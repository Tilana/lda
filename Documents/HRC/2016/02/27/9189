<p><b>I.  Resolutions adopted by the Council at its eighth session 
</b></p>
<p><b>8/1. Conference facilities and financial support  
for the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolutions 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and Council 
resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Council decision 3/104 of 8 December 2006 on conference facilities and 
financial support for the Council and the report of the Secretary-General on its implementation 
(A/62/125), 
</p>
<p> 1.  <i>Reaffirms</i> the need to ensure the provision of necessary financial resources to the 
Council and its working groups in order to discharge its mandate fully, as stipulated in 
General Assembly resolution 60/251 and implemented by Council resolution 5/1;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its concern</i> at the delays in the submission of documents to the Council, 
including those relating to the universal periodic review, and in particular the delays in the 
translation of documents into the six official languages of the United Nations, and in this context 
requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
Conference Services Division at the United Nations Office at Geneva to make an assessment of 
the situation and to report back to the Council at its ninth session with proposals for adequate 
measures, bearing in mind the necessity of maintaining financial efficiency, to address these 
problems;  
</p>
<p> 3.  <i>Reaffirms</i> that the Council will consider favourably the adoption of a decision on the

principles of transparency, equal treatment and non-selectivity and, in this context, requests the 
Department of Public Information of the United Nations Office at Geneva to make an assessment 
of the situation and to report back to the Council at its ninth session with proposals for adequate 
measures, including the necessary resources to establish a permanent capacity for webcasting. 
</p>
<p><i>28th meeting

</i></p>
<p> Adopted without a vote. 
</p>
<p><b>8/2. Optional Protocol to the International Covenant  
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 
by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/24), the World Conference 
encouraged the Commission on Human Rights to continue the examination of optional protocols 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the 2005 World 
Summit Outcome and General Assembly resolution 60/251 establishing the Human Rights 
Council all affirm that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and 
mutually reinforcing and must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and 
with the same emphasis,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> previous resolutions of the Council and the Commission on Human Rights 
on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, and in particular Council resolution 1/3 
on the Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the report of the Working Group (A/HRC/8/7) and the decision to transmit the 
draft optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to 
the Council for its consideration,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Adopts</i> the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights annexed to the present resolution;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recommends</i> that the General Assembly, in accordance with paragraph 5 (<i>c</i>) of its 
resolution 60/251, adopt the following draft resolution: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>The General Assembly</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the adoption by the Human Rights Council, through its resolution ..., of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Adopts</i> and opens for signature, ratification and accession the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the text of which is annexed to the present 
resolution; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recommends</i> that the Optional Protocol be opened for signature at a signing ceremony in 
Geneva in March 2009 and requests the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to provide the necessary assistance.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Annex  
</b></p>
<p><b>OPTIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT  
ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Preamble 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The States Parties to the present Protocol</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, 
recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family 
is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free 
and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, 
without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human 
Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be 
achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy civil, cultural, economic, political and social 
rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that each State Party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(hereinafter referred to as the Covenant) undertakes to take steps, individually and through international 
assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, 
with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by all 
appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that, in order further to achieve the purposes of the Covenant and the implementation of 
its provisions, it would be appropriate to enable the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(hereinafter referred to as the Committee) to carry out the functions provided for in the present Protocol, 
</p>
<p> <i>Have agreed</i> as follows: 
</p>
<p><b>Article 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>Competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. A State Party to the Covenant that becomes a Party to the present Protocol recognizes the competence 
of the Committee to receive and consider communications as provided for by the provisions of the present 
Protocol. 
</p>
<p>2. No communication shall be received by the Committee if it concerns a State Party to the Covenant 
which is not a Party to the present Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 2 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications 
</b></p>
<p> Communications may be submitted by or on behalf of individuals or groups of individuals, under the 
jurisdiction of a State Party, claiming to be victims of a violation of any of the economic, social and cultural 
rights set forth in the Covenant by that State Party. Where a communication is submitted on behalf of 
individuals or groups of individuals, this shall be with their consent unless the author can justify acting on 
their behalf without such consent.  
</p>
<p><b>Article 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>Admissibility 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall not consider a communication unless it has ascertained that all available 
domestic remedies have been exhausted. This shall not be the rule where the application of such remedies is 
unreasonably prolonged.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall declare a communication inadmissible when: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) It is not submitted within one year after the exhaustion of domestic remedies, except in cases 
where the author can demonstrate that it had not been possible to submit the communication within that time 
limit; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The facts that are the subject of the communication occurred prior to the entry into force of the 
present Protocol for the State Party concerned unless those facts continued after that date; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or is being 
examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) It is incompatible with the provisions of the Covenant; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) It is manifestly ill-founded, not sufficiently substantiated or exclusively based on reports 
disseminated by mass media; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) It is an abuse of the right to submit a communication; or when 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) It is anonymous or not in writing. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 4 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications not revealing a clear disadvantage 
</b></p>
<p> The Committee may, if necessary, decline to consider a communication where it does not reveal that 
the author has suffered a clear disadvantage, unless the Committee considers that the communication raises a 
serious issue of general importance. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 5 
</b></p>
<p><b>Interim measures 
</b></p>
<p>1. At any time after the receipt of a communication and before a determination on the merits has been 
reached, the Committee may transmit to the State Party concerned for its urgent consideration a request that 
the State Party take such interim measures as may be necessary in exceptional circumstances to avoid 
possible irreparable damage to the victim or victims of the alleged violations. 
</p>
<p>2. Where the Committee exercises its discretion under paragraph 1 of the present article, this does not 
imply a determination on admissibility or on the merits of the communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>Transmission of the communication 
</b></p>
<p>1. Unless the Committee considers a communication inadmissible without reference to the State Party 
concerned, the Committee shall bring any communication submitted to it under the present Protocol 
confidentially to the attention of the State Party concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. Within six months, the receiving State Party shall submit to the Committee written explanations or 
statements clarifying the matter and the remedy, if any, that may have been provided by that State Party. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Article 7 
</b></p>
<p><b>Friendly settlement 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall make available its good offices to the parties concerned with a view to reaching 
a friendly settlement of the matter on the basis of the respect for the obligations set forth in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>2. An agreement on a friendly settlement closes consideration of the communication under the present 
Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 8 
</b></p>
<p><b>Examination of communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall examine communications received under article 2 of the present Protocol in the 
light of all documentation submitted to it, provided that this documentation is transmitted to the parties 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall hold closed meetings when examining communications under the present 
Protocol. 
</p>
<p>3. When examining a communication under the present Protocol, the Committee may consult, as 
appropriate, relevant documentation emanating from other United Nations bodies, specialized agencies, 
funds, programmes and mechanisms, and other international organizations, including from regional human 
rights systems, and any observations or comments by the State Party concerned. 
</p>
<p>4. When examining communications under the present Protocol, the Committee shall consider the 
reasonableness of the steps taken by the State Party in accordance with Part II of the Covenant. In doing so, 
the Committee shall bear in mind that the State Party may adopt a range of possible policy measures for the 
implementation of the rights set forth in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>Article 9 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to the views of the Committee 
</b></p>
<p>1. After examining a communication, the Committee shall transmit its views on the communication, 
together with its recommendations, if any, to the parties concerned. 
</p>
<p>2. The State Party shall give due consideration to the views of the Committee, together with its 
recommendations, if any, and shall submit to the Committee, within six months, a written response, including 
information on any action taken in the light of the views and recommendations of the Committee. 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to

decision 2004/110 of 19 April 2004 of the Commission on Human Rights establishing the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council and 5/2 
on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Council of 18 June 2007, and 
stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with those

</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political

</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and declarations,

</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the

Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the resolve of the Heads of State and Government expressed in the 
United Nations Millennium Declaration to intensify efforts to fight transnational organized crime 
in all its dimensions, including trafficking in human beings, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the Vienna Forum against Trafficking in Persons in the framework of the 
United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking, held from 13 to 15 February 2008, 
and of the thematic debate on the issue of trafficking in persons in the framework of the 
General Assembly on 3 June 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often 
subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their 
gender, age, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as their origins, and that these forms of 
discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> that trafficking in persons violates human rights and impairs the 
enjoyment of human rights, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a 
concerted international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among 
countries of origin, transit and destination in order to be eradicated, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The high number of persons, especially women and children, in particular from 
developing countries and countries with economies in transition, who are being trafficked to 
developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime and others that 
profit from trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard for dangerous 
and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for the purposes of 
exploitation of the prostitution of others and for child pornography, paedophilia and any other 
form of sexual exploitation of children, as well as for trafficking in women as brides and for sex 
tourism; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The high level of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and their accomplices and the 
denial of rights and justice to victims of trafficking; 
 2. <i>Urges </i>Governments: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To take appropriate measures to address the root factors, including external factors, 
that encourage trafficking in persons for prostitution and other forms of commercialized sex, 
forced marriages and forced labour, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the 
removal of organs, including by strengthening existing legislation or by considering the 
enactment of anti-trafficking legislation and the adoption of national plans of action with a view 
to providing better protection for victims of trafficking and to punishing perpetrators through 
criminal and civil measures; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms and to condemn and penalize 
traffickers, facilitators and intermediaries, including, where applicable, by imposing sanctions 
against legal entities involved in the process of trafficking, without making accusations by, or the 
participation of, the victims of trafficking a precondition for the prosecution of trafficking; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure protection and assistance to the victims of trafficking with full respect for 
their human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To actively promote the rehabilitation of victims of trafficking by providing them 
with access to adequate physical and psychological care and services, including those related to 
HIV/AIDS, as well as shelter, legal assistance and help lines; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To take all appropriate measures to ensure that victims of trafficking are not 
penalized for being trafficked and that they do not suffer from revictimization as a result of 
actions taken by Government authorities, bearing in mind that they are victims of exploitation; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures to discourage the demand that 
fosters all forms of exploitation of persons and leads to trafficking in persons; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To establish mechanisms, where appropriate, in cooperation with the international 
community, to combat the use of the Internet to facilitate trafficking in persons and crimes 
related to sexual or other forms of exploitation and to strengthen international cooperation to 
investigate and prosecute trafficking facilitated by the use of the Internet; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To provide or strengthen training for law enforcement, immigration, criminal justice 
and other relevant officials, including personnel participating in peacekeeping operations, in 
preventing and responding effectively to trafficking in persons, including the identification of 
victims with full respect for their human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To conduct information campaigns for the general public, including children, aimed 
at promoting awareness of the dangers associated with all forms of trafficking and encouraging 
the public, including the victims of trafficking themselves, to report on instances of trafficking; 
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) To cooperate with each other and with relevant intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations to ensure the effective countering of trafficking in persons; 
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>) To enhance information-sharing and data-collection capacities as a way of promoting 
cooperation to combat trafficking in persons, including through the systematic collection of sex- 
and age-disaggregated data; 
</p>
<p> (<i>l</i>) To consider strengthening existing regional mechanisms aimed at combating 
trafficking in persons or to establish such mechanisms where they do not exist; 
</p>
<p> (<i>m</i>) To consider signing and ratifying and States parties to implement relevant 
United Nations legal instruments, such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Takes note </i>of the work undertaken by the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Decides </i>to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, for a period of three years, in order to, inter alia: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Promote the prevention of trafficking in persons in all its forms and the adoption of 
measures to uphold and protect the human rights of victims; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Promote the effective application of relevant international norms and standards and 
to contribute to the further improvement of them; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Integrate a gender and age perspective throughout the work of his or her mandate,

<p><b>8/13. Elimination of discrimination against persons affected by  
leprosy and their family members 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including Article 1 
that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and that they are endowed 
with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood, </p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, including article 12,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the work of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to enjoy the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to enjoy the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health (A/58/427), in which he reported that persons 
affected by leprosy and their family members often suffer stigma and discrimination born of 
ignorance and prejudice,  
<i> Recognizing </i>that more than 16 million people affected by leprosy have been cured 
worldwide since the 1980s and that leprosy as a disease has been scientifically and medically 
proven to be curable and manageable,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that tens of millions of people and their family members still suffer from 
leprosy not only as a disease but also from political, legal, economic or social discrimination and 
ostracization due to society&#8217;s lack of knowledge and misguided notions, such as leprosy being 
incurable or hereditary, and that the issue of leprosy is not only a matter of medicine or health 
but also one of discrimination that can give rise to a clear violation of human rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note of </i>the previous work done by the Commission on Human Rights and its 
mechanism on discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members,  
</p>
<p><i> Encouraging </i>States to share best practices on combating discrimination against persons 
affected by leprosy and their family members and also on their efforts to achieve full recovery 
from and manage this disease, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Affirms</i> that persons affected by leprosy and their family members should be treated 
as individuals with dignity and are entitled to all basic human rights and fundamental freedoms 
under customary international law, relevant conventions and national constitutions and laws; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> Governments to take effective measures to eliminate any type of 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, including 
awareness-raising; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
include the issue of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members 
as an important matter in its human rights education and awareness-raising activities;  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to collect information on the measures that Governments have taken to eliminate 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, and, if 
extrabudgetary funding is available, to hold a meeting to exchange views among relevant actors, 
including Governments, observers of the United Nations, relevant United Nations bodies, 
specialized agencies and programmes, non-governmental organizations, scientists, medical 
experts as well as representatives of persons affected by leprosy and their family members, and 
to transmit a report to the Council and the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to examine the report 
referred to in paragraph 4 above, and formulate a draft set of principles and guidelines for the 
elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, and 
to submit it to the Council for its consideration by September 2009; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Decides</i> to consider this issue based on these reports submitted to the Council in 
September 2009.

</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>,  
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights, and reaffirming 
Council resolutions S-5/1 of 2 October 2007, 6/33 of 14 December 2007 and 7/31 of 
28 March 2008,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar 
(A/HRC/8/12) while calling on the Myanmar authorities to extend full cooperation to the Special 
Rapporteur, including by inviting him to visit Myanmar as soon as possible,  
</p>
<p><i> Being deeply concerned </i>that the urgent calls contained in the above-mentioned resolutions, 
as well as of other United Nations bodies concerning the human rights situation in Myanmar 
have not been met and further emphasizing that, without significant progress towards meeting 
these calls of the international community, the human rights situation in Myanmar will continue 
to deteriorate,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing </i>its condolences to those who suffered loss as a result of Cyclone Nargis, and 
welcoming the efforts of international, regional and national organizations to bring relief to the 
survivors of this natural disaster and noting the commitment made by the authorities of 
Myanmar, on 25 May, to grant unfettered access to relief workers to the affected areas,  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing also </i>its deep concern that the country&#8217;s political processes are not transparent, 
inclusive, free and fair, and at the decision of the Government of Myanmar to proceed with the 
constitutional referendum in an atmosphere of intimidation and in disregard with international 
standards of free and fair elections at a time of dire humanitarian need,  
</p>
<p><i> Being concerned </i>about reported widespread violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law in the Kayin State and Bago Division,  
</p>
<p><i> Being most concerned </i>by the decision, once again, to extend the house arrest of the 
General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, on 
27 May 2008, and by reports that there are as many as 1,900 other political prisoners, many held 
without charge and in unknown locations,  
</p>
<p><i> Being concerned </i>that no effort has been made to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators 
of the violent crackdown on peaceful mass demonstrations of September 2007 and of the ensuing 
human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture and 
ill-treatment,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns </i>the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of the people of Myanmar;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly urges </i>the Government of Myanmar to desist from further politically 
motivated arrests and to release all political prisoners without delay and without conditions;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon </i>the Government to fully implement the commitments it has made to the 
Secretary-General on granting immediate, full and unhindered access by relief workers to all 
persons in need throughout the country, to cooperate fully with all humanitarian organizations, in 
particular in the Irrawaddy Delta, to refrain from sending people back to areas where they cannot 
have access to emergency relief and to ensure that return is voluntary and occurs in safety and 
with dignity;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Strongly urges </i>the Government of Myanmar to end all forms of discrimination and 
protect civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, on the basis of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and, in particular, to comply with its human rights obligations 
under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child in this regard;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Condemns </i>the recruitment of child soldiers into both the Government armed forces, 
contrary to its international obligations, and non-State armed groups, and calls for an absolute 
and immediate stop to this appalling activity; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls for </i>a full, transparent, effective, impartial and independent investigation into all 
reports of human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, 
torture, ill-treatment, forced labour and forced displacement, and for bringing those responsible 
to justice in order to end impunity for violations of human rights;  
 7. <i>Strongly calls on</i> the Government of Myanmar to engage in a real process of 
dialogue and national reconciliation with the full and genuine participation of representatives of 
all political parties and ethnic groups who have been excluded from the political process;  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Expresses </i>its strong support for the good offices mission and commitment of the 
Secretary-General, and encourages the Government of Myanmar to take early steps to admit his 
Special Representative on Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari, to facilitate a genuine and inclusive 
political process, and calls on the Government of Myanmar to ensure full cooperation with the 
Secretary-General, his representative and the Special Rapporteur;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Strongly urges </i>the Government of Myanmar to receive, as soon as possible, the

</p>
<p><b>I. Modalities of work for troika members before the session of 
the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p>1. States that wish to raise questions and/or issues with the State under review may do so via 
the troika, which shall relay them to the Secretariat. These questions and/or issues should 
conform to the basis of the review, as identified by the Human Rights Council in paragraph 1 of 
the annex to its resolution 5/1 on institution-building of the Council, and shall be raised in a 
manner that is consistent with the principles and objectives of the universal periodic review, as 
stated in resolution 5/1, and be based mainly on the three universal periodic review documents.  
</p>
<p>2. The Secretariat shall then transmit all questions and/or issues to the State under review no 
later than 10 working days before the date of the review in the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review. 
</p>
<p>3. The troika members shall cluster the questions and/or issues in accordance with the content 
and the structure of the report prepared by the State under review. 
</p>
<p>4. As the universal periodic review is, inter alia, a transparent process, the questions and/or 
issues will be circulated among Member and Observer States after being relayed to the State 
under review. 
</p>
<p>5. The State under review is sovereign in addressing the questions and/or issues it chooses to 
answer of those transmitted to it by the troika members or raised during the proceedings of the 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  Modalities for the Review in the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>6. The interactive dialogue of the universal periodic review exercise takes place solely in the 
Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review. 
</p>
<p>7. The State under review will be given up to 60 minutes in the Working Group, to be used 
for:  
</p>
<p> (a) Initial presentation of the national report/responses to written questions; 
</p>
<p> (b) Replies to the questions raised from the floor during the interactive dialogue, if 
desired;  
</p>

guidance of the President.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  Report of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Working Group shall prepare a factual report of its proceedings, consisting of a 
summary of the interactive dialogue, which will reflect recommendations and/or conclusions 
made by delegations during the interactive dialogue.  
</p>
<p>9. The report of the Working Group shall be prepared by the troika by fully involving the 
State under review and with the assistance of the Secretariat.  
</p>
<p>10. The State under review is expected to examine all recommendations made, in accordance 
with the provisions of the annex to Council resolution 5/1. In all cases, the recommendations that 
enjoy the support of the State under review are to be identified as such. Other recommendations, 
together with the comments of the State under review, are to be noted. Both will be included in 
the report of the Working Group, to be adopted by the Council at its plenary session. The State 
under review is expected to follow up on the recommendations that enjoy its support as well as 
on voluntary commitments and pledges.  
</p>
<p>11. The State under review will inform the Council about its views concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions as well as voluntary commitments/pledges whenever it is 
in a position to do so, during the meeting of the Working Group, or between the session of the 
Working Group and the next session of the Council, or during the meeting of the Council at its 
plenary session.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  Modalities at the plenary session 
</b></p>
<p>12. The review process starts at Working Group level and ends with the adoption of the 
outcome of the review by the Council at its plenary session.  
</p>
<p>13. The report of the Working Group, together with the views of the State under review 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as voluntary commitments made by 
the State under review and replies presented by the State under review before the adoption of the 
outcome by the Council at its plenary session to questions or issues that were not sufficiently 
addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group, will constitute the outcome of 
the review, which shall be adopted by the Council at its plenary session through a standardized 
decision.  
</p>
<p>14. A summary of the views expressed on the outcome of the review by the State under review 
and of Member and Observer States of the Council, as well as general comments made by other 
relevant stakeholders before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary, will be included in the 
report of the Council session.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  General modalities 
</b></p>
<p>15. Only the three documents mentioned in paragraph 15 of the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1 as constituting the basis of the review will be posted on the Extranet.  
</p>
<p>16. The Council will consider favourably the adoption of a decision on the webcasting of all

President&#8217;s statement on modalities and practices for the universal periodic review process 
(A/HRC/PRST/8/1), the Council considered the outcome of the reviews conducted during the 
first and second sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review. The first

</p>
<p><b>Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p>189. The review of Bahrain was held on 7 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Bahrain in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1,

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/BHR/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/BHR/3). 
</p>
<p>190. At its 13th meeting, on 9 June 2008, the Human Rights Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Bahrain (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>191. The outcome of the review on Bahrain is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/19 and Corr.1), together with the views of Bahrain 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>192. Bahrain thanked the members of the Human Rights Council for their support resulting in 
the successful re-election of Bahrain to the Council, noting the responsibility that comes with it. 
Bahrain noted the adoption on 26 May 2008, in the presence of a representative from OHCHR, 
of its Action Plan to Implement Bahrain&#8217;s Pledges, Voluntary Commitments and UPR Outcomes 
(the Action Plan). Bahrain commended OHCHR on the compilation and summary reports 
prepared, and thanked the troika and the UPR Working Group for their contribution. It informed 
the meeting that it tasked a team of its delegation to observe and draw lessons from the 15 other </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>States reviewed under the designated alongside Bahrain, recognizing and promoting recognition 
that universal periodic review is a process with several stages and with successive four-year time 
frames. It noted its appreciation of the burden and the privilege of being the first State at every 
stage of the review process. 
</p>
<p>193. During its three-year term on the Council, Bahrain recommitted itself to striving to 
strengthen its effectiveness as a mechanism for international dialogue and cooperation on human 
rights. It also recommitted itself to striving to establish the universal periodic review as a unique 
vehicle for international cooperation on measures to improve the human rights situation on the 
ground through implementation of the review outcomes. Bahrain also committed to publicizing 
and promoting dissemination of the report of the Working Group on Bahrain adopted by the 
Council; to studying the report carefully and harmonize the Action Plan with the report; to 
encourage national stakeholders, civil society and media to study the report carefully and to 
promote awareness and advocacy in support of the Council report.  
</p>
<p>194. Bahrain highlighted some aspects of the Action Plan, and stated that it is also available on 
the website of its Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Bahrain stated that the Action Plan is the product 
of a transparent and participatory national process which sought to involve all national 
stakeholders. It stated that the Action Plan addresses actions to fulfil or implement: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The pledges that Bahrain made in seeking election to the Council in 2006 and in seeking 
re-election in 2008 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The voluntary commitments contained in the Bahrain national report submitted to the 
Council 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Responses to the suggestions and issues raised in the interactive dialogue during the 
review of Bahrain and in the draft report from the UPR Working Group, in light of the 
outcome adopted in plenary 
</p>
<p>195. Bahrain stated that the specific areas for action set out in the Action Plan fall into four 
broad categories: 
</p>
<p>(1) Actions related to strengthening Bahrain&#8217;s national system for protecting and 
promoting human rights regarding both specific national human rights institutions 
such as human rights commissions, as well as institutions of government such as the 
legislature, the executive and the judiciary that are vital to protecting and promoting 
human rights; 
</p>
<p>(2) Actions to enhance the protection of vulnerable and &#8220;at risk&#8221; groups in Bahrain 
such as, for example, foreign workers, women, children and human rights defenders; 
</p>
<p>(3) Actions to advance the progressive realization of specific human rights in 
Bahrain such as freedom of speech, expression, assembly and association, and 
equality and non-discrimination; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(4) Actions to strengthen Bahrain&#8217;s international cooperation with the 
United Nations, and regional and bilateral intergovernmental arrangements for the 
protection and promotion of human rights, starting with the Council and the universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p>196. Bahrain stated that every aspect of the Action Plan, from design and implementation to 
monitoring, evaluating and reporting, will be guided by the values and principles of participation 
and inclusion of all relevant national stakeholders, governmental and non-governmental, 
including the judiciary, members of parliament, non-governmental organizations and political 
societies and the private sector, as appropriate; transparency; accountability; cooperation 
between the Government and the people of Bahrain, as well as between Bahrain and the Council; 
and commitment to results. 
</p>
<p>197. Finally, Bahrain added the two following steps in its Action Plan: (1) to immediately 
proceed with a strategic programme to strengthen human rights capacities, both governmental 
and non-governmental; and (2) before the third session of the Working Group in 
December 2008, Bahrain plans to organize a regional comparative meeting on &#8220;Strengthening 
participatory UPR processes: learning from the reviews undertaken thus far&#8221;. The study of the 
Bahrain team as one of the first 16 State reviews will be an input to this meeting. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>198. Algeria noted Bahrain&#8217;s strong political will through which it committed itself to 
reinforcing all institutions contributing to the promotion and protection of human rights. It 
further noted Bahrain&#8217;s commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Working 
Group and the development of a national action plan with the help of civil society institutions. 
Algeria welcomed actions already undertaken, especially on streamlining a gender perspective in 
its work and on freedom of the press, as well as training courses organized in collaboration with 
the United Nations for law enforcement, police officers and officials of other relevant 
government agencies. 
</p>
<p>199. Slovenia congratulated Bahrain for having approached its review in a serious manner and 
noted with appreciation that Bahrain accepted all of Slovenia&#8217;s recommendations. Slovenia will 
be looking forward to hearing more on the follow-up to those and other recommendations. It 
invited Bahrain to consider informing the Council on a voluntary basis and as appropriate of any 
relevant progress and/or challenges encountered even before its next review in four years, which 
would set a good example of keeping the Council up to date with regard to its recommendations. 
Slovenia regretted that the issue of women migrant workers is not reflected in the section on the 
conclusions and recommendations in the Working Group report. 
</p>
<p>200. Tunisia noted that Bahrain has its place in the system of human rights of the 
United Nations and noted achievements made in this regard. It welcomed the participatory and 
inclusive manner in which the universal periodic review was undertaken and the website created 
by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the review. Tunisia noted the political determination to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>promote human rights on the basis of transparency and responsibility and the interest in the 
recommendations of the Working Group. Welcoming amendments to the law on the press and 
reaffirming the right to freedom of expression, Tunisia encouraged Bahrain to strengthen its 
efforts in this regard. 
</p>
<p>201. Qatar, on behalf of the Group of Arab States, welcomed efforts made to lay the foundation 
for the rule of law and to guarantee human rights. The report presented has shown efforts made 
by Bahrain with respect for its Arabic and Islamic identity. Qatar noted that the measures that 
have been taken in consultation with civil society further reflect the country&#8217;s commitment. It 
also noted efforts made to strengthen the rights of women and children and the right of freedom 
of expression and the press, steps taken by the Council of Ministers, the adoption of a national 
plan of action and a workshop organized with the United Nations Development Programme to 
sensitize on the need to implement undertakings in terms of human rights. 
</p>
<p>202. Indonesia was encouraged to note the efforts which are being made as a follow-up to the 
universal periodic review session in April to ensure a full and positive integration and 
implementation of human rights norms in the country. Indonesia commended Bahrain on its 
human rights commitment and its achievement thereof, which is part of an ongoing process, and 
encouraged Bahrain in its efforts to continue to apply a human rights based approach to its 
policies. Indonesia commended the Bahraini Government on its immediate response to some 
recommendations made by the Working Group, such as an amendment to the law regulating 
press and publishing in relation to recommendations on gender and freedom of journalists. 
Indonesia hoped that the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the newly launched National Action Plan to implement the voluntary pledges to the 
Human Rights Council will further enable Bahrain to achieve the targets set in terms of 
effectively meeting its national human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>203. Pakistan acknowledged the positive steps highlighted by the delegation of Bahrain, the 
most important being the launching of the National Action Plan, the guiding norms of which 
include full involvement of all stakeholders, transparency, accountability, cooperation and a 
result-oriented commitment. Pakistan also welcomed the gender specific steps taken by Bahrain, 
its increased cooperation with United Nations agencies on technical cooperation, and its decision 
to amend the laws relating to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>204. Jordan commended Bahrain on its positive and constructive approach and commitment and 
noted that a department on human rights had already been established before the universal 
periodic review. It noted legislation that applies to Bahraini and non-Bahraini citizens to 
guarantee rights, including those of women, equality of men and women, and the participation of 
women in the process of development. Jordan also welcomed the changes reflected in the 
adoption of a national charter and constitutional amendments to it and noted the active 
participation of women. It expressed the hope that Bahrain will continue on this path and 
reaffirm its attachment to recommendations made in this regard.  
</p>
<p>205. According to the Syrian Arab Republic, Bahrain&#8217;s election to the Council reflected its 
relevance with regard to protecting and promoting human rights and its credibility at the 
international level. It noted that Bahrain has accepted recommendations in the context of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>interactive dialogue and set the bar high with regard to cooperating with the universal periodic 
review mechanism. The Syrian Arab Republic urged other countries to multiply their efforts to 
attain the same level and noted that Bahrain has provided a model to be followed by other 
countries.  
</p>
<p>206. Saudi Arabia appreciated the effectiveness and speedy reaction by Bahrain to the 
recommendations of the Working Group. It was of the view that the efforts made to present the 
report and clarify achievements in the field of human rights are examples to be followed. It also 
noted the speed and effectiveness in achieving progress in implementing recommendations and 
welcomed the launching of a national action plan which is distinguished by its transparency. 
Saudi Arabia commended Bahrain on all actions taken for the promotion of human rights in all 
sectors. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>207. The Bahrain Women&#8217;s Association stated that Bahraini women who marry non-Bahraini 
citizens are denied the right to extend their citizenship to their children, who therefore have 
limited access to high education, health care, land ownership, political participation and 
employment. This inequality not only denies women their basic rights as citizens, it also denies 
children their right as human beings. It stated that although Bahrain mentioned in its report that 
&#8220;a draft law on citizenship is being debated&#8221;, this draft remains the same since it does not permit 
Bahraini mothers to transmit their nationality to their children. Lately, even this draft was 
withdrawn from the parliament. The numbers of children from Bahraini mothers who do not 
have a nationality are increasing. Another violation of women&#8217;s rights is the absence of family 
law. The lack of this law is considered to be one of the main obstacles and struggles for women 
in Bahrain. Bahrain Women&#8217;s Association was of the view that the Government could have done 
more to push towards the family law by cooperating with some of the religious figures who 
support this law and also coordinate with non-governmental organizations, especially women 
organizations. The Bahrain Women&#8217;s Association urged the Government of Bahrain to take 
serious and immediate action to amend the nationality law, approve the family law and remove 
all reservations on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. 
</p>
<p>208. Front Line noted that the Government had not responded positively to a recommendation 
in 2005 by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to maintain dialogue with 
all civil society organizations, including those critical of its policies. Secondly, during the last 
four years, human rights groups and defenders were harassed, defamed, denied access to the 
media and legally prosecuted. Many of them were victims of the use of excessive force. 
Frontline recommended that Bahrain invite the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders to visit Bahrain as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed by the State under review on the  
outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>209. Following the views expressed on the outcome of the review by States members and 
observers of the Council, as well as general comments made by other relevant stakeholders, 
Bahrain stated that it has included all relevant remarks on human rights from non-governmental 
organizations and other States, and added that the process was fully transparent, with the full </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>participation of all societies in Bahrain, including through the hotline, the web page set up for 
this purpose, meetings and through the press. All comments, direct and indirect, were taken into 
account in the Action Plan. The draft action plan was also presented in the presence of 
ambassadors and other delegates. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that upon returning to 
Bahrain after the review of Bahrain during the Working Group, he had engaged in several 
debates on the outcome of the universal periodic review, through direct televised debates with 
the chairman of the Bahrain Human Rights Society. He indicated that all participants commented 
on the transparency of the process, following which the action plan was compiled, and a 
representative from OHCHR was invited to attend the launching of the action plan, along with 
non-governmental organizations. Bahrain added that it asked non-governmental organizations 
and human rights societies to participate in the implementation of the action plan. In response to 
Slovenia&#8217;s question, Bahrain answered that paragraph 9 on page 6 of the Action Plan addresses 
enhanced protection for the rights of domestic workers, especially women.  
</p>
<p>210. The Minister stated that on the same day as the present discussion, Bahrain was launching 
a national conference on understanding the concept of &#8220;gender&#8221;, under the patronage of 
H.M. King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, King of Bahrain, reflecting the importance attached by the 
Government to this issue. The Minister added that it had made an important amendment on 
4 May 2008 to its press law by abolishing the punishment of imprisonment of journalists and 
abolishing censorship on publications. Bahrain then drew attention to the invitation extended to 
and the presence of a representative of OHCHR to observe at the first workshop, held on 
29 May 2008 conducted by the UPR working team of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on 
applying a human rights based approach. Bahrain informed the Council that this workshop is the 
first step the UPR working team has taken in its plan to conduct further workshops with the 
assistance of the UNDP in Bahrain and experts from OHCHR. Bahrain further underlined the 
establishment of a national committee to combat human trafficking, which embodies members 
from the governmental sector, human rights societies and relevant non-governmental 
organizations, such as the migrant workers&#8217; protection society. 
</p>
<p>211. Finally, Bahrain stated that it is working on implementing a &#8220;project document&#8221; with the 
assistance of UNDP and in consultations with members of civil society. A representative of 
OHCHR observed the discussions between the Government and civil society regarding the 
drafting of this project. This project proposal seeks to address the need for supporting Bahrain&#8217;s 
Action Plan and provides a vehicle for its further development, based on needs and experiences 
implementation emerging over the present four-year universal periodic review cycle. The project 
proposal seeks to address: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need to strengthen Bahrain&#8217;s human rights database and information systems 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need for more effective implementation of Bahrain&#8217;s obligations under international 
human rights treaties 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need to strengthen Bahrain&#8217;s institutions for the protection and promotion of human 
rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need to strengthen Bahrain&#8217;s institutions dealing with ratification of international 
human rights instruments and with the incorporation into national legislation of human 
rights treaties that Bahrain has ratified </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need to strengthen Bahrain&#8217;s human rights capacities, both governmental and 
non-governmental, especially capacities for monitoring and evaluation 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Specifically, the need to strengthen Bahrain&#8217;s capacities to apply a human rights-based 
approach to development 
</p>
<p>212. Bahrain reiterated that it takes human rights very seriously, and the need to empower its 
strongest resource which is its human resource, women and men alike, Bahrainis and 
non-Bahrainis alike. It stated that it needs the support of all, including country partners, the 
United Nations and OHCHR in the process of protecting human rights. While the situation in 
Bahrain is not perfect, the Minister stated that it sees universal periodic review as an opportunity 
to develop the human rights condition in Bahrain.  
</p>
<p>213. In her intervention, the Deputy of the Higher Council for Women of Bahrain replied to the 
comment made by the Bahraini Women&#8217;s Association. She affirmed that the Government is in 
permanent cooperation in this area with respect to the issue of citizenship, and hopes that the law 
will be adopted to enshrine and guarantee citizenship for that category. She stated that there is no 
objection to the issue of citizenship but that there are social constraints, and informed the 
Council of ongoing campaigns to sensitize society on the adoption of such a law, and to lift these 
reservations.  
</p>
<p>214. Bahrain stated that it has accepted all the recommendations and has incorporated them in 
the Action Plan which will be implemented, a process which started on 26 May 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Ecuador 
</b></p>
<p>215. The review of Ecuador was held on 7 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Ecuador in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/ECU/1); the compilation prepared by the OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/ECU/2); and the summary prepared by the 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/ECU/3). 
</p>
<p>216. At its 13th meeting, on 9 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Ecuador (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>217. The outcome of the review on Ecuador is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/20 and Corr.1), together with the views of Ecuador 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>218. At the 1st meeting, on 9 June 2008, during the adoption of the final outcome of the review 
of Ecuador, the Under-Secretary of Multilateral Relations, Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
Mr. Emilio Izquierdo, welcomed the opportunity of addressing the Council on the occasion of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the adoption of the final outcome of the universal periodic review on Ecuador. Ecuador had both 
the challenge and privilege of being the second country to participate in the universal periodic 
review, and thus it had been able to contribute in a two-fold manner to the consolidation of the 
review process, in the creation of the mechanism and then through active participation in the 
review. Ecuador indicated that the Government has undertaken the political commitment to 
participate with conviction in the various phases of the review in a responsible manner: from the 
elaboration of the national report through broad consultations at the national level, including not 
only State institutions but also many civil society organizations, and participation in the 
interactive dialogue in the context of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review of 
the Council, which took place on 7 April 2008. 
</p>
<p>219. The importance that Ecuador attaches to this exercise is reflected in the active and 
representative participation in the preparations and the interactive dialogue of very high level 
government officials from various relevant State institutions involved in the implementation of 
public policies in key areas of human rights, such as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Commerce 
and Integration, Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, the Secretariat of People, Social 
Movements and Citizen Participation, the Ministry of Coordination and Social Development, the 
Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion, the Migrant National Secretariat and other 
institutions which undertook efforts to be present at the interactive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>220. Ecuador values the extensive participation of delegations during the interactive dialogue. 
Ecuador received with satisfaction the acknowledgement by several delegations of Ecuador&#8217;s 
efforts in the promotion of human rights, including in the areas of institutional strengthening, 
implementation of public policies, dissemination of recommendations of the United Nations 
special procedures mechanisms, active participation in many international forums and others. 
Ecuador also indicated that it had taken note with profound interest the requests for further 
information on specific situations.  
</p>
<p>221. Ecuador indicated that it wished to state for the record that it had acted in a very 
responsible manner, profoundly committed to the need to make progress in the area of human 
rights, and thus it had welcomed all recommendations put forward by delegations, and thus these 
recommendations enjoy the support of Ecuador. It further indicated that Ecuador will continue to 
follow up on these recommendations and that it will make all efforts to implement them in 
practice. 
</p>
<p>222. Since the interactive dialogue took place on 7 April 2008, and under the coordination of 
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Commerce and Integration, a number of State institutions, in 
consultation with civil society, had been working together to develop the voluntary commitments 
presented by Ecuador in this occasion. These are commitments which involve an enormous 
effort and firmness on the part of the Ecuadorean State. Ecuador will promote and disseminate 
human rights internally, harmonize their domestic legislation vis-&#224;-vis international law, and 
many other areas. Some highlighted areas included:

</p>
<p>223. Ecuador believes that with the adoption of the final outcome, a new phase has been 
reached, in which there is a need to follow up on the recommendations and for international 
support for a country that like Ecuador, which is committed to make progress in the promotion of 
human rights. It is also important to weigh all difficulties and experiences that arise from the 
universal periodic review as a new mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>224. Pakistan noted the constructive and valuable role played by Ecuador in the Council and 
throughout the universal periodic review process. Pakistan noted its comprehensive report, 
forthcoming attitude in accepting the recommendations made during the review, and detailed list 
of voluntary pledges and commitments. It also noted that Ecuador&#8217;s constructive approach to 
dealing with human rights mechanisms, as well as with civil society, would enable it to ensure 
promotion and protection of human rights in the best possible manner. 
</p>
<p>225. Italy noted Ecuador&#8217;s seriousness and spirit of commitment demonstrated throughout the 
process, the challenge of being the second country to be reviewed and the challenges faced by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the troika members having to work without a set precedent. While underlining that the 
10 recommendations in the Working Group report enjoyed Ecuador&#8217;s support, Italy also noted 
Ecuador&#8217;s commitment by presenting, before the adoption of the final report, voluntary pledges 
and its willingness to provide concrete follow-up. The spirit of cooperation and consensus 
among all involved parties and the result of having the final acceptance of all recommendations 
were remarkable. Italy highlighted the value of all recommendations, whether they are accepted 
or not, and their usefulness for an open and transparent process, even when they represent 
different positions. Moreover, countries had the opportunity to address specific issues which had 
not been included in the section containing the conclusions and recommendations of the 
Working Group report, during the adoption of the report. All countries enjoyed the freedom to 
decide which recommendations to accept, including those that could be problematic for others. 
The review of Ecuador will provide the road map for its policies in defending and promoting 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>226. Brazil praised Ecuador&#8217;s constructive, open and committed approach throughout the 
process and the national report submitted at the Working Group and the results of its review 
process. Brazil recognized the commitment demonstrated by Ecuador in the plenary session by 
highlighting its voluntary commitments in the framework of the review. Brazil strongly 
welcomed Ecuador&#8217;s commitment regarding 48 issues under 15 thematic areas, including the 
harmonization of national law in relation to international norms, women&#8217;s rights, children&#8217;s 
rights, and the collective rights of African-Ecuadorians and indigenous peoples. It also 
commended Ecuador on its political will to face human rights challenges.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>227. Latin American Committee for the Defence of Women&#8217;s Rights (Cladem), in a joint 
statement with Action Canada for Population and Development, the Federation for Family 
Planning, and the International Women&#8217;s Rights Action Watch, highlighted the very positive 
attitude of the delegation of Ecuador during the review, its openness and cooperation with civil 
society, including its participation in the National Direction for Women. With regard to the 
ongoing adoption of a new constitution and draft laws, Ecuador should take into account 
women&#8217;s rights, in particular recommendations and voluntary commitments on gender and the 
eradication of violence. It advised to maintain in the Constitution the protection of women, 
especially women at work, in order to allow them to free and responsible decisions regarding 
their reproductive and sexual life, and the recognition of non-paid domestic labour. In addition, 
paternity leave is another step in the right direction to promote gender equality in the family. 
Finally, it would be important to promote commissions on women and family rights in the 
Amazon region, which is disadvantaged with respect to the rest of the country.  
</p>
<p>228. Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos stated that in 
Ecuador there are large tracks of virgin lands, both in the Amazon and the Andes regions, and a 
very rich biodiversity. Both young and adult persons have a special relation with this land, which 
they have occupied since time immemorial and which allows them to survive, and to revive their 
own identity in the exercise of their collective rights. Illegal action taken by oil companies and 
other firms violates the rights of these peoples. The State must reaffirm the constitutional rights 
of indigenous peoples, as the present situation appears inappropriate to promote the highest level 
of implementation of their rights and to ensure their participation to civil life. It therefore 
suggested to include a further recommendation which would reflect Ecuador&#8217;s commitment to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>including in the constitutional text the free self-determination of indigenous peoples, including 
the possibility of being informed in advance on matters which have a direct influence on their 
lives. 
</p>
<p>229. Action Canada for Population and Development welcomed the strong commitment to the 
universality of human rights demonstrated by the Ecuadorian delegation during the review, 
including its defence of its obligation to combat discrimination based on sexual orientation. In 
this connection, it welcomed the decision of the Constitutional Assembly to preserve the 
references forbidding discrimination based on sexual orientation in the text of the new 
constitution that is currently being drafted - a decision that corresponds to the letter and spirit of 
recommendation No. 7 (A/HRC/8/20, para. 60). Ecuador was encouraged to add &#8220;gender 
identity&#8221; to the prohibited grounds of discrimination listed in the Constitution, and it was 
recommended that Ecuador develop and implement training and sensitization programmes on 
gender identity and sexual orientation for police personnel and for the educational system at all 
levels. It also recommended that Ecuador take concrete steps to address the situation of the social 
and economic marginalization of transvestites, transsexuals, lesbians, bisexuals and gay men.  
</p>
<p>230. Centre for Women Global Leadership stated that with reference to recommendations 
nos. 6, 7 and 8, in spite of being prominent in civil society reports, women&#8217;s reproductive rights 
were not adequately highlighted during the review. It encouraged Ecuador to affirm the 
constitutional principles of non-discrimination and the right to exercise informed choice in 
matters of sexual and reproductive health above the interest of particular groups, including 
religious groups. Furthermore, women do not use contraceptives due to ignorance, pressure from 
their husbands and partners and religious beliefs. The Government was encouraged to strengthen 
the awareness-raising component of its current plans on reproductive health to better educate the 
population on the uses of contraceptives and to eradicate gender stereotypes and harmful beliefs, 
including those of a religious nature. Including a specific reference to the secular character of the 
Ecuadorean State in the new Constitution, with full respect of religious freedom, will further 
contribute to this end. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review on the  
outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>231. Following the views expressed on the outcome of the review by representatives of States 
members of the Council, observers and stakeholders, Ecuador expressed its appreciation for the 
additional comments made by delegations and several non-governmental organizations. It noted 
that statements reflect the transparent, clear and decisive way in which Ecuador has submitted 
itself to the universal periodic review. It further noted that many of the recommendations put 
forward by non-governmental organizations are already reflected in the national report and 
the 48 voluntary pledges and commitments introduced by Ecuador at the present meeting.  
</p>
<p>232. Ecuador indicated that it participated in the process with the objective of strengthening 
international mechanisms and expressed its satisfaction at the process and mechanism, an 
efficient form of multilateralism with the highest goal of human development, which is what 
countries like Ecuador aspire to as well. This means for Ecuador basically a firm commitment to 
the defence of human rights, transparency in its actions, a firm determination and resolution to 
bring about reform in its judiciary, especially in the new Constitution which is being drafted. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Ecuador considers the universal periodic review exercise a very valuable and important process. 
It noted that a number of State institutions and civil society representatives participated actively 
in the preparation of the national report and the voluntary commitments.  
</p>
<p>233. Ecuador considers that it is very important to carefully weight the experiences and lessons 
learned from the review. Measures should be adopted to prepare the reports with more lead time 
for the next review and to increase as much as possible the participation of the civil society. The 
Council and the Secretariat, in the areas of their complex responsibilities, should adopt measures 
and optimize resources to bring about a more effective contribution to the process. All actors, 
States, civil society and the United Nations system and the international community should 
preserve and take further drive the goals of the Universal Periodic Review process, so that it does 
not loose its raison d&#8217;&#234;tre and that it continue to be respectful and constructive and participative 
mechanism to promote respect of human rights in the world.  
</p>
<p><b>Tunisia 
</b></p>
<p>234. The review of Tunisia was held on 8 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Tunisia in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/TUN/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/TUN/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/TUN/3). 
</p>
<p>235. At its 13th and 14th meetings, on 9 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Tunisia (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>236. The outcome of the review on Tunisia is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/21 and Corr.1), together with the views of Tunisia 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>237. Tunisia reiterated its full commitment to the universal periodic review mechanism, which 
would help to advance human rights issues throughout the world. Tunisia was determined to 
continue the efforts it had begun with seriousness and selflessness even before the institution of 
the universal periodic mechanism, an exercise in which it had participated from the outset as a 
founding member of the Council. 
</p>
<p>238. The best illustration of Tunisia&#8217;s commitment was to be found in the interview given by 
President Zine e-Abidine Ben Ali to the magazine <i>Afrique Asie</i>, which appeared in the May 2008 
issue; in that interview, the President emphasized that Tunisia intended to take full advantage of 
the recommendations of the Human Rights Council in order to further promote human rights and 
strengthen cooperation with United Nations and regional organizations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>239. In its report to the Council&#8217;s Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
(A/HRC/26.6/1/TUN/1), Tunisia described some of the commitments it had undertaken to give 
new impetus to the protection and promotion of human rights. Since the submission of the 
country&#8217;s report, new measures had been taken to consolidate the effective enjoyment of human 
rights in daily life, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) The extending of an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights while countering terrorism to visit Tunisia; 
</p>
<p> (b) The passage of a law on the national institution for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (the High Committee on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) in accordance 
with the principles relating to the status of national institutions (the Paris Principles, 
General Assembly resolution 48/134, annex). This new legislative statute consolidates the 
High Committee&#8217;s administrative and financial autonomy and strengthens it operational capacity.  
</p>
<p>240. Tunisia drew attention to a number of steps it had taken to ensure more effective practical 
implementation of human rights in the country, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) The adoption of a law on Tunisia&#8217;s accession to the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol; 
</p>
<p> (b) The adoption of a law on Tunisia&#8217;s accession to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; 
</p>
<p> (c) The adoption of an act withdrawing the reservations entered by Tunisia in the act 
ratifying of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; 
</p>
<p> (d) The adoption by the Council of Ministers of a bill aimed at strengthening 
jurisdictional guarantees during pretrial detention and at making conditions of automatic release 
and rehabilitation procedures more flexible; 
</p>
<p> (e) Submission of a periodic report on implementation of the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (f) Submission of a periodic report on implementation of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child; 
</p>
<p> (g) The visit to Tunisia of two Special Rapporteurs of the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders in Africa and the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of women in Africa, from 25 to 30 June 2008; 
</p>
<p> (h) The holding of talks with the non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch 
with a view to concluding an agreement on visits to prisons, similar to the agreement concluded 
with the International Committee of the Red Cross; 
</p>
<p> (i) The establishment of an institution associated with the General Human Rights 
Coordinator responsible for follow-up to the recommendations of treaty bodies. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>241. Tunisia recalled that the efforts of all stakeholders in the protection and promotion of 
human rights, which were of vital importance, would produce results only if they had their basis 
in constructive dialogue founded on universal values. Such an outcome clearly depended on the 
combined efforts of the public authorities, national institutions and civil society. 
</p>
<p>242. Strengthened by its choices as a modern society and by its accomplishments, Tunisia was 
firmly committed to the promotion and protection of all human rights. Tunisia was nevertheless 
aware that the progress attained thus far needed to be further consolidated on an ongoing basis. 
</p>
<p>243. Tunisia was thus proceeding calmly along that path, but it was far from complacent, for 
none of its achievements in that area was as yet permanent. In that connection, Tunisia recalled 
that the efforts of the State would continue to be aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the 
protection and promotion of human rights in everyday life, and in particular towards the 
development of a culture and system of education of human rights and the humanistic and 
universal values that underlay them. 
</p>
<p>244. Tunisia noted that the international community was facing a number of real challenges and 
objectives related to the major threats posed by mounting racism, xenophobia, defamation of 
religions, extremism, intolerance and terrorism, worsening poverty and the prospect of famine. 
Tunisia stressed that it was imperative that the dialogue among cultures and civilizations should 
be strengthened as a vector of understanding and rapprochement. In that connection, Tunisia, a 
country characterized by openness and moderation, would spare no effort in promoting the 
values of dialogue and tolerance. 
</p>
<p>245. The World Solidarity Fund, established by the General Assembly in its resolution 57/265 
at the initiative of Tunisia, was a mechanism that could effectively help to combat poverty and 
the food crisis. Tunisia called once again on the international community, through the 
Human Rights Council, to make international solidarity a fundamental value in order to tackle 
that crisis in all its magnitude. Tunisia said that the serious threats to human rights must be 
addressed as a matter of urgency. That effort was the responsibility of everyone. It was therefore 
time to give active expression to the international community&#8217;s solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>246. Algeria welcomed the commitment of Tunisia to the implementation of the 
recommendations made during the universal periodic review, which reflects its will to improve 
the situation of human rights and to support the efforts made towards the protection and 
promotion of human rights. It also noted that this confirms the good cooperation of Tunisia with 
the human rights system in general and with the Council in particular. Algeria noted that the 
measures taken by Tunisia to implement the recommendations require the understanding on the 
part of the international community of the particular features of the region and its support in 
order to enable Tunisia to confront the challenges it faces.  
</p>
<p>247. Morocco noted the actions taken by Tunisia since the review, and in particular the 
promulgation of laws concerning the accession by Tunisia to the International Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, as well as the withdrawal of its </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It also took note of the submission of 
its periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child. It welcomed the promulgation of a law on a national 
human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles which is consistent with a 
recommendation made during the universal periodic review and demonstrates the commitment of 
Tunisia to the implementation of the recommendations. It further noted that the invitation sent to 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering 
terrorism is also an illustration of Tunisia&#8217;s commitment.  
</p>
<p>248. Qatar, on behalf of the Group of Arab States, commended Tunisia on the measures taken in 
the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms and expressed esteem for its cooperation 
with the Council. Qatar noted the long series of measures taken after the review, which reflects 
Tunisia&#8217;s determination to respect the commitments undertaken and its decision to implement 
the recommendations of the Working Group. It welcomed the adoption of the law concerning the 
establishment of a national human rights institution consistent with the Paris Principles and the 
invitation extended to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights 
while countering terrorism. It further noted the great interest shown by Tunisia in cooperating 
with the civil society, and in particular with Human Rights Watch with which there has been an 
agreement on regular visits to prisons in Tunisia. It noted that Tunisia has continued to opt for 
new measures and has acceded to human rights instruments, such as the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Qatar reiterated its appreciation for 
the efforts made and the measures taken by Tunisia with a view to respecting its commitments, 
and called upon all human rights forums to continue to provide assistance to Tunisia so that all 
its commitments may be translated into concrete facts.  
</p>
<p>249. Belgium noted that during the review it had expressed its concern at the freedom of 
expression, the freedom of the press, and the situation of human rights defenders in Tunisia. It 
noted that the conclusions contained in the report of the Working Group encouraging Tunisia to 
make efforts in these areas were formulated in a very general manner. Belgium reiterated its 
hope that the Press Code will be harmonized with the provisions of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, in particular as regards the crime of defamation. It welcomed the 
announcement made by Tunisia to receive this month the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights 
Defenders of the African Commission of Human and People&#8217;s Rights and hoped that this visit 
will make it possible for Tunisia to welcome, in the near future, the special procedure of the 
Council competent in this area. 
</p>
<p>250. Indonesia expressed its appreciation for the presentation made by the Minister on the 
occasion of the adoption of the Working Group report. It commended Tunisia on the information 
provided and on the measures taken as part of the follow-up to the review, which reflect 
Tunisia&#8217;s commitment to implementing the recommendations made during the review. It also 
noted with appreciation various initiatives undertaken by Tunisia and welcomed the invitation 
extended to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while 
countering terrorism as well as the upcoming visits of two special procedures mandate holders of 
the African Commission on Human and People&#8217;s Rights to Tunisia. It also welcomed the 
commitments made by Tunisia to further enhance measures for the promotion and protection of 
human rights. It also congratulated it on the adoption into national laws of normative legislation 
on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, and welcomed the establishment of a body which is in charge of 
following up on recommendations of the treaty bodies. Indonesia also commended Tunisia on its 
ongoing measures and encouraged it to further enhance the application of human rights norms in 
the country based on its commitments made to implement the recommendations emanating from 
the review by the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>251. Pakistan noted Tunisia&#8217;s successful review and that it had accepted all the 
recommendations made to it. It also noted Tunisia&#8217;s positive tradition of following up on its 
commitments and that it has extended an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of human rights while countering terrorism and adopted a law concerning a 
national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. It also noted that 
Tunisia has adopted laws regarding its accession to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and withdrawn its reservations to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. It welcomed Tunisia&#8217;s decision to adopt a bill providing jurisdictional guarantees 
for detainees and the submission of its periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Rights of the Child. It commended Tunisia on 
its engagement with regional structures for the promotion and protection of human rights and 
other steps taken, and wished Tunisia well in its efforts to guarantee the promotion and 
protection of the human rights of its citizens.  
</p>
<p>252. Angola welcomed the willingness of Tunisia to implement several recommendations 
proposed in the context of the review and its readiness to engage in an open and constructive 
dialogue regarding the situation of human rights. It expressed its appreciation for the efforts 
made by Tunisia to enhance in a concrete manner the situation of human rights in the field of 
civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights, taking into consideration 
the positive dialogue during the process of the universal periodic review. It noted that Tunisia is 
showing a great commitment to the improvement of human rights by committing itself to the 
implementation of several international human rights instruments. It welcomed Tunisia&#8217;s policies 
to promote gender equality through the adoption of legislative measures to ensure an effective 
implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. It also welcomed the measures taken to reinforce juridical 
guarantees for preventive detentions and measures to withdraw its reservation to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child. It took note with satisfaction of the invitation extended to the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, and 
Tunisia&#8217;s readiness to cooperate with the African Commission for Human and People&#8217;s Rights.  
</p>
<p>253. Bahrain welcomed the positive measures and actions undertaken by Tunisia pursuant to the 
recommendations made by the Working Group. It noted that the adoption of measures shows that 
Tunisia is committed to giving a new emphasis to the human rights movement and promoting it, 
as well as to strengthening of cooperation with United Nations and regional bodies. It welcomed 
the adoption of a law on a national human rights institution consistent with the Paris Principles, 
strengthening the autonomy and administrative independence of that body and its working 
methods. It welcomed the establishment of a human rights coordinator to follow up on the 
recommendations made by treaty bodies and Tunisia&#8217;s cooperation with United Nations 
mechanisms with a view to promoting and protecting human rights.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>254. Cuba commended Tunisia on the efforts and progress made in the field of human rights, 
including on the tangible results obtained in the promotion and protection of fundamental rights, 
notably in the areas of education and health. It recognized the progress made toward achieving 
equality between men and women, eliminating all forms of discrimination against women and 
protecting vulnerable groups, in particular the rights of children. It noted that the experience and 
results of Tunisia in the area of the eradication of poverty based in particular on the 
implementation of the national programme to help families in need is very useful, and noted that 
this initiative should be an example for other countries. It noted that Tunisia is a country of peace 
and solidarity and that its move toward economic and social development and its achievements 
in these areas are impressive despite the difficult international context. It noted that the review 
gave an opportunity to appreciate the genuine political will of Tunisia and its clear commitment 
to human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>255. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues, Amnesty International and the 
Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, in a joint statement, welcomed Tunisia&#8217;s commitment 
to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the invitation to the Special Rapporteur on human rights and 
terrorism but regretted that the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture has not yet been 
invited. They also regretted that the recommendations of the universal periodic review do not 
take sufficiently into account the need to better protect freedom of association and expression, 
notably of human rights organizations. They would have preferred that the authorities would 
have made commitments regarding recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and, recently, 
by the Human Rights Committee. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues and 
Amnesty International also urged the Government to implement as quickly as possible the 
recommendations made during the review and those of the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>256. The Organisation de la M&#232;re Maghrebine (also on behalf of Femmes Africa Solidarit&#233; and 
Association Tunisienne des M&#232;res) focused its statement on equality and the promotion and 
protection of women&#8217;s rights, referring to Millennium Development Goal 3, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. In Tunisia, the achievements in the area of women&#8217;s rights have 
become a social reality and a constitutional value. It considered that equality is linked to 
women&#8217;s fight for further improving the right to employment, the status within the family and 
also to participating in the process of sustainable human development. Thus, equality must be 
accompanied by an in-depth discussion involving the entire international community with a view 
to defining a plan of action to eradicate all forms of discrimination as proposed by the 
Millennium Summit which has set 2015 as the deadline for achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>257. The World Organization against Torture (also on behalf of the Cairo Institute for 
Human Rights Studies, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists) stated 
that Tunisia is capable of making progress, particularly legislative progress in the areas of the 
rights of the child and the status of women. It regretted that there are serious gaps in Tunisian 
law, especially in the way in which it is applied. It would have liked to see a number of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>recommendations be reflected in the debate of the Working Group. As to paragraph 9 of the 
report, Tunisia should take measures without ambiguity to put an end to the use of torture during 
interrogations. As to paragraphs 49 and 59, it should clarify the definition of terrorism as 
emerging from the law of 2003 which should not be used to limit freedom of association and 
expression or forms of political disagreement expressed without violence. As to paragraphs 6 
and 31, it should ensure genuine independence of judges and magistrates so that they can apply 
the law respecting their professional ethics, and put an end to harassment of lawyers. As to 
paragraph 23, Tunisia should guarantee the effective opening of an investigation into all 
allegations of torture or inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment, putting an end to the current 
practice of investigative authorities not accepting the filing of a complaint or letting its 
processing take too long. As to paragraph 42, it should put an end to the various forms of 
physical, administrative, judicial or media harassment against human rights defenders. As to 
paragraphs 10 and 19, it should amend the law according to which a person found guilty of a 
sexual offence against someone under the age of 20 is exempted from any penalty if the offender 
marries the victim.  
</p>
<p>258. The International Publishers Association (also on behalf of the International PEN and 
World Association of Newspapers) noted that in April 2007, the IFEX Tunisia Monitoring 
Group issued a report which refers to serious breaches of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights in Tunisia, notably article 19. It believed that the only recommendation 
pertaining to freedom of expression in the report of the review of Tunisia, mainly to the revision 
of article 51 of the Press Code, is far from sufficient to address the multitude of problems 
existing in Tunisia in this area. It welcomed the news of the release of some of the censored 
books and some announced positive changes to legislation although these do not go far enough 
in addressing the concerns raised in the report. It urged the Tunisian authorities to encourage 
diversity of content and ownership of the press, to stop blocking news websites, to release all 
censored books and to allow new titles to be published. It also reiterated its position that the 
Government should allow legal non-governmental organizations to work and independent 
organizations to be established without requiring prior political approval. 
</p>
<p>259. The Union Nationale de la Femme Tunisienne noted that the report of Tunisia revealed a 
number of indicators on the presentation of women in different areas of political, economic and 
social activity. The achievements reflected in the report are the result of Tunisia&#8217;s adoption of a 
personal status code directly after independence which has enshrined the emancipation of 
women, in particular by abolishing polygamy, eradicating customary marriage and establishing 
the principle of judicial marriage. All the achievements of women in Tunisia are the result of 
serious and constructive debate between the Government and women&#8217;s associations. It noted that 
efforts and progress made do not prevent the persistence of certain lacunae which call for 
in-depth and collective reflection. But if the rights which women in Tunisia have today constitute 
a rampart against obscurantism and extremism. It called for combining efforts and multiplying 
contacts among women of different cultures to further promote the rights of women and to block 
all of those who try to hinder them.  
</p>
<p>260. Espace Afrique International welcomed Tunisia&#8217;s approach to human rights in general and 
noted that the promotion of women in Tunisia deserves support from the international 
community. Tunisia has been able to transform women into a pole of creativity and vigilance for 
harmonious social development. It noted that since the end of the 1980s, Tunisia has 
concentrated its efforts on women&#8217;s arrival in the public sphere at the level of the most important </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>decision-making forums. Besides the provisions of the personal status code of women, Tunisia 
has developed many initiatives for their implementation. There is a long list of protective 
measures contained in the Constitution. Tunisia has always granted a privileged place to the 
education and training of girls. Measures have been taken to promote the integration of women 
into various areas of public life while preparing them for decision-making.  
</p>
<p>261. The Association tunisienne des droits de l&#8217;enfant welcomed the withdrawal of Tunisia&#8217;s 
reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in follow-up to recommendations 
made by the Committee, and reiterated its request to reconsider withdrawing the reservations to 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It noted that 
while legislation is in conformity with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, various 
challenges remained, such as the need to consolidate the mechanisms for the protection of the 
rights of children, in particular by setting up a database on the situations and violations of 
children&#8217;s rights which would be accessible to all, including civil society.  
</p>
<p>262. The Fondation Atlas pour l&#8217;auto-developpement et la solidarit&#233; noted that the report on 
Tunisia refers to efforts to combat poverty and welcomed efforts which have made it possible to 
reconcile economic and social affairs, encouraged by active solidarity. With regard to the rise of 
energy and basic food prices and the negative effects of globalization it asked about the 
implementation of the world solidarity fund established to combat poverty.  
</p>
<p>263. The Association tunisienne de la communication welcomed the fact that the rights of 
persons with disabilities are now protected through the 2005 legislation, which is in harmony 
with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ratified by Tunisia. It was 
convinced that other measures must be taken in order to reach full participation of disabled 
persons, in particular in the field of digital accessibility, which is still very expensive in Tunisia. 
It urged the Government, the private sector and civil society to make more efforts with a view to 
developing and implementing a needed mechanism to allow for access to information technology 
and information, in accordance with article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>264. Action internationale pour la paix et le developpement dans la region des Grands Lacs 
welcomed the holistic approach to human rights promoted in Tunisia based on values set forth in 
the Vienna Programme of Action and relevant instruments of the African Union. It highlighted 
Tunisia&#8217;s efforts, especially the ratification of international instruments, the agreement to 
authorize Human Rights Watch to visit prisons, the creation of a body with a general coordinator 
on human rights responsible for follow-up to treaty body recommendations, the adoption of a 
draft law which strengthens judicial guarantees during preventive detention, the withdrawal of 
reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, accession to the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, ratification 
of the charter on the creation of an African court on human rights and peoples and the 
Arab Charter on Human Rights, which is important to promote the rights of the poor. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed by the State under review on the  
outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>265. The Minister of Justice and Human Rights, Mr. B&#233;chir Tekkari, concluded by thanking all 
speakers, including the members of civil society. He recalled and confirmed that Tunisia was 
firmly committed to following up the recommendations of the Human Rights Council. A body 
had been established to ensure follow-up to those recommendations, and Tunisia had reported on 
its most recent activities to implement them. He further noted that the invitation to the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism did not preclude invitations to other special rapporteurs, particularly the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In 
that connection, he assured the Council that there was no torture in Tunisia; rather, there were 
instances of torture that were duly prosecuted by the justice system. He also affirmed that there 
was no immunity in respect of acts of torture. 
</p>
<p>266. With regard to the case of the journalist mentioned during the debate, he said that the 
journalist in question had been detained for reasons that had to do with his status as a journalist. 
Indeed, no one was detained in Tunisia for his or her opinions. However, one&#8217;s profession was 
not a source of immunity for any offences a person might commit. With regard to Internet 
access, he recalled that the Tunisian Government had been accused of sentencing young people 
for having used Internet websites to create explosives. One of the youths in question had been 
pardoned and had subsequently died in an incident linked to a terrorist act. 
</p>
<p>267. The Minister said that there were still many obstacles to be overcome, particularly with 
regard to the exploitation of religion and religious extremism. Terrorism posed a major 
challenge, but it would not hold Tunisia back and would be dealt with through the law. If there 
were still inadequacies in Tunisia&#8217;s counter-terrorism legislation, the Government was prepared 
to rectify them. 
</p>
<p>268. The Minister said that, at the domestic level, Tunisia would pursue and strengthen its 
positive collaboration with civil society, which must play a role in the promotion of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>269. The Minister concluded his statement by expressing the hope that he had contributed to the 
success of the universal periodic review exercise, which he believed to be useful, but which must 
be followed by self-study at the national level, an effort in which Tunisia, which had made 
human rights a strategic choice, was already engaged. 
</p>
<p><b>Morocco 
</b></p>
<p>270. The review of Morocco was held on 8 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Morocco in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/MAR/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/MAR/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/MAR/3 and Corr.1). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>271. At its 14th meeting, on 9 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Morocco (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>272. The outcome of the review on Morocco is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/22 and Corr.1), together with the views of Morocco 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>273. The Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Morocco to the United Nations Office 
at Geneva said that when the review of Morocco in the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review had concluded on 8 April 2008, his delegation had accepted 11 of the 
13 recommendations that the Working Group had formulated. In its recommendations, the 
Working Group had taken note of the progress made by Morocco in the field of human rights 
and encouraged it to continue broadening and deepening the substantial reforms undertaken in 
recent years at the instigation of King Mohammed VI and with the active and sustained 
participation of all segments of Moroccan society. Those recommendations, which fell within the 
framework of Morocco&#8217;s ongoing reform, were different in that while some could be 
implemented in the short term, others required a minimum of coordination and the taking of 
decisions by various departments and had time frames and budgetary implications associated 
with their implementation. In the light of those considerations, he wished to confirm Morocco&#8217;s 
acceptance of the 11 recommendations contained in the report of the Working Group 
(A/HRC/8/22) and inform the Council of the following measures taken to implement them. 
</p>
<p>274. Hardly two weeks after Morocco&#8217;s periodic review, on 25 and 26 April 2008, the Human 
Rights Documentation, Training and Information Centre, which was a subsidiary body of the 
Consultative Council on Human Rights, the country&#8217;s national human rights institution, had held 
a symposium on the launching of the preparatory process for the National Plan of Action in the 
area of democracy and human rights, the completion of which would allow Morocco to join the 
group of States that had established such an instrument at the international level. 
</p>
<p>275. The objective of the Plan was to help the Government, organizations and members of civil 
society in their efforts to ensure respect for and promote and protect human rights; strengthen 
national institutions working in that area; disseminate information on human rights standards and 
mechanisms, particularly among law enforcement bodies and social workers; develop specific 
programmes to improve the situation of vulnerable groups within the country; and place 
emphasis on the role of human rights in national development. Following the official launching 
of the Plan, the Human Rights Documentation, Training and Information Centre planned to hold 
four regional meetings during June and July 2008 with a view to decentralizing the debate and 
working together with the local actors concerned. 
</p>
<p>276. The recent initiative by the Moroccan Government aimed at combating violence against 
women, including domestic violence, had led to a wide range of measures ranging from the 
establishment of new counselling centres and shelters for battered women to a revision of the 
Criminal Code aimed at criminalizing domestic violence. In order to sensitize public opinion to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the phenomenon, Morocco was to conclude an agreement with the High Commissioner&#8217;s Office 
aimed at making both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the problem and its 
repercussions known. Similarly, a national survey was to be conducted to ascertain the 
prevalence of gender-based violence. There were also plans to strengthen counselling centres and 
shelters for women victims, working together with various actors, by establishing 16 new centres 
in 2009 in collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Government&#8217;s social 
development strategy called for the creation of a rehabilitation centre for perpetrators of violence 
and the institutionalization of the National Observatory to Eliminate Violence against Women. 
Lastly, a multisectoral programme to combat gender-based violence, which was the result of 
partnership with eight United Nations specialized agencies, had officially been introduced on 
30 May 2008. The objective of the programme was to promote women&#8217;s equality and 
empowerment and to reduce violence against women by half. 
</p>
<p>277. With regard to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Morocco 
had signed, the Government had, in tandem with the ratification process, prepared a bill on 
strengthening the rights of persons with disabilities which was based largely on the Convention. 
</p>
<p>278. With regard to the situation in prisons, King Mohammed VI had on 29 April 2008 
appointed a High Commissioner General for Prison Administration and Reintegration whose role 
was to ensure safety in correctional establishments, modernize them and ensure that no violation 
of the law occurred within them. The High Commissioner General would be assisted in the 
performance of his functions by a Director, who would be responsible for creating adequate 
conditions for effective inmate training with a view to the professional and social reintegration of 
inmates after their release. In terms of infrastructure, the Moroccan Government was pursuing its 
programme of renovating and expanding existing prisons and was going ahead with the 
construction of seven new prisons, while three more projects aimed at reducing prison 
population density and improving living conditions were under consideration. The Moroccan 
Government was also implementing two other measures in pursuit of the same goal: the early 
release of a number of prisoners and the adoption of alternative measures to deprivation of 
liberty. 
</p>
<p>279. The Moroccan delegation provided the following information on efforts to implement the 
recommendations of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission, which was one of the Working 
Group&#8217;s recommendations. 
</p>
<p>280. With regard to reparations to individuals, it was noted that some 13,412 beneficiaries, 
representing victims of grave human rights violations perpetrated in the past or their heirs, had 
received compensation, with over 95 per cent of all persons so entitled having received 
reparations or compensation. Cooperation between the national human rights institution and the 
Government had led to the signing of an agreement on the inclusion of victims of grave 
violations in the basic health-care system. Under that agreement, the State would bear all 
medical expenses of the victims and their heirs. 
</p>
<p>281. With regard to reparations at the community level, 11 local coordination offices had been 
established in the regions that had suffered most from the violations in order to promote 
participation in the implementation of development projects for those regions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>282. Again in the area of individual and community reparation, it was noted that the Ministry of 
Employment and Vocational Training and the Consultative Council on Human Rights had 
concluded a cooperation agreement on 3 June 2008 that would allow that body to contribute to 
the implementation of individual and community reparation programmes. 
</p>
<p>283. On 28 and 29 May 2008, Morocco had organized the Twelfth National Congress on 
Children&#8217;s Rights which had had as its theme &#8220;Promoting children&#8217;s rights: what role for local 
actors?&#8221;. The Congress had afforded an opportunity for evaluating the National Plan of Action 
for Children (PANE) two years after its implementation. The Congress had concluded with the 
issuing of a declaration that endorsed the spirit of participation displayed by the various sectors, 
the involvement of children in the evaluation of PANE, the need to adopt quality standards, 
principles of equal opportunity and means of combating all forms of educational 
impoverishment, and further reform of the health-care system in terms of managed care and 
maternal and child health facilities. 
</p>
<p>284. With regard to human rights education and training, and in order to build the capacities of 
law enforcement officers in the area of human rights, the Consultative Council on Human Rights 
had begun to implement the partnership and cooperation agreements concluded with the Ministry 
of Education and the Ministry of the Interior. Those agreements were intended to promote a 
culture of human rights in educational institutions and in the curricula of training programmes 
for law enforcement officials and officers within the Ministry of the Interior. A study had been 
undertaken to assess existing training and education programmes in order to measure 
capacity-building needs and to determine whether any adjustments were needed. 
</p><p>285. The representative of Morocco said that his country had taken note of the 
recommendations concerning the International Criminal Court and the extending of a standing 
invitation to the Council&#8217;s special procedures, and he provided the following information. 
</p>
<p>286. As a reflection of its positive engagement with the United Nations machinery, Morocco 
had always cooperated fully with the special procedures and supported their mandates when it 
had not initiated them itself, as in the case of the mandate of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, which it had initiated with the 
delegation of Norway. More concretely, Morocco had been visited by the Special Rapporteur on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography in 2000, by the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants in 2003 and by the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, 
whose mission report (A/HRC/8/10/Add.2) had been presented and considered at the beginning 
of the eighth session of the Council, in 2006. All those rapporteurs had attested to Morocco&#8217;s 
unstinting cooperation. 
</p>
<p>287. The representative of Morocco also reaffirmed that Morocco&#8217;s commitment to the 
protection and promotion of human rights was sincere, permanent and irreversible. After having 
courageously and voluntarily dealt with past violations of human rights and compensated the 
victims or their legitimate heirs, Morocco was currently endeavouring to consolidate its 
achievements in that area, to broaden the scope of freedoms and to create the conditions for the 
exercise by all Moroccans without distinction of all rights, whether civil, political, economic 
social or cultural. Morocco would not fail to keep the Council informed over time of the 
development of those reforms and their results. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of  
the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>288. The Netherlands commended the Moroccan delegation on the transparent way it had 
handled the review. It was noted with appreciation that Morocco had agreed to almost all the 
recommendations that had been made during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group, 
including its recommendation to continue implementing the remaining recommendations of the 
Instance Equit&#233; et R&#233;conciliation. The Netherlands further asked if Morocco could inform the 
Council not only of the progress made in the implementation of the agreed recommendations, but 
also when it would reconsider its position on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court and on extending a standing invitation to all thematic special procedures on a voluntary 
basis. 
</p>
<p>289. Tunisia thanked Morocco for its outstanding statement and commended Morocco on its 
commitment to promoting and protecting human rights. The progress made in that area showed 
the desire often expressed by Moroccan authorities to make human rights a reality in everyday 
life. Tunisia noted Morocco&#8217;s achievements in strengthening its Constitution, harmonizing 
legislation, and ratifying almost all the international instruments in the area of human rights. 
Tunisia commended it on the results achieved by the National Initiative for Human 
Development - a plan of action for the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights in 
Morocco. Tunisia encouraged Morocco to continue its efforts for the well-being of all 
Moroccans. 
</p>
<p>290. Qatar, speaking on behalf of the Group of Arab States, congratulated Morocco for its 
progress on human rights. Morocco was commended on its role in the establishment of the 
universal periodic review mechanism. Morocco had taken seriously the recommendations of the 
Working Group. It has speeded up steps towards a culture of human rights through training and 
education, especially for law enforcement officials, and it has safeguarded the protection of 
minorities, women, children, the disabled and migrants. The Arab Group reiterated its 
appreciation of Morocco&#8217;s achievements in the field of human rights and fundamental rights, 
recalling the results of the Instance Equit&#233; et R&#233;conciliation, which has assured a convergence 
between various sectors of the Moroccan society. Qatar further noted that Morocco has adopted 
various measures to give a new impetus to human rights. Qatar stressed that Morocco has 
speeded up its responses to the recommendations made by the Council, and has continued its 
efforts to ensure the compatibility of its laws with all its international obligations. 
</p>
<p>291. Pakistan said that Morocco had one of the most comprehensive reviews and thanked the 
delegation of Morocco for its elaborate presentation, noting that Morocco had accepted all but 
two of the recommendations. One of them related to extending a standing invitation to all 
thematic special procedures. Pakistan welcomed Morocco&#8217;s commitment to giving serious and 
positive consideration to every single request made by any of the special procedures. It also 
welcomed the appointment of a new high commissioner for the administration of prisons with a 
ministerial rank, in line with the recommendations of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>292. Bahrain welcomed the statement made by Morocco and commended it on positive 
developments towards promoting and protecting human rights in the country. It further 
commended Morocco on its keenness to work with all stakeholders at the national, regional and 
international level. Morocco has proven its commitments to the objectives of the universal </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>periodic review, recognizing the importance of a number of issues: the draft law to promote 
disability rights, the appointment of a high commissioner to improve the conditions of prisons 
and prisoners, and organizing a national child congress, which would help towards implementing 
the rights of the child, all of which were among the recommendations made during the review.  
</p>
<p>293. The Syrian Arab Republic congratulated Morocco for cooperating with the universal 
periodic review mechanism. Morocco had made efforts to protect human rights, and had taken 
steps to raise awareness of the rights of various people. The Council should remember the efforts 
made by Morocco in the creation of the Council. It deserved credit for these efforts and its 
continuing commitment to promoting and protecting human rights. 
</p>
<p>294. Saudi Arabia paid special tribute to the Ambassador of Morocco for his constructive and 
effective role in the work of the human rights. Saudi Arabia emphasized that Morocco was a 
pioneer amongst Arab countries, having paid special attention to human rights at the institutional 
and legal levels. Saudi Arabia further noted that Morocco dealt positively with the 
recommendations made by the Working Group, and has accepted them, although some would 
have financial implications. Saudi Arabia believed that this showed the determination of 
Morocco to further promote and protect human rights. It welcomed the National Plan for 
Democracy and Human Rights drawn up by Morocco in accordance with the Vienna Declaration 
aimed at raising awareness of human rights. Implementation of the recommendations made 
during the review has already started effectively, with the setting up of a post of a high 
commissioner to oversee the conditions of prisons and prisoners, in accordance with 
international standards. Saudi Arabia noted that Morocco has also organized the Second 
Congress of Arab Human Rights Institutions.  
</p>
<p>295. Jordan noted that the national report discussed on 4 April 2008 during the review 
demonstrated the attachment of Morocco to human rights. Human rights in Morocco have 
continued to improve and the Government cooperated with all actors in society in their 
promotion. Unsurprisingly, Morocco ensured a positive and interactive dialogue throughout the 
process. Jordan referred to the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights with an increase from 
1 to 11 per cent representation in the Parliament and with a 50 per cent increase among the 
judiciary, which has promoted equality in professions monopolized hitherto by men. Jordan 
recommended to Morocco to continue its cooperation with the universal periodic review 
mechanism. 
</p>
<p>296. Egypt expressed appreciation for Morocco&#8217;s efforts and report under the universal periodic 
review. It noted that Morocco had started implementing recommendations even before they were 
issued by the Working Group, and noted the work undertaken on prisons, and on the rights of 
women and children. Egypt stressed that Morocco was one of the few countries to have accepted 
all the recommendations, which demonstrated Morocco&#8217;s pioneering role in the field of human 
rights without division between various rights.  
</p>
<p>297. The United Arab Emirates congratulated Morocco for having accepted the 
recommendations of the Working Group and thanked it for its efforts within the universal 
periodic review process, improvements to the national legislation, and its improvement and 
guarantee of human rights through the Instance Equit&#233; et R&#233;conciliation, in addition to the 
training of all the personnel and those who were in charge of implementing the laws. The 
United Arab Emirates stated that since the 1970s Morocco has been involved in the institutional </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>building of human rights also aimed at setting norms and standards which were compatible with 
international human rights, because it was cognizant of the need to achieve developments in the 
field of human rights and to promote and protect human rights with the cooperation of the 
international community. It believed that the Council should provide Morocco with all the 
necessary help to that effect. It was noted that Morocco had been working towards putting in 
place internationally recognized human rights norms.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>298. The Consultative Council on Human Rights of Morocco recalled that as a national 
institution, it was responsible for the operationalization of human rights in cooperation with the 
Government. These efforts have been translated into offering redress to victims of human rights 
violations. Various judicial decisions that have been implemented provided redress to victims in 
95 per cent of the cases addressed. Regarding health insurance, cooperation between the 
Government and the Consultative Council had allowed health coverage to be provided for the 
majority of those victims. Regarding collective rights, various decisions had been taken at the 
local level before programmes were implemented. Regarding the Equity and Reconciliation 
Commission, it affirmed that 44 cases out of 66 had been dealt with, and investigations were in 
progress to settle the remaining ones. It further explained that it was also working to implement 
the recommendations which have been adopted by the Committee for Legal Redress, including 
with regard to capital punishment, and establishing a national strategy to combat impunity. 
</p>
<p>299. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies stated that the cooperation between the 
Government and civil society in the preparation of the universal periodic review should be 
institutionalized in order to be fruitful and productive. It could not be challenged that Morocco 
has made tangible progress in promoting and protecting human rights. Important legislative 
reform has taken place to harmonize domestic legislation with international treaties. 
Nevertheless, human rights violations were regularly recorded by the Cairo Institute and other 
organizations, and it invited the Government to implement the recommendations contained in the 
report of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>300. Interfaith International commended the Government of Morocco on its commitment to 
promote and protect human rights and steps including, inter alia, the 1999 revision of the 
Constitution, the public liberty legislation, the law on prisons, the revision of the criminal 
procedure code, the labour law, the 1999 Independent Commission for the compensation of 
victims of forced disappearances and arbitrary detention, the adoption in 2004 of a new family 
code and the creation of a commission on truth, justice and reconciliation, and the launching of a 
national plan of action for economic, social and cultural rights. It affirmed that Morocco had 
developed strategies that placed the human being at the centre of development. 
</p>
<p>301. The Arab Commission for Human Rights mentioned that, since the attacks of 2003 in 
Casablanca, thousands of persons were arbitrarily detained, tortured and imprisoned after unfair 
trials in the name of the fight against terrorism. It stated that efforts undertaken to combat 
terrorism included some measures that led to violations of international conventions ratified by 
Morocco. It said that torture, which was tending to disappear in the beginning of the 2000s, was 
unfortunately back and practised in a certain number of detention centres under the oversight of 
the direction of the territory and law enforcement. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>302. The Union de l&#8217;action f&#233;minine encouraged Morocco to continue its efforts to implement 
the recommendations made during the review. It believed that the Government should lift its 
reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and the Optional Protocol thereto. It urged Morocco to create a higher council for 
women to guarantee these and believes that Morocco should establish and institutionalize a 
consultative committee that would bring together all stakeholders on an equal level. The Council 
was urged to adopt the outcome of the review to help assist Morocco in meeting those goals. 
</p>
<p>303. The International Federation of Business and Professional Women noted that Morocco 
deployed many efforts in the field of human rights, including the rights of women, and should be 
cited as an example and a model. It welcomed the new Family Code and stated that some of the 
Moroccan experiences should be referred to as best practices, especially in the field of 
reconciliation and the overhauling of the Family Code, which is the framework of enhancing 
women&#8217;s rights and gender equality. Morocco has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child to promote and protect children&#8217;s rights and measures have been undertaken, including in 
the fields of civic and human rights education and child participation. It stated that there was still 
a long path ahead and Morocco was encouraged to continue its efforts. 
</p>
<p>304. Amnesty International welcomed the recommendations made by several States, including 
on continuing to implement the recommendations of the Instance Equit&#233; et R&#233;conciliation, to 
ensure respect for the rights of migrants, to harmonize domestic law with international standards, 
and to ratify international human rights treaties. Amnesty International identified as a key human 
rights concern the apparent lack of accountability of the security forces for their alleged abuses, 
including torture and excessive use of force in the case of a person suspected of terrorist 
offences, of Sahrawi persons advocating against Moroccan rule in Western Sahara, and for the 
killings or arrest and detention of migrants attempting to reach European shores. There were also 
concerns about the freedom of the press and journalists. The fact that the death penalty has not 
yet been abolished and the Rome Statute not yet ratified as recommended by the Instance Equit&#233; 
et R&#233;conciliation put into question the political will of the authorities to implement these 
reforms. Amnesty International urged the Government to take swift action on these issues. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed by the State under review on the  
outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>305.  The representative of Morocco thanked the delegations for their positive assessment of the 
reforms being undertaken in his country and in particular the efforts being made to promote and 
protect human rights. That effort was reflected not only in the action taken at the national level 
but also in local initiatives. What was taking place was the result not of an official policy but of 
concerted efforts undertaken with civil society. The Ambassador and Permanent Representative 
of Morocco said that he had refrained from taking the floor during statements by NGOs that did 
not in his view have anything to do with the universal periodic review. He nevertheless 
cautioned against letting the universal periodic review become a weakened exercise devoid of 
any meaning. He reaffirmed Morocco&#8217;s intention of informing the Council of all human rights 
initiatives undertaken in the country and emphasized that his country&#8217;s commitment to human 
rights was deep and irreversible. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>306. Also taking the floor to deliver concluding remarks was Mr. M&#8217;hammed Abdenabaoui, 
Director of Criminal Affairs, who said that Morocco&#8217;s counter-terrorism legislation was 
consistent with human rights and the law applicable in most countries. All arrests that had been 
made had been carried out in accordance with the law. He did not know what the speaker who 
had made allegations of torture had been referring to, and he was prepared to meet that 
individual to discuss the matter. He assured the Council that if any acts of torture had occurred in 
the past, that phenomenon no longer existed. He stressed that civil society had contributed to the 
preparation of the national report, and it was the Government&#8217;s intention to pursue that 
collaboration. Lastly, he said that Morocco had contributed to the success of the universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b>Finland 
</b></p>
<p>307. The review of Finland was held on 9 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Finland in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/FIN/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/FIN/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/FIN/3). 
</p>
<p>308. At its 14th meeting, on 9 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Finland (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>309. The outcome of the review on Finland is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/24), together with the views of Finland concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/8/24/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>310. The delegation provided information on follow-up measures to the recommendations 
contained in A/HRC/8/24. More comprehensive information on follow-up is contained in 
A/HRC/8/24/Add.1. 
</p>
<p>311. Concerning recommendation No. 1, it was clarified that although public awareness of 
cultural diversity is increasing and the Government has worked persistently to integrate 
immigrants into Finnish society, there were still certain problems of racism and intolerance in 
Finland. Different measures were taken to address these challenges. The Non-Discrimination Act 
was currently under revision in order to strengthen the guarantees. In the recent Internal Security 
Programme of 8 May 2008, the security of immigrants and ethnic minorities was one of the key 
issues to be paid special attention to in the coming years.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>312. With regard to recommendation No. 2, the delegation provided information that the 
Ministry of Justice is currently examining the need to amend the legislation to oblige the service 
providers of Internet sites to follow up on and erase material amounting to hate speech and racist 
offences. 
</p>
<p>313. With reference to recommendation No. 3, it was stated, inter alia, that first-hand data was 
important to better understand the context in which violence within families occurred so as to be 
able to provide better services, prevention and monitoring measures, advocacy as well as 
awareness-raising. Finland was carrying out the Council of Europe&#8217;s Campaign to Combat 
Violence against Women in 2008 and a comprehensive study on violence against children will 
be published in the autumn.  
</p>
<p>314. Concerning recommendation No. 4 about considering ratifying the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, the delegation of Finland clarified that the rights of immigrants were already covered 
by national legislation, European Union legislation as well as by other human rights instruments, 
including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms. The basic rights and freedoms of the Finnish Constitution protect everyone residing in 
Finland, including migrant workers. Finland did not envisage that consultations between 
ministries to revise its position towards the Convention would take place in the near future. 
</p>
<p>315. Regarding recommendation No. 5, the delegation stated that it<b> </b>pursued actively the 
enhancement of the rights of the Sami people. The objective of the present Government is to 
solve the issue of the land use question during the current term of the Government. Another 
question related to the right of Sami people to participate in decision-making on the use of land 
in the Sami homeland area and the delegation stated that the aim of the Government was to find 
a solution that would include the prerequisites to ratify ILO Convention No. 169 on Indigenous 
and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries. 
</p>
<p>316. Referring to recommendation No. 6, Finland stated that it was committed to the full and 
inclusive application of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and that the 
Ombudsman for Minorities found that the accelerated asylum procedure, as a rule, safeguarded 
the legal protection of an asylum applicant during the process. Furthermore, the Finnish 
Constitution and Aliens Act prohibited deportation of aliens to a country where they could face 
the death penalty, torture or ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>317. With regard to recommendation No. 7, Finland reported, inter alia, that it had initially 
studied the Yogyakarta Principles and recognized their usefulness in bringing greater clarity and 
coherence to States&#8217; human rights&#8217; obligations. Finland was committed to further enhancing the 
situation of the LGBT people in Finland and the possible role of the Yogyakarta Principles in 
this would be studied further. 
</p>
<p>318. Concerning recommendation No. 8 on fully integrating a gender perspective into the 
follow-up process to the universal periodic review, it was explained that the Government was 
preparing an action plan for gender equality, the key objectives of which were, among others, to 
mainstream the gender perspective, to raise awareness of gender equality in schools and to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>reduce violence against women. The final action plan would be adopted soon and carried out 
intersectorally by all ministries and will be also taken into account while following up on the 
review. 
</p>
<p>319. Concerning the question of the elements employed to present violence against women as a 
human rights violation, the delegation clarified that it was the Government&#8217;s duty to raise public 
awareness of the problem, to positively shape attitudes and to take up other necessary actions in 
order to prevent violence against women. It also stated that violence against women or violence 
between the spouses as an aggravated ground for punishment was currently under examination at 
the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>320. On the question of other measures that would address the root causes of the problem of 
violence against women rather than the consequences and the proper role of mass media, Finland 
replied that data and information were a prerequisite for evidence-based policymaking, and that 
it was continuing its work in this field. In addition to holding offenders accountable and 
providing treatment programmes, it was also crucial to enhance positive male role models and to 
engage men in the efforts to eliminate violence against women in both prevention and advocacy. 
The delegation stated that it was only through a truly holistic approach that impunity can be 
ended and this violation of human rights eliminated. 
</p>
<p>321. In answer to the questions on the ombudsman system, it was indicated that the Ministry of 
Justice has set up an Equality Committee in January 2007 to prepare an overall reform of 
equality and non-discrimination legislation. In that connection, the status, duties and powers of 
the Ombudsmen were to be re-examined with a view to improve the functionality of the 
supervision mechanism. 
</p>
<p>322. Finland provided information that the Ombudsman for Minorities started work in 2001 
and its tasks were increased by a legislative amendment (22/2004) that took effect on 
1 February 2004 in connection with the enactment of the new Non-discrimination Act. In 
addition to issuing guidance, advice and recommendations, the Ombudsman supervised 
compliance with the Non-Discrimination Act outside employment relationships and service 
relationships governed by public law. The Ombudsman for Minorities was assisted by the 
Advisory Board for Minority Issues, set up for 2005-2008. Together with the Ombudsman, the 
Board was dealing with issues concerning the prevention and monitoring of ethnic 
discrimination, and supervision of non-discrimination. It also promoted related cooperation 
between different authorities. The Ombudsman for Minorities was the Chairman of the Board, 
which consisted of 14 members, who represented State authorities, trade unions, ethnic 
minorities and non-governmental organizations focusing on human rights. In 2007, the 
Ombudsman for Minorities handled a total of 737 customer cases, investigating them and, where 
necessary, referring the matter to the competent authorities. Some cases were taken further either 
for police investigation, to the National Discrimination Tribunal, or for a decision to prosecute 
by the Prosecutor General, or the case was referred for legal aid. 
</p>
<p>323. Regarding the main challenges for the Government in extending assistance to victims of 
human trafficking and protecting potential victims, it was explained that assistance for victims of 
trafficking in human beings begins with their identification. Finland was mainly a transit country 
for victims of trafficking and often, when in transit, the victims did not yet know that they will 
become victims of trafficking and they travel with legal travel documents. Therefore, their </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>identification is challenging for the authorities. The Ministry of the Interior was responsible for 
assisting victims of trafficking in human beings. Various services and support measures were 
organised for the victims and coordinated by asylum-seekers&#8217; reception centres in Joutseno or 
Oulu. In addition to taking care of accommodation and means of support, these measures may 
also include emergency aid, health services, legal advice and interpretation. Victims of 
trafficking in human beings were also given guidance in practical matters. In organizing services, 
attention was paid to the victims&#8217; individual needs and safety. For reasons of safety, information 
relating to victims of trafficking in human beings was kept confidential. Authorities responsible 
for assisting victims, along with other parties involved, were bound to professional secrecy. 
</p>
<p>324. In reply to the question on action taken by the Government to prosecute racially motivated 
crimes it was explained that one of the aims in the Prosecution Service in 2008 was to raise 
awareness to see whether a crime under prosecution was racially motivated. The Office of the 
Prosecutor General has ordered (order No. 2008:1) the prosecutors to report to the Office on all 
crimes which might have a racist motive.  
</p>
<p>325. Finland was asked whether it would consider integrating issues such as the resolution of 
the existing human rights problems, like racism and intolerance, into Finnish human rights 
education programmes. In reply it stated that in the core national curriculum for preschool 
education, basic education and upper secondary schools, the basic values were human rights, 
equality and democracy. Education against racism was also part of the core values in all the 
curricula. Basic education promoted tolerance and multicultural understanding. Human rights, 
tolerance and democracy were also incorporated in the core curriculum for adult education, both 
in the basic and upper secondary education for adults.  
</p>
<p>326. Special features in the education of different language groups and cultural groups have also 
been observed in the new core curriculum for basic education. The national languages of the 
Sami as an indigenous people and the national minorities have to be taken into consideration in 
education. The curriculum also emphasized the versatility the immigrant students from various 
different countries bring to the Finnish culture.  
</p>
<p>327. The Ministry of Education had, together with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the National 
Board of Education and civic organizations, prepared a national programme on 
internationalization. Education in human rights, tolerance, multiculturalism and minorities was 
part of this programme. One goal was to continue to strengthen the practical internationalization 
in schools and to evaluate the need for the development of school materials.  
</p>
<p>328. In 2005 the Equality Act was amended to include measures to be taken to promote equality 
in educational institutions. In general education, this meant the upper secondary schools. 
According to the amendment, the schools were required to make an equality plan once a year, 
together with the staff and student body representatives. The plan had to include the equality 
situation in the educational institution and the promotion of equality in schools. Special attention 
had to be paid to the student selections.  
</p>
<p>329. Information was also provided on how Finns and others can follow up on visits by the 
special procedures and on the recommendations of treaty bodies, which is also contained in 
paragraphs 86 and 87 of the national report (A/HRC/WG.6/1/FIN/1). It was explained that 
concluding observations were translated into the two national languages, Finnish and Swedish, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and if possible also into the minority languages used in Finland, e.g. North Sami, and published 
on the website of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (http://formin.finland.fi). Implementation is 
monitored by seminars, as well. Monitoring the implementation of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child has been a pilot project. Annual seminars had been useful, including as interactive 
discussion forums which contributed to implementing the concluding observations of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and monitoring implementation at the national level at all 
stages of the reporting cycle. In addition, these seminars contributed to the preparation of the 
Government&#8217;s periodic report and raised awareness of the Convention and the related monitoring 
and implementation processes, which proceeded as a spiral continuum. 
</p>
<p>330. On the question of how Finland currently guaranteed the right to consultation of collective 
property for the Sami people in regard to lands, the delegation in its reply stated that 
environmental projects may affect the traditional livelihood of Sami people. The special 
legislation relating to the environment and land use provided legal safeguards for those whose 
rights or interests were concerned, including the Sami people. Provisions on the right to issue an 
opinion and a right of appeal were included, for example, in the Environmental Protection Act, 
the Land Use and Construction Act, the Nature Conservation Act and the Act on Environment 
Impact Assessment. The Finnish Government stated that it pursued actively the enhancement of 
the rights of the Sami people and that the objective of the present Government was to solve the 
issue of the land use question during the current term of the Government. It was further stated 
that the Government Bill was under preparation and there were active negotiations between the 
Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Sami Parliament, which was 
a necessary partner in the negotiations. The point of departure was to ensure the culture of the 
Sami people and the right of Sami to use the land they traditionally occupied or where they 
traditionally lived. Another question related to the right of Sami people is to participate in 
decision-making on the use of land in the Sami homeland area. The aim of the Government was 
to find a solution that would include the prerequisites to ratify ILO Convention No. 169. Another 
ongoing project in Finland concerning the rights of Sami is the establishment of a new Sami 
Cultural Centre, which is to be built in Lapland, in the Sami homeland. The Government has 
already reserved nearly 12 million euros for the project. The main purpose of the Centre will be 
to enhance the Samis&#8217; ability to independently maintain and develop their culture, language and 
community life, manage and nurture their cultural and linguistic autonomy, and support the 
development of their living conditions. The premises will be used by the Sami: the Centre will be 
a Sami Parliament house, Sami library, a concentration of culture, education and skill resources, 
as well as an events venue for meetings, music, cinema and theatre. The Centre will be in use 
in 2012. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>331. No views were expressed by States members and observers of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>332. In a joint statement, Amnesty International and Friends World Committee for Consultation 
(Quakers) welcomed the serious and open way in which Finland approached its participation in 
the universal periodic review. They noted that Finland was one of the first States to be reviewed. 
Consequently, not all the questions raised and comments made were phrased as </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;recommendations&#8221; and, therefore, were not reflected as such in the report of the Working 
Group. By way of example, they raised the issue of the excessive length of alternative civilian 
service in comparison to the military service addressed in paragraph 36 of the report of the 
Working Group and hoped that Finland will give effect to that recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>Indonesia 
</b></p>
<p>333. The review of Indonesia was held on 9 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Indonesia in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/IDN/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/IDN/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/IDN/3). 
</p>
<p>334. At its 14th and 15th meetings, on 9 and 10 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted 
the outcome of the review on Indonesia (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>335. The outcome of the review on Indonesia is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/23), together with the views of Indonesia 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>336. Indonesia informed the Council that it is a country of huge geographical size and 
archipelagic contours, with an extremely diverse ethnic, religious and cultural heritage. In its 
efforts to promote and protect human rights nationwide, Indonesia has been facing huge 
challenges in terms of the diverse levels of human resource capacity and institutional 
development in various regions in the now highly decentralized governance system, including 
two provinces which enjoy special autonomous status, namely Aceh and Papua.  
</p><p>337. The National Action Plan on Human Rights, along with 436 local implementing 
committees, has significantly contributed to nurturing a human rights culture, including among 
government officials. Local governments share the burden and responsibility for the promotion 
and protection of human rights of each individual under their respective jurisdiction. Enhancing 
the capacity of provincial and district authorities is imperative. The central Government is 
currently undertaking capacity-building programmes, including the establishment of complaint 
mechanisms at the district level.  
</p>
<p>338. With regard to the recommendations made by the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review that enjoy the support of Indonesia, Indonesia stated that it considers them to be 
in line with the priority programmes of the promotion and protection of human rights. They are 
therefore being implemented through various programmes such as human rights training and 
education; harmonization of national legislation vis-&#224;-vis the international norms and standards 
acceded to by the Government; and regional and international cooperation for capacity-building. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>339. On the recommendations advocating further ratification of and accession to human rights 
instruments, Indonesia stated that the Government, including through its 436 local committees 
implementing the national action plans, and in close cooperation with members of civil society, 
is increasing efforts to bring together all stakeholders to develop the groundwork for such 
undertakings. This includes efforts to assess the readiness of stakeholders at provincial and 
district levels to implement certain human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>340. In addition to the local committees&#8217; mandate to ensure the conformity of local regulations 
with the ratified core international human rights treaties, Indonesia stated that the Ministry of 
Law and Human Rights is working in close collaboration with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
Both institutions have issued a circular letter and guidelines on the harmonization of local laws 
with human rights standards. As a result, efforts are being undertaken consistently and 
systematically to bring local legislation and regulations in full conformity with universal human 
rights norms and standards.  
</p>
<p>341. Indonesia addressed the recommendations that it took note of during the dialogue last 
April. On the question of Ahmadiyah, it was stressed that freedom of religion and the practices 
linked to individual belief are guaranteed under the Constitution. Articles 28 E, 28 I and 29 of 
the Constitution state that the exercise of freedom of religion cannot be limited otherwise than by 
law. Moreover, legal guarantees in respect of freedom of religion and religious practice are also 
stipulated in various laws, specifically Law No. 39 of 1999 on human rights. Indonesia stated 
that, on the one hand, the doctrinal aspect of this particular religious movement has long been 
considered by some communities as deviant. On the other, sporadic acts of violence by a mob 
against members of this group have constituted public disturbance carrying with them 
dimensions of intolerance acts and crimes punishable by law. 
</p>
<p>342. On the doctrinal aspect of this movement, Indonesia noted that in recent years the 
phenomenon has created social tension in many communities in the country, which the 
Government is endeavouring to resolve through dialogue, such as having held a series of 
dialogues with the leaders of Ahmadiyah on issues such as the protection of their followers. 
Indonesia stated that it also continues to promote dialogue between Ahmadiyah and various 
related groups in order to enhance mutual understanding and respect. The second aspect relates 
to law enforcement regarding some intolerance and violent acts against the followers of 
Ahmadiyah. In this regard, the authorities have on all occasions when members of the sect have 
been at risk stepped in for their protection just as it is obliged to ensure the protection of ordinary 
citizens against violence inflicted by other citizens. Indonesia indicated that, following the 
attacks, the perpetrators of the violence were detained for questioning and several were brought 
before the law. While enforcing the law, the Government also takes into account the need to 
address the related social tension and to promote further dialogue among related groups. 
</p>
<p>343. In this regard, Indonesia informed the meeting that it has just issued a specific policy on 
the issue which takes into account the principle of freedom of religion and the observance of 
existing relevant laws and regulations in the country. The policy, which is in the form of a decree 
and was announced today, contains among others the following elements: it does not outlaw the 
belief, but orders its followers to halt their proselytization (<i>Syi&#8217;ar</i>) activities and to fully respect 
the existing laws and regulations; it appeals to the Ahmadiyah followers to return to the Islamic 
mainstream and at the same time appeals to the others to refrain from violent acts against them. 
The issuance of such a decree is never meant to be an intervention of the State in people&#8217;s </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion. It is merely an effort by the Government to uphold law and public order and 
the protection of the followers of Ahmadiyah from criminal attack. In other words, the 
Government limits its role to the levels of maintaining law and order and the protection of 
citizens. It does not interfere with religious doctrines or limit religious freedom. 
</p>
<p>344. With regard to the recommendation to abolish the death penalty, Indonesia maintained that 
the issue is linked to the national legal system which unquestionably falls under the sovereign 
jurisdiction of individual member states. The death penalty remains part of Indonesia&#8217;s positive 
law, namely the Indonesian Penal Code. The provision related to capital punishment was 
retained by decisions democratically taken through a parliamentary process. The issue has also 
been the subject of various public debates, and only last year was brought to the Constitutional 
Court for review, which decided that the application of the death penalty remains fully 
compatible with the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>345. Indonesia stated, however, that its belief is that the death penalty should be applied in a 
very selective and limited manner and only for very serious crimes. The fullest legal precautions 
must be applied exhaustively and the strictest criteria observed throughout the judicial process 
leading to a possible application of the death sentence. Indonesia stated that it supports any 
efforts to strengthen safeguards to prevent miscarriages of justice.  
</p><p>346. Indonesia stated that it attaches great importance to establishing cooperation with 
international human rights mechanisms, including special procedures, which may take various 
forms, of which country visit invitations are only one. Indonesia expressed its view that a 
country visit serves as an important tool for the special procedures to perform their task 
effectively, and may answer the need of certain member states in seeking expert advice to assist 
efforts. In this regard, the decision of a State as to when and what specific special procedure 
should be invited for a country visit will be dictated by its own needs and priorities.  
</p>
<p>347. Indonesia informed the Council that since 1991, it has received 11 different special 
procedure mandate holders for the purposes of a country visit as well as a number of other 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, as well as visits by the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, comparable to those countries which have extended standing invitations. In the 
11 months between December 2006 and November 2007, it has consecutively received three 
special procedures, namely the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and a second 
visit by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture. Hence, Indonesia was of the view that 
cooperation of countries with the special procedures mechanisms should not be based on or 
measured merely by extending standing invitations but rather on the assessment of the added 
value derived from such a visit to meet the needs and priorities of the country concerned. 
</p>
<p>348. Indonesia added that the voluntary pledges and commitments offered by a country are an 
important feature of the promotion and protection of human rights, since they are made based on 
the measured abilities and resources available in that country. In this context, Indonesia stated 
that it places a high value on the universal periodic review as a breakthrough mechanism. It 
offered its voluntary commitment to disseminate information on the review process in Indonesia 
through the involvement of civil society and national human rights institutions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>349. Indonesia addressed some of the issues raised during the Working Group last April. It 
concurred that there is a need to provide additional human rights training for military and law 
enforcement officials, including the police and local judges. In this regard, Indonesia expressed 
its thanks for the generous assistance offered by the international community. In addition to 
various assistance programmes from regional and multilateral organizations, more countries are 
engaging with Indonesia in a format of bilateral human rights dialogue. Thus far, Indonesia has 
established such dialogues with Canada, Norway, Sweden and Japan, and indicated that it is 
considering extending bilateral dialogues to other Governments. Most of this dialogue has 
resulted in the creation of various training and educational programmes for Indonesian law 
enforcement, including security officers. In line with the pillar of its National Action Plan on 
human rights education and dissemination, a particular division in the Ministry of Law and 
Human Rights has been established to ensure an enhanced and comprehensive approach of its 
human rights education and dissemination programmes throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>350. With regard to the issue of combating trafficking in persons, pursuant to Law No. 21 
of 2007, Indonesia stated that the police has increased efforts to take preventive measures, 
including: community policing, public campaigns and border control; legal protection through 
joint investigations and legal assistance for victims; rehabilitation and reintegration measures 
available through an integrated services centre and a harmonized procedure; capacity-building 
measures through training for law enforcement officers. This is conducted in close cooperation 
and coordination with international and regional organizations and donor countries. Currently, 
efforts are more focused on preventive and victim-perspective measures; however, the rising 
number of cases of trafficking in persons being brought before the courts is evidence of the 
increasing steps to criminalize this heinous act and punish the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>351. As regards the participation of women in politics, Indonesia stated that after the adoption 
of Law No. 2 of 2008 on Political Parties, various measures were underway to ensure its 
effective implementation, in anticipation of the general elections in 2009. These include 
workshops on the formulation of the Provincial Strategic Plan; training for women on 
awareness-raising on civic education at the provincial level; political education and guidance for 
potential women candidates in the general elections of 2009; and public or interactive dialogue 
with community, traditional and religious leaders, political parties and civil societies in order to 
create a conducive atmosphere to enable the prescribed 30 per cent representation of women at 
all levels of the decision-making process. 
</p>
<p>352. Addressing human rights abuses is another urgent issue of priority to the Government. The 
adoption of relevant legislation such as Law No. 22 of 2002 on Child Protection; Law No. 23 
of 2004 on Domestic Violence; and Law No. 21 of 2007 on Combating Trafficking in Persons 
are examples of Indonesia&#8217;s considerable efforts to address human rights abuses, with further 
challenges expected in their effective implementation. In this context, Indonesia recognized the 
need for a continued reform process of the judiciary, including enhancing the capacity of its 
human resources. 
</p>
<p>353. Indonesia stressed that the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission plays an 
important and active role in addressing violations of human rights. As part of its mandate, the 
Commission has the task of undertaking &#8220;pro-justicia&#8221; investigations of serious human rights 
violations. Created by Presidential Decree in 1993, it has been strengthened by subsequent 
legislation which also ensures its independence. It has regional offices in various parts of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Indonesia and by law is one of the most powerful commissions in the world. In addition, the 
Commission has established cooperation with various countries and received assistance from 
many donors. 
</p>
<p>354. Working closely with the Constitutional Commission and the various non-governmental 
organizations, Indonesia is undertaking a judicial review of Law No. 27 of 2004 on the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission. Given the importance of an inclusive and fully participatory 
approach, intensive socialization and consultation on this process are currently<b> </b>under way. 
Indonesia also informed the meeting of efforts to revise Law No. 39 of 1999 on Human Rights 
and Law No. 26 of 2000 on the Human Rights Court, with a view to strengthening the judicial 
process in addressing human rights violations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>355. Indonesia stated that while it is aware of the long process involved in the comprehensive 
revision of the Penal Code, the Government is currently considering the amendment of 
article 351 of the Code on ill-treatment. In particular, this amendment will bring the formulation 
of the Code to cover the crime of torture as defined in the Convention against Torture, an 
instrument to which Indonesia is a party.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>356. Indonesia stated that most of the points raised by other stakeholders were sufficiently 
addressed in its statement. Indonesia responded to the criticism levelled at the Government by 
the Komnas-HAM. As already stated, its legal foundation makes it one of the strongest 
commissions. While acknowledging that it is funded by the State budget, the Commission has 
never been prevented from criticizing the Government in any forum, including in this Council.  
</p>
<p>357. Concerning the criticism on the way the Government has handled the issue of Ahmadiyah, 
Indonesia reiterated that it has never interfered in interpreting religious doctrine or limiting 
religious freedom in the country. The Ahmadiyah issue is not simply a question of freedom of 
religion. Extra caution is needed since this issue is highly sensitive and involves dual aspects. On 
the one hand, the Government is responsible for promoting a harmonious life among religions 
and their believers. On the other hand, the Government is mandated to uphold law and order, and 
committed to eradicate extremism and radicalism.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>358. Algeria commended Indonesia on its cooperation and commitment to promote and protect 
human rights and address the complex challenges it faces in this respect. Algeria thanked 
Indonesia for its transparent participation and genuine dialogue, which shows its commitment to 
progress in its human rights obligations. It is a responsibility to create a conducive atmosphere to 
support the Government in doing so. Indonesia&#8217;s willingness to accept the universal periodic 
review recommendations based on the mutually reinforcing recommendations of treaty bodies, 
special procedures and civil society contribute to the effectiveness of the universal periodic 
review. Algeria noted Indonesia&#8217;s acknowledgement of the need to continue human right training 
and education for security and law enforcement officials as well as the ongoing efforts to protect 
women and children. In line with the National Plan of Action, Algeria commended Indonesia on 
its willingness to work towards acceding to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on involvement of children in armed conflict, for empowering a vibrant civil 
society, for involving national human rights institutions in the ongoing consultation and for 
involving the civil society in this process until the next universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>359. Tunisia congratulated Indonesia for the determination it showed in the promotion and 
protection of all human rights and for the measures taken to follow up on recommendations of 
the Working Group, as well as for identifying challenges in the promotion and protection of 
human rights. It encouraged Indonesia to follow up on its efforts to promote and protect human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>360. Qatar noted the cooperation and measures taken to promote and protect human rights. In 
the midst of the ongoing reform process, Qatar greatly appreciates Indonesia&#8217;s commitment to 
continue its efforts in the field of human rights and to face the complex challenges. In line with 
the objectives of the universal periodic review and General Assembly resolution 60/251, there is 
a collective responsibility to support Indonesia&#8217;s efforts to fulfil its commitments. The 
recommendations of the Working Group supplement the recommendations made by the treaty 
bodies. Qatar encouraged Indonesia to continue to search for proper means to implement the 
recommendations and focus on education and training in human rights, particularly for law 
enforcement officials, as well as its efforts to protect rights of women and children. Qatar further 
called on all to provide appropriate assistance to Indonesia to implement recommendations of the 
Working Group.  
</p>
<p>361. Pakistan noted that the reform process has brought many important and commendable 
changes in the human rights structure, and that the challenges are complex but the determination 
of Indonesia to fight them is noteworthy. The universal periodic review mechanism envisages a 
comprehensive and collaborative approach to dealing with individual human rights situations, 
and Indonesia should be encouraged to implement its human rights obligations taking into 
account the recommendations of treaty bodies and special procedures. Pakistan noted that it is 
important that security and law enforcement officials receive training in human rights law and 
the implementation of human rights standards, particularly relating to the protection of women 
and children. Pakistan appreciates the acknowledgement of challenges and resolves to overcome 
them. It will continue to deepen its bilateral cooperation with Indonesia. 
</p>
<p>362. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed its appreciation to Indonesia for the commitment to 
further progress in its efforts to promote and protect human rights and to address its complex 
challenges. It also commended Indonesia on its strong commitment and positive approach to the 
universal periodic review, and noted the common responsibility to create a conducive 
atmosphere to support the Government&#8217;s endeavours to continue progressing towards the 
implementation of its human rights obligations. There was a need to focus on continued human 
rights training and education for, inter alia, security and law enforcement officials as well as on 
ongoing efforts to protect women and children. 
</p>
<p>363. Bahrain welcomed positive steps taken by Indonesia within the reform process, which 
reflects its unceasing efforts to promote and protect human rights. The universal periodic review 
must be cooperative, aimed at enabling the State under review to promote and protect human 
rights in a better way. Bahrain noted the common responsibility to create an enabling  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>environment aimed at progress. Bahrain noted that recommendations included the need or 
training and education in the field of human rights and commended Indonesia on its efforts 
regarding women and children. Bahrain also appreciated the transparent and open method in 
expressing continuing challenges. 
</p>
<p>364. The universal periodic review process has enabled Cuba to learn first-hand from the 
experience and challenges of Indonesia and appreciates the additional information provided at 
the present meeting. In order to correctly assess results achieved, it is necessary to take into 
account the specific situation of the country. Indonesia is a developing country which must deal 
with challenges in terms of resources. The efforts developed in this context are thus even more 
worthwhile. Indonesia has implemented its national plan of action, and highlighted the priority 
given to eradicate poverty and the promotion and protection of the rights of women and children. 
Cuba noted the substantial progress made regarding civil and political rights, especially 
regarding strengthening democracy, as well as economic, social and cultural rights, regarding 
particularly education and employment. Indonesia&#8217;s performance shows the importance of 
protecting the human rights of its people, which should be applauded. Indonesia has shown 
political determination.  
</p>
<p>365. The Syrian Arab Republic has listened with interest about the steps taken regarding the 
recommendations made to promote and strengthen human rights in the framework of the 
universal periodic review. Important steps have been taken in promoting and strengthening all 
human rights while preserving the specificities of cultural diversity and religious tolerance, and 
the Syrian Arab Republic commended Indonesia on these steps, which should not go unnoticed.  
</p>
<p>366. Azerbaijan noted that the reform process is still ongoing, and expressed appreciation for 
the commitment of Indonesia to further progress in making efforts to promote and protect human 
rights and to address its challenges. It also took due note of consultations conducted with 
representatives of civil society and national institutions, and was encouraged by continued efforts 
to publicly disseminate and discuss the universal periodic review and the national report with 
representatives of civil society at the local level in the provinces. Azerbaijan shared the need to 
focus on the inclusion of the crime of torture in the new draft criminal code, the continued 
human rights training and education for security and law enforcement officials, as well as 
measures directed towards protecting women and children.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>367. The Indonesian National Human Rights Commission welcomed the conclusions and 
recommendations of the Working Group on the importance of strengthening the national human 
rights institution. It noted that the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination observed the insufficient impartiality and independence 
of Komnas HAM, as also mentioned during the review process. Komnas HAM recommended 
that this should include an effort to guarantee its impartiality and independence and appreciated 
that many fundamental human rights issues were raised during the review process, including the 
issue of protecting religious minorities. Komnas HAM was of the view that all regulations that 
are not in line with the Constitution should be removed or amended. It further welcomed the 
conclusion or recommendation reaffirming Indonesia&#8217;s commitment to combat impunity and 
encouraging it to continue its efforts to combat impunity. In its view, combating impunity should 
become a voluntary commitment of Indonesia.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>368. Franciscans International, also on behalf of Pax Romana and Dominicans for Justice and 
Peace (Order of Preachers), wished to acknowledge the questions raised by various States on the 
situation of human rights in West Papua, noting however that these questions remained 
unanswered and that any specific mention of West Papua was avoided in the recommendations. 
The organizations further encouraged Indonesia: to follow-up on the recommendation to issue a 
standing invitation to all special procedures, including to visit West Papua; to urgently ratify the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture; to prosecute without delay those 
responsible for gross human rights violations in Timor-Leste, in particular those who currently 
operate in Aceh and in West Papua; and welcomed Indonesia&#8217;s renewed commitment to adopting 
a definition of torture in the Criminal Code in accordance with the Convention against Torture. 
The organizations further noted that the universal periodic review has indicated to Indonesia the 
way to fully comply with human rights treaty standards. Indonesia must engage in a frank and 
open dialogue in order to address all outstanding human rights concerns, particularly in 
West Papua. 
</p>
<p>369. In a joint statement, the<b> </b>International NGO Forum on Indonesian Development and 
Pax Romana<b> </b>expressed appreciation for the universal periodic review process, noting that several 
important issues had been raised during the dialogue, while others were not adequately addressed 
by the Indonesian delegation. With regard to the voluntary commitments made by Indonesia, 
they regretted that Indonesia had only made one commitment to continue the socialization of the 
universal periodic review in cooperation with civil society and Komnas HAM. They also 
welcomed the recommendations made during the review which would be implemented by 
Indonesia to further the protection of human rights in the country. They expressed their 
appreciation to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for having accepted the request to facilitate a 
dialogue between the Coalition of Indonesian Human Rights NGOs and various State agencies 
on the report of the universal periodic review on Indonesia, which was held in Jakarta on 
26 May 2008 and led to the agreement to make the following two additional voluntary 
commitments: to incorporate a definition of torture into the Indonesian Criminal Code in 
accordance with the Convention against Torture; and to combat impunity by improving the legal 
and institutional framework in order to have a credible Human Rights Court and Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission to bring justice to the victims of human rights violations. They had 
hoped that these additional voluntary commitments would be adopted during the plenary session.  
</p>
<p>370. The<b> </b>Asian Legal Resource Centre welcomed the acknowledgement of many of the serious 
human rights concerns in Indonesia, including the need for the criminalization of torture. 
However, it regretted the lack of any clear agreement by the Government to take decisive, timely 
action concerning this issue and further regretted the lack of a commitment by the Government 
to address the problems of impunity and the ongoing violations in Papua as a result of the 
universal periodic review process. The Asian Legal Resource Centre welcomed Indonesia&#8217;s offer 
to include criminal investigation units from the national police in future delegations to the 
Council and treaty body sessions. It also expressed concern about claims in the report of the 
Working Group that Komnas HAM is an independent body. Concerning the outcomes on Papua, 
the Government had claimed an improvement in the situation of its indigenous people, but the 
organization noted that civil society reports from Papua starkly contradict this view. The Asian 
Legal Resource Centre remains seriously concerned about the security of human rights defenders 
and civil society organizers in the region and indicated that human rights remain a taboo in  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Papua and Poso. It indicated that the role of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office in ensuring impunity 
remains a key obstacle in the country and regretted that the universal periodic review failed to 
identify the problem and make recommendations in this regard.  
</p>
<p>371. In a joint statement, the<b> </b>World Organization against Torture and Human Rights First<b> </b>noted 
that the report of the Working Group focuses on plans and institutions, but does not fully address 
their impact. Questions, responses and recommendations failed to note that the effectiveness of 
the National Human Rights Commission has been severely limited in recent years, due in part to 
an impasse with the military and Parliament. The organization further recommended that 
Indonesia take concrete measures to end impunity, such as legislative and executive measures to 
resolve the impasse at the National Human Rights Commission; to assign individual 
responsibility for crimes against humanity in Timor-Leste; to reform the Human Rights Court 
system to ensure prosecution of serious past and present human rights violations; and to revise 
the criminal code to include a clear definition of torture and appropriate penalties.  
</p>
<p>372. Amnesty International welcomed the call made to the Government during the review to 
support and protect human rights defenders in Indonesia. It noted that human rights defenders in 
the province of Papua operate in a climate of fear and that their activities are restricted by a 
heavy presence of security personnel. It called on the Government to guarantee the rights to 
freedom of expression and assembly in Papua and Maluku provinces, and to ensure that the 
police and the military are aware of the legitimate role of human rights defenders and their 
responsibility to protect them. Amnesty International welcomed Indonesia&#8217;s commitment 
reaffirmed during the review to combat impunity, however it noted that despite the creation 
in 2000 of a human rights court to deal with gross human rights violations, the Government has 
failed to bring to justice those responsible for such violations.  
373. On behalf of the<b> </b>Asian Forum for Human Rights and Developments (Forum-Asia) and the 
Indonesian NGO coalition that submitted reports and contributed to the universal periodic review 
process, Forum-Asia expressed their appreciation to all members and observers of the Working 
Group that raised critical comments reflecting the most pressing human rights issues in 
Indonesia. On combating extreme poverty, Forum-Asia noted that the number of Indonesians 
living in extreme poverty has increased significantly in the last few years despite the 
implementation of recent policies. On the protection of minorities, Forum-Asia indicated that the 
Coordinating Body to Monitor Beliefs within Society has become a serious threat to the 
protection of religious minority rights including Ahmadiyah, as it has been accompanied by a 
wave of violent acts by religious extremist groups who have increased attacks against religious 
minorities and supporters of religious pluralism over the last eight months. Forum-Asia further 
noted that it deeply regretted the recent decision of the Indonesian Government to partially ban 
Ahmadiyah activities, as this might become the justification for the religious extremist group to 
attack the Ahmadiyah followers and pro-pluralism group. Finally Forum-Asia encouraged the 
Council and its members to closely monitor the progress made in implementing the 
recommendations, and to develop a concrete and measurable follow-up mechanism to the review 
process.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed on the outcome by the State under  
review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>374. Indonesia stated that most of the points raised by other stakeholders were sufficiently 
addressed in its statement. Indonesia responded to the criticism levelled at the Government by 
the Komnas-HAM. As already stated, its legal foundation makes it one of the strongest 
commissions. While acknowledging that it is funded by the State budget, the Commission has 
never been prevented from criticizing the Government in any forum, including in this Council.  
</p>
<p>375. Concerning the criticism on the way the Government has handled the issue of Ahmadiyah, 
Indonesia reiterated that it has never interfered in interpreting religious doctrine or limiting 
religious freedom in the country. The Ahmadiyah issue is not simply a question of freedom of 
religion. Extra caution is needed since this issue is highly sensitive and involves dual aspects. On 
the one hand, the Government is responsible for promoting a harmonious life amongst religions 
and their believers. On the other hand, the Government is mandated to uphold law and order, and 
committed to eradicate extremism and radicalism.  
</p>
<p>376. In closing, Indonesia extended its gratitude to the members of the Council, observer States 
and other participating stakeholders for their active involvement leading up to the adoption of the 
Working Group report. Indonesia reaffirmed its full support to the universal periodic review 
mechanism and its follow-up process. The exercise is intended to achieve the final objectives of, 
inter alia, the improvement of the situation on the ground and ensuring that the principles of 
universality, interdependence and indivisibility are fully upheld. It also observed that the review 
mechanism so far has been successful in reviewing the obligations, commitments and 
performance of all countries without exception, placing them all on an equal footing. The 
exercise has been a precious opportunity for Indonesia to take stock of its current position in 
human rights fields as well as a chance to test the efficiency of this mechanism. In this regard, 
Indonesia expressed its hope that the genuine dialogue that was shown so far will continue in 
good faith. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>377. Indonesia hoped that the explanations provided would enhance the understanding of the 
complex challenges it faces in its endeavours to promote and protect human rights. In this 
respect, it expressed its sincere appreciation for the comments, observations, and criticisms made 
by the distinguished delegations of member States, observers and the national human rights 
institutions as well as non-governmental organizations. Indonesia valued these inputs, as it 
considers them to be reflections of the common responsibility and the need to witness further 
progress in the promotion and protection of human rights in Indonesia. 
</p>
<p><b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>378. The review of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was held 
on 10 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Council 
resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the national report submitted by the 
United Kingdom in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/1/GBR/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/GBR/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/GBR/3). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>379. At its 15th meeting, on 10 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on the United Kingdom (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>380. The outcome of the review on the United Kingdom is constituted of the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/25), together with the views of the 
United Kingdom concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the 
Working Group (see also A/HRC/8/25/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>381. The representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland referred 
the meeting to the document reflecting its response to the recommendations made to the 
United Kingdom during its universal periodic review on 10 April 2008 and stated that they are 
also available on the Council extranet. This document is available under symbol 
A/HRC/8/25/Add.1. 
</p>
<p>382. The United Kingdom stated that it gave serious consideration to every recommendation 
and considered whether acceptance would improve and extend the delivery of human rights in 
the United Kingdom and in its Overseas Territories. 
</p>
<p>383. The United Kingdom stated that it accepts the great majority of the recommendations 
either in full or in part, and explained the reasons for not having accepted some of the 
recommendations, which were a minority of them. It acknowledged that while development of 
human rights is seldom an easy or straightforward option for Governments, it believed this 
endeavour to be a vital test for good government. 
</p>
<p>384. After stating its view that the universal periodic review offers a genuine opportunity for 
States to take a serious, self-critical look at their own human rights situation, it expressed its 
appreciation for the positive and supportive response received from other States, and thanked the 
President of the Council, the members of the troika, civil society and United Nations 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of  
the Council on the review outcome  
</b></p>
<p>385. Algeria thanked the United Kingdom for accepting to address the high incarceration rate of 
children, while it encouraged the United Kingdom to review more thoroughly the painful 
techniques applied to children and to harmonize them with their human rights obligations. It 
thanked the United Kingdom for acknowledging that legislation on freedom of expression and 
opinion should be in harmony with human rights obligations and for agreeing that pretrial 
detention should never be excessive. It noted that the claim that the Counter-Terrorism Bill 
allowing for pre-charge detention of over 40 days in the United Kingdom is hard to reconcile 
with the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s recent upbraiding of Algeria for increasing pretrial 
detention from 9 to 12 days. It regretted that no action is taken to accede to the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Families, and that there was no acceptance of access to prisons by the International Committee 
of the Red Cross. It commended the United Kingdom on accepting to comply fully with its 
obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention 
against Torture, while it affirmed that the United Kingdom is under an obligation to extend these 
instruments to all overseas territories under the United Kingdom&#8217;s control. 
</p>
<p>386. Nigeria congratulated the United Kingdom on its constructive spirit towards the universal 
periodic review, which it deemed worthy of emulation. Nigeria further welcomed the fact that 
the United Kingdom recognizes that economic, social and cultural rights are as important as civil 
and political rights, and that they are interdependent and indivisible. 
</p>
<p>387. Pakistan took note of the fact that the United Kingdom decided not to respond during the 
review to any of the recommendations made and welcomed the comprehensive responses to 
these recommendations. Pakistan noted the statement made by the United Kingdom as regards 
the review process, which should be taken as a tool for critical and constructive self-analysis. In 
this regard, Pakistan noted that the United Kingdom&#8217;s willingness to accept most of the 
recommendations indicates that it is prepared to accept the challenge of implementation of 
relevant conclusions and recommendations, which are consistent with its national priorities and 
the set of accepted norms. Pakistan noted that the number of recommendations not accepted has 
found some explanation, which reflects the understandable divergence of views on issues which 
are, nevertheless, important. Pakistan expressed the hope that the United Kingdom will continue 
to intensify its efforts to harmonize and implement some of its recently enacted laws with 
international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>388. The Russian Federation noted with satisfaction that all the recommendations it made had 
been accepted by the United Kingdom, which had also provided quite detailed answers on 
substantive matters. The way in which the review took place on the United Kingdom and the 
written answers received, yet again clearly asserted the fact that there are no ideal countries from 
the point of view of the observance of human rights. It noted that the United Kingdom is one of 
the oldest democracies, and that it is today confronted with a whole series of new challenges 
such as, for example, the fight against the terrorist threat; that it is not always possible to manage 
in respect of the highest human rights standards. It noted that the capacity to acknowledge 
existing problems and to adopt steps to eliminate these is one of the preconditions for 
advancement of the common goals of the universal and comprehensive promotion and protection 
of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>389. The International Save the Children Alliance called on the United Kingdom to establish 
adequate institutional frameworks for the promotion and protection of children&#8217;s rights. It stated 
that the United Kingdom must withdraw its reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child as it is clear that its general reservation concerning immigration and citizenship is against 
the object and purpose of the Convention. It welcomed the Government&#8217;s current review and 
urged it to remove the general reservation as soon as possible. It stated that the United Kingdom 
must introduce with urgency clear and non-equivocal legislation which fully prohibits physical 
punishment in the home, the International Save the Children Alliance also stated that the  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Government must fully protect asylum-seeking children and separated children who need a 
guardian so that they receive the support they require. The detention of children with their 
families in immigration removal centres continues. It added that the juvenile justice systems 
continue to violate standards of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the age of criminal 
responsibility is much too low, custody is not used as a last resort, and anti-social behaviour 
legislation allows children to be named and shamed in public despite the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child urging the Government to ensure that it respect the privacy of children in 
trouble with the law. Finally, it strongly urged the Government to accept all recommendations 
made in the course of its review and to commit to implement them urgently. The 
United Kingdom should also organize regular follow-up meetings between non-governmental 
organizations and all relevant Government departments, and report annually to the Council on 
progress being made. 
</p>
<p>390. Amnesty International welcomed many of the recommendations made by States to the 
United Kingdom, including the call to review all counter-terrorism legislation to ensure that it 
complies with the highest human rights standards; to reduce, rather than extend still further, the 
maximum period of pre-charge detention for terrorism suspects; and to recognize that all persons 
arrested or detained by United Kingdom armed forces, wherever and whenever that may be, 
should be entitled to the full protection of the human rights instruments to which the 
United Kingdom is a party. Given the prominence of the issue of counter-terrorism in the 
interactive dialogue, Amnesty International noted with surprise that recommendations did not 
specifically refer to the United Kingdom&#8217;s reliance on so-called &#8220;diplomatic assurances&#8221; to 
facilitate the return of individuals to States where they face the risk of grave human rights 
violations, including torture or other ill-treatment. Amnesty International expressed the belief 
that the use of such assurances undermines the absolute prohibition of torture and had urged the 
United Kingdom and others not to rely on such assurances. Amnesty International called on the 
United Kingdom to carry out effective, independent and impartial investigations into incidents 
where the actions of the police and other State agents may have led to violations of the right to 
life or of the right to be free from torture and other ill treatment. Amnesty International urged the 
United Kingdom to commit to repealing the Inquiries Act 2005 and to creating, in its place, a 
genuinely independent mechanism for judicial inquiries into serious allegations of human rights 
violations. 
</p>
<p>391. The Islamic Human Rights Commission congratulated the Council on the conclusions and 
recommendations forwarded, which reflected also many of its concerns. It expressed deep 
concern with the ever-increasing time of pre-charge and pretrial detention, which it had raised 
several times in consultations with the Government. It was especially concerned since the next 
day the bill increasing pre-charge detention from 28 to 42 days would be put to Parliament. It 
stated that the need for this has never been identified, and noted that Britain has the longest 
pre-charge detention limit in a liberal democracy. It urged the Government to refrain from this 
unnecessary damaging policy, and also recommended reviewing the anti-terrorism law in the 
light of the highest human rights standards. It expressed concern about the implementation of 
anti-terror laws which has resulted in racism and religious profiling, which, it noted, is evidently 
disproportional in the stop and search statistics. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed by the State under review on  
the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>392. In closing, the representative of the United Kingdom stated that the delegation would 
reflect comments made during the meeting back to colleagues in the capital. On the issue of 
pretrial detention, the Council was referred to the document circulated which provides detailed 
responses to concerns, and the representative reiterated that the proposal regarding pretrial 
detention is the subject of significant public and parliamentary debate. The proposal to move to 
42 days is a reserve power, only to be used in specific circumstances set out in the legislation. 
The power is temporary and detention is subject to stringent judicial safeguards, including the 
approval of a judge, at least every seven days. The proposal in the counter-terrorism Bill will 
enable the limit to be extended if there is a clear operational need to do so because of a grave 
exceptional terrorist threat to the United Kingdom. The representative also thanked Nigeria for 
acknowledging the United Kingdom&#8217;s position that it considers economic, social and cultural 
rights to be as important as civil and political rights, and that all rights are mutually 
interdependent and interrelated. In response to Pakistan&#8217;s reference to paragraph 23 of the report 
of the Working Group, he stated that the response of the Minister can be found in paragraph 25 
of the same report. Regarding the intervention of the Russian Federation, the Minister had made 
it clear during the review that it is necessary to protect public safety and national security, while 
stressing the need to ensure full respect for human rights. Finally, the representative of the 
United Kingdom thanked the representatives of civil society who had taken the floor during the 
meeting, and re-affirmed commitment to civil society participation in the follow-up process. 
</p>
<p><b>India 
</b></p>
<p>393. The review of India was held on 10 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by India in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/IND/1 and Corr.1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/IND/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/IND/3). 
</p>
<p>394. At its 15th meeting, on 10 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on India (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>395. The outcome of the review on India is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/26), together with the views of India concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/8/26/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>396. The Head of Delegation and Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations 
Office at Geneva stated that the present deliberations will conclude the first phase of a very 
productive process which India embarked upon with the preparation of its national report some </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>six months ago. He explained that during the interactive dialogue of the universal periodic 
review of India, which was held on 10 April 2008, the Indian delegation, at that time, had been 
constituted in keeping with the importance of the occasion as well as the broad range of issues 
that were likely to come up given the diversity and size of India. The delegation included the 
Solicitor General of India and representatives from a number of relevant ministries and 
departments. He stated that the interactive dialogue was very rich and productive and witnessed 
the participation of a large number of States members and observers of the Council. India had 
tremendously benefited from that process by learning how its efforts for the realization of human 
rights for its people were viewed and assessed by the international community. It was indeed a 
matter of great satisfaction that there was a clear and positive recognition of India&#8217;s efforts and 
that many of the initiatives it had launched were viewed as example of best practices. 
</p>
<p>397. He stated that a number of recommendations were made by delegations during the 
interactive dialogue, which were recorded in the report of the Working Group. India had 
carefully examined these recommendations in consultation with the concerned ministries and 
departments. It also examined them with an open mind to constructively assess how their 
acceptance and implementation could contribute positively to India&#8217;s efforts to secure human 
rights for its people. The Head of Delegation referred to the written response of India 
(A/HRC/8/26/Add.1), which indicates India&#8217;s position on these recommendations, while 
accepting a majority of them. 
</p><p>398. The Head of Delegation stated that while the universal periodic review was primarily an 
intergovernmental process, it had been designed to facilitate the effective participation of 
non-governmental organizations and national institutions. He added that these other stakeholders 
have thus far participated in the universal periodic review of India in an indirect manner and 
looked forward to listening to their views on the outcome, which will receive India&#8217;s due 
consideration. 
</p>
<p>399. India looked at the universal periodic review as a continuous process and not a one-time 
exercise. The present deliberations marked the conclusion of the first phase of its work and the 
commencement of the second phase, during which India will pursue the implementation of 
recommendations that it had accepted here. The Head of Delegation stated that the commitment 
of India is not limited to these recommendations. India&#8217;s vibrant democratic polity required it to 
continuously pursue higher norms and standards, in the area of human rights as well as 
development. The delegation was confident that India will have significant progress to report in 
its pursuit of human rights at the time of its next review. 
</p>
<p>400. He also conveyed the delegation&#8217;s appreciation to the troika members, the representatives 
of Ghana, Indonesia and the Netherlands, for their constructive approach in the preparation of 
the report of the Working Group on the review of India and thanked OHCHR for its excellent 
organization of and support to this process. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed on the outcome by States members  
and observers of the Council 
</b></p>
<p>401. Nigeria congratulated India for being one of the pioneer set of States to undergo the 
universal periodic review and commended it on the efforts and the positive developments 
recorded since its review was conducted. Nigeria underlined that India, as the world&#8217;s largest </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>democracy, with a multicultural, multi-ethnic and multilingual population, should be 
commended on its efforts at achieving remarkable success in guaranteeing human rights and civil 
liberties for its citizens. It commended the Indian Government on its deliberate policy to strike a 
much needed balance between the human rights agenda and development issues and expressed 
hope that the universal periodic review will afford India an opportunity to periodically review 
the implementation of its human rights obligations for the benefit of all its citizens. 
</p>
<p>402. The Netherlands, highlighting its role as a troika member during the review of India, 
congratulated India on the professional way in which it conducted its review. The Netherlands 
expressed gratitude for its responses during the session and suggested that India, before the next 
review in four years time, voluntarily undertake to inform the Council on the progress made on 
the recommendations agreed to during the Working Group as well as, where appropriate, 
developments regarding the recommendations that it did not agreed to, or could not yet agree to, 
as is the case for recommendations Nos. 7 and 9 and the signing of Conventions Nos. 138 
concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and 182 concerning the Prohibition 
and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour of the 
International Labour Organization, as well as regarding the reservation to article 32 to the 
Convention of the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>403. The United Arab Emirates welcomed the adoption by the Government of India of the 
conclusions and recommendations made during the review. It commended India on allowing 
national civil society to participate in the follow-up to these conclusions and recommendations, 
which shows India&#8217;s spirit of democracy and transparency. It also commended India on its 
decision to ratify a number of human rights treaties and its openness to international monitoring 
and to recommendations made by agencies in the field of human rights, in particular regarding 
the rights of women and children. The United Arab Emirates also noted that India is a vast and 
multicultural country, which may constitute a challenge for the promotion of human rights. It 
called on the Council to appreciate all the efforts made by India to preserve its deep-rooted 
democracy, eradicate poverty, improve economic and social circumstances and further promote 
education and development. The United Arab Emirates hoped that India will find all the 
necessary support and assistance from the Council to implement all the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>404. Qatar expressed its appreciation for India&#8217;s cooperation with the Council and the steps 
taken for the promotion of all human rights and for the implementation of the recommendations, 
in spite of the challenges faced. Qatar stated that India, after accepting most of the 
recommendations presented by the Working Group, has taken measures aiming at signing and 
ratifying some international instruments. It has accepted to implement article 16 of Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and of the Optional Protocol 
thereto. India is one of the first signatories of the Convention on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance and is determined to ratify it. It is working on the elaboration of a 
national plan of action on human rights, in particular in relation to the rights of women and 
children, and on the ratification of the Convention against Torture and the International Labour 
Organization Conventions Nos. 138 and 182. This series of reforms demonstrates the 
commitment of India to all human rights. Qatar reiterated its appreciation for the achievements 
accomplished and called on India to continue the reform process for the benefit of all its citizens. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>405. China thanked the Indian delegation for the seriousness of its responses to the outcome of 
the review, which fully demonstrates the importance it attaches to the universal periodic review 
mechanism. It congratulated India for the rapid economic growth achieved over recent years 
which has improved the livelihood of its people. India has not only established a comprehensive 
national system for the protection of human rights, but also adopted effective measures to 
promote human rights and respond to various challenges. China appreciated the special measures 
adopted to protect minorities and all vulnerable groups. It believed that India will, in the light of 
its national circumstances, take into consideration and follow up on the recommendations put 
forward in an open and constructive manner. It was also convinced that in four years time, India 
will have achieved more progress in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>406. Sri Lanka appreciated the exemplary manner in which India subjected itself to the 
universal periodic review and commended it on the open, frank, constructive and practical 
approach it has adopted in responding to the recommendations made during the session of the 
Working Group. It noted that during the review, India&#8217;s numerous efforts and initiatives in the 
field of human rights were recognized as examples of best practices by many delegations. 
Sri Lanka appreciated India&#8217;s responses to recommendations Nos. 8 and 10 made by Mauritius 
and Algeria, and looked forward to learning more from India&#8217;s experience. Sri Lanka shared 
India&#8217;s view that the lack of adequate resources and insufficient national capacity in developing 
countries&#8217; handicap and the ability of the State to secure the full enjoyment of civil and political 
rights. Despite challenges and constraints, India&#8217;s commitment and achievement in nurturing a 
diverse and multifaceted society is a model. 
</p>
<p>407. Morocco thanked the delegation for the clear presentation of the measures taken to 
implement the recommendations of the Working Group, which demonstrates India&#8217;s 
commitment to human rights and to the strengthening of the Council and its new mechanism. 
India continues to be a model of a living, dynamic and tolerant democracy. The work 
accomplished in the field of economic and social development and human rights is noticeable 
despite objective difficulties. Morocco particularly appreciated that India has adopted a national 
plan of action for human rights education, and encouraged it to continue its sustained interaction 
with the Council and its mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>408. Ghana commended India on its cooperation and openness during the review process. As a 
member of the troika for India&#8217;s report, it noted the seriousness with which India undertook the 
exercise, which reflects India&#8217;s commitment to human rights. Ghana believed that the final report 
and the various recommendations which have been accepted will contribute further to the 
strengthening of the protection and promotion of human right son the ground. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>409. The National Human Rights Commission of India highlighted its role in advocating the 
effective participation of national human rights institutions in the Council, which resulted in 
Council resolution 5/1. The Commission stressed that it is in constant dialogue with the 
Government on this issue, and explained its role as an independent mechanism to monitor 
reported cases of torture in custody and the manner in which custodial deaths are dealt with. It 
also underlined its role in advocating the right to education. On the progressive implementation 
of children&#8217;s rights and the elimination of child labour, it was highlighted that despite India&#8217;s 
non-ratification of International Labour Organization Conventions Nos. 138 and 182, the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>concerned Government department has committed to their gradual implementation. It also noted 
its contribution in the fight against discrimination of socially backward and other vulnerable 
sectors of the population, such as women and disabled persons. 
</p>
<p>410. The International Movement against Discrimination and All Forms of Racism, Lutheran 
World Federation, Pax Romana and the Commission of the Churches of International Affairs of 
the World Council of Churches, in a joint statement,<b> </b>noted the recommendations made by a 
number of States in the outcome report, which addressed the issue of caste-based discrimination, 
giving a strong message to India about the international concern at the persistence of this form of 
discrimination affecting more than 167 million Dalits daily. They welcomed India&#8217;s acceptance 
to take into account the recommendations made by treaty bodies and special procedures in 
developing its national action plan for human rights. They looked forward to the inclusion in this 
plan of measures to combat severe violations of Dalit rights and for the expansion and 
improvement of existing statistics on scheduled castes. An appeal was made to the Indian 
Government to effectively utilize the universal periodic review and its follow-up to strengthen 
human rights education initiatives, especially to address gender-based discrimination and to 
respond to the concerns of the Council regarding caste based discrimination. 
</p>
<p>411. Action Canada for Population and Development, the Federation for Women and Family 
Planning and the Latin American Committee for the Defence of Women Rights, in a joint 
statement, noted their appreciation for the statement of the Indian Government as reflected in 
paragraph 84 of the Working Group outcome report and welcomed the understanding that it is 
not homosexuality, but homophobia which is a western import. The Indian Government was 
urged to do more on this issue, including by enacting civil rights legislation banning 
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity and repealing section 377 
of the Indian Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>412. The International Human Rights Association of American Minorities<b> </b>referred to 
recommendations made, including that India ratify the International Convention on the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, stating that persons had disappeared in 
territories under India&#8217;s control and mass graves had recently been found in Jammu and 
Kashmir. Noting the relevance of the recommendation that India should immediately receive the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, it stated that persons belonging to minority groups 
were incarcerated on unsubstantiated charges of terrorism. The importance of the issue of 
impunity was also highlighted, in particular with regard to the killings of Muslims in the Gujarat 
massacre in 2002, as well as the call for extending a standing invitation to all special procedures 
in the context of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the North East, and in relation to 
Muslims and Dalits. 
</p>
<p>413. Amnesty International questioned the statement made by India that the National Human 
Rights Commission is as powerful and independent as India&#8217;s Supreme Court, expressed its 
concern about the independence and authority of the Commission since its establishment in 1993 
and following the 2006 amendments to the Protection of Human Rights Act, and called on the 
Government to give the Commission more authority, a broader mandate and adequate resources. 
Amnesty International stated, inter alia, that the Armed Forces Special Powers Act continued to 
grant de facto impunity to members of the armed forces. It called on the Government to commit 
itself to ending impunity for human rights violations by the police and security forces and to 
remove all legislative provisions which might prevent accountability for such violations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>414. The International Islamic Federation of Student Organizations referred to concerns about 
torture, summary executions and minority rights mentioned in the recommendations made for 
India. It highlighted the need to ratify the Convention against Torture and to give the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture access to India to investigate pending complaints. The 
issue of impunity was also stressed, particularly in regard to the killings of Sikhs in 1984 and the 
massacre of Muslims in 2002. 
</p>
<p>415. Interfaith International stated that torture is a prevalent issue in India and is a tool 
frequently used against minorities and low castes in order to extract desired confessions. It stated 
that it will be in order for India to ratify the Convention against Torture as well as to provide the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture with unhindered access to India to investigate 
complaints of torture particularly in the North East of India and the Punjab. Discrimination 
against low castes and the need to recognize casteism as a form of racism were also highlighted 
as issues for India to address. Reference was made to the work of the Government appointed 
committee to investigate the issue of impunity under the Armed Forces Act, which 
recommended the Act&#8217;s abrogation and that this recommendation had not yet been implemented. 
It stated that the issue of impunity was associated with the killings of Sikhs in 1984 and the 
massacre of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002. It recommended that all special procedures pay 
increased attention to these issues. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed on the outcome by the State  
under review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>416. Following concluding remarks were made by India on the outcome of the review. The 
Head of Delegation thanked everyone for their presence and participation as well as for their 
warm expressions of friendship and goodwill for India. India reciprocated those sentiments. 
</p>
<p>417. The delegation had listened carefully to all the statements made, including those by 
non-governmental organizations and the National Human Rights Commission of India. He stated 
that India was encouraged by their active participation in the debate and the fact that many 
non-governmental organizations from India were able to come all the way to Geneva to 
participate in this meeting was reflective of the vibrancy of India&#8217;s civil society. A number of 
issues were raised in those statements. Where issues had already been addressed by India in the 
interactive dialogue, he invited participants to refer to the report of the Working Group and to its 
response to the recommendations made during the interactive dialogue. He proceeded to make 
some general remarks and broad observations on some issues. 
</p>
<p>418. India was conscious of its human rights challenges; no country in the world can claim a 
perfect human rights record and India did not claim to have one. Implementation in a country as 
vast, populous and diverse as India was always a challenging task and there would always be 
some instances resulting in human rights violations. What was important, he said, was to have in 
place an effective institutional framework to address such violations. India&#8217;s democratic polity 
with an independent and impartial judiciary, free and independent press, a vibrant civil society 
and powerful and independent National Human Rights Commission, provided the requisite 
framework for the promotion and protection of human rights. A range of legislative and 
administrative measures had been taken to seek improvement in all aspects of human life. India 
has persevered diligently and would continue to do so; it was a work in progress. India remained 
open to suggestions and advice. In this regard, the delegation had carefully noted the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>observations and suggestions made by participants during the course of the discussion today and 
would give them due consideration with an open mind. However, this would have to be done 
within the parameters set out by the Indian Constitution which was among the most progressive 
in the world. 
</p>
<p>419. The Head of Delegation explained that many of the human rights challenges that India 
faced were rooted in poverty and underdevelopment. India was committed to the realization of 
the right to development of its people and was conscious of the obligations for the State arising 
from it. India sought to pursue this right by providing an environment for inclusive and 
accelerated growth and social progress within the framework of a secular and liberal democracy. 
Through a combination of offering entitlements, ensuring empowerment and stepping up public 
investment, the Government has sought to make the growth process more inclusive. To give a 
new impetus to its efforts for the realization of the right to development for its people, India had 
launched several new and ambitious initiatives in the areas of employment, education, and 
health. Further, in order to ensure that benefits of these schemes reached the people, a major step 
for empowerment of people has been taken through the enactment of the Right to Information 
Act, which was a very strong tool available to the people to ensure accountability of the 
Government. It had led to transparency, accountability and openness in the governmental 
process. 
</p>
<p>420. With reference to some specific issues, he stated that many delegations referred to the issue 
of discrimination against members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes<b> </b>communities. India 
had been deeply conscious of the need to empower the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and 
was fully committed to tackling any discrimination against them at every level. He stated that an 
impressive array of constitutional, legal and administrative measures have been taken to 
empower the traditionally disadvantaged sections of Indian society. 
</p>
<p>421. The Head of Delegation spoke of the need to clarify one misconception often noticed 
among the participants in multilateral forums. It was often suggested that India denied the 
existence of the phenomenon of caste-based discrimination. This was clearly not the case. India 
was deeply conscious of this phenomenon and its Constitution had explicit and elaborate 
provisions to address this issue. He emphasized that there was no discrimination at the level of 
the State. On the contrary, an extensive affirmative action programme had been launched for the 
empowerment of the scheduled castes which was without parallel in its scale and dimension. 
However, when it came to the society as a whole, it was known that changing age old mindsets 
required sustained effort and patient application. India was committed to persevering in its 
efforts for attaining equality for all. It also recognized that action at the level of the Government 
only was not enough and had been engaging constructively with all relevant stakeholders. He 
further clarified that the caste system, which was unique to India, was not racial in origin, and 
therefore, caste based discrimination cannot be considered a form of racial discrimination. This 
was India&#8217;s settled position and not subject to review. 
</p><p>422. As regards the situation of minorities, he stated that &#8220;secularism&#8221; was one of the basic 
features of the Indian Constitution which can not be amended. The Constitution also ensured 
freedom for those who profess to have no religion and scrupulously restrained the State from 
discrimination on the grounds of religion. India was a diverse society which was home to almost 
all major religions of the world with, perhaps, unmatched pluralism and tolerance and it took 
immense pride in that fact. A range of legislative and executive measures had been taken for the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>effective implementation of safeguards provided under the Constitution for the protection of 
interests of minorities. These included a statutory body in the form of a National Commission, 
establishment of a new Ministry of Minority Affairs, as well as the launch of the 
Prime Minister&#8217;s new 15-point programme for the welfare of minorities. 
</p>
<p>423. In conclusion, the Head of Delegation thanked everyone for their participation in and 
contribution to the universal periodic review of India, and that India had immensely benefited 
from this constructive engagement with the Council and considered it a positive experience. 
India was committed to following up on the recommendations emanating from this process in an 
inclusive manner. Its commitment was not limited to these recommendations. India&#8217;s vibrant 
democratic polity required it to continuously pursue higher norms and standards. He stated that 
India looked forward to returning to the Council in the next cycle to report on the progress made 
in its pursuit of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Brazil 
</b></p>
<p>424. The review of Brazil was held on 11 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Brazil in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/BRA/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/BRA/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/BRA/3). 
</p>
<p>425. At its 15th meeting, on 10 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Brazil (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>426. The outcome of the review on Brazil is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/27), together with the views of Brazil concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>427. Brazil expressed its gratitude to the Council and OHCHR. It stated that it was a great 
opportunity to be able to present the human rights situation in its country and the efforts 
undertaken by the Government to promote, protect and guarantee those rights in an environment 
of constructive and frank dialogue. 
</p>
<p>428. Brazil stressed that it was a great honour to be engaged in the whole process leading to the 
adoption of the first final reports of the Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review: the 
institution-building process, the preparation of the national report, its presentation and the 
outcome process. 
</p>
<p>429. Brazil stated that it was pleased to see the successful conclusion of the beginning of the 
first universal periodic review cycle. It was convinced that the implementation of the universal 
periodic review mechanism was deeply connected to the successful outcome of human rights </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>system reform, which was aimed at leaving politicization and selectivity behind. Brazil believed 
strongly that the universal periodic review mechanism constituted an innovative framework to 
deal with human rights defence in a multilateral system. It could serve as a good example to be 
repeated in other United Nations bodies. As the beginning of the first universal periodic review 
cycle was concluding, it was becoming clear that non-selectivity and transparency were the most 
efficient ways to promote true dialogue and to achieve real cooperation among countries. 
</p>
<p>430. The Brazilian delegation, which came to Geneva for the presentation of its national report 
and interactive dialogue, was broad and representative. Brazil stated that most of its members 
had previous experience in civil society activities. The delegation was headed by the 
Under-Secretary of the Special Secretariat for Human Rights, and comprised high-level 
authorities from the Special Secretariat of Policies for Women, the Special Secretariat of 
Promotion of Racial Equality, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Social Development, the 
Ministry of External Relation and the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform. 
</p>
<p>431. During the interactive dialogue, 47 States from all five regional groups commented on the 
national report, asked questions and made recommendations. Brazil stressed that such active 
participation of all States in the universal periodic review process vindicated its 
acknowledgement that, despite all differences, human rights were a common concern for all. 
Brazil regarded the review exercise as a valuable opportunity for international cooperation. 
Brazil reiterated its commitment to take serious account of the recommendations made in the 
report of the Working Group, all of them accepted and acknowledged. 
</p>
<p>432. It recognized that, despite all progress achieved since democratization in Brazil, there were 
still many areas in serious need of improvement, and many issues still had to be addressed before 
human rights could be fully realized. Brazil acknowledged that it faced huge challenges 
concerning, inter alia, the reduction of poverty, the improvement of prison conditions, the 
empowerment of women, the protection of human rights defenders, the eradication of racial 
discrimination, respect for indigenous peoples rights, access to justice, the improvement of 
public security and the elimination of torture. 
</p>
<p>433. Brazil expressed its strong belief, however, that 2008 would be an important year for the 
promotion of human rights; a year of reflection not only on what its challenges were and on 
which public policies needed to be reformulated, but also on what had worked well so far. 
</p>
<p>434. Brazil noted that the eleventh national conference on human rights, to be held in 
December 2008, would be a major step towards a comprehensive evaluation of the human rights 
challenges faced by Brazil. The conference would aim at revising the national plan on human 
rights, which established the core guidelines for the elaboration of actions and public policies for 
the protection and promotion of human rights at the domestic level. The plan stemmed from a 
recommendation made at the Vienna World Conference, the final document of which was 
initially implemented in Brazil in 1996. 
</p>
<p>435. In the context of the commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, Brazil reported that the Government, together with civil society 
entities, was organizing important events, not only of national but also of international scope. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>436. The regional preparatory conference for the Durban Review Conference would be held in 
Brasilia, from 17 to 19 June. The conference would bring together delegations from South and 
Central America, the Caribbean region and representatives of civil society to discuss what the 
region expected from the Durban Review Conference and how it could contribute to the review 
process. 
</p>
<p>437. From 25 to 28 November, the third World Congress against the Sexual Exploitation of 
Children and Adolescents would bring together more than 3,000 people in Rio de Janeiro to 
explore the challenges of implementing an intersectoral approach to the global fight against the 
sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. Brazil invited all States and representatives of 
civil society present to come together for the third Congress so that efforts could be combined to 
combat that crime. 
</p>
<p>438. With regard to the Council, Brazil was committed to launching a set of human rights 
voluntary goals by December 2008. Brazil and the co-sponsors of the initiative continued to 
count on the cooperation of all States in the elaboration of these goals in commemoration of the 
sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>439. Furthermore, on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, Brazil expected that a resolution would be consensually adopted at the next session of 
the Council. The draft guidelines on alternative care for children without parental care should be 
adopted by the Council and transmitted to the General Assembly. The guidelines were an 
important complement to the system of child protection established by the Convention. 
</p>
<p>440. Brazil also mentioned the holding of the first National Conference of Gays, Lesbians, 
Bisexuals, Transvestites and Transsexuals and of the third Film Festival on Human Rights and 
Cinema in South America, among many other initiatives. Brazil stated that its voluntary 
commitment to creating a national system of human rights indicators and the elaboration of 
annual reports on the situation of human rights, taking into account the follow-up to the universal 
periodic review, would be fundamental tools for the domestic monitoring of human rights. 
</p>
<p>441. Brazil also highlighted that, in the last week of May, a second public hearing, as a 
follow-up to the one held before the conclusion of its national report, had been held by the 
Commission of Human Rights and Minorities of the House of Representatives. On that occasion, 
civil society organizations were able to express their opinions regarding the universal periodic 
review process and make comments on the participation of Brazil in international human rights 
forums. 
</p>
<p>442. Brazil pointed out that its commitments before the Council meant concrete actions in 
Brazil; along the way, the Government was open to a transparent and objective dialogue with 
civil society, because no public policy could be effective without its participation. 
Non-governmental organizations in Brazil had been partners of the Government in the 
improvement of human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>443. Brazil thanked all countries that had participated in the review of the Brazilian report, and 
expressed its gratitude to the members of the troika and to the States that had recently supported 
the re-election of Brazil to the Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>444. It stated that it had great expectations for the consolidation of the universal periodic review 
mechanism in upcoming sessions and expressed its hope that it could contribute to that task. 
Brazil seized the opportunity to reiterate its voluntary commitments. It stressed that its goal was 
to continue collaborating with the Council, to enhance cooperation with international 
mechanisms for monitoring the protection of human rights, to consider ratifying human rights 
treaties to which Brazil was not a State party, to support OHCHR activities and to strengthen 
regional systems for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of  
the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>445. China thanked the Brazilian delegation and expressed its appreciation for the 
Government&#8217;s serious attitude in responding to the various questions and recommendations. 
China noted that in recent years Brazil has recorded high economic growth and rapid social 
development, making great achievements in areas such as the elimination of poverty, the 
realization of the rights to education, food and health, and the elimination of racial 
discrimination. China appreciated Brazil&#8217;s active participation in international human rights 
activities, its active promotion of mainstreaming gender issues into human rights, and its 
advocacy of cooperation and dialogue on human rights in the international community. China 
also noted the open and frank attitude with which the Brazilian Government approaches and 
deals with human rights challenges. 
</p>
<p>446. Canada congratulated Brazil for the serious attitude with which it participated in the 
review, noting that Brazil allowed its civil society to participate in the reporting process. Canada 
acknowledged Brazil&#8217;s progress towards the full respect of human rights, noting the fact that 
Brazil has recognized the challenges it still has to overcome. Canada supported Brazil&#8217;s 
resolution to adopt internal evaluation tools for human rights, encouraging the country to 
concretely implement effective public policies emanating<b> </b>from the recommendations made 
during the review process.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>447. Nigeria congratulated the Brazilian delegation for its comments on the adoption of the 
outcome of its review. It noted Brazil&#8217;s efforts to put in place mechanisms for the 
implementation of recommendations made during the review, and hoped that these initiatives 
will reinforce and deepen enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all 
Brazilians. With the demonstration of such commitments by Brazil, Nigeria expects that the 
objectives of the universal periodic review will begin to be realized even before the conclusion 
of the first cycle of the review. Nigeria therefore calls on all parties concerned to assist Brazil in 
whatever way they might deem fit, in order to fully implement the recommendations and 
outcomes of the review for the benefit of its citizens. 
</p>
<p>448. Pakistan thanked the delegation of Brazil for its elaborated presentation, stating that Brazil 
has invested great human and material capital to improve the human rights situation in the 
country. It urged Brazil to continue to implement its reforms relating to indigenous people, the 
situation of prisoners, the criminal justice system, violence and extrajudicial killings, the 
protection of human rights defenders, and economic and social inequalities. Pakistan requested 
that Brazil closely cooperate and share its good practices on how it resolves its issues with the 
relevant multilateral structures. Pakistan also hopes that while strategizing the promotion of 
rights, Brazil will be mindful of concerns regarding climate change and right to food. </p>

<p>449. Switzerland, as a member of the troika together with Saudi Arabia and Gabon, stated that it 
was in a good position to observe the serious attitude and commitment shown by Brazil during 
the review. Switzerland noted that Brazil has accepted the 15 recommendations submitted to it, 
which shows its high ambitions in the area of improving the situation of human rights in the 
country. Switzerland stressed two issues taken up during the interactive dialogue that appear in a 
number of recommendations. Firstly, as children are a particularly vulnerable group in Brazil, 
Switzerland welcomed Brazil&#8217;s commitment to implement quickly the programmes related to the 
situation of children. The other issue deals with the assessment of the implementation of 
programmes and national action plans Brazil has launched, and Brazil has made the voluntary 
commitment to establish new instruments to monitor human rights at the national level and to 
introduce human rights indicators. Drawing up annual national reports including on follow-up to 
the universal periodic review, is another of its voluntary commitments. Switzerland will follow 
with great interest the way in which Brazil will translate these objectives into actions at various 
levels of the Federation. Switzerland remains convinced that civil society will continue to 
provide a valuable contribution to this process. 
</p>
<p>450. The Syrian Arab Republic expressed its appreciation of Brazil&#8217;s transparency and 
collaboration with different human rights mechanisms, including the Council. Brazil&#8217;s 
acceptance and endorsement of the various difficult recommendations made to it is a clear 
testimony of its determination to promote and protect human rights in their different 
manifestations and interpretations, despite the burden of development in the last two decades. 
This includes, inter alia, continuing and intensifying efforts to reduce poverty and social 
inequality, to improve prison conditions, to enhance access to justice, and to adopt the law on 
access of citizens to public information. 
</p>
<p>451. Angola welcomed Brazil&#8217;s efforts to concretely improve the situation of human rights 
through its cooperation with the United Nations system and its willingness to accept several 
recommendations made during the review. Angola noted that Brazil is showing great progress 
towards improving the situation of human rights, by making the voluntary commitment to create 
new tools to monitor human rights, which include a national system of human rights indicators 
and annual reports on the situation of human rights. Angola welcomed policies to improve the 
life of African descendants and minorities, and to promote gender equality. These strategies will 
help Brazil to face the challenges that still exist in these areas. Angola noted with satisfaction 
that Brazil considers the right to education a fundamental tool for the fight against poverty and 
social exclusion, concurring with Brazil&#8217;s position that education and development strategies can 
be the key to solving regional and economic inequalities and racial, ethnic and gender issues. 
Angola expressed its appreciation for Brazil&#8217;s engagement to reduce poverty and social 
inequalities.

<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>452. Conectas Human Rights noted its involvement in the review process of Brazil. Although it 
appreciated the corrections made to the report to be adopted by the Council, Conectas Human 
Rights noted that some important observations had not been included and that it did not reflect 
the answers provided by Brazil on the measures to improve the situation of human rights 
defenders and on challenges and commitments for 2010. Conectas Human Rights asked how  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Brazil would implement the 15 recommendations made during the universal periodic review and 
some 3,000 recommendations made by the treaty bodies. It also asked how the Government 
would translate these recommendations into public policies and how civil society would 
participate in their implementation. Conectas Human Rights also noted that the success of the 
universal periodic review would depend on five conditions: the review should not replace or 
weaken the special procedures and treaty bodies mechanisms; delegations should be more 
concrete in their questions and recommendations and States under review should address all of 
them; the final report should be an adequate reflection of the review; the recommendations 
should be turned into concrete actions; and each State under review should engage with civil 
society in all phases of the review. 
</p>
<p>453. Amnesty International noted that the presentation made by Brazil during the session of the 
Working Group focused on a description of existing government programmes and policies rather 
than on an analysis of the effectiveness of measures to address human rights violations. It noted 
that a number of States raised key human rights issues including on impunity for crimes during 
the dictatorship, violence and extrajudicial killings by the police, torture and other ill-treatment, 
violence against women and harsh prison conditions. Amnesty International noted that the recent 
report presented by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
following his visit to the country further highlights the extent of the problem. Amnesty 
International noted that States recommended to Brazil to evaluate its initiatives and activities 
designed to address serious human rights violations, including violence and killings by the 
police, torture, violence against women and prison conditions, and to intensify efforts to protect 
human rights defenders. Amnesty International welcomed these recommendations and the 
statement made by Brazil that it supports all the recommendations made during the review and 
called on Brazil to give them early and full effect. 
</p>
<p>454. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions noted that while it welcomes the view 
expressed by Brazil that States and municipalities must abide by the mechanisms to implement 
human rights in the country, it also noted that the Federal Government is the main duty-bearer 
and urged it to establish mechanisms to monitor the implementation of recommendations made 
by the United Nations and regional monitoring bodies at the federal level. The Centre on 
Housing Rights and Evictions also urged the establishment of a national human rights institution 
in accordance with the Paris Principles. Particular concern was expressed at racial discrimination 
against Afro-descendants, especially the <i>quilombo</i> communities, and noted that conflicts over 
ancestral lands are increasing in number and in violence, mainly as a result of the Plan for 
Accelerating Growth. It noted with concern that the lack of security of tenure faced by 
Afro-descendants and women was not pointed out as a concern during the universal periodic 
review. While discrimination against women was addressed, it noted that there was no reference 
to the relation between life in slums and violence against women, including domestic violence 
and rape. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions praised the creation of three new 
ministries to deal with human rights issues but noted their lack of jurisdiction and resources to 
prevent and solve conflicts. It noted the Agrarian Ombudsman as the only mechanism in place to 
prevent and mediate land conflicts, and urged for the immediate implementation of the National 
Policy for Prevention and Mediation of Urban Land and Conflicts. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed by the State under review on  
the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>455. Brazil also thanked various delegations for their comments made concerning their 
involvement and the commitment of Brazil to the improvement of its human rights policies. 
Concerning the comments made by the representatives of civil society, Brazil noted that its 
statement had been clear about its openness to work along with civil society organizations in the 
ongoing process. It noted that the public policies included in the national report of Brazil and the 
report of the Working Group reflected the other steps that Brazil would have to take to address 
the main human rights problems. Brazil also noted that one of its main objectives was to develop 
a set of human rights indicators that would help improve and fine-tune the human rights policies 
already in place. Brazil highlighted that the national programme introduced in the country for the 
protection of human rights defenders had not been reflected in the final report of the 
Working Group, and that that programme was aimed to guarantee, inter alia, the life of defenders 
and their physical and psychological safety, to prevent threats and situation of vulnerability, and 
to implement active polices. It pointed out that, in some federal States, pilot projects were being 
implemented for the protection of human rights defenders, and that this was an indication of how 
the national process could be improved. Brazil also stated that the national policy on the matter 
had been launched by the President in 2007, and that a legal framework had been developed. It 
reported that one of the country&#8217;s priorities had been to establish a national protection system 
that would rationalize all sectoral programmes under way in various areas, such as the protection 
programmes for victims and witnesses, human rights defenders and children and adolescents. 
</p>
<p><b>Philippines 
</b></p>
<p>456. The review of the Philippines was held on 11 April 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by the Philippines in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/PHL/1 and Corr.1); the compilation 
prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/PHL/2); and the 
summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/PHL/3). 
</p>
<p>457. At its 16th meeting, on 10 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on the Philippines (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>458. The outcome of the review on the Philippines is constituted of the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/28), together with the views of the 
Philippines concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the 
Working Group (see also A/HRC/8/28/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>459. The Permanent Representative of the Philippines to the United Nations Office at Geneva 
reaffirmed that the Philippines had always attached the highest priority to the protection and 
promotion of human rights. It had therefore welcomed the opportunity of the universal periodic </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>review, in order to present an objective assessment of the human rights situation in the country 
and to strengthen the universal periodic review as a key instrument of the Council to advance 
human rights on a global scale. 
</p>
<p>460. The Philippines had further sought to progressively refine its relevant laws, policies and 
practices on human rights. That continuous effort encompassed the whole range of governance, 
from the making of national laws to law enforcement and the administration of justice at the 
local level. Further, the Filipino civil society was a dynamic and active partner and a watchdog 
of the Government, and the media was one of the freest and most outspoken in the world. 
</p>
<p>461. The Philippines had made key voluntary commitments at the conclusion of its review, 
including to develop a gender-responsive approach, especially to protect the rights of children 
and women; to further develop domestic legislation to better protect the rights of the child; to 
continue to address the issue of extrajudicial killings; and to meet the basic needs of the poor. 
</p><p>462. In addition to those unilateral commitments, the Philippines had closely and carefully 
studied the recommendations made by various States during its review, which are contained in 
paragraph 58 of the report of the Working Group. In a spirit of openness and cooperation that 
marked its full engagement with the universal periodic review, the Government has expressed 
support for recommendations Nos. 1 and 2; the first part of recommendation No. 4; 
recommendations made by the Holy See and Switzerland under No. 6; and recommendations 
Nos. 5, 9, 10, 12 and 13.  
</p>
<p>463. With respect to women and children, the Philippines will continue to develop a 
gender-responsive approach to issues relating to violence against women and to build a 
supportive environment for women and children within the judicial system, taking into account 
the special needs for rehabilitation and post-conflict care of women and children in vulnerable 
situations and conflicts areas. The Philippines already benefited from long experience and has 
established a policy of women&#8217;s participatory inclusion and empowerment in all spheres of life, 
including government affairs and public service. The Philippines ranked high on gender issues, 
as has been recognized in the UNDP in its <i>Human Development Report</i>, as well as by the World 
Economic Forum Gender Gap Index. The Supreme Court has created the Committee on 
Gender-Responsiveness in the Judiciary, and in support of the Violence against Women and 
Their Children Act, it issued the Rule on Violence against Women and Their Children, which 
enables courts to better manage and monitor such cases. For non-judicial interventions, the 
Philippine Inter-agency Council on Anti-Violence to Women and their Children has prepared a 
five-year strategic plan, which includes public information and advocacy, capacity-building and 
service delivery, research on policy development, and sustained linkages and partnerships in 
resource generation and mobilization. The Philippines has also been chosen as one of the pilot 
countries to be involved in the United Nations Joint Programme on Violence against Women. 
Interventions to address rape, sexual harassment, trafficking in women and children and 
domestic violence were being prioritized. Regarding the rehabilitation and post-quality care for 
women and children, the Department of Social Welfare and Development provides 
community-based psychological interventions, including &#8220;Return-to-School&#8221; programmes for 
children whose schooling has been disrupted and livelihood and core shelter assistance. The 
Department of Health, through its Women and Children Protection Units in government  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>hospitals, also provided holistic, gender-responsive health care to women survivors. Legislative 
measures have been proposed to the Philippine legislature to further strengthen laws on the 
promotion and protection of the human rights of women and children. 
</p>
<p>464. With respect to trafficking, it was noted that the Philippines would continue combating 
trafficking in human beings at the national level and would sustain its leading role at the 
international level in that matter. The Philippines welcomed the cooperation of all nations in that 
major endeavour and trafficking would be among the issues taken up at the Second Global 
Forum on Migration and Development, which the country would be hosting in Manila in 
September. It had also called for the extension of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons and proposed that gender and age-sensitive approaches be included in the 
conduct of the mandate. It fully supported the extension of the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and called on more countries to join the 
International Convention on the Promotion of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members 
of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>465. With respect to extrajudicial killings, the Philippines was ensuring that members of 
security forces were trained on human rights and on their responsibility to protect human rights 
defenders. Human rights offices have already been institutionalized in the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines and the Philippine National Police. Among other functions, those offices were to 
receive and act on reports or complaints against military or police personnel. They also handled 
human rights education, training, capacity-building and advocacy. The Philippines did not 
engage in or encourage torture or extrajudicial killings of any kind, and would continue to take 
resolute and concrete steps to address allegations of extrajudicial killings and measures would 
follow the rule of law and due process. Torture was prohibited by the Constitution and was a 
criminal act punishable under the revised Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>466. The Philippines submitted its latest report to the Committee against Torture in 
January 2008 and would endeavour to submit its reports regularly to the various treaty bodies. 
The Philippines also signed and was in the process of ratifying the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>467. With respect to economic and social rights, the Philippines would be pleased to share with 
other countries its experience in the area of justiciability of economic and social rights, 
particularly in the field of labour rights. In keeping with the Constitution and international 
standards, the Philippine Labour Code provides a legal mechanism to address concerns on labour 
standards and labour relations, including the right of workers to join associations or unions, the 
right to strike and to collectively negotiate agreements, and inter-union and intra-union conflict 
disputes. Appeals against decisions on labour cases may be elevated to the Secretary of Labour. 
A petition for review may be filed with the Supreme Court to set aside the decision of the 
Secretary of Labour on the ground of serious abuse of discretion amounting to lack of 
jurisdiction. Conciliation and mediation mechanisms were also provided for in the Labour Code. 
The Philippines was actively meeting the basic needs of the poor and other vulnerable groups 
and was committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The 
Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan, reiterating the overreaching goal of fighting 
poverty and hunger and improving basic social services, including health and education, has just 
been updated. Besides investing in infrastructure and agriculture productivity, the Philippines is 
instituting the Accelerated Hunger Mitigation Plan. The implementation of following initiatives </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>has also started: microfinance and livelihood services, Poverty Free Zone Programme, 
&#8220;Progressive Livelihood&#8221; programme, and the <i>Ahon-Pamilyang Pinoy</i> (Lifting the Filipino 
Family from Poverty) project. The Philippine Plan of Action for Nutrition 2005-2010 also 
provided for intervention to alleviate hunger and malnutrition. The community-based monitoring 
system has been set up to better identify and serve the poor. It is a poverty monitoring system 
that makes use of computer-based processing generating core local poverty indicators at the 
household level. As it was the case in many countries, the Philippines is facing difficulties 
caused by rising food and energy prices and by the devastating threat of climate change. 
</p>
<p>468. The Philippine Government involved civil society in the preparatory process of its national 
report, and would fully involve civil society in the follow-up to the review. It looked forward to 
their continued involvement in the formulation of the second Philippines Human Rights Action 
Plan, which was launched on 19 May 2008. 
</p>
<p>469. The second part of recommendation No. 4 and recommendations Nos. 7, 16 and 17 had 
been duly noted and would be the subject of further study by the Government, as they might 
require legislative action or involve interpretation of laws. With regard to recommendation 
No. 8, the Government was of the view that that recommendation was already covered by its 
voluntary commitments contained in paragraph 60 of the report of the Working Group. The 
Philippines would keep in mind all other recommendations, as it would continue to strengthen 
the institutional and policy responses to bring about greater human rights protection and 
promotion in the country, and to constructively engage with the Council and other international 
mechanisms and bilateral and regional partners on human rights issues. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States of  
the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>470. China appreciated the great importance attached to the universal periodic review by the 
Government of the Philippines. It noted that the Philippines had actively participated in the 
interactive dialogue and had given a comprehensive account of its efforts to protect human 
rights, and that it made consistent and vigorous efforts to improve the human rights situation. 
China noted with appreciation that in the light of the real needs of vulnerable groups such as 
children, women and the aboriginal population, the Philippines had strengthened the protection 
through human action plans, including the implementation of the 25-year National Strategic 
Framework Plan for Development of Children, the formulation of Magna Carta for women, and 
the establishment of various mechanisms for the protection of the rights of migrant workers. 
China welcomed the newest information provided by the Philippines and its voluntary 
commitments. China was convinced that the Philippines would overcome challenges, meet its 
commitments and effectively promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>471. Algeria commended the Philippines on its constructive approach and the involvement of 
civil society in the promotion and protection of human rights. The voluntary commitment and 
cooperation of the Government would provide help and relief for vulnerable groups. Algeria 
commended the Philippines on the unhindered participation of all stakeholders in the process and 
for promoting a genuine dialogue towards addressing its complex challenges. Algeria hoped that 
international assistance would be provided to allow the Philippines to translate the 
recommendations it accepted into reality by enhancing capacity-building. There was a need for 
continued support to develop a gender-responsive approach to issues relating to women and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>children, including for the improvement of the judicial system and on violence against women 
and children, and continued measures to address the basic needs of the poor and other vulnerable 
groups. Algeria welcomed that the Philippines was working towards harmonizing its national 
legislation with international human rights obligations and its acceptance to abolish the death 
penalty. 
</p>
<p>472. Canada was pleased that the Philippines had constructively engaged in the universal 
periodic review, and commended it in particular on efforts made with regard to extrajudicial 
killings and human rights trainings for security forces. Canada thanked the Philippines for its 
response to the outcome report and encouraged it to implement the recommendations of the 
Working Group. It specifically urged the Philippines to step up efforts to investigate and 
prosecute extrajudicial killings and to punish those responsible for them and to address the 
culture of impunity. Further, the Philippines was encouraged to strengthen its witness protection 
programme and to increase training for its security forces on human rights and on their 
responsibility to protect human rights and human rights defenders. Canada would welcome an 
update to the Council before the following review on measures taken to follow up on the 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>473. Qatar appreciated the steps taken to promote and protect human rights for the benefit of the 
people, as well as the Philippines&#8217; commitments and endeavours to further enhance the 
protection of human rights, noting that this was not surprising for a country that had made a vital 
contribution to the institution-building process of the Council and the preparation of the 
universal periodic review mechanism. In spite of challenges, the Philippines responded 
positively to the recommendations of the Working Group, including to further promote and 
protect human rights and the rights of women and children and to develop gender-sensitive 
action plans, including in the judiciary and on the issue of violence against women and children, 
as well as measures to protect the media and find ways to meet the vital needs of the poor. Qatar 
noted that there was a collective responsibility to offer support to the efforts of the Philippines, 
through dialogue, cooperation and capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>474. Indonesia joined the other delegations in congratulating the Philippines on its remarkably 
frank and comprehensive report, which made impressive reading and documented a remarkable 
track record of achievements in the promotion and protection of human rights over the past 
21 years. The strong commitment of the Philippines to the universal periodic review mirrored the 
consistency of the Government to always keeping in sight the goal of responsible governance. 
The early establishment of an independent commission on human rights had been the first in a 
series of moves to integrate the promotion and protection of human rights at all levels of the 
Government. It was an example of best practices, notably in the areas of development, education, 
the protection of migrant workers and trafficking of persons. As regards the recommendations of 
the Working Group, the Philippines has willingly undertaken to address some of the gaps in the 
protection of the human rights of women and children, particularly in terms of their status before 
the law and in situations of detention, or as the target of violence. The Government is also 
committed to continuing its action to combat and punish the killing of activists and media 
professionals. Indonesia has no doubt that the Philippines&#8217; commitment to its pledges would see 
it succeed in those endeavours. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>475. Sri Lanka commended the Philippines on the open, serious and comprehensive approach 
followed throughout the review of the Philippines. The number of recommendations supported 
by the Philippines and the voluntary commitments bear testimony to its commitment in the field 
of human rights, despite its complex challenges. Sri Lanka commended the Philippines on the 
commitment, initiatives and efforts made to combat trafficking at the national level and its 
leading role at the international level on that issue. Sri Lanka noted that the Philippines had 
identified a roadmap and expectations for international cooperation, and that there was a 
common responsibility to create a conducive and cooperative atmosphere to fulfil its needs upon 
request. Further, it was the Council&#8217;s common responsibility to create a collaborative atmosphere 
to help the country to meet its goals, to implement its roadmap and fulfil its expectations and 
needs, through international cooperation with a view to enhancing the protection of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>476. Thailand congratulated the Philippines on the additional responses to the recommendations 
it provided to the Council, and shared the observations made by several States on the positive 
steps taken by the Philippines in considering the implementation of those recommendations to 
advance the cause of human rights. This bore testimony to the commitment of the Philippines to 
constructively cooperating with the Council and the universal periodic review. The Government 
should be supported and encouraged by the international community and interested stakeholders 
to help advance the promotion and protection of human rights of all people in the country. It 
welcomed the announcement by the Philippines of its voluntary commitments and pledges to the 
cause of human rights. Thailand was confident that the Philippines would continue to engage 
with the Council and interested stakeholders, with the will to increase dialogue and cooperation 
with international and regional mechanisms and with civil society in order to ensure that the full 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms of all would be promoted, protected and 
respected in the Philippines. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>477. The Commission on the Human Rights of the Philippines welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to accord the highest priority to the promotion and protection of human rights. It 
requested the Government to nurture an independent Commission by acting on the Presidential 
veto message on the annual appropriations limiting the use of their savings, filling the posts of 
three commissioners, and certifying the proposed Charter of the Commission. The Commission 
on the Human Rights of the Philippines asked for support for the Barangay Human Rights 
Action Centres and for a joint project with the New Zealand Human Rights Commission, and 
that the civil society&#8217;s representation for a strengthened Presidential Human Rights Committee 
be restored. It looked forward to the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture, the ASEAN Charter and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. It 
encouraged the Government to sign the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance and to actively participate in the adoption of an optional 
protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The 
Commission would actively engage with treaty bodies and asked the Philippines to consider 
extending standing invitations to special procedures. The Commission on the Human Rights of 
the Philippines noted that it would track cases of human rights violations, including extrajudicial 
killings, enforced disappearances and torture. It would engage with State agencies to reiterate a 
human rights based legislative agenda; monitor judicial decisions that impact on human rights,  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and advise on executive action to address human rights issues. It finally stated its readiness to 
work with the Government and civil society in formulating the national human rights plan of 
action and in follow-up to the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>478. The International Women&#8217;s Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific, Action Canada for 
Population and Development, the Latin American Committee for the Defence of Women&#8217;s 
Rights, the Centre for reproductive rights and the Federation for Women and Family Planning 
called on the Government to reject the recommendation made by the Holy See in paragraph 58 
of the report of the Working Group, calling for the protection of children in the womb. The 
recommendation is contrary to the concluding comments of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women in which it urged the Government to remove the punitive 
provisions imposed on women who have abortions and to reduce women&#8217;s maternal mortality 
rates in line with the Committee&#8217;s general recommendation No. 24 on women and health and the 
Beijing Platform for Action. The recommendation contravenes the findings of the treaty 
monitoring bodies that access to safe and legal abortion is a matter of women&#8217;s right to life, 
health, non-discrimination and dignity based on interpretations of human rights norms, 
commitments in global consensus documents and evidence of the impact of unsafe abortion on 
women&#8217;s health. As reflected in recommendation No. 15, the non-governmental organizations 
called on the Government of the Philippines to extend a standing invitation to the special 
procedures as part of its commitment to respect and fulfil women&#8217;s reproductive rights. 
</p>
<p>479. Human Rights Watch, in a joint statement with Amnesty International, welcomed the 
important recommendations made by several States during the review of the Philippines to 
eliminate extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture and other ill-treatment, and 
to carry out investigations into such violations and to punish those responsible. They encouraged 
the Philippines to act immediately on those recommendations, which echo those of the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. Amnesty International and 
Human Rights Watch welcomed the Government&#8217;s stated commitment to reducing incidents of 
extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances and to bringing the perpetrators to justice, 
including through enhanced coordination between its prosecution services and other agencies. 
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch noted that the challenge for the Philippines 
continued to be the effective implementation of its initiatives and programmes, including reform 
of the witness protection programme and the prosecution and suitable punishment of persons 
found to be responsible for political killings and other serious rights violations, particularly those 
from the security sector. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch encouraged the 
Philippines to implement its institutional reforms necessary for preventing a resurgence of 
political killings, by vigorously investigating and prosecuting members of the military implicated 
in extrajudicial killings or enforced disappearances and by creating a specialist unit in the 
Witness Protection Programme to provide social and financial support for witnesses and families 
of alleged victims of political killings and enforced disappearances for as long as they are at risk. 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also welcomed the signature of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture shortly after the review of the Philippines in 
April, and encouraged its early ratification as well as ratification of the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, as pledged by the Government. 
</p>
<p>480. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions welcomed the attention paid to economic, 
social and cultural rights, and particularly to housing rights in the national report; and in 
particular welcomed the voluntary commitment to continue to find measures to meet the basic </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>needs of the poor and other vulnerable groups. In view of the serious housing rights problems in 
the Philippines, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions was disappointed that little attention 
was paid thereto in the interactive dialogue and in the report of the Working Group. It drew 
attention to some recent developments of real concern, including the prevalence of forced 
evictions. It noted with concern the abolition of the Presidential Commission on the Urban Poor 
earlier this year, which removed a key check against abuse by the public authority in ensuring 
compliance by local governments in cases of evictions. It invited the Government to stop 
the erosion to law and policy in the area of housing rights and not to proceed with the House 
Bill 1087 of 2008. 
</p>
<p>481. The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum-Asia) in association with 
Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates and Task Force detainees of the Philippines 
commended the States on the objectivity of the questions and recommendations delivered during 
the interactive dialogue of the Working Group on the Philippines. They expressed their 
appreciation for the statement of the Philippines on continued engagement with civil society 
throughout the follow-up process to the universal periodic review, maintaining the momentum in 
addressing killings and disappearances, ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture, and implementing the measures to address the needs of the poor and vulnerable sectors. 
They stated that they would expect the strengthening of domestic support for the signing and 
ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance and urged the Government to reconsider its position on the statute of the 
International Criminal Court. They also stated that they would expect convictions in the cases of 
extrajudicial executions, disappearances and torture and that the shortcomings and limitations of 
court personnel, protection of witnesses, victims&#8217; families, and forensic investigation would be 
addressed substantively. There were some key issues and recommendations raised by States 
which the Philippine delegation had chosen not to reply to, particularly regarding the conflict in 
the Southern province of Mindanao and the extension of a standing invitation to special 
procedures. The universal periodic review could be a positive and effective mechanism for 
scrutiny and constructive dialogue as long as a State adhered to the principles of openness, 
transparency and accountability. 
</p>
<p>482. The Commission of Churches on International Affairs of the World Council of Churches 
and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers noted that the continuing concern of 
the international community about human rights violations was reassuring, as this dispelled the 
glossy picture projected by the Philippines in its national report. Much was left to be desired in 
the process of preparation of the report. In relation to the outcome, they noted that the delegation 
did not indicate having adopted any of the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, especially on the changes in the 
counter-insurgency programme currently being implemented by the State, and noted that the 
filing of cases and the conviction of four persons did not negate the fact that not a single military 
person was convicted of such violations. They noted that the reduction of the number of victims 
was the result of public outcry, but that impunity continued. 
</p>
<p>483. The Indian Council of South America and Indigenous Peoples and National Coalition 
thanked the Government for its final report before the Council and for its willingness to 
cooperate and constructively work with civil society in addressing human rights challenges, 
especially the extrajudicial killings. They also thanked the Philippines for accepting the 
acknowledgement and responsibility to address the plight that activists and journalists were </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>facing. They recommended that the Philippines involve civil society more directly at high levels 
of Government, including through an oversight committee of civil society in seeking ways and 
means to search for the missing victims and to get to the root of why those killings were taking 
place. They recommended that the authorities address the root causes for those assassinations 
and that they look for disappeared persons, and implement the recommendations of the 
Special Rapporteur and other special procedures on that issue. 
</p>
<p>484. The Asian Legal Resource Centre welcomed the importance given in the Working Group 
report to the need for the Government to provide evidence of concrete results concerning its 
promises to address extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. The Asian Legal 
Resource Centre noted that the chief of the human rights office had admitted that he and his staff 
had never gone to the field to investigate allegations of killings. The Asian Legal Resource 
Centre hoped that the Government would provide information on the implementation of the 
recommendations made by the Melo commission and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial 
killings. It appreciated the recommendation for the reform of the judiciary and the armed forces, 
noting that independent investigations and fair trials were the only way to keep up real 
momentum in addressing those killings and other serious abuses. It also welcomed the repeated 
requests for the need to ratify the Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture as a starting point 
which needed to lead to verifiable implementation and regular Government reporting. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed by the State under review on  
the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>485. The Permanent Representative of the Philippines, in her concluding remarks, said that it 
was an honour to be one of the first countries to go through the universal periodic review 
process. It had been an important learning experience. The recommendations would be used to 
strengthen the national institutions and policies of the Philippines aimed at bringing better and 
fuller protection of human rights for all Filipinos. The Philippines had listened to all stakeholders 
and would keep in mind their suggestions when strengthening and addressing human rights 
issues in the country. Thanks went to the troika members and secretariat for their support and 
patience throughout the process, as well as to the national human rights institution, to all 
non-governmental organizations and members of civil society for their comments and 
suggestions. 
</p>
<p>486. The Permanent Representative congratulated the Council on the successful conduct of the 
universal periodic review. Its positive atmosphere and outcome showed that it was possible to 
discuss and analyse country situations in a constructive and cooperative manner. More 
importantly, through the universal periodic review, they had seen that all countries, regardless of 
the level of development, demography, or geography, faced similar challenges in effectively 
implementing human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>487. All countries needed the support of an enabling international environment conducive to the 
responsible promotion and protection of all human rights for all peoples. Human rights were the 
universal responsibility and heritage of the Philippines. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>488. Sixty years ago, Member states, through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
pledged themselves to achieve, in cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of 
universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and 
acknowledged that a common understanding of these rights and freedoms was of the greatest 
importance for the full realization of this pledge. The Philippines believed that the universal 
periodic review helped bring the international community closer to that common understanding 
of both the cause and challenge of human rights. The review process contributed to the 
realization of more constructive and cooperative international engagement on human rights, as 
embodied in General Assembly resolution 60/251 and the institution-building package which all 
delegations in Geneva had worked so hard on last year. It also perhaps brought closer the vision 
of the original drafters of the Universal Declaration, in which human rights would exacerbate 
divisions in an already much divided and conflicting world, and bring nations closer together in a 
common purpose to uphold the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of each and 
every individual. 
</p>
<p>489. In conclusion, the Permanent Representative expressed the Philippines&#8217; continuing strong 
support for the universal periodic review and was confident that it could further contribute to the 
effective implementation of human rights standards on the ground, where it mattered most, as all 
countries sought to ensure greater enjoyment of human rights of their peoples. 
<b>Algeria 
</b></p>
<p>490. The review of Algeria was held on 14 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Algeria in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/DZA/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/DZA/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/DZA/3). 
</p>
<p>491. At its 16th meeting, on 10 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Algeria (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>492. The outcome of the review on Algeria is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/29), together with the views of Algeria concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>493. The delegation of Algeria paid a tribute to the troika composed of Senegal, the Philippines 
and Uruguay and thanked all those who had shown interest in Algeria&#8217;s report. 
</p>
<p>494. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had personally headed the delegation during the 
presentation of Algeria&#8217;s report, had emphasized, Algeria was aware that it still had a way to go 
and needed to improve its performance in a number of areas. Algeria was resolutely trying to do 
that, and it was all the more determined to do so in the light of the constructive discussions that </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>had taken place in the Working Group, with all participants demonstrating a genuine desire to 
cooperate in order to help all States, from North and South alike, do better in the field of human 
rights. By not lapsing into outright indictments or preaching, as the former Commission had 
sometimes done, the Council had given new impetus to the promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>495. Algeria&#8217;s commitment to the universal periodic review exercise was reflected in its 
immediate acceptance of nearly all - 17 out of 20 - of the recommendations that had been 
formulated: the recommendations that had been accepted fell within the ambit of national efforts 
to consolidate and protect human rights and promoted the development and welfare of all 
citizens. 
</p>
<p>496. As soon as the universal periodic review exercise had been completed, Algeria had stepped 
up the implementation of its national human rights plan and instituted a professional code for 
journalists. It had prepared draft legislation criminalizing domestic violence and human 
trafficking as well as a draft framework law on children which had four main components: 
health, education, equality and protection. In addition, on 28 and 29 June 2008, Algeria planned 
to hold a national meeting on family relations that would deal with, inter alia, the topic of 
violence against children. 
</p>
<p>497. The Algerian Government had taken the first steps towards ratification of the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol, and intended to notify the 
relevant treaty body of its withdrawal of its reservation to article 9, paragraph 2, of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. That reservation 
had already become null and void in Algeria. 
</p>
<p>498. Insofar as visits by mandate holders of the Human Rights Council&#8217;s special procedures 
were concerned, Algeria took the same view towards its obligations vis-&#224;-vis the Council as it 
did to those under the African Charter of Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Arab Charter on 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>499. Just as it had agreed to the visit by the Council&#8217;s Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
Algeria had agreed to visits by the Special Rapporteur of the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights on the rights of women in Africa and the Commission&#8217;s Special Rapporteur on 
human rights defenders in Africa. 
</p>
<p>500. Algeria was likewise prepared to receive the Council&#8217;s Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression at any time. Algeria 
was currently considering the possibility of extending new invitations to other special procedures 
mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>501. With regard to the three recommendations that Algeria had been unable to accept because 
they were contrary to the Constitution, the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation and the 
principle of non-discrimination with regard to religious worship, the delegation said it was 
conceivable that Algeria had not been explicit enough in its report to dispel any possible 
misunderstandings. However, it remained open to debate and would reply to any questions 
member States and non-governmental organizations might wish to ask. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>502. The universal periodic review was designed to measure the extent of States&#8217; commitment 
to human rights in a way that was universal and treated all States equally. The exercise was 
intended, and therein lay its strength, to be a cooperative effort based on dialogue in which 
the country under review was fully involved and which took into account the country&#8217;s 
capacity-building needs. The universal periodic review also made it possible to analyse the 
situation in a country objectively while preventing any influence from political factors when 
information was gathered and reviewed. It ought to result in specific action. 
</p>
<p>503. The universal periodic review mechanism had the advantage of constituting an assessment 
that could be applied to all States without distinction and had an effective impact on all human 
rights in a day-to-day context. The process should be left to take its own course and should not 
be overburdened, as some of those who had supported the review and in fact had been its earliest 
proponents of the review were trying to do. 
</p>
<p>504. It went without saying that the exercise benefited everyone. Above all, it made it possible 
to highlight things that were not working and identify ways of fixing them. Algeria had endorsed 
the conclusions of the Working Group and had already begun to implement them with the 
support and commitment of its citizens. Having been one of the architects of the founding text, 
Algeria was undertaking that task with a spirit of openness, humility and responsibility, and with 
complete confidence in the positive mission of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>505. China noted that Algeria has been committed to national unity and social development, has 
established a developed judicial system and human rights institutions, signed and ratified many 
international and regional instruments and is taking active measures to carry out its legal 
obligations, which has demonstrated its determination to make positive efforts to realize and 
protect human rights. He welcomed new measures and relevant commitments, as outlined by the 
delegation of Algeria, in order to accomplish new achievements in national reconciliation and 
unity and in promoting and protecting human rights in all areas. 
</p>
<p>506. Tunisia took note of progress made in the field of human rights and congratulated Algeria 
for the efforts deployed to strengthen human rights protection in the country despite the difficult 
circumstances it faces, including terrorism. Tunisia noted the choice Algeria has made to achieve 
national reconciliation and support structural reforms, which are considerable and have covered 
many areas, including education, health, women and family affairs. Algeria has always ensured 
the application of international human rights treaties and has reaffirmed its human rights 
commitments. Tunisia encouraged Algeria in its endeavours and supported new initiatives taken 
within the universal periodic review context. 
</p>
<p>507. The United Arab Emirates welcomed the importance Algeria gives to human rights, the 
Council and the role of human rights in the national policies of the country. It noted the reforms 
undertaken, in particular regarding the rights of children and women, measures to promote 
economic, social and cultural rights to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and 
welcomed the Government&#8217;s willingness to pursue the path of national reconciliation, to ensure </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>social coherence, and its initiative to organize an international conference to discuss links 
between security and fundamental freedoms. Regarding the outcome of the Working Group, it 
was optimistic that Algeria would face its challenges. 
</p>
<p>508. Bahrain welcomed Algeria&#8217;s important commitment to the universal periodic review, and 
welcomed its open and positive attitude during the review. It was highlighted that Algeria has 
ratified many human rights treaties and protocols thereto and is prepared to fully collaborate 
within the universal periodic review process, despite all the challenges the country faces. Bahrain 
expressed in particular support for the national strategy to combat violence against women. 
</p>
<p>509. Qatar, on behalf of the Arab Group, noted that Algeria is a State based on the rule of law 
and fundamental freedoms and referred to the initiative to amend the justice system. It welcomed 
that Algeria has accepted 17 out of 20 recommendations of the Working Group, highlighted its 
commitment to adopt international treaties, including the Convention on the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and to carry out a dialogue with religious minorities, and 
welcomed its measures to promote the rights of women and children and to guarantee the rights 
of prisoners. 
</p>
<p>510. Cuba congratulated Algeria for its commitment to the universal periodic review process 
and the open and constructive approach throughout it. Cuba noted that the support of Algeria for 
some of the recommendations made by the Working Group demonstrated its commitment to 
promoting and protecting human rights. Algeria has undertaken a wide range of actions, 
programmes and legislative reforms aimed at ensuring social equality and participation of all 
stakeholders in the political and social areas. 
</p>
<p>511. Nigeria noted that Algeria has already started taking necessary steps towards implementing 
many of the recommendations it agreed to during the review. It welcomed the various 
mechanisms put in place to guarantee the protection of the fundamental freedoms and rights of 
its citizens such as the right to fair trial, freedom of the press, the humanization of conditions of 
detention, the right to education and other economic and social rights. 
</p>
<p>512. Indonesia noted that Algeria is party to 10 treaties and 4 regional human rights 
instruments, which is a proof of the country&#8217;s commitment to improving the promotion and 
protection of human rights. Algeria accepted an important number of the Working Group&#8217;s 
recommendations, mainly in the areas of protection of women and children, the enhancement of 
its health facilities, the right to education, and is taking necessary steps through policy and 
legislation for the prevention of torture and other cruel inhuman and degrading treatment. 
Indonesia encouraged Algeria to provide follow-up to the recommendations of the Working 
Group. Regarding visits of mandate holders to Algeria, Indonesia noted that the contents of these 
visits must be factual and not relate to anecdotal events, and must be dictated by the country&#8217;s 
own needs and priorities in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>513. Belgium reiterated concern at the deterioration with respect to the situation of freedom of 
religion and opinion in Algeria and noted with regret that Algeria has not endorsed Belgium&#8217;s 
recommendations in this respect. Reference was made to recent events which had occurred in 
Tiaret regarding the conviction of four young Algerians for having worshipped in an  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>unauthorized place on the basis of a decree of 2006 establishing the rules for the exercise of 
religions other than Islam. Belgium reiterated its request that Algeria ensure respect for the 
principle of the freedom of religion and opinion by undertaking a review of the text of that 
decree, and in the meantime to suspend its application. 
</p>
<p>514. Pakistan thanked Algeria for its comprehensive and elaborate review on the steps taken by 
Algeria with respect to the promotion and protection of human rights and the recommendations 
of the Working Group. Algeria is faced with a complex and challenging internal situation and 
has maintained a delicate balance between the need to ensure the promotion and protection of 
human rights of its citizens and the need to ensure peace and stability within the society by 
fighting terrorism. Pakistan expressed appreciation for the open and transparent approach 
adopted by Algeria during the universal periodic review process. It stated that despite serious 
challenges, the Algerian model to pursue multidimensional policies to promote sustainable 
development needs support and encouragement. It also welcomed the initiative to implement a 
national strategy to combat violence against women. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>515. The European Centre for Law and Justice, referring to observations by a number of States 
including Belgium, Brazil and the Holy See, as well as by non-governmental organizations, 
regarding the alarming situation of religious freedom, took note of Algeria&#8217;s resolution to 
maintain a dialogue with all its citizens practising a minority religion. It however regretted that 
Algeria had refused to take into account recommendation No. 55 made by Belgium, which 
noting the deterioration of religious freedom, requested that Algeria suspend the application of 
the 2006 decree. This decree had led to the prohibition and closing of more than two thirds of the 
protestant churches in the country, as well as to the conviction of a growing number of Christian 
Algerians for religious reasons. It stressed the urgent need to develop a dialogue with religious 
minorities and fully respect the principle of religious freedom affirmed in the Algerian 
constitution. Algeria&#8217;s willingness to facilitate the visit of special rapporteurs was welcomed and 
the European Centre for Law and Justice hoped that Algeria would invite the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief in the near future. 
</p>
<p>516. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues and the Cairo Institute for Human 
Rights Studies congratulated the Algerian Government for having accepted most 
recommendations made by the Working Group. Nevertheless, they noted that the Algerian 
Government rejected the recommendation requesting the revision of the Charter for Peace and 
National Reconciliation so that authors of grave human rights violations such as forced 
disappearance be judged and prosecuted according to international standards. The two 
organizations noted that a similar recommendation had been made by the Human Rights 
Committee in November 2007 and the Committee against Torture in May 2008. They regretted 
that Algeria refused to accept the recommendation inviting it to suspend and revise the 2006 
ordinance defining the rules and conditions to exercise non-Muslim religions, the restrictions of 
which are incompatible with the respect of freedom of religion and conscience. They 
congratulated Algeria for having withdrawn its reservation to article 2 of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women but regretted that it had not lifted the 
reservation to article 16 relating to marriage.<b> </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>517. The Arab Commission for Human Rights, also speaking on behalf of Al Karama for 
Human Rights, regretted that the most important recommendations of the Working Group and of 
the treaty bodies have not been supported by Algeria. The Arab Commission for Human Rights 
stressed that enforced disappearances, torture, summary executions and extrajudicial executions 
are neither anecdotal nor occasional but crimes against humanity due to their widespread and 
systematic nature. It suggested ratification of the Rome Statute with a view to putting an end to 
impunity as enshrined in a decree issued by the executive branch. It also raised concerns about 
the state of emergency and powers accorded to the Department for Information and Security, 
which had led to the death of 200,000 people and the disappearance of more than 10,000 others. 
</p>
<p>518. Amnesty International welcomed the responsiveness of Algeria to the recommendations of 
the Working Group to protect detainees from torture and other ill-treatment; to strengthen efforts 
to protect women&#8217;s rights; to ensure the rights of detainees, including access to a lawyer; and to 
cooperate with the special procedures. Amnesty International further expressed serious concern 
about a persistent pattern of secret detention and torture by the Department for Information and 
Security, and about discrimination against women in the Family Code and continuing reports of 
violence against women, including in the family. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review  
on the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>519. In reply to the questions raised during the meeting, the delegation of Algeria said that the 
impunity which, according to some speakers, was implicit in the Charter for Peace and National 
Reconciliation was nowhere to be found in that text, which the Algerian people had accepted by 
means of a referendum on 29 September 2005. It was that sovereign choice by millions of 
Algerians that alone gave the Charter its legitimacy, and the Algerian delegation wondered what 
kind of legitimacy could be claimed by the non-governmental organizations that sought to call 
that choice into question. That, in the delegation&#8217;s view, was something that contrasted starkly 
with the elementary and intangible rules of democracy that drew their strength from choices 
made by a majority of the community. The Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation was a 
national patriotic response aimed at putting an end to fratricide, bringing those who had gone 
astray back into line, isolating the radicals and casting a spotlight on those who had 
misappropriated religion for their own purposes and those zealots who had, through their 
erroneous interpretation, violated the Holy Koran and the right to life of tens of thousands of 
innocent people. 
</p>
<p>520. Non-governmental organizations could not, in the name of ethics or morality, help to 
prosecute the bloodletting by casting doubt on an effort to bring about peace and reconciliation. 
The Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation was considered by some legal experts to be a 
form of transitional justice that represented the passage from a complex situation of crisis to one 
of relief in which the consequences of the national tragedy brought on by terrorism were 
addressed. It was in that spirit that Algeria had endorsed the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations 
that priority should be given to tolerance and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>521. The question of disappeared persons was a painful one for Algerian society. No family had 
been untouched by that phenomenon or was unaware of it. It was the direst consequence of the 
national tragedy confronting Algeria and one that the country was endeavouring to address 
through humanitarian, legal and social means. In other cases where States had planned, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>organized and carried out policies aimed at the methodical liquidation of political, trade union 
and media opposition forces, the response had been reparations that took those parameters as 
well as the political and sociological context in which the disappearances had occurred into 
account. In Algeria, however, where the State had been faced with a terrorist attack on such a 
massive scale that the security forces had been ill-prepared to deal with it and where many 
people were killed defending their endangered homeland, the effort required to overcome the 
crisis was necessarily different. That was why a study group must be organized within the 
framework of the Council to consider different ways of surmounting crises in the light of the 
specific circumstances of each situation. Otherwise, by seeking to apply the same remedy to 
different situations without distinction, the Council ran the risk of acting like the sorcerer&#8217;s 
apprentice. 
</p>
<p>522. Freedom of expression was guaranteed by the Algerian Constitution. The restrictions 
contained in that instrument were recognized in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and were reflected in legislation throughout the world. Article 45 of the Charter for Peace 
and National Reconciliation must be understood as establishing the right of the Algerian people 
to have its desire for the success of the effort to bring about peace and reconciliation respected, a 
desire that had been expressed outright by an overwhelming majority. That right - and it was 
indeed a right enjoyed by 19 million Algerian citizens - had to be respected. Those who violated 
that right were liable to prosecution, and that consequence was spelled out in article 45. That rule 
was applicable to all citizens, and all citizens were equally obliged to observe it, just as they 
were all other rules that governed the functioning of society. That being said, no one had ever 
been prosecuted under article 45 of the Charter. 
</p>
<p>523. The Algerian Constitution expressly guaranteed the inviolability of freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion in article 37, which stipulated: &#8220;Freedom of belief and opinion is 
inviolable.&#8221; Moreover, that freedom could in no case be used as grounds for discrimination 
under the law. 
</p>
<p>524. In that connection, article 29 of the Constitution stipulated that &#8220;[a]ll citizens are equal 
before the law. There shall be no discrimination by reason of birth, race, sex, opinion or any 
other personal or social status or circumstance&#8221;. In Algeria, and contrary to what had been 
alleged, Act No. 63-278 of 28 July 1963, establishing the list of official holidays, recognized 
Christian and Jewish holidays in addition to Muslim holidays as paid holidays for persons of 
those faiths. The Algerian delegation wondered whether such tolerance existed in the countries 
where the headquarters of the major international non-governmental organizations were located. 
Furthermore, since independence, celebrations in observance of those holidays were broadcast 
live on the national radio without distinction. 
</p>
<p>525. Order No. 06-03 of 28 February 2006, concerning the conditions and rules governing the 
practice of faiths other than Islam, had been the subject of a number of comments. Article 2 of 
that text expressly provided that &#8220;the Algerian State guarantees freedom of religious practice 
consistent with respect for the Constitution, the present Order, the laws and regulations currently 
in force, public order, and the fundamental freedoms of third parties. The State also guarantees  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>tolerance and respect between the different religions&#8221;. The provisions concerning faiths other 
than Islam simply extended to those faiths the provisions in force governing Islam and included: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Order No. 77-03 of 19 February 1997, concerning charitable contributions; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Executive decree No. 91-91 of 23 March 1991, concerning mosques; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 87 bis of Act No. 01-09 of 26 June 2001. 
</p>
<p>526. The Order of 28 February 2006 thus sought to correct a legal oversight. It constituted a 
response to numerous requests by citizens, who believed that the current social problems were 
being exploited by an aggressive form of proselytizing carried out in the name of freedom of 
worship that was sowing discord and tearing families and communities apart. Furthermore, those 
destabilizing acts were being carried out by unqualified and unauthorized persons. In short, 
whatever was applicable to Islam, the main religion in Algeria, had been extended to other faiths 
in the name of non-discrimination. To accuse Algeria, which was proud of being the homeland 
of Emir Abdelkader, the saviour of persecuted Christians, of intolerance was an oxymoron. 
Meanwhile, the evangelical proselytizing that was destabilizing the state of inter-faith 
coexistence was also affecting African countries, both those with a Christian majority and those 
where Muslims were predominant. 
</p>
<p>527. Public opinion in Algeria had been hostile to the missions of some of the special 
procedures and mandate holders. Algerians were in fact looking for stronger expressions of 
solidarity amidst the trials they had faced, particularly from human rights mechanisms and not, 
as had been the case, efforts to justify the acts of the criminals. Currently Algeria was on the path 
to reconciliation and a pacifying of hearts and easing of spirits. The situation had changed 
entirely, and life and hope had triumphed over terrorism. It was in the light of that situation that 
those mandate holders who had been unable to visit Algeria should explain why they wished to 
visit the country in their applications, which would be given careful consideration. Algeria did 
not have any particular dispute with those mechanisms that might be a source of concern, since 
their urgent appeals and communications were treated with diligence. 
</p>
<p><b>Poland 
</b></p>
<p>528. The review of Poland was held on 14 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Poland in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/POL/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/POL/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/POL/3). 
</p>
<p>529. At its 16th meeting, on 10 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Poland (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>530. The outcome of the review on Poland is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/30), together with the views of Poland concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/8/30/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>531. Poland reiterated that the universal periodic review constitutes one of the raisons d&#8217;&#234;tre of 
the Human Rights Council. Therefore, the Council&#8217;s credibility rests largely on the success of 
the review process. It believes that with the strong commitment of all the stakeholders, the 
universal periodic review can and will make a difference on the ground by improving the human 
rights situation in the States under review. 
</p>
<p>532. In this regard, Poland highly values all comments, questions and recommendations 
formulated in the course of the review process, which will allow it to better identify key 
challenges it is facing in the field of human rights. Poland commits itself to improving and 
further consolidating the national system of the protection and promotion of human rights on the 
basis of the review outcome. In this context, Poland also stands ready to share with other 
countries its best practices and experience concerning human rights. It also shared the following 
commitments and pledges: 
</p>
<p> (a) Poland will ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of death penalty; 
</p>
<p> (b) Measures will be introduced to streamline the implementation of the 
recommendations of the Human Rights Committee. The mandate of the Inter-Ministerial 
Committee for Matters Concerning the European Court of Human Rights will be extended to 
integrate therewith decisions of the Human Rights Committee; 
</p>
<p> (c) Poland is also committed to continuing actions to reduce poverty and social 
exclusion, which will remain a priority in our national social policy. Poland indicated that a new 
national programme on social security and social integration for 2008-2010, now under 
preparation, will strengthen assistance to families for the purpose of counteracting poverty and 
social exclusion of children. These actions are meant to equalize the opportunities of families 
and children, i.e. to eliminate educational deficits and improve access to services that will enable 
parents to reconcile their professional activities with the upbringing of children. In addition, the 
national programme will determine specific goals, including, in particular, lowering the poverty 
index and the index of poverty risk among children to achieve that the following actions will be 
undertaken by Poland: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Improvement of family incomes 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Development of the child day-care service system 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Levelling educational opportunities of and support for school-age children from poor 
families </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consolidating the system of assistance to families, family counselling; improvement of 
income support 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development of cooperation with non-governmental organizations will also 
contribute to the effective combating of poverty and social exclusion 
</p>
<p> (d) Poland pledges to further improve the situation of disabled persons. Due to its 
limited effectiveness, a review of the current system of vocational and social rehabilitation and 
employment of disabled persons, particularly with regard to vocational activation, will be carried 
out; 
</p>
<p> (e) Poland will strengthen measures to reduce domestic violence. It indicated that 
current solutions need to be adjusted in light of the insufficient social awareness of the threats 
domestic violence poses to individuals, families and society as a whole, as well as insufficient 
assistance to victims of violence. An annual evaluation of the implementation of the National 
Programme to Counter Domestic Violence for 2006-2016 will constitute the basis for its 
adjustment to actual needs. Eradication of violence from the family environment can first and 
foremost be achieved through the implementation of programmes promoting positive methods of 
childrearing and partnership in the family, some of which are carried out in collaboration with 
the European Union and the Council of Europe. In 2008 the law against domestic violence and 
the National Programme to Counter Domestic Violence will be amended, resulting in: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A complete ban on corporal punishment, and financial support for the implementation 
of projects against domestic violence at municipal level within the framework of the 
National Programme to Counter Domestic Violence 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The introduction of a warrant obliging the perpetrator to leave the house immediately 
after an incident of violence is reported by the victim 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The introduction of cost-free forensic medical examinations 
</p>
<p> (f) Poland will reinforce actions to implement equal treatment of women and men. A 
national programme for gender equality for the years 2009-2013 will be prepared, and the draft, 
on which consultations will be held with social partners and NGO representatives, covers the 
following areas of action: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Equal economic independence of women and men, including equality in the labour 
market 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reconciliation of family life and career 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participation in political life and decision-making 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Equality in the area of health care 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Eradication of all forms of gender-driven violence </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Eradication of gender stereotypes, including in schoolbooks and school curricula 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promotion of gender equality in external relations and development policy 
</p>
<p>The action plan for gender equality will reinforce the achievements of the Beijing Platform for 
Action and relevant international conventions, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women. In 2008-2013, the Ministry of Labour and Social 
Policy will carry out two projects involving research, training and promotion. The first one will 
be devoted to the reconciliation of career and family roles of women and men, and the second 
will be on the socio-economic activation of women at local and regional levels. In accordance 
with the draft law on equal treatment, the minister responsible for family matters and equal 
treatment, using data and analyses from independent research and in conjunction with other 
relevant bodies, will prepare a national programme against discrimination. The programme will 
determine adequate measures to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Raise social awareness of the root causes and effects of discrimination 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Counteract violations of the principle of equal treatment 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establish cooperation with relevant social partners involved in implementing equal 
treatment 
</p>
<p> (g) Poland will continue to combat and counteract racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism 
and hate crimes. Although these phenomena are not common in Poland, the Government is 
nevertheless determined to implement a wide catalogue of preventive measures of an 
institutional, legal and educational nature. Poland will continue implementing and evaluating its 
Programme for the Roma community, the National Programme against Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance 2004-2009, and the law enforcement officer programme for 
combating hate crimes. Moreover, the existing network of Human Rights Advisers attached to 
the Police Commander-in-Chief and Voivodship Police Commanders-in-Chief will conduct 
ongoing monitoring of incidents, trends and crimes related to discrimination and misconduct of 
law enforcement authorities. They will also make analyses and elaborate proposals on the 
improvement of the quality and methods of the work of the law enforcement. It is also planned to 
create the institution of Human Rights Advisers attached to the Border Guard; 
</p>
<p> (h) Poland will continue to participate in the World Programme for Human Rights 
Education, within the first stage of which education on human rights has been introduced into the 
core curricula of general education at primary and middle schools. Moreover, the Ministry of 
National Education has launched a number of other measures to promote education on human 
rights and the rights of child. Training to prepare activities for the advancement of human rights 
and combating discrimination in local communities has been carried out under numerous 
projects; 
 (i) Additional measures to level educational opportunities will be introduced. Poland 
will spare no effort to enable preschool-age children to enjoy their rights, among others through 
the creation of amenable conditions for developing various forms of preschool education, 
particularly in rural areas. The planned strategy for the development of education in rural areas  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>for 2007-2013 will be attuned to the Government Programme for the development of education 
in rural areas in the years 2008-2013. The strategic aim of the programme is to upgrade the 
quality and level of education in rural areas. Implementation of the measures facilitating access 
for children from rural areas and small towns to quality education will continue until 2013. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>533. No views were expressed by States members and observers of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>534. The Federation for Women and Family Planning (also on behalf of Action Canada for 
Population and Development, the Latin American Committee for the Defence of Women&#8217;s 
Rights and the International Women&#8217;s Rights Action Watch Asia-Pacific) indicated that, with 
reference to the National Programme against Domestic Violence (paras. 29 and 34 of the 
Working Group report), the legal framework for the protection of domestic violence victims is 
not effective. It noted that the possibility to isolate victims from perpetrators of violence is rarely 
used and only after the criminal proceedings are finished. It also noted that there is no effective 
infrastructure of shelters and centres assisting both the victim and the perpetrators. It further 
noted that too many people continue to believe that domestic violence is a private matter. In 
reference to the new provisions permitting to file an appeal when a doctor refuses to conduct an 
abortion (para. 51 of the Working Group report). It noted that access to abortion in Poland is 
restricted to three situations described in law and that Polish law does not foresee effective 
measures to review refusals of abortions. It noted that both legislative reforms and increased 
social awareness were necessary to tackle these problems. 
</p>
<p>535. The International Commission of Jurists drew attention to recommendation No. 20 and 
paragraph 30 of the report, as well as to the fact that the dialogue has not enabled full 
consideration of the issues of secret detentions or of renditions of terrorism suspects. It indicated 
that there is strong evidence that at least one CIA-run secret detention centre has existed in 
Poland, involving systematic gross violations of human rights. This imposes an international 
human rights law obligation on Poland to provide for a thorough, transparent, independent and 
impartial investigation. So far, the only national-level investigation has taken place in secret, 
with no published report, which fails to satisfy Poland&#8217;s duty to investigate alleged human rights 
violations. The International Commission of Jurists suggested that Poland establish a transparent 
and independent inquiry to investigate allegations of the involvement of Polish officials in secret 
detentions and renditions and make the outcomes of such investigations public. 
</p>
<p>536. Amnesty International welcomed the focus in the Working Group report on identity-based 
violence and discrimination. It shared the deep concern expressed by States during the review at 
the climate of fear that increasingly threatens the basic human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender people in Poland. It expressed the wish that Poland act upon the recommendations in 
the outcome report and take effective measures to combat discrimination; that it refrain from 
making public statements which could be interpreted as encouraging discrimination; that it 
ensure thorough and impartial investigations; and that those responsible be brought to justice. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Concerning the issue of the alleged involvement of the Polish authorities in the programme of 
secret detentions and renditions led by the United States of America raised during the interactive 
dialogue, Amnesty International regretted that no specific recommendations were included in the 
outcome report. 
</p>
<p>537. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights expressed satisfaction at the fact that the 
Polish Government has accepted most of the recommendations made during the review, 
especially those concerning the use of pretrial detention, the overcrowding of prisons and the 
prevention of discrimination. It noted that despite denials by the Polish Government, senior 
Polish security officials have confirmed to the Council of Europe that Polish territory was 
secretly used to hold some of the United States&#8217; most important detainees after 11 September. 
Although the Polish Government has promised to release the findings of Senator Marty&#8217;s report, 
these materials have never been made public, except at a press conference in which the 
Government denied the existence of any information regarding the use of detention facilities. In 
Marty&#8217;s opinion, this exercise was insufficient in terms of the positive obligation to conduct a 
credible investigation of the allegations of serious human rights violations. In the light of this, 
the Helsinki Foundation expressed its hope that Poland will engage in a dialogue on this issue. 
</p>
<p>538. The International Lesbian and Gay Association expressed great satisfaction that Poland has 
accepted most of the recommendations and that those concerning lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender people were addressed. As regards recommendation No. 6 on the adoption of an 
anti-discrimination law, it stressed that the proposition of Poland includes sexual orientation 
and gender identity only in employment and recalled that human rights standards in 
Europe on this matter include sexual orientation and gender identity in all contexts. It 
welcomed recommendation No. 27 encouraging Poland to enact a comprehensive body of 
anti-discrimination legislation and to set up a body to combat discrimination. It also expressed 
the hope that the new Plenipotentiary of Equal Status will be equipped with the sufficient 
resources to effectively perform its duties. In reference to recommendation No. 17 on the right to 
freedom of expression and association, it hoped that the decision of the European Court of 
Human Rights in this regard would be fulfilled and that the freedom of assembly be guaranteed 
to all. It also indicated that it would be suitable to include sexual orientation and gender identity 
as one of the grounds in the anti-hate speech criminal code provisions. Finally, in reference to 
recommendation No. 23 encouraging Poland to intensify its efforts to promote and protect 
dignity and equality, it noted the position of Poland that the issue of the Council of Europe&#8217;s 
handbook COMPAS on promoting human rights had been resolved. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed by the State under review  
on the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>539. In conclusion, the delegation reiterated that Poland<b> </b>is fully committed to make the 
universal periodic review process a success and to ensure that it will improve the situation of 
human rights at the national level. It stated that no country has a perfect human rights record and 
Poland is no exception. Poland is aware of its shortcomings in this field and it has been very 
clear about this in the national report and during the review process. What we need is to be 
constantly ready to respond to the new challenges in the promotion and protection of human 
rights. In this context Poland is convinced that the value of the UPR exercise lies not only in the 
presentation of human rights achievements but in particular in the identification of the key 
challenges that are still to be tackled. Poland perceives the recommendations made in the course </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the review process as an immense added value for further improvement of the human rights 
situations on the ground. Many of them reflect the challenges that Poland has already identified 
and is in the process of addressing. 
</p>
<p>540. The delegation of Poland thanked the representatives of civil society for their comments 
concerning the examination of the situation of human rights in the country. It stressed that the 
principles of openness and inclusion are of utmost importance in the review process, it refers in 
particular to the involvement of civil society. In this context, the delegation does hope that the 
lessons that were drawn from this experience will allow Poland to improve communication and 
cooperation with non-governmental organizations in the future. It noted that issues raised during 
the debate by non-governmental organizations, e.g. the problem of overcrowding in prisons, 
access to abortion, equal treatment, cases of discrimination based on sexual orientation, the 
question of secret flights and secret detention centres, pretrial detention and domestic violence, 
have already been discussed during the interactive dialogue that took place on 14 April. Some of 
them are also covered by recommendations formulated by the UPR Working Group; comments 
to them are to be found in the written responses of the Government to these recommendations 
(A/HRC/8/30/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>Netherlands 
</b></p>
<p>541. The review of the Netherlands was held on 15 April 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by the Netherlands in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/NLD/1); the compilation prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/NDL/2); and the summary 
prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/NLD/3). 
</p>
<p>542. At its 17th meeting, on 11 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on the Netherlands (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>543. The outcome of the review on the Netherlands is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/31), together with the views of the 
Netherlands concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the 
Working Group (see also A/HRC/8/31/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>544. The Netherlands stated that it had been an honour to be part of the very first session of the 
universal periodic review. It was of the opinion that the review had the potential to become a 
platform for the discussion of all the challenges and constraints, achievements and best practices 
of member States in the area of human rights. 
</p>
<p>545. The Netherlands was reviewed on 15 April, as the interactive dialogue the 
General Assembly had in mind when it adopted its resolution 60/251 in 2006. A total 
number of 37 countries intervened and many issues were raised, including on issues that were </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>currently the subject of debate in the Netherlands. It noted that the approximately 50 questions 
and 31 recommendations received would help it find answers to the challenges that the country 
was facing and to develop new thoughts and ideas for the future. 
</p>
<p>546. The Netherlands submitted its responses to the 31 recommendations to OHCHR 
(A/HRC/8/31/Add.1). In that document, the Netherlands tried to be as open and transparent as it 
had been during the review and earlier in its national report by substantiating why certain 
recommendations could or could not be supported. Many of the recommendations concerned 
integration, discrimination and migration issues, which were the subject of current public debate 
in the Netherlands. The Netherlands stated that it supported most of the recommendations and 
that they were generally in line with the Government&#8217;s policies, as explained in its national 
report. 
</p>
<p>547. The Netherlands further noted that two of the questions that it received in April still needed 
to be answered. The first one was from Slovenia, which expressed its concern at the lack of 
sufficient mental health services for adolescents, the prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse, 
teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. Slovenia also requested more 
information on programmes and measures to prevent or reduce drug and alcohol abuse. 
</p>
<p>548. The Netherlands assured that it offered a variety of education and prevention programmes 
designed for young people. Young people with alcohol and/or drug problems could turn 
to outpatient or inpatient clinics for help. The number of teenage births was relatively low and 
not rising and the number of sexually transmitted diseases had stabilized over the past two years. 
It also informed the Council that, with regard to mental health care, more resources had become 
available so that young people with severe behavioural problems could now have access to care 
more rapidly. 
</p>
<p>549. The second question came from Switzerland, which asked about the action plan on human 
rights education. The Netherlands pointed out that the action plan was currently being discussed 
within the framework of the human rights education platform, which was looking for ways to 
help schools to incorporate human rights into existing study programmes. Furthermore, it stated 
that a major challenge was posed by the limitation mentioned in its national report, namely that 
schools could not be ordered to include specific subjects in their curriculum. The Netherlands 
stated that it would inform the Council on progress in due course. 
</p>
<p>550. Moreover, the Netherlands took the opportunity to make some remarks about the universal 
periodic review process to date. Although a lot of work still had yet to be done, the Netherlands 
highlighted some trends developing in the first two sessions of the review that it considered to be 
promising for the future. 
</p>
<p>551. Firstly, it noted that the major human rights issues in every State under review had been 
raised in a constructive manner, showing that the intention of the General Assembly that the 
universal periodic review should be a cooperative mechanism based on interactive dialogue 
could actually work. Secondly, the Netherlands was pleased to see so many member States 
actively participating in the process. Thirdly, it experienced an increasing openness and 
transparency as the sessions evolve. For the moment, the Netherlands considered the review a 
&#8220;work in progress&#8221; that would ultimately contribute to the improvement of the human rights 
situation in all countries. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>552. The Netherlands pointed out that it should be kept in mind, however, that the universal 
periodic review was an additional tool for human rights monitoring, intended to complement and 
not duplicate the work of the treaty bodies and the special procedures. Furthermore, the review 
should not detract from the mandate of the Council to act upon gross human rights violations in 
specific countries. 
</p>
<p>553. The Netherlands was also of the view that it was crucial to have an open dialogue in the 
Council and at home; an open dialogue between States, but also between Governments and civil 
society. The Netherlands reported that, in its preparations for the universal periodic review, it 
had organized three consultative meetings with a total number of 24 Dutch human rights 
non-governmental organizations and other representatives of civil society. The last meeting had 
been held when its response to the 31 recommendations received was discussed. The 
Netherlands also stated that, directly following that review, the head of the Dutch delegation, 
State Secretary of Justice Nebahat Albayrak, had participated in a very useful side event for 
non-governmental organizations on the outcome of the Dutch review. The Netherlands expressed 
the view that policies designed through dialogue are more workable and effective than those 
conceived on the Government&#8217;s drawing board alone. 
</p>
<p>554. While the Netherlands noted that several countries had followed a similar procedure, it 
strongly encouraged others to opt for and stimulate a more active involvement of civil society in 
preparations for the review, the review itself, the concluding outcome meeting and the follow-up 
of non-governmental organizations, and to participate in country-based side events on the 
premises of the United Nations Office in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>555. The Netherlands stated that it was essential for a productive universal periodic review 
outcome that the voice of civil society be sufficiently heard by the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>556. No views were expressed by States members and observers of the Council.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>557. The International Commission of Jurists welcomed the delegation&#8217;s interaction with the 
universal periodic review mechanism and drew attention to recommendations Nos. 1, 9, 23 
and 29 and paragraph 26 of the summary of the debate. It was recommended, inter alia, to ratify 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and review the legislation in order to 
protect fundamental rights of all persons independently of their migrant status. The International 
Commission of Jurists noted that the ratification and the implementation of the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention against Torture would help improve the conditions of detention in the 
Netherlands, in particular in detention centres for immigrants. As regards counter-terrorism 
measures, it stated that the law expanding the powers to investigate and prosecute terrorist acts 
came into effect in the Netherlands in February 2007 and that the Netherlands must respect 
human rights obligations when implementing anti-terrorism measures and bring all anti-terrorism 
legislation in line with human rights standards. The Netherlands is late in submitting its reports 
to the treaty bodies, and often reports only on the European part of the State; recalling that the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee against Torture 
and the Human Rights Committee have all urged the Netherlands to report on the human rights 
situation in Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. 
</p>
<p>558. Aim for Human Rights reiterated the concerns that were prioritized by the Dutch coalition 
of 17 non-governmental organizations that are involved in the Universal Periodic Review 
process. This coalition stressed the importance of the participation of non-governmental 
organizations in all human rights debates. It noted that the Government has conducted an open 
dialogue with the non-governmental organizations, which is highly appreciated, but there are still 
concerns on substance. Aim for Human Rights stressed that the Netherlands should speed up 
ratification of important human rights instruments and comply with the recommendations made 
by treaty bodies. The coalition recommended the establishment of a national human rights 
institution in accordance with the Paris Principles before the end of 2008. It also stated that the 
Netherlands should develop and implement a holistic approach to preventing the spread of 
intolerance and discrimination on the grounds of religion, sexual orientation and ethnic origin, 
and that human rights education should be promoted in all schools. 
</p>
<p>559. International Association of Democratic Lawyers referred to the reported persecution of 
certain Filipino political exiles. Attention was drawn to the raids late last year on the offices and 
residences of the Negotiating Panel of a national liberation movement called the National 
Democratic Front of the Philippines. In light of the statement made by the Justice Secretary 
during the review, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers also asked how the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to respect human rights can be reconciled with what is viewed as 
unfounded arrest and labelling of asylum-seekers and what voluntary pledge the Government can 
make to guarantee that the legal processes are not affected by political interests. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed by the State under review  
on the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>560. The Netherlands concluded by repeating what the State Secretary of Justice had said in 
April. For the Netherlands, the universal periodic review was not a snapshot of a particular 
moment in time, but rather an ongoing process that should lead to a permanent focus on the 
promotion of human rights at the national level. The Netherlands therefore stated that it would 
not wait four years to write a new report for the next review, but would submit interim overviews 
to inform States and others on the implementation of recommendations and other relevant human 
rights developments in the Netherlands, including the pledges made when it submitted its 
candidacy to the Council. It stated that it would continue the dialogue that it has now started, 
including the one with civil society, and that it would include answers to the questions that were 
asked during the adoption of the outcome either in its first interim overview or in bilateral 
contacts to the extent that they had not already been addressed in its national report or in its 
response to recommendations. 
</p>
<p>561. Finally, the Netherlands thanked Nigeria, Pakistan and Peru, the members of the troika that 
had helped prepare the Working Group report on the Netherlands, the Council Secretariat and the 
staff of OHCHR. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>South Africa 
</b></p>
<p>562. The review of South Africa was held on 15 April 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the presentation of the 
national report made by South Africa in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/1/ZAF/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/ZAF/3). 
</p>
<p>563. At its 17th meeting, on 11 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on South Africa (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>564. The outcome of the review on South Africa is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/32), together with the views of South Africa 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>565. South Africa thanked the members of the Council and other participants for the active and 
interactive dialogue that was held on 15 April 2008, when the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review reflected on South Africa&#8217;s national report. South Africa remains indebted to all 
those countries which demonstrated a keen interest in the affairs of South Africa, particularly at 
this critical stage of its development. Challenges abound in South Africa, which is a young 
democracy. It grappled with the challenge of having to reverse, in concrete terms, the negative 
effects of institutionalized forms of racial discrimination and dispossession which lasted well 
over 300 years, under successive oppressive colonial regimes and apartheid. 
</p>
<p>566. The South African struggle over this dark period was primarily the struggle for human 
dignity and equality, for democracy and the rule of law and for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. South Africa is proud of the successes registered in the 14 years of its young 
democracy. As a deliberate Government policy, it embarked on a National Programme through 
the Parliament to repeal all the discriminatory legislation and to put in place a broad range of 
legislation promoting equality and dignity. The Government also put a particular emphasis on 
the rights of the vulnerable groups in the country, which during the apartheid era had suffered 
from multiple forms of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>567. Most of the recommendations proposed for South Africa require serious contextualization. 
Most of the recommendations have already been implemented through national legislation and 
policy programmes. It needs to be pointed out that the issue of corporal punishment in the home 
is being dealt with within the broader range of legislation covering domestic violence, i.e. the 
South Africa Domestic Violence Act. The Government has set up one-stop service centres 
(Thuthuzela Centres) where survivors of sexual assault can report crime, access specialist 
investigators and prosecutors and obtain medical care and counselling. The Department of Social </p>

<p>Development is in charge of implementing Social Development Programmes, which among 
others provides for social security and safety nets and other important services such as social 
grants for persons living with HIV and AIDS and other debilitating illnesses. 
</p>
<p>568. The Government has by legislation outlawed corporal punishment at school. It however 
acknowledges that there are isolated cases of non-compliance with legislation for which 
corrective measures are usually taken in accordance with the country&#8217;s Penal Code. The 
South African Schools Act focuses on the best interest of the child and respect for children&#8217;s 
dignity. South Africa promotes a human rights-based approach to all its educational policies, and 
these are strongly reflected into the National Curriculum Statement. This promotes the interests 
of the child and teaches the values of respect and dignity, diversity and non-discrimination. The 
Department of Education has initiated the Advanced Certificate Programme in Human Rights 
and Values Education for teachers, which is offered by universities, and enables teachers to act 
as champions for human rights in schools. Various other programmes contribute to this aspect as 
well. 
</p>
<p>569. Furthermore, the Department of Education has taken steps to ensure the right to education, 
and rights in education. Periodic reviews by the Human Rights Commission have ensured that 
these policies are effectively delivered. There is a racial integration strategy, an inclusive and 
non-discriminatory, non-religion policy in education, and a set of guidelines on managing sexual 
harassment in schools. These interventions are intended to ensure that no learner is unfairly 
discriminated against in education. The Bill of Rights is a constitutional imperative, and the 
Department of Education, working with religious leaders, has recently introduced a Bill of 
Responsibilities into schools, as a complement to the rights culture being established in the 
country. 
</p>
<p>570. School attendance in South Africa is relatively good, with universal primary education 
well established. A recent study on learner retention concluded that there is now near full 
enrolment until at least the ninth grade, after which there is a challenge regarding dropouts. 
However, at least 60 per cent of children complete 12 years of schooling. While financial 
constraints are cited as one reason for such dropouts, this has been alleviated through the 
following measures: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 40 per cent of schools have been declared &#8220;no fee schools&#8221;, in which parents are not 
expected to contribute anything towards the costs of education. This figure will be 
increased to 60 per cent in 2009. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It could also be noted that the funding of public schools is heavily weighted towards 
the poor, with school funding dependent upon the poverty ranking of the school. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; At schools with tuition fees, a system of exemptions, based on family income, is in 
place to ensure that pupils are not excluded from these schools because of the inability 
to pay. The rule of thumb is that a family earning less that 10 times the school fee is 
fully exempted from fee payments. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In addition, substantial loans and scholarships are made available to deserving students 
for study at the Further Education and Training College, at a university, or for teacher 
training. This has enabled large numbers of poor students to attend such institutions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>571. One seriously disturbing occurrence which shocked the conscience of an overwhelming 
majority of South Africans was the recent racial incident at the University of Free State in 
Bloemfontein. Through prompt action, the Government, upon recommendation of the 
Department of Education and other relevant stakeholders, decided to permanently close down the 
student residence at the University from which these acts were perpetrated. 
</p>
<p>572. In South Africa, everyone has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law. No one 
may be discriminated against on any ground. The Constitution extends this protection to all 
groups, including persons with alternative life and sexual orientations. Successful cases have 
been adjudicated upon by the South African Constitutional Court where discrimination on some 
of these grounds could be proven. 
</p>
<p>573. The Government is in the process of preparing legislation aimed at criminalizing all acts 
that are repugnant and demeaning of dignity in society. The areas covered in this regard include 
acts of racism, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as well as enforced 
disappearance. Some of the Bills are already at the stage of public consultation. The 
South African extradition policies are premised on the principle of non-refoulement. Just last 
week, the Government received the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate as part 
of the Security Council&#8217;s evaluation of South Africa&#8217;s respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p>574. The Government of South Africa is on record as having publicly deplored the recent acts 
of violence against foreigners in the country by individuals and groups, ostensibly motivated by 
xenophobia. The prompt and decisive intervention by the Government against individuals and 
groups responsible for these violent acts of xenophobia manifestly demonstrates that what 
happened cannot be described as State-sponsored xenophobia. In acknowledgement that many 
African countries hosted and welcomed many South Africans as refugees in their countries 
during the dark days of apartheid, South Africans have lived peacefully with immigrants of all 
types over many years. Thus, the South African Immigration Act is premised on inclusivity. The 
Government uses the annual Africa Day celebrations as an occasion to promote diversity and 
multiculturalism. 
</p>
<p>575. Many of the special procedures of the Council who previously visited the country 
legitimately recommended to the Government to consider ratifying the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. South Africa appreciates and welcomes this 
recommendation. The Government is currently looking at the appropriate structure which can be 
used as an &#8220;implementing agent&#8221; to coordinate the various rights resorting under this important 
instrument. The Government&#8217;s position is very clear that the enjoyment of civil and political 
rights is meaningless unless these rights are inextricably linked to economic, social and cultural 
rights. The Constitutional Court system, through its adjudications, has given international 
momentum to the notion of &#8220;justiciability&#8221; of economic, social and cultural rights. The 
delegation is currently spearheading an initiative within the framework of the Council aimed at 
the rectification of the legal status of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It 
is one of the few advocates of a very strong optional protocol which would guarantee the true 
meaning of the practical enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, including 
maximizing remedies for the victims whose economic, social and cultural rights have been 
violated. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>576. South Africa will update the Council in line with its voluntary commitments and pledges. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>577. Nigeria praised South Africa for taking the necessary measures to implement the 
recommendations it agreed to during the review. It expressed its optimistic view that with such a 
level of commitment, the primary objective of the universal periodic review as a mechanism 
intended to assess and determine the extent of the practical enjoyment of all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in each country will fully be realized. It welcomed the laudable progress 
made over the years by the Government to transform the State and deploy resources to give all 
citizens equal access to rights and provide equal services to all. It wished South Africa success in 
this endeavour. 
</p>
<p>578. Canada indicated that during the review, it had highlighted reports of abuse of migrants in 
South Africa and recommended that it ensure that the rights of migrants are respected. The 
violence that subsequently occurred in Johannesburg and a number of other urban areas in 
South Africa shows that addressing issues related to xenophobia and the abuse of foreign 
nationals will not be easy. The challenge is made greater by the ongoing movement of large 
numbers of Zimbabweans seeking to escape the deteriorating political and humanitarian situation 
in their country. It was encouraged by South Africa&#8217;s strong condemnation of these attacks and 
remains confident that the Government will do its utmost to promote tolerance, to combat 
prejudice and to ensure the safety of migrants. It also expressed its support to South Africa for its 
efforts. 
</p>
<p>579. Tunisia expressed its gratitude to South Africa for its commitment during the universal 
periodic review process. It commended it on the presentation and its efforts in the area of human 
rights, and noted with interest the information contained in the national report and the new 
provisions adopted in various areas in follow-up to the recommendations which resulted from the 
review. It also paid tribute to the leadership of South Africa in the area of combating racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. It further noted that the experience of 
South Africa in this area remains for all a source of inspiration and pride. 
</p>
<p>580. China noted that South Africa has not only completed successfully the peaceful transition 
from apartheid to a democratic society but has also established a comprehensive national system 
for safeguarding human rights and taken positive measures for the protection of human rights 
with remarkable progress. It noted that South Africa had hosted the historic conference against 
racism and had excellent cooperation with various United Nations human rights bodies. 
</p>
<p>581. Pakistan thanked the delegation of South Africa for its elaborate presentation on the 
outcome of the universal periodic review. It noted that South Africa faces a complex and 
challenging internal situation after years of racial discrimination. South Africa has invested great 
human and material capital to improve the human rights situation in the country, and it was 
urged to continue to implement its reforms policies to promote economic, social and cultural 
rights, democracy and the rule of law, the national programme against discriminatory policies, 
rights of vulnerable groups, education, and racial integration policies and policies against </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>xenophobia. It understands that the challenges faced by South Africa are enormous, but with the 
commitment displayed by the Government, South Africa will soon be able to overcome these 
challenges. 
</p>
<p>582. Botswana was encouraged by South Africa&#8217;s willingness to accept the recommendations of 
the Working Group and that most of them are already being implemented. It noted with 
appreciation the stance taken recently against xenophobic attacks on expatriates, which 
demonstrates the commitment of the Government to safeguarding the human rights of both 
South Africans and other nationals within its borders. 
</p>
<p>583. Algeria commended South Africa on having adopted, after the first democratic election 
in 1994, a reconstructive framework the primary goal of which was to address the historical 
legacy of inequality and create an integrated service delivery system to improve the quality of 
life of all South Africans. It noted that the Government is demonstrating a firm commitment to 
continuing to implement its human rights obligations and to address in the most appropriate 
manner xenophobic attitudes towards immigrants from neighbouring countries. It commended 
South Africa on following a coherent and structural approach to tackling poverty and 
underdevelopment by integrating appropriate measures into sectoral policies and strategies and 
by providing appropriate budgetary allocations thereto. With regard to HIV/AIDS, Algeria 
highlighted that through the establishment of the Medicine Pricing Regulation in 2004, the 
Government has made medicine affordable for all. It appreciated the fact that the challenge was 
addressed with a special focus on preventive programmes targeting adolescents. Concerning 
housing issues, it is impressed by the challenge that South Africa has met notably in addressing 
the phenomenon of &#8220;homelessness-landlessness&#8221;. Beyond the impressive increase in available 
housing and the adoption of legislation to address the issue of land reform, it acknowledged the 
strong constitutional and legislative protection measures taken to prevent illegal evictions and to 
provide judicial recourse for victims of illegal evictions. It stated that South Africa will continue 
to be a source of inspiration in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>584. Malaysia noted with appreciation the positive engagement of the Government of 
South Africa in the universal periodic review process, including its forthcoming responses during 
the interactive dialogue in the session of the Working Group. It noted South Africa&#8217;s 
commendable transformation into a vibrant democratic nation embracing the principles of the 
rule of law and sound socio-economic policies for its population. The benefits thereof have been 
acknowledged during the review of South Africa&#8217;s national report. It congratulated the 
Government on its efforts to further enhance the promotion and protection of human rights in the 
country, despite the existing challenges it continues to face. It reiterated its support to the 
Government&#8217;s leading role in the global fight against racism and racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>585. Egypt congratulated South Africa on the efforts made in the short period since 
independence, and in getting rid of the repulsive system of colonialism, apartheid and racial 
discrimination. It noted the progress achieved, including the framing of a modern constitution 
and legislation, as well as the establishment of proactive institutions. Egypt noted that these 
achievements were a good basis, though a work in progress, and was satisfied with the 
constructive and open spirit in which the Government would address any new and remaining 
challenges. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>586. Angola welcomed the readiness of South Africa to engage in an open and constructive 
dialogue regarding the situation of human rights and its cooperation with the universal periodic 
review. It expressed its appreciation for the efforts of the Government to improve the situation of 
human rights in all areas in spite of the challenges. It noted that South Africa is creating 
strategies to improve civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights and 
is showing a great commitment to improving human rights by ratifying a number of international 
human rights instruments and by accepting several recommendations to enhance human rights. It 
welcomed South Africa&#8217;s commitment to overcoming social challenges it faces and welcomed 
the policies undertaken to promote gender equality, notably in education. It expressed its 
appreciation for the South Africa Bill of Rights as it enshrines the rights of all people and affirms 
the democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom. It also welcomed South Africa&#8217;s 
efforts to achieve universal primary education by 2015. In this regard, it underlines the 
South African Schools Act 84 of 1996. It believes that only through education can a nation aspire 
to achieving sustainable growth and development. 
</p>
<p>587. The Syrian Arab Republic noted that South Africa&#8217;s acceptance and endorsement of the 
various recommendations was indicative of its determination in the field of human rights, despite 
the heavy legacy it inherited from the shameful ex-apartheid regime. These include the 
commitment to improve the handling by police of rape cases and to curb rates of violence, 
particularly against women and girls, to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, to ensure that the rights of migrants are respected, particularly by law 
enforcement officials, and to take measures to address the inequities in access to HIV/AIDS 
treatment and support, particularly in rural areas. It noted that the development burden inherited 
by South Africa was enormous, but that its achievements in the areas of housing, basic services, 
education and medical care in favour of the historically disadvantaged masses are genuinely 
unsurpassed in developing countries and deserve encouragement and full support. 
</p>
<p>588. Djibouti welcomed the review of South Africa, which after years of deprivation of the 
human rights of its people who suffered so much and after the apartheid regime has been able to 
establish an atmosphere and climate conducive to the establishment of a democracy which is 
multicultural and multi-ethnic. It noted that South Africa has been able to promote and protect 
human rights and dignity of its people. It encouraged it to continue along these lines. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>589. Human Rights Watch welcomed the important recommendations to address the problems 
of sexual violence, equal access to HIV retroviral treatment and the enhanced protection of those 
seeking safety from persecution. It noted that the treatment of migrants and asylum-seekers has 
become particularly relevant in view of the surge in xenophobic attacks. It noted that poverty has 
a strong rural dimension, and that South Africa&#8217;s Bill of Rights provides for binding and 
justiciable rights for all. It suggested that South Africa ratify the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and ensure equitable access to antiretroviral treatment for 
all sectors of society. It regretted the absence of a recommendation on the prevention of 
evictions. It supported the recommendation made to provide victims of discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation more accessible and rapid remedies, and suggested strengthening the 
Sexual Offences Bill to include a comprehensive package of protection for child victims in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>courts and to ensure that this bill is enacted without further delay. It believed that the review 
would be enhanced by broad and substantive participation and consultations with civil society 
and all branches of government. 
</p>
<p>590. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions welcomed the attention paid by South Africa 
to housing rights matters but was concerned that there were no recommendations on housing 
rights issues. It also expressed concern about the proposed amendments to the Prevention of 
Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act. A further cause for concern was a 
recently passed provincial legislation, the KwaZulu-Natal Elimination and Prevention of 
Re-emergence of Slums Act, and it was disturbing that other provinces were looking to adopt 
similar legislation, particularly considering the ongoing legal challenge to the constitutionality of 
this Act. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions welcomed the recent historic judgement in 
the case of <i>Mazibuko v. City of Johannesburg</i>, which, inter alia, increased the minimum amount 
of drinking water the city is obligated to provide to low-income residents in Phiri township in 
Soweto. It expressed serious concern at the escalation of forced evictions in Durban and other 
cities, noting that in Johannesburg, the &#8220;urban regeneration&#8221; and gentrification of the inner city is 
leading to the eviction of hundreds of thousands of desperately poor people. It suggested that the 
Council record these concerns and that the Government address them without delay. 
</p>
<p>591. Amnesty International welcomed the recommendations on the rights of asylum-seekers and 
migrants. It noted that despite assurances by South Africa, the recent wave of xenophobic 
violence in May 2008 against victims identified by the perpetrators by their perceived ethnic 
origin or status as &#8220;foreigners&#8221; or asylum-seekers demonstrated a need for much better State 
policies. It suggested that South Africa ensure that those subjected to this type of violence and 
displacement are afforded effective protection and access to legal remedies and humanitarian 
assistance. It noted that a full, independent and impartial judicial inquiry must be conducted into 
the violence, including that by law enforcement officials. It noted that the elimination of 
discriminatory barriers to access to health services for people living with HIV/AIDS continues to 
be a key challenge. It suggested that the Government address inequities, arising from poverty 
and gender-based violence, in the access to prevention, treatment, care, and support for those at 
risk of or living with HIV/AIDS, with particular attention to women in rural areas. It also noted 
with disappointment the limited participation of representatives from the capital in the review. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review  
on the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>592. In conclusion on the outcome review, the delegation of South Africa welcomed the 
opportunity to be reviewed as one of the first 16 States under the universal periodic review 
mechanism of the Council on 15 April 2008, at which it had the opportunity to present 
South Africa&#8217;s challenges, achievements and best practices to the Council and also to learn from 
the experiences of other member States. It also welcomed the active participation and 
collaborative spirit in which South Africa&#8217;s review was conducted, including the insightful 
comments and questions. The delegation noted with appreciation the very positive and 
constructive statements made in support of South Africa&#8217;s efforts to firstly achieve economic, 
social and cultural rights, especially from States which had experienced similar challenges in the 
past. Furthermore, the comprehensive reports and presentations by all States under review 
reflecting their achievements and best practices no doubt constitute valuable resources for 
countries that are looking for possible solutions to address their own challenges. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Czech Republic 
</b></p>
<p>593. The review of the Czech Republic was held on 16 April 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by the Czech Republic in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/CZE/1); the compilation prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/CZE/2); and the summary 
prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/CZE/3). 
</p>
<p>594. At its 17th meeting, on 11 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on the Czech Republic (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>595. The outcome of the review on the Czech Republic is constituted of the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/33), together with the views of the 
Czech Republic concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the 
Working Group (see also A/HRC/8/33/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>596. The Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva, in his introductory remarks, expressed his pleasure to represent the Czech Republic 
before the Council in this important exercise and welcomed the report, as well as the whole 
process starting with the preparation of the national report, continuing with the interactive 
dialogue on 16 April 2008, and the adoption of the outcome document. The Czech Republic was 
ready to continue the follow-up to the review, in cooperation with civil society and with a gender 
equality perspective. 
</p>
<p>597. Since the interactive dialogue on the situation of human rights in the Czech Republic, the 
Government had diligently considered all the recommendations raised during the discussion and 
a detailed written response to them had been submitted to the Council. 
</p>
<p>598. Regarding the rights of ethnic minorities, especially the Roma minority, the Government 
was aware of the need to continue its efforts through a number of initiatives aimed to eliminate 
all forms of discrimination or exclusion of individuals and groups defined by their race, colour of 
skin, nationality or language. A focused attention is being paid to the reduction of 
unemployment, improvement of the housing situation, health and prevention of social exclusion 
in Roma communities. 
</p>
<p>599. The recommendations related to the fight against Nazism and extremism were included 
and implemented in the framework of the Government&#8217;s anti-extremism policy. This policy also 
contains medium and long-term provisions, both of a preventive and repressive nature, against 
extremism, neo-Nazism, racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia. All activities leading to violence 
against groups of people and individuals, as well as any incitement to hatred against nations, 
ethnic groups, races or beliefs, and support of movements leading to suppression of the rights 
and freedoms of people, are criminal offences under Czech law. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>600. The Czech Republic deeply appreciated the contribution of human rights defenders to the 
protection of human rights and actively supported effective measures to improve their protection 
and to promote their activities worldwide. The Government remains committed to maintaining 
an environment conducive to the work of human rights defenders in the Czech Republic as well, 
enabling individuals, groups and associations to freely carry out activities to promote and further 
the protection of human rights. The Government Council for Human Rights, where an open 
dialogue between the Government and civil society representatives takes place, is one of the 
examples of such an environment. 
</p>
<p>601. Regarding the cases of sterilization of women without their proper informed prior consent, 
the Ombudsman identified 50 such cases. In some of them complaints were filed with a court, 
and in one case financial compensation of 200,000 euros was awarded together with an apology. 
In another case, an apology was awarded by the hospital. In response to these findings, 
additional measures were taken to improve the effectiveness of existing legal safeguards against 
such sterilizations. Detailed rules on sterilization will become part of the new law on specific 
medical services, which is being prepared and is expected to come into force in 2009. Further, 
the Government would be considering the proposal made by the Council to establish an 
interdepartmental working commission to examine past sterilization practices starting 
from 1 July 1966. 
</p>
<p>602. On the issue of cage beds in health-care and social care facilities, cage beds or net-beds 
have been banned by law since 1 January 2007. In health-care facilities the use of restraining 
means is currently regulated by internal guidelines, not by law. In March this year, the 
Government approved a motion requesting the Ministry of Health to prepare a new legal 
regulation which should follow the Council&#8217;s recommendations and contain a set of detailed 
rules and safeguards for use of any restraining means in health-care facilities. 
</p>
<p>603. The Government had for many years been exercising its strong resolve to fighting 
trafficking in human beings. The recommendations in this area enjoy its full support and are 
being implemented in compliance with the National Strategy of Fighting against Trafficking in 
Human Beings, which is being implemented since 2003 and is updated every two years. A 
number of measures continue to be taken regarding repression, prevention and care for the 
victims of trafficking, in accordance with the Palermo Protocol and other relevant international 
agreements and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>604. In the area of the protection of child rights and support to families, the Government&#8217;s 
current activities and plans in this regard conformed to the recommendations made. In 
March 2008, the Government tasked the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs to prepare a 
proposal on necessary measures for the transformation of the system of child protection, which 
would be submitted to the Government by the end of 2008. The long-term objective of this 
reform is to strengthen prevention and social assistance provided to families at risk and to 
improve conditions for the foster care in order to prevent the institutionalization of children. The 
Government is aware of the need to enable parents to combine their work and family life. A new 
system of a three-speed drawdown of parental allowance was introduced in January 2008, 
entitling parents to choose from three options of drawdown of parental allowance according to 
their reconciliation strategy, thus allowing families to choose the length of personal child care 
freely and to share responsibilities for child care within the family. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>605. Regarding the Yogyakarta Principles, currently a committee for issues relating to sexual 
minorities is being set up under the Government Council for Human Rights. The committee will 
work on implementing recommendations stemming from the recently prepared analysis of the 
state of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender minority, most of which are already in 
compliance with the Yogyakarta Principles, and stemming from the Yogyakarta Principles. 
</p>
<p>606. On the international political and legal framework for the protection and promotion of 
human rights, the Government remained committed to full cooperation and an open and 
constructive dialogue with all the monitoring treaty bodies and human rights special 
mechanisms. The Parliament is currently considering the Government proposal to ratify the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. In the course of this year, inter-departmental 
consultations will be taking place with a view to preparing a proposal to sign the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and the Ministry of 
Labour and Social Affairs will present to the Government a proposal to ratify the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto. The Government is of 
the view that the rights of migrant workers and their families are comprehensively protected 
under existing national legislation and international commitments, and is therefore currently not 
considering the signature of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>607. Regarding the recommendation related to trainings for the judiciary on international human 
rights law, the Czech Republic continues to strengthen this crucial aspect of education of legal 
professionals, which is attended by judges and public prosecutors. Some of these trainings are 
open also to members of other legal and court trainees, and seminars of continuing education are 
conducted for judges and public prosecutors with up to three years&#8217; experience. 
</p><p>608. The Government was ready to submit to the Council, in the coming months and years, 
information on all concrete developments that would be achieved in the areas covered by the 
recommendations as a proof of its commitment to the ultimate goal of the universal periodic 
review, which is to achieve concrete improvements in the situation of human rights in the 
countries under review. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>609. No views were expressed by States members and observers of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>610. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions, in a joint statement with Canadian 
HIV/AIDS Legal Network, welcomed the process and outcome of the universal periodic review, 
and the attention paid during the interactive dialogue and in the report in the Working Group to 
the severe exclusion of the Roma minority in the Czech Republic and to the need to tackle 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It requested that the record reflect specific 
concerns, including the lack of a Government response to the coercive sterilization of several 
hundreds of Roma women during the period from the late 1970s to 2004. The Government had 
not offered any clear indication as how it intended to rectify the current erosion of the right to 
adequate housing in domestic law. It was also unknown how the Government would desegregate </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the school system and deal with the Presidential veto of an anti-discrimination bill adopted by 
the Czech Parliament on 24 April 2008. It urged the Czech Republic to take account of these 
matters in the follow-up to the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>611. Amnesty International welcomed the focus in the review on the issue of discrimination 
against ethnic minorities and other marginalized groups. Amnesty International supports and 
welcomes suggestions to ensure that Roma are not discriminated against in the area of 
employment, health care, education, housing and access to justice. Roma continue to suffer from 
discrimination at the hands of both public officials and private individuals. They can often not 
obtain housing, even if they present financial guarantees. Segregation in the education system is 
widespread and Roma children are frequently placed in special schools for children with mental 
disabilities. Concern was also expressed at the fact that Roma women had been subjected to 
sterilization procedures without their full and informed consent. The Government should take all 
measures to stop such practices. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Views expressed by the State under review  
on the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>612. In his closing remarks, the Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic thanked all 
representatives who had taken the floor. Thanks were also expressed to all those who had 
devoted their time to studying the human rights situation in the Czech Republic and had raised 
concrete recommendations during the interactive dialogue. For the Permanent Representative, 
the delegation and his colleagues in the ministries, the universal periodic review had become a 
unique chance to see the human rights in the country through the eyes of all others, and they 
would continue working on its follow-up.

<p>613. The review of Argentina was held on 16 April 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Argentina in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/ARG/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/ARG/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/1/ARG/3). 
</p>
<p>614. At its 18th meeting, on 11 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Argentina (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>615. The outcome of the review on Argentina is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/34 and Corr.1), together with the views of 
Argentina concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the 
Working Group. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>616. The Permanent Representative of Argentina to the United Nations Office at Geneva 
reaffirmed the commitment of Argentina to the universal system for the promotion and 
protection of human rights, in particular the Council and its mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>617. For Argentina, the system of bodies created pursuant to human rights treaties and special 
procedures of the Council is one of the main achievements of the United Nations in the field of 
the promotion and protection of human rights at the universal level, and constitutes one of the 
principal tools of the Organization for ensuring the compliance with international human rights 
obligations assumed by States.  
</p>
<p>618. Argentina noted that in the framework of the reform of the United Nations system some 
three years ago, the establishment of the universal periodic review was one of the main 
innovations. The review mechanism enables the Council to assess the human rights situation in a 
given country within a framework of universality and non-selectivity, while ensuring equal 
treatment for all States in accordance with General Assembly resolution 60/251 which created 
the Council. 
</p>
<p>619. Argentina noted that with the two first sessions of the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review, the system has been put in place. Throughout these two sessions, a genuine and 
constructive international dialogue and an excellent cooperation among States took place, and 
this will certainly contribute to improving the compliance with human rights obligations and 
commitments. Nevertheless, Argentina noted that it is important to further improve the 
mechanism within the framework of the Working Group. In particular, it is necessary to work 
with a view to contributing to the uniformity of certain key aspects of the mechanism, such as 
the preparation of the reports of the Working Group, in coordination with the troika and the 
Secretariat, as well with regard to the format to be used for the section on recommendations. 
</p>
<p>620. Argentina was in the first group of countries to be reviewed in the context of the universal 
periodic review. Within the framework of the review of Argentina, 21 recommendations were 
made. The Government of Argentina has accepted all those recommendations. 
</p>
<p>621. Argentina considers that this last stage of the mechanism - the adoption of the outcome by 
the Council - is of particular importance since it makes it possible to include civil society in the 
process, in an active and participatory manner. Argentina has supported the participation of the 
civil society since the beginning of the negotiations on the institution-building process. 
Argentina highlighted the importance of contributions by non-governmental organizations to the 
debate. 
</p>
<p>622. Argentina also wished to emphasize the issue of follow-up to the recommendations and 
commitments made within the framework of the universal periodic review. The Council will in 
the future have the task of carrying out that work in the most appropriate manner. In this regard, 
Argentina has embarked on domestic measures to comply with the recommendations made 
during the review and with its voluntary commitments. Argentina will report in due course on 
the follow-up to the recommendations and commitments. Argentina indicated that it had already 
decided to announce its decision to recognize the competence of the Committee established </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance to examine individual complaints and inter-State communications, through a 
communication sent to the relevant office of the United Nations in New York. 
</p>
<p>623. Similarly, Argentina announced that on 21 May, the Congress approved the legislation 
authorizing the executive branch to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto, the Protocol to the American Convention on 
Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty and the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>624. The Government of Argentina is also developing new initiatives to comply with 
recommendation 4 in respect to witness protection, in particular those witnesses giving evidence 
in trials related to human rights violations. Argentina further indicated that it is committed to 
keep the Council informed of developments for the fulfilment of its commitments and follow-up 
to the recommendations, and reiterated its commitment to continuing to take an active part in the 
work of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>625. No views were expressed by States members and observers of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>626. The Latin American Committee for the Defence of Women&#8217;s Rights, in a joint statement 
with Action Canada for Population and Development, Fundaci&#243;n para Estudio e Investigaci&#243;n de 
la Mujer, Federation for Women and Family Planning, International Women&#8217;s Rights Action 
Watch - Asia Pacific, emphasized as a best practice meetings held by the Argentinean delegation 
with various organizations from the country which were present in Geneva prior to the adoption 
of the report of the Working Group, providing an opportunity to discuss the content and express 
concerns about the situation in the country. It also welcomed the adoption of a voluntary 
commitment to preserve and strengthen the role of non-governmental organizations. With 
reference to paragraphs 16 and 21 of the report regarding the effective implementation of 
Law 26.150 on sexual education, the organization welcomed that a minimum content was 
approved, including various forms of family organization, prevention of sexual abuse, birth 
control, respect for identities and gender equality, in compliance with recommendations 1, 2 
and 17 and a voluntary commitment made by Argentina on the implementation of a national plan 
to combat discrimination. 
</p>
<p>627. The Permanent Assembly for Human Rights stated that many challenges that Argentina 
was facing in the field of human rights were not included in the recommendations of the report 
of the Working Group. The Permanent Assembly for Human Rights urged the Government of 
Argentina to take measures to prevent the recurrence of violent deaths in jails, as well as to 
inquire in a prompt and impartial manner into crimes perpetrated in prisons. It expressed concern 
at the lack of transparency of the Division of Internal Affairs and the opportunity given to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>police to judge its own officers, and called on Argentina to reform the <i>Ley Organica de la 
Polic&#237;a Federal</i> and Act No. 21.695.965. Finally, the fact that the Security Secretariat was 
recently transferred within the competence of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, to 
which also the Human Rights Secretariat belongs, raised further alarm. 
</p>
<p>628. The Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos, with 
reference to recommendations 15 and 16 of the report of the Working Group regarding the 
protection of indigenous peoples, noted that they should be taken into account for the resolution 
of potential conflicts related to the social impact of the operations of mining industries on the 
lands of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>629. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions welcomed the attention paid to indigenous 
issues, especially indigenous rights to land, and of women, children and other members of 
vulnerable groups in the universal periodic review of Argentina. It was noted that the 
Argentinean national report made no reference to the realization of particular standards as 
defined, inter alia, in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
notably the right to an adequate standard of living for all. The lack of security of tenure and the 
continuing increase in forced evictions has not been adequately addressed. Argentina does not 
have a policy to prevent forced evictions and does not ensure adequate protection for those who 
lose their houses. The Centre on Housing and Evictions was also concerned that regularization 
and urbanization programmes in informal settlements are carried out in a discretionary basis and 
with uncertain results, without the possibility of recourse to judicial or administrative remedies. 
Argentina should transpose into the domestic legal order United Nations standards concerning 
housing rights and forced evictions as stated in general comments Nos. 4 and 7 of the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>630. Action Canada for Population and Development, with reference to paragraphs 16 and 25 of 
the report of the Working Group, regretted that the discussion of the issue of women&#8217;s sexual 
and reproductive health and rights did not result in any recommendation. Implementation of the 
National Law on Sexual and Reproductive Health mentioned in paragraph 16 is very unequal 
across the country, due to the lack of political will on the part of some authorities and uneven 
distribution of contraceptive devices to public hospitals. It noted that unsafe abortion, being the 
leading cause of maternal mortality, is a problem of social justice because it affects poor women 
in a disproportionate way. It stressed the importance for the Government to take action to protect 
women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; lives by, inter alia, guaranteeing ample provision of contraceptive devices to 
stop abortions, regulating the provision of therapeutic abortions that are currently allowed by 
law, and providing proper medical care to women and girls who have undergone unsafe 
abortions. 
</p>
<p>631. The Centre for Women&#8217;s Global Leadership stated that, in spite of some legislative 
advances, Argentina still lacks a clear agenda for women&#8217;s rights. In order to implement 
adequately recommendations 1, 2, 3, 17 and 18 of the report on the review of Argentina, a 
number of important issues should be addressed, namely the lack of sex-disaggregated official 
data on violence against women; women&#8217;s vulnerability to HIV infection; the steadily decrease 
of the budget of the <i>Consejo Nacional de la Mujer</i>; the State&#8217;s failure to implement the 
recommendation made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to incorporate domestic work - 90 per cent of which is performed by women - into the national 
accounts; and public housing plans&#8217; preference to two-parent households, which are 
discriminatory for families led by women. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review on  
the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>632. Argentina thanked the various actors who have made it possible for this new mechanism to 
come to life for their work and efforts, in particular, the President, the Secretariat of the Council 
and the delegations that worked in the preparation of the guidelines and modalities for the 
process, the methods to elect the States to be reviewed and the troika members. Argentina also 
expressed its appreciation to the troika members for Argentina - the delegations of Cameroon, 
Cuba and Ukraine - for their work and efforts during the review, as well as for the constructive 
spirit and dialogue on issues under consideration. 
</p>
<p>633. Argentina thanked OHCHR for Human Rights for its crucial cooperation and support. The 
inputs provided by the Office, both substantive and logistic, made a significant contribution to 
the mechanism, in particular, for the consolidation of the practice in the preparation of reports, 
which include the views and contributions from the treaty monitoring bodies, the special 
procedures mechanisms and the civil society. The contributions from stakeholders and other 
actors strengthen the mechanism and should be further supported and consolidated in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>634. Argentina noted that it had also taken due note of the statements and suggestions expressed 
during the adoption of the final outcome of the review. Argentina reiterated its firm support to 
the universal periodic review as well as its commitment to continue to work in a constructive 
way within the framework of the review mechanism in the near future. 
</p>
<p><b>Gabon 
</b></p>
<p>635. The review of Gabon was held on 5 May 2008, in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Gabon in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/GAB/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/GAB/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/GAB/3). 
</p>
<p>636. At its 18th meeting, on 11 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Gabon (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>637. The outcome of the review on Gabon is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/35), together with the views of Gabon concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>638. Gabon had ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
on 20 September 2000 and had signed the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance in 2007. The Convention was under consideration in 
Parliament with a view to its forthcoming ratification. In the same spirit, the Government had 
decided in the wake of the recommendations made by the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review to speed up the ratification of a number of instruments, including the Optional 
Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. A bill abolishing the death penalty had been submitted to Parliament for adoption in 
the near future. 
</p>
<p>639. With regard to the protection of minors, a number of criminal justice reforms were under 
way and a bill on the punishment of sexual violence had been adopted by the Inter-Ministerial 
Council and the State Council. The bill took into account the special situation of child victims of 
sexual violence and provided for a stiffening of existing penalties, particularly for rape. 
</p>
<p>640. A bill establishing a juvenile court system, which had been prepared with the assistance 
of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), had been submitted to Parliament, while 
a draft decree establishing educational facilities in prisons would soon be submitted to the 
Inter-Ministerial Council and the State Council. Once that text had been adopted the Government 
would launch an appeal for funding for juvenile detention and rehabilitation centres. Minors 
were currently detained in areas known as &#8220;juvenile quarters&#8221;. 
</p><p>641. Pursuant to article 177 of the Labour Code, Gabon had adopted 
Decree No. 0031/PR/MTEFP, on child labour, and Act No. 09/2004, on the prevention 
and combating of trafficking in children, with a view to ensuring the consistency of 
national legislation with the principles set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>642. In the area of women&#8217;s rights, the following activities had been undertaken: an 
Observatory for Women&#8217;s Rights and Equality had been established; day-care centres had been 
created to provide assistance to working child-mothers; a special prize for the promotion of 
women&#8217;s socio-economic activities had been established; and the State had been encouraged to 
develop a structure for the coordination of women&#8217;s organizations. Women had the same rights 
as men in Gabon. A Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs, which had subsequently become the Ministry 
for the Advancement of Women, had been created to deal with all questions relating specifically 
to women. 
</p>
<p>643. The highest authorities in the country had taken a number of initiatives aimed at making 
the Gabonese press free and diverse. One such initiative was the establishment, by means of Act 
No. 14/91 of 24 March 1992, of the National Communications Council, a regulatory body 
governing the broadcast media and the press in Gabon. A press code had also been prepared with 
the involvement of media professionals, including journalists&#8217; unions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>644. Freedom of the press was thus guaranteed by law. While the press was governed by a 
simple registration system, the broadcast media were subject to licensing, as Gabon was a young 
multi-ethnic State with underpinnings that were still somewhat fragile. Given the media&#8217;s impact 
on the population, it was sometimes necessary to ensure that that balance, which was a work in 
progress, was not disrupted. 
</p>
<p>645. With regard to the Pygmy population, the Gabonese delegation drew attention to all the 
measures that had been described during the review by the Working Group. With the support of 
the international community, the Government had formulated a plan of action aimed at 
protecting that population and protecting its rights more effectively. In addition, an integrated 
development project for Pygmies had been set up in collaboration with UNICEF. 
</p><p>646. Civil society was becoming organized with support from the State, pursuant to 
Act No. 35/62 of 1962, governing associations. Laws and regulations guaranteed the exercise of 
trade union freedom. Thus the right to strike was recognized, provided that the regulations in 
force were observed. To date no trade union member had been detained on account of his or her 
union views. 
</p>
<p>647. In order to meet the requirements of the treaty bodies, Gabon had created, by means of 
Decree No. 000102/PR/MDHCCLEI of 15 January 2007, a National Committee for the Drafting 
of Human Rights Reports. When the Committee had been established, the various constituent 
administrations had been informed of the deadlines and timetables for the submission of the 
various reports. With regard to the request of the Special Rapporteur on the right to education to 
visit Gabon, the delegation invited the Special Rapporteur to resubmit his request through the 
Permanent Mission of Gabon to the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States of  
the Council on the review outcome  
</b></p>
<p>648. Algeria congratulated Gabon on its cooperation and commitment to the promotion and 
protection of human rights despite the challenges due to the development needs in Gabon. 
Algeria appreciated the spirit of dialogue and cooperation with which Gabon has undertaken the 
exercise and its desire to meet its commitments in the sphere to human rights. Algeria noted the 
success of the new mechanism of the Council based on cooperation and interaction, thus 
allowing States to improve the situation of human rights in harmonization with their national 
priorities. It welcomed the decision of the Government to endeavour to increase school 
attendance and equal access for boys and girls to education. It noted Gabon&#8217;s commitment to 
pursuing its effort in the area of economic, social and cultural rights. Algeria also welcomed the 
establishment of a body to reduce the time for ratification of treaties. It noted that Gabon requires 
technical and financial assistance to implement its commitments and renewed its call to the 
international community to provide such assistance. Algeria referred to the issue of the follow-up 
by OHCHR in the sphere of technical and financial assistance to the implementation of the 
recommendations, which applies to Gabon and other countries and requested further information 
on the measures being taken to implement this. 
</p>
<p>649. Morocco congratulated Gabon on its exhaustive presentation and noted Gabon&#8217;s active 
role for peace in the region and its policies of constructing the rule of law within their country. 
It noted the establishment of drafting committees on treaty bodies, standard-setting </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>institution-building activities to increase awareness of human rights, the development of a plan 
to combat exploitation of children, the establishment of an observatory on women and gender 
parity and the designation of women ministers for one third of the portfolios. It also noted as 
evidence of Gabon&#8217;s commitment the translation into the national languages of the human rights 
treaties and the posting of their contents in police stations, and the training of police and prison 
staff in human rights. Morocco also noted Gabon&#8217;s recognition of its shortcomings in its human 
and institutional resources, which hamper efforts to promote all human rights. Morocco 
expressed trust that OHCHR and Gabon&#8217;s development partners would hear this appeal to 
strengthen its capacity in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>650. China noted Gabon&#8217;s active preparation for the national report and its honest and 
constructive approach during the interactive dialogue. It also noted that Gabon introduced during 
the review its achievements in promoting and protecting human rights such as ratifying 
international human rights conventions, establishing human rights commissions and formulating 
programmes of action on poverty reduction and on the protection of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s 
rights. It noted that Gabon also referred to gaps and challenges such as a high poverty rate and 
the foreign debt pressure. It noted Gabon&#8217;s determination to promote and protect human rights 
and indicated that Gabon will continue to make positive efforts in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>651. Egypt congratulated Gabon on the constructive and positive way in which it participated in 
the universal periodic review. It noted with appreciation the progress made by Gabon in the 
promotion and protection of human rights and for the promotion of democratic practices in the 
country. It appreciated that Gabon requires further time to implement the recommendations made 
by the Working Group and noted that further analysis may be carried out in the future. Egypt 
thanked Gabon for the presentation made and was convinced that the relevant authorities in 
Gabon will spare no efforts to put into practice the recommendations made and to further the 
promotion and protection of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>652. Djibouti noted the progress achieved for the promotion and protection of human rights in 
Gabon and expressed its support to future activities to be carried out in the implementation of the 
recommendations addressed to Gabon. It recalled the quality of the national report and 
presentation during the review. Djibouti congratulated Gabon for its spirit of openness, frankness 
and seriousness which characterized the answers it provided by Gabon to questions raised during 
the interactive dialogue. Djibouti was convinced that this same spirit of seriousness would 
prevail in the implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>653. Nigeria commended Gabon on the presentation and the extensive preparation of reports 
and noted the recommendations which Gabon indicated it will implement fully. Nigeria noted 
the challenges Gabon faces and that it has undertaken a number of actions to implement the 
recommendations referred to, including on education, which is quite comprehensive, gender 
mainstreaming and women&#8217;s rights. It also noted that these challenges will require international 
support in order to implement fully the recommendations made by the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>654. No comments were made by other relevant stakeholders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review on the  
outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>655. The delegation of Gabon wished to thank the troika, composed of Nigeria, China and 
Azerbaijan, for their efficient drafting of the report of the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review, as well as the members of the Working Group and all delegations present at the 
meeting of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>Ghana 
</b></p>
<p>656. The review of Ghana was held on 5 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Ghana in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/GHA/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/GHA/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/GHA/3). 
</p>
<p>657. At its 18th meeting, on 11 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Ghana (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>658. The outcome of the review on Ghana is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/36), together with the views of Ghana concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>659. The Permanent Representative of Ghana to the United Nations Office at Geneva, in his 
opening remarks, welcomed the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, 
which was discussed on 7 May 2008. The report covered, inter alia, the interactive dialogue 
held during the review and the conclusions and recommendations made by delegations. 
The Government of Ghana confirmed its acceptance of the 22 recommendations listed in 
paragraph 68 of the report. In accordance with the undertaking made by the delegation at the 
review, the Government had carefully examined the other recommendations listed in 
paragraph 69 of the report and wished to reply as follows. 
</p>
<p>660. Regarding the abolition by law of the use of corporal punishment in all situations, all 
punishment in Ghana must be reasonable. Corporal punishment in its classical sense had been 
abolished. Caning could only be exercised by the principal of the school and only in specific 
circumstances and under specific guidelines; any breach of these guidelines was sanctioned by 
law. Unreasonable punishment in the home was also sanctioned by existing laws, including the 
Domestic Violence Act, the Children&#8217;s Act and the Criminal Code of Ghana. 
</p>
<p>661. Concerning the recommendation on the adoption of a legal moratorium on the death 
penalty and the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights aimed at the abolition of the death penalty, the Representative referred to the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>previous response of Ghana at the universal periodic review session held in May 2008, and 
reiterated the fact that this was an entrenched provision in the Constitution that required a 
referendum before it could be amended. In the interim, the Government would continue to 
maintain the de facto moratorium on the application of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>662. Regarding the enactment of the Freedom of Information Bill, Ghana shared the view of 
those who had made the recommendation for such a law, that it was important and that it was 
intended to consolidate democracy. It was with this mind that the Right to Information Bill was 
being prepared within the framework of ongoing consultations with relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>663. With regard to the recommendation concerning the implementation of measures to abolish 
polygamy in Ghana, in accordance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, Ghana informed the Council that there were three forms of 
marriage in the country: the ordinance marriage, the customary law marriage and Islamic 
marriage. With the exception of ordinance marriage, the other forms of marriage were in 
conformity with the customs and traditions of Ghana. With regard to faith-based marriages, 
chapter 5 of the Constitution guaranteed freedom of religion. There was therefore a problem in 
abolishing the practice since it would be an infringement of the right to practise one&#8217;s faith. 
</p>
<p>664. The recommendation on combating discrimination against minority groups, immigrants 
and children with disabilities was found to be rather curious, and Ghana was therefore not able to 
accept it, given that the situation that the Government was required to fight against did not even 
exist. The Constitution of Ghana guaranteed the protection of rights of all individuals and groups 
resident within its territory and, for that matter, all acts that tended to deny any such individual or 
group of people their inalienable rights could be sanctioned. Ghana continued to host a large 
number of immigrants, including those who had fled their countries as a result of social unrest, 
economic deprivation or otherwise, and who, over the years, had come to consider Ghana their 
home. Such people were guaranteed their rights as long as they abided by the rules and 
regulations that contributed to making the country a safe haven for both its citizens and 
foreigners. The Disability Act and the Children&#8217;s Act had both been passed to protect the rights 
of children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States of  
the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>665. Algeria congratulated Ghana on the comments and responses made to the 
recommendations put forward during the session of the Working Group and was encouraged by 
the willingness of Ghana to implement its human rights obligations notwithstanding the 
challenges the country faces, particularly in the area of development. Algeria reiterated the 
appeal it made during the session of the Working Group to provide assistance to Ghana so that it 
can continue to improve its human rights. Algeria appreciated that Ghana had accepted Algeria&#8217;s 
recommendation regarding women&#8217;s rights and also appreciated Ghana&#8217;s willingness to improve 
the quality of its educational system, to increase the school enrolment rate and fill the gap 
between boys and girls in the field of education, despite significant challenges. Algeria 
encouraged Ghana to continue its work and the Council to adopt the outcome of this review. 
</p>
<p>666. Luxembourg indicated that the spirit of dialogue and cooperation shown by Ghana was 
welcomed. The commitments of Ghana made with regard to the recommendations were also </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>welcomed, especially the recommendation related to the right to food. Ghana was encouraged to 
effectively pursue work with regard to the recommendations that had not yet been accepted, 
especially those regarding the abolition of the death penalty, the decriminalization of sexual 
activity between consenting adults or the abolition of polygamy. 
</p>
<p>667. Senegal said that the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
testified to Ghana&#8217;s full commitment to promoting and protecting its citizens. Ghana&#8217;s 
acceptance of the majority of the recommendations was also noted. Senegal encouraged Ghana 
to continue with its efforts and possible follow-up with the view to improving the national 
human rights situation. Senegal expressed its congratulations to Ghana for its re-election to the 
Council and for its seriousness in the universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>668. Nigeria congratulated Ghana for its presentation, and commended it on the open, 
transparent and constructive manner it had engaged with all parties in the process. It welcomed 
the steps taken thus far by Ghana to fully implement the recommendations made during the 
review and its commitment to addressing human rights challenges. The various mechanisms put 
in place over the years by the Government to eradicate poverty and create a conducive 
environment for youth empowerment were commendable. Nigeria noted that Ghana has a great 
reputation in the subregion for the quality of its education and for gender mainstreaming, and 
encouraged it to continue with its socio-economic and political reforms that enhanced human 
rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>669. Egypt thanked the delegation of Ghana for the exhaustive answers it had provided. This 
demonstrated Ghana&#8217;s true political will to create a national environment so that real, radical 
change could take place in the country which ensured further the promotion and protection of 
human rights. Such a process is an ongoing one and requires transfer of expertise, and Egypt 
hoped that Ghana would pursue this path and continue its cooperation with civil society in order 
to advance human rights and meet the aspiration of the population. It expressed its understanding 
that Ghana had not been able to accept some recommendations. 
</p>
<p>670. Malaysia congratulated Ghana on its presentation which focused on the commitments of 
the Government following the recommendations made in the report of the Working Group. 
Malaysia commended Ghana on its comprehensive efforts towards the promotion and protection 
of human rights in Ghana and its positive engagement with the Universal Periodic Review 
process. The Government of Ghana had implemented various strategies in the human rights 
sphere, specifically those regarding education, health, trafficking of persons and domestic 
violence. The Constitution of Ghana provided free education for every child. Further, Malaysia 
recognized the efforts made by Ghana to address the issue of child labour. 
</p>
<p>671. Uganda congratulated Ghana on the steady improvement of its human rights record and its 
commitment to addressing challenges by putting in place legislation in particular to address 
problems of corruption, domestic violence, human trafficking and child labour. Uganda 
commended Ghana on its efforts to increase women&#8217;s participation in governance and noted 
universal primary and secondary education as the way forward, especially among the poorest of 
the poor in remote areas of Ghana. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>672. India congratulated Ghana on its open and frank interaction during the universal periodic 
review. India noted that Ghana had accepted the majority of the recommendations made and 
commended Ghana on its constructive approach. India expressed the hope that the 
recommendations would be implemented for a brighter future in Ghana. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>673. Amnesty International welcomed recommendations made on the use of the death penalty, 
including the establishment of a moratorium on executions and the removal of the death penalty 
from domestic law. It however regretted that, Ghana was not able to support the recommendation 
on this issue. Amnesty International welcomed that no executions had been carried out for the 
past 15 years, but remained concerned that death sentences continued to be handed down, Ghana 
was encouraged to complete the reform of the judicial system and to urgently address the issue 
of prison conditions, including the problem of acute overcrowding. Further, Amnesty 
International was concerned at reports suggesting that the police fail to bring suspects before a 
judge within 48 hours of arrest, as guaranteed in Ghana&#8217;s Constitution. Amnesty International 
encouraged the Government to ensure that anyone held was charged with a recognizable criminal 
offence or released; and that the cases of those awaiting trial were regularly reviewed to ensure 
their right to a fair trial. 
</p>
<p>674. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions welcomed Ghana&#8217;s support of 
recommendation 23 in the report of the Working Group to include a gender perspective and a 
rights-based approach into issues related to the right to adequate housing. It noted that Ghana&#8217;s 
poor struggled with issues of sanitation, infrastructure, natural disasters and floods. It was also 
concerned about the current rent act. It commended Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Water Resources, 
Works and Housing on having initiated a consultative process to enable stakeholder inputs into a 
national shelter policy. It also congratulated several Governments for commenting on the rights 
of women in Ghana. It was concerned that outside the area of inheritance few questions were 
raised about women&#8217;s housing, land and property rights. Although Ghana had ratified a number 
of international treaties, it noted that Ghana had yet to ratify the Protocol to the African Charter 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights related to women rights in Africa. 
</p>
<p>675. The Food First Information and Action Network thanked the delegation of Ghana for its 
openness during the universal periodic review process, but noted that a statement made by the 
Minister of Justice and Attorney-General had not been truly reflected in the report. According to 
it, the Minister had said that it was true that at a certain point, joint military and police teams had 
been protecting mining companies driving away illegal miners, but that it had been a short-term 
measure. This had been the first time that the Government had announced the discontinuation of 
military support for mining companies. This announcement had demonstrated that the review 
process could be a valuable instrument. The announcements made by Ghana were laudable, but 
only if they are implemented and it was convinced that the Council could play a role in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review on the  
outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>676. In his closing remarks, the Permanent Representative stated that Ghana was thankful to all 
Member States and the stakeholders who had participated in the review exercise for their very </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>important and constructive contributions, offered by way of comments, observations, criticisms 
or recommendations. The review had been enriched by those contributions and Ghana was 
grateful. He conveyed the sincere appreciation of Ghana to the troika members - Sri Lanka, 
Bolivia and the Netherlands - for their understanding, commitment and cooperation, which were 
vital to achieving the balanced report that they had before them. In a similar vein, he thanked the 
Secretariat for its extremely helpful role in facilitating the compilation of the report. The 
delegation of Ghana further wished to reiterate the importance that Ghana attached to the 
promotion and protection of human rights and to the universal periodic review process, which 
sought to improve the human rights situation on the ground. Ghana would continue to discharge 
its responsibilities by ensuring that all its citizens enjoyed the full compliments of a safe and 
sound society in which the respect for human rights was pre-eminent. 
</p>
<p><b>Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>677. The review of Guatemala was held on 6 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Guatemala in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/GTM/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/GTM/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/GTM/3). 
</p>
<p>678. At its 18th meeting, on 11 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Guatemala (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>679. The outcome of the review on Guatemala is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/38), together with the views of Guatemala 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>680. The Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Guatemala to the United Nations and 
other International Organizations in Geneva indicated that it was an honour to receive on behalf 
of the Government of Guatemala the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review. Guatemala welcomed the various recommendations resulting from the review that took 
place on 6 May 2008. Guatemala fully concurs with the concerns on specific issues reflected in 
the recommendations. It reiterated the political will of the current Government of Guatemala and 
the importance and priority that it attaches to the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>681. Guatemala highlighted the considerable challenge it will be facing to implement in practice 
the recommendations on various issues, noting that it will need to strengthen its actions in the 
following areas: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ratification of international instruments; 
</p>
<p> (b) Improvement of the constitutional and legislative framework; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Establishment or strengthening of institutional and human rights infrastructure; 
</p>
<p> (d) Increasing the already solid cooperation with human rights mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> (e) Adoption of additional measures to combat discrimination and to obtain equality for 
indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p> (f) Ensuring the right to life, liberty and security; 
</p>
<p> (g) Strengthening the administration of justice and the rule of law; 
 (h) Guaranteeing the freedom of expression, opinion and participation in political life of 
the country; 
</p>
<p> (i) Ensuring effective enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p><p>682. A number of measures were already being taken for adequate follow-up to the 
recommendations and encouragement of actions with a view to their implementation. One of 
those measures has been the convening of government and State institutions that integrate the 
High Level Human Rights Commission, which is coordinated by the Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs, with a view to disseminating the recommendations and jointly defining a strategy for 
follow-up and implementation. 
</p>
<p>683. Guatemala highlighted the need to link the universal periodic review recommendations to 
those made on the same issues by treaty monitoring bodies and a number of thematic rapporteurs 
and working groups that have visited the country. Guatemala stated that it will have a 
comprehensive national plan of action to follow-up on the recommendations made by various 
human rights monitoring bodies of the United Nations, including the specific recommendations 
made by OHCHR in Guatemala. It further indicated that the responsibility for the follow-up will 
be exercised by the Presidential Human Rights Commission (COPREDEH), with the support of 
the High Level Commission and other relevant government institutions. With the support of 
OHCHR in Guatemala, COPREDEH was currently defining a methodology to be discussed with 
relevant institutions. Once an agreement in that regard had been reached, it will proceed with its 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>684. Actions are already being undertaken in many of the areas highlighted in the 
recommendations and Guatemala will thus seek to reinforce its efforts, including through 
additional actions to ensure more effective results. Furthermore, some good practices were 
identified in the interactive dialogue. Guatemala indicated that it hopes it will be able to share 
additional good practices in the next universal periodic review dialogue. 
</p>
<p>685. Guatemala appealed to States that have gone through the review process to, in the near 
future, exchange good practices with respect to national mechanisms being set up to monitor and 
implement the universal periodic review recommendations, in particular countries of the region. 
Guatemala reiterated its request to OHCHR, in particular its Office in Guatemala, to accompany 
and support its national efforts in the process. It also appealed to the friendly countries to 
continue their cooperation, support and technical assistance, so as to comply with the 
recommendations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>686. Guatemala thanked the member countries of the troika, the Working Group and the 
Secretariat for their support, as well as the States that participated in the interactive dialogue, 
noting that their participation reflected their concern and solidarity with the people of 
Guatemala. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States of the Council  
on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>687. India commended Guatemala on the open and fruitful exchange of views that took place 
during the review and welcomed the detailed responses given to the recommendations, which 
shows the seriousness with which these have been considered. India noted the reiterated political 
will expressed by Guatemala and its full commitment to the promotion and protection of human 
rights and stated that this positive approach was also evident in the engagement of Guatemala 
during the universal periodic review process. India wished full success to Guatemala in further 
improving the situation of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>688. Slovenia expressed its appreciation to the commitment expressed by Guatemala 
throughout the whole universal periodic review and commended the fact that it accepted all the 
recommendations addressed to it and the spirit in which it was done. Slovenia welcomed in 
particular that Guatemala accepted the recommendations made by its delegation during the 
review. It called on Guatemala to consider informing the Council on a voluntary basis on the 
progress made in implementing the recommendations prior to the next review in four years time. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>689. Franciscans International emphasized the openness to dialogue displayed by the national 
delegation during the review on the issue of violence against children and adolescents in 
Guatemala. It noted with satisfaction the Government&#8217;s intention to implement a national policy 
to combat juvenile violence, which would in practice prevent juvenile violence and encourage 
education for boys and girls who are victims of violence, or engaged in the &#8220;maras&#8221;, the youth 
gangs. It noted that prevention and education were key to breaking out of the circle of violence, 
and requested Guatemala to devote adequate resources to the full and effective implementation 
of that national policy. It also called on Guatemala to promptly proceed with the practical 
implementation of the recommendations arising out of the universal periodic review with respect 
to the rights of indigenous peoples, since they constitute one of the most vulnerable sectors of the 
Guatemalan community. 
</p>
<p>690. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions was pleased by Guatemala&#8217;s progressive 
efforts in the implementation of the housing infrastructure, but asked that the issue of land and 
property rights of indigenous people be addressed. It appreciated Guatemala&#8217;s efforts to create 
new human rights institutions to tackle impunity and democratize access to justice but noted that 
crimes committed during the conflict such as genocide, torture and enforced disappearances have 
still not been fully investigated. It highlighted that the resettlement of the displaced following 
armed conflict and other land-related issues are only partially implemented. It urged Guatemala 
to provide full reparations and to bring to justice all those responsible for human rights violations 
in the case of Rio Negro. It also expressed concern on the threatened forced evictions of more 
than 30 indigenous communities as a result of the planned or implemented development projects, 
without due process of consultation, participation and information of affected communities. It </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>endorsed the recommendation made to Guatemala to follow up on the recommendations made by 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and other human rights bodies 
towards enhancing the equal protection of indigenous peoples. It regretted that Guatemala did 
not approve legislation to regulate indigenous rights, noted that the absence of an Agrarian Law 
has resulted in the non-recognition of communal and cultural rights of indigenous peoples over 
their territories, and was concerned about measures taken to ensure investigation of violence 
against human rights defenders, and suggested that the coordination between the police and the 
Office of the Attorney-General be increased. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review on the  
outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>691. Guatemala reiterated its appreciation for the statements made on 6 May 2008 and the 
recommendations resulting from that session, as well as for the issues raised at the present 
meeting. It further reiterated the commitment of Guatemala to promoting and protecting human 
rights. As noted earlier, some of the recommendations had already been envisaged as part of 
public policies and the implementation of recommendations made by treaty bodies, visiting 
special procedures and as a result of contacts with the Inter-American human rights system. 
</p>
<p><b>Peru 
</b></p>
<p>692. The review of Peru was held on 6 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
the national report submitted by Peru in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/PER/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/PER/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/PER/3). 
</p>
<p>693. At its 19th meeting, on 12 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Peru (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>694. The outcome of the review on Peru is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/37), together with the views of Peru concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>695. Mr. Jos&#233; Eduardo Ponce Vivanco, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Peru to 
the United Nations Office at Geneva reiterated the commitment of Peru to the universal system 
for the promotion and protection of human rights, and in particular to the Council. Peru 
participated actively in the institution-building of the Council and supported the creation of the 
universal periodic review mechanism, which is an essential mechanism to ensure equal treatment 
to all Member States, regardless of their level of development. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>696. The first two sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review have been 
positive, since the 32 countries that were examined demonstrated their genuine commitment to 
the system. Peru hoped that the procedural issues raised during the first two sessions have now 
been fully resolved. It noted however the importance of refining the way in which questions, 
comments and recommendations are formulated. It is essential to avoid both a politicization of 
the exercise and also disproportionate words of praise, and advisable to avoid repetitive 
statements that ignore the concrete situation in each country being examined. It indicated that the 
dialogue should focus on actions and facts that can objectively contribute to addressing human 
rights issues in the countries being examined. This should be the responsibility incumbent of all 
States that want the universal periodic review to be an effective instrument in order to improve 
the human rights situation in the countries being reviewed. 
</p>
<p>697. During the review, Peru always kept in mind the ultimate goal of the exercise, as being to 
contribute to the enjoyment of human rights in the country. Thus, Peru acknowledged its actual 
shortcomings and challenges and reiterated its appreciation to all States that participated in the 
dialogue with Peru contributing to it with valuable recommendations. 
</p>
<p>698. Considering the recommendations, Peru noted that the second part of recommendation 4, 
as well as recommendations 17 and 20, are relevant to the commitments that the Government 
made during the session of the Working Group and therefore accepts them with pleasure. 
Regarding the others, not directly linked to the three voluntary commitments made by Peru, it 
indicated that in a constructive spirit and within the framework of its national legislation, Peru 
will study each of the recommendations, and these will also serve as substantial guidance for the 
human rights agenda. Peru indicated that recommendation 3 however cannot be implemented 
within the constitutional and legal framework, but recalled that for more than 30 years there has 
not been a single execution in Peru. Peru also reiterated its firm commitment to continue being 
part of the Inter-American system. 
</p>
<p>699. Peru summarized its voluntary commitments within the context of the first review and 
highlighted the open invitation made in 2002 to all United Nations human rights mechanisms to 
visit Peru, which remains valid. 
</p>
<p> (a) With regard to the submission of reports to treaty monitoring bodies, Peru indicated 
that it will submit the pending periodic reports according to the following schedule: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Report to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, December 2008 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Report to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, December 2008 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Report to the Human Rights Committee, June 2009 
</p>
<p> (b) Concerning obligations under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Peru reiterated its 
full willingness to comply with the obligations accepted when ratifying it. In accordance with 
articles 3 and 17 of the Optional Protocol, one or various independent national preventive 
mechanisms will be designated. Within the framework of the current policy of dialogue, the 
Ministry of Justice will seek to define the most adequate mechanism at the earliest possible time; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Concerning the National Human Rights Plan, Peru indicated that dialogue will be the 
most effective tool to achieve the goals of the Plan and to establish a national human rights 
agenda. Peru will strengthen the National Human Rights Council by establishing round tables 
that will allow for permanent and institutional dialogue. 
</p>
<p>700. Peru further informed that upon her return to Peru following the review of Peru at the 
second session of the Working Group, the Minister for Justice established a working group 
composed of representatives of public institutions and civil society to evaluate progress and 
make further proposals. Peru is prepared to carry out appropriate follow-up to the 
recommendations and commitments, to be carried out by relevant national institutions, such as 
the Ministry of Justice, the National Human Rights Council and other State entities, in 
coordination with other relevant stakeholders in the country. Peru further noted that it is 
convinced that the universal periodic review exercise cannot be considered to have finished with 
the dialogue within the Working Group and the additional plenary discussion in the Council. 
Rather, Peru would like to continue with this productive exchange of ideas and to report back 
progressively and regularly on progress achieved. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>701. No views were expressed by States members or observers of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>702. The Latin American Committee for the Defence of Women&#8217;s Rights, also on behalf of 
Action Canada for Population and Development, the Federation for Women and Family Planning 
and International Women&#8217;s Rights Action Watch-Asia Pacific, welcomed Peru&#8217;s open attitude to 
dialogue with civil society during the universal periodic review. It referred to paragraph 8 and 
recommendation 5 of the Working Group report on the issue of violence against women, stating 
that there are two obstacles which Peru should address in order to implement this 
recommendation. First, while the Law on Family Violence contains appropriate measures, the 
judicial system does not fully provide for the defence of the family in terms of the rights of 
women who denounce ill-treatment. This should be urgently remedied, through training of 
justice personnel. Second, there are budgetary and programme weaknesses in institutions of 
implementing programmes and plans, as mentioned in paragraph 8 of the Working Group report. 
It also refer to a study undertaken by the Latin American Committee for the Defence of 
Women&#8217;s Rights which states that violence against women is a serious issue in Peru. It 
concluded that implementing recommendations on this issue represents a duty to ensure that the 
right to life of women is upheld. 
</p>
<p>703. The Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos Originarios Andinos referred 
to the first recommendation of the Working Group, which recommends that Peru promote the 
situation of indigenous peoples, and stated that it must urgently grant constitutional status to the 
rights to indigenous peoples. For the follow-up effort, it stated that measures should be adopted 
in accordance with recommendation 15 to counter the adverse effects of the oil, mineral and 
water extracting industries affecting the full exercise of economic, social and cultural rights of 
indigenous peoples. It urged that responses be made to communications provided to treaty 
bodies, in accordance with recommendation 17, to avoid legislative decree 10/15 which should </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>be repealed, because it leaves indigenous peoples without the right to free prior and duly 
informed consent. Further, Peru should stop uncontrolled pillaging of surface and subterranean 
water resources in the Tacna Andean region where the Aymara people should preserve pasture 
land. Lastly, the pending invitations to the Special Rapporteurs on freedom of expression and on 
extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions should be carried out in accordance with the 
principles of transparency and universality of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review on the  
outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>704. Peru thanked all those that participated in the session for their constructive comments, 
noting that Peru will take these into consideration in the follow-up to the review process. With 
regard to the interventions made at the present on the human rights of women, Peru indicated 
that the issues raised require due attention and indicated that Peru will do so. Concerning the 
situation of indigenous peoples, Peru recalled that it had taken a decisive part in the drafting of 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. With respect to mining 
activities and national resources extraction, consultations with the communities are held in the 
context of the development projects and these will continue in the future. Peru and the mining 
companies are fully aware of the fact that the development of mining and exploitation of natural 
resources in general must be done in association with the people of the concerned communities. 
It further noted that socially responsible companies can indeed help the impoverished people of 
the country. 
</p>
<p>705. In conclusion, Peru thanked again all those who had participated in the session, the 
President, the States of the troika for Peru - Cuba, India and Mali - as well as the Secretariat for 
its work and cooperation. Peru reiterated its commitment to continue to disseminate information 
about the universal periodic review outcome and process and reinforce the dialogue with relevant 
national institutions and key human rights actors in the country. Peru hopes, with the support of 
all, to make a positive follow-up to this review. 
</p>
<p><b>Benin 
</b></p>
<p>706. The review of Benin was held on 7 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Benin in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/BEN/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/BEN/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/BEN/3). 
</p>
<p>707. At its 19th meeting, on 12 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Benin (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>708. The outcome of the review on Benin is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/39), together with the views of Benin concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>709. Benin commended the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review for the 
constructive dialogue that had taken place during the country&#8217;s review on 7 May 2008, a 
dialogue that had elicited contributions and recommendations from delegations. Benin also 
wished to commend the members of the troika: Nicaragua, Madagascar and Germany. 
</p>
<p>710. Since the adoption of the draft report by the Working Group at its 9th meeting, 
on 9 May 2008, Benin had taken a number of measures relating to its international commitments. 
From 18 to 26 May 2008, Benin had been visited by the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which had enjoyed access to 
places of detention. Despite some difficulties relating to a lack of information on the part of 
some of the parties involved, Benin had not stinted in its cooperation and had taken all the 
necessary steps to facilitate the Subcommittee&#8217;s mission. 
</p>
<p>711. Following its visit, the Subcommittee on Prevention had presented its confidential 
preliminary conclusions to the State bodies involved in the implementation of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. 
</p>
<p>712. Benin had also participated in the regional meeting of directors of penal institutions. 
During that meeting a cooperation agreement had been signed by the Minister of Justice, 
Legislation and Human Rights. Benin noted with satisfaction and interest 33 of 
the 34 recommendations that had been formulated after the review by the Working Group. Benin 
wished to thank the delegations that had contributed to the interactive dialogue and pledged to 
undertake all necessary measures to implement the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations. 
</p>
<p>713. As part of its effort to enhance its cooperation with the Council&#8217;s special procedures 
mandate holders, Benin agreed in principle to visits by special rapporteurs, would extend official 
invitations to them and undertook to reply to communications and urgent appeals. 
</p>
<p>714. With regard to recommendation 6, concerning the decriminalization of homosexual acts 
between consenting adults, it was pointed out that during the interactive dialogue the Beninese 
delegation had stated that that phenomenon was marginal in Benin and that no Beninese court 
had in fact prosecuted or punished anyone for such acts. Given the current state of Beninese 
positive law and taking into account certain endemic factors, it would be difficult to contemplate 
any such decriminalization in the near future. 
</p>
<p>715. In the context of compliance with international human rights obligations, the representative 
of Benin said that the right to life was guaranteed by law; the most recent executions had 
taken place more than 16 years previously. Accordingly, Benin had voted in favour of 
General Assembly resolution 62/149, on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, 
on 18 December 2007. However, the debate on that question would continue in order that 
de facto abolition might become de jure. Steps would be taken to speed up the establishment of 
a national mechanism for the prevention of torture. In that connection, Benin willingly agreed to 
engage in bilateral cooperation with the United Kingdom and other partners for the establishment 
of the national mechanism. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>716. Steps were likewise being taken to bring internal legislation into line with the relevant 
international norms. At its meeting on 23 April 2008, the Council of Ministers, adopting the 
recommendations issued by the Committee against Torture at its thirty-ninth session, called upon 
the Minister of Justice, Legislation and Human Rights to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Introduce without delay, and in cooperation with the relevant bodies, a bill to 
incorporate into Benin&#8217;s domestic legislation: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The definition of torture as contained in article 1 of the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The offences classified as constituting torture and the appropriate penalties for 
those offences 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The rules regarding universal competence set out in articles 6 and 8 of the 
Convention 
</p>
<p> (b) Propose, with the bodies concerned, urgent measures to be taken to ensure that 
conditions in the country&#8217;s prisons are in conformity with the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners adopted by the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime 
and the Treatment of Offenders, and in particular the material and human resources needed to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reduce the prison population and the high number of persons held in pretrial 
detention 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Take appropriate measures to put an end to the acts of corruption and ransoming 
that are alleged to occur in prisons 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Improve the health care and the quality and quantity of food provided to prisoners 
</p>
<p>717. The Minister of the Economy and Finance had also been requested to provide the Minister 
of Justice, Legislation and Human Rights with the financial resources needed to ensure that the 
food and medical treatment provided to detainees was improved. 
</p>
<p>718. It was true that in its May 2008 report Amnesty International had denounced the deplorable 
conditions in Benin&#8217;s detention facilities. Implementation of the aforementioned corrective 
measures would demonstrate Benin&#8217;s good faith and its determination to honour the international 
commitments it had voluntarily undertaken. Nevertheless there were challenges to be met, which 
was why Benin planned to intensify its efforts to combat poverty and traditional practices that 
adversely affected women and children and to guarantee the right to education for all. 
</p>
<p>719. The Beninese Constitution guaranteed and protected the rights of persons with disabilities. 
Benin therefore welcomed the entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and its Optional Protocol, and was prepared to take the necessary steps for the 
ratification of those two international instruments. Benin looked forward with interest to any 
cooperation for the implementation of the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States of the Council  
on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>720. Algeria congratulated the Government of Benin on its cooperation and commitment to 
promoting and protecting human rights, despite its limited resources and related constraints. It 
recalled that Benin had specified that the universal periodic review provided it with an 
opportunity to appeal to the international community to fill implementation gaps regarding its 
international commitments. It invited the international community and primarily OHCHR to 
respond to this appeal. Furthermore, it welcomed that primary education is free of charge and 
Benin&#8217;s willingness to consider Algeria&#8217;s recommendation to extend free education to the 
secondary level, with international assistance. It welcomed the establishment of an action plan to 
reduce poverty, including the question of illiteracy. It underlined that the international 
community has the responsibility to provide support to Benin, in particular through appropriate 
and durable provision of technical and financial assistance so that it can improve its performance 
in the area of human rights. 
</p>
<p>721. Morocco welcomed with satisfaction the fact that Benin agreed to 33 of the 34 
recommendations made by the Working Group. It stated that the firm commitment of Benin with 
regard to the implementation of the recommendation Morocco made during the review was quite 
clear well before the adoption of the outcome of the Working Group. Benin started implementing 
some of its recommendations and the recent visit of the United Nations Sub-committee against 
Torture is part of the strengthening of the cooperation between the country and human rights 
mechanisms. It further noted the drafting of a law to refine the criminal code and bring the 
definition of torture in line with the definition contained in the Convention against Torture, and 
the decision to take immediate measures to improve conditions of detention. It expressed further 
the need for the Council to support the reforms undertaken to restore a modern democracy and 
the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>722. Senegal reminded that during the Working Group review of Benin it had underlined the 
progress achieved by Benin in the promotion of the rights of disabled persons, the realization of 
the right to education and providing access to clean water. Senegal also highlighted the need for 
the international community to provide appropriate technical assistance to Benin. Senegal 
reiterated that it maintained these views and expressed satisfaction about the commitment of 
Benin to overcome all challenges and improve the situation of human rights by implementing the 
recommendations that it had accepted. 
</p>
<p>723. Nigeria noted that Benin has already demonstrated practical and strong commitment to 
constructively engaging with the international system, as demonstrated by the ratification of the 
Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Statute of the International Criminal Court. It 
welcomed the steps taken by the Government to fully implement the recommendations 
emanating from the review, and to ensure the enjoyment by its citizens of a wide range of 
economic, social and cultural rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>724. Djibouti congratulated Benin for the frank and comprehensive report and noted that it 
shows results achieved in the promotion and protection of human rights. It also congratulated 
Benin for its lucidity and sincerity in stressing the constraints that need to be dealt with and 
difficulties encountered in trying to meet remaining challenges. It called for international 
assistance to be provided to the country to help it in achieving and implementing the 
recommendations resulting from the review. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>725. Franciscans International acknowledged Benin&#8217;s spirit of cooperation and the frank 
dialogue which characterized its involvement in the universal periodic review process. It noted 
that Benin acknowledged the existence and persistence of infanticide linked to traditional 
practices in the north of the country. It also encouraged Benin to further implement 
recommendations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee against 
Torture and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It encouraged the 
authorities to further continue its efforts to improve the quantity and quality of health 
infrastructures, including in the north of the country, and to sensitize women living in rural areas 
about the health risks linked to delivering at home. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review on  
the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>726. The delegation of Benin warmly thanked all speakers and repeated Benin&#8217;s commitment to 
implement all the recommendations and measures addressed to it and that it has accepted. With 
reference to the intervention of Franciscans International, the delegation recalled and confirmed 
that Benin continue to intensify its efforts to eradicate the phenomenon of child sorcerers and all 
negative impact on women and children. It also referred to the constructive exchanges and 
fruitful discussion held during the universal periodic review of Benin and welcomed the 
initiative of the Council, its observations and recommendations. It finally reiterated Benin&#8217;s 
commitment to implement, in so far that it is able to do so, those recommendations and welcome 
any support in that regard. 
</p>
<p><b>Switzerland 
</b></p>
<p>727. The review of Switzerland was held on 8 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Switzerland in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/CHE/1 and Corr.1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/CHE/2); and the summary prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/CHE/3). 
</p>
<p>728. At its 19th meeting, on 12 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Switzerland (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>729. The outcome of the review on Switzerland is constituted of the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/41), together with the views of Switzerland 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/8/41/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations  
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>730. The representative of Switzerland began by thanking delegations for the interest they 
had expressed in Switzerland&#8217;s review and for the quality of the dialogue that had taken place 
on 8 May 2008. At that time 31 recommendations had been addressed to Switzerland. 
Switzerland had already taken a position on eight of the recommendations, and that position 
was reflected in the report of the Working Group (A/HRC/8/41), which stated that six 
recommendations had been accepted and two rejected. The remaining 23 recommendations 
had been discussed subsequently by the various departments of the Federal Administration: 
14 recommendations had been accepted, 6 had been rejected and 3 had been changed to 
voluntary undertakings. While most of the recommendations addressed to Switzerland had thus 
been accepted, recommendations 4, 7, 11, 15, 18 and 20 had been rejected for the following 
reasons. 
</p>
<p>731. Recommendation 4, &#8220;Adopt legislative or other measures so that human rights are taken 
into account upstream by the judiciary, in particular during the elaboration of popular initiatives 
to ensure their compliance with international obligations&#8221;, would entail a substantial 
modification of existing procedures by giving the Federal Tribunal competence in the areas of 
monitoring constitutional conformity and international law that it did not currently have. There 
was thus no reason at present for additional measures to achieve the objective of the 
recommendation. The Swiss Government and Parliament made a preliminary check to ensure 
that popular initiatives were consistent with Switzerland&#8217;s obligations under international law. 
Popular initiatives that were contrary to a peremptory norm of international law were declared to 
be totally or partially null and void by Parliament. Furthermore, when an initiative was accepted, 
its implementation had to be consistent with Switzerland&#8217;s international commitments. 
</p>
<p>732. Recommendation 7, &#8220;Adopt a specific law prohibiting incitement to racial and religious 
hatred, in accordance with article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights&#8221;, was already covered by article 261 bis of the Criminal Code (article 171 (c) 
of the Military Criminal Code) on racial discrimination, which had entered into force 
on 1 January 1995. That provision punished anyone who publicly incited hatred or 
discrimination against people because of their race, ethnicity or religion, violated human dignity, 
refused to provide a public service or propagated a racist ideology. Since the entry into force of 
article 261 bis, approximately 450 cases had resulted in judgements or decisions in various 
courts. The recommendation was thus covered by that provision of the Swiss Criminal Code, and 
Switzerland did not feel it was necessary to adopt any additional legislation in that area. 
</p>
<p>733. Recommendation 11, &#8220;Recruit minorities in the police and establish a body tasked to carry 
out inquiries into cases of police brutality&#8221;, could not be accepted owing to Switzerland&#8217;s federal 
nature: police forces were a matter for the cantons, and even local communities, to decide, and it 
was the cantons and communities who determined recruitment policy. All Swiss citizens, 
provided they met the criteria for eligibility, could apply for the entrance examinations </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>regardless of their place of origin or establishment. Moreover, some cantons allowed only those 
foreign nationals who had residence permits to join their forces. Legal remedies were available 
to victims of police brutality. 
</p>
<p>734. Switzerland rejected recommendation 15, &#8220;Withdraw reservation to article 4 of the 
International Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Radical Discrimination&#8221;. Although it 
continued to maintain its reservation to article 4 of that Convention, Switzerland had adopted 
article 261 bis of the Criminal Code (article 171 (c) of the Military Criminal Code) on racial 
discrimination. Switzerland reserved the right to take the legislative measures necessary for the 
implementation of article 4, taking due account of freedom of opinion and freedom of 
association, which were provided for, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>735. The overall thrust of recommendation 18, &#8220;That federal legislation be strived for to provide 
protection against all forms of discrimination, including on grounds of sexual orientation and 
gender identity&#8221;, did not pose any major problems for Switzerland, which made combating any 
kind of discrimination a priority. However, the fact that sexual orientation was the only type of 
discrimination mentioned in the recommendation was an obstacle to its acceptance. Switzerland 
thus rejected the recommendation for the same reasons adduced for its rejection of 
recommendation 20. 
</p>
<p>736. Recommendation 20, which Switzerland also rejected, called on the country to &#8220;take 
additional steps to ensure that same-sex couples are not discriminated&#8221;. The Federal Act on 
registered partnerships, which had entered into force on 1 January 2007, had introduced 
partnership registration, whereby same-sex couples could have their relationship recognized in 
law. Registered partners enjoyed the same status as married couples. However, registered 
partners were not allowed to adopt children or to use medically assisted means of reproduction.  
</p>
<p>737. The representative of Switzerland then discussed the recommendations that had not been 
accepted but which it had chosen to change into voluntary undertakings. 
</p>
<p>738. Recommendation 1, &#8220;Establish a national institution on human rights in accordance with 
the Paris Principles&#8221;, had become the following voluntary undertaking: &#8220;Switzerland shall 
consider the possibility of establishing a national human rights institution in accordance with the 
Paris Principles&#8221;. That language reflected more accurately the current state of the debate in 
Switzerland. In January 2007, the Federal Council had established a joint federal/cantonal 
working group, which would soon transmit its report to the Government. The federal authorities 
did not wish to adversely affect the final decision by accepting or rejecting recommendation 1.  
</p><p>739. Recommendation 3, &#8220;Accede to the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights&#8221;, had been changed to the following voluntary undertaking: 
&#8220;Switzerland is ready to consider becoming a party to the first Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&#8221;. Switzerland recognized the importance of 
allowing individuals to have access to communication and complaint mechanisms when their 
fundamental rights were violated. It remained ready to consider becoming a party to the 
Protocol. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>740. Recommendation 21, &#8220;Withdraw the reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women and ratify the Optional Protocol thereto&#8221;, was 
problematic in that it dealt with two different issues. Accordingly, Switzerland wanted to split it 
into two parts. Swiss regulations governing family names, which were currently under discussion 
in the Federal Parliament, would most likely not be changed before Switzerland&#8217;s next periodic 
review in 2012. The same was also true for Switzerland&#8217;s reservations to article 15, paragraph 2, 
and article 16, paragraph 1 (h) of the Convention. Those provisions were applied subject to 
several interim provisions of the matrimonial regime, which were scheduled to expire after the 
next universal periodic review cycle. Switzerland did, however, agree voluntarily to undertake 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States of  
the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>741. Belgium appreciated the response of Switzerland to questions concerning its immigration 
policy, stated that it was familiar with it and therefore understood that adjusting this legislation 
could not be done in a precipitous manner. Belgium particularly welcomed the declaration on the 
direct applicability of international human rights instruments, and that migrants could demand 
redress before the courts on the basis of those instruments. Belgium noted the reply regarding 
taking into account human rights prior to organizing popular initiatives, and was pleased to note 
that accepted popular initiatives needed to be in line with Switzerland&#8217;s international 
commitments. Belgium welcomed the continuity of its dialogue with the Council and the civil 
society and the clarity and rigour of Switzerland&#8217;s replies. 
</p>
<p>742. Qatar congratulated Switzerland for its commitments to the enjoyment of human rights. 
Switzerland cooperates with all mechanisms for the promotion of human rights, as evidenced by 
the role played by Switzerland in the debates which led to creation of the Council. Switzerland 
replied favourably to a number of recommendations and as a result of this dialogue, Switzerland 
took the decision to accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, which 
will allow bringing to justice people who have been responsible for such kind of crimes. Qatar 
commended Switzerland on its commitment to combat racial discrimination and the ratification 
of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Further, Qatar expressed its 
satisfaction with regard to the harmonization of domestic legislation with international human 
rights law at the local level undertaken by the Swiss Federal authorities. Lastly, the 
representative of Qatar commended Switzerland on its initiative to establish a human rights 
institution in line with the Paris Principles and on accepting some recommendations, specifically 
those related to article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>743. Azerbaijan noted that Switzerland had achieved remarkable success in promoting and 
protecting human rights and in creating a society that meets the needs of all its citizens. This is 
why development in this country is a model of success. It appreciated the efforts to ensure 
fundamental freedoms and the accomplishments in this field, as well as the policy led in 
promoting respect for international humanitarian law. Azerbaijan encouraged Switzerland to take 
effective measures to improve the situation regarding migration and asylum. Azerbaijan noted 
with satisfaction that Switzerland would consider ratifying the International Convention for the  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. Finally, Azerbaijan hoped that Switzerland would consider creating a 
national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>744. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland congratulated Switzerland 
on its constructive and considered approach to the universal periodic review process, which 
proved that the review offers each and every country the opportunity for an honest, detailed and 
self-critical assessment of its own human rights record. The United Kingdom commended 
Switzerland on its frank assessment of progress achieved to date and of areas where it will seek 
to make further progress. It thanked the delegation of Switzerland for the detailed responses 
provided to the recommendations made during the review and noted with satisfaction that 
Switzerland has accepted the recommendation to consider creating a human rights institution in 
line with the Paris Principles. It recognized the importance that Switzerland had attached to civil 
society involvement in the review process and encouraged it to continue its efforts in the 
follow-up to the review. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>745. The representative of Indian Movement &#8220;Tupaj Amaru&#8221;, in a joint statement with the 
World Peace Council, was extremely concerned that Switzerland&#8217;s attitude to housing and land 
rights will have a negative effect on the respect for this right worldwide and noted with regret 
that it had chosen not to approve the widely supported recommendation that it recognize the 
justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights. It noted that in 2007, 80 children and adults 
were evicted from buildings known as &#8220;Rhino&#8221; without warning, court order or measures to 
ensure respect for basic human rights, and without alternative housing being provided, an 
eviction qualified by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a violation of housing 
rights. It stated that the federal structure of Switzerland could not be used as an excuse to avoid 
respecting its human rights obligations, and noted that another community, the &#8220;Tulipiers&#8221;, is 
at present being threatened with such an eviction. It welcomed Switzerland&#8217;s support to 
non-governmental organizations to deliver general statements in the universal periodic review 
procedure, but noted that communication with civil society, and in particular with victims of 
human rights violations, should not be limited to 20 minutes every four years. 
</p>
<p>746. Amnesty International presented a joint statement speaking on behalf of a coalition 
of 32 non-governmental organizations. It thanked the Swiss delegation for organizing an 
open consultation and was pleased with the fact that Switzerland has accepted 20 out 
of 31 recommendations and took on voluntary commitments on two of them. Switzerland&#8217;s 
consistent implementation of recommendations by treaty bodies could be progressively resolved 
through the establishment of the human rights institution. It expressed concern regarding 
Switzerland&#8217;s refusal of some essential recommendations, in particular the one related to social 
and economic rights. As Switzerland noted that legislative authorities should consider human 
rights as the guideline for their activities, it stressed that the human rights contained in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not guidelines, and such position may lead to a 
differentiated approach to the rights guaranteed by the Declaration. It deplored the fact that 
Switzerland is not ready to discuss the possibility of signing the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and noted that  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the refusal to envisage introducing federal legislation against discrimination is a missed 
opportunity to set up a central system to prevent discrimination based on racial or religious 
reasons or persistent discrimination against women or sexual discrimination. 
</p>
<p>747. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions was particularly concerned at the views on 
economic, social and cultural rights expressed by the Government, which is clearly incompatible 
with Switzerland&#8217;s obligation under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. It noted that Switzerland had failed to implement effective remedies for most of 
the economic, social and cultural rights. It noted that no due remedy had been provided to the 
victims of the 2007 forced evictions from the Rhino Collective, nor in the matter of the forced 
closure of the Rhino association and the arbitrary seizure of its assets. It was also concerned at 
the threats levelled by the public prosecutor against persons residing at the &#8220;Tulipiers&#8221; residence 
in Geneva and urged the Swiss authorities to adhere to due process requirements in that case, 
noting that forced evictions do not affect only squatters. Regarding Switzerland&#8217;s rejection of 
recommendation 18 on discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, on the basis that 
homosexuals do not have the right to adopt, it highlighted that since a recent judgement of the 
European Court of Human Rights, discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation was now 
explicitly impermissible in Council of Europe States. 
</p>
<p>748. Prison Fellowship International commended Switzerland, and specifically the Swiss 
Development Aid agency on its work in the area of defending and promoting the human rights of 
a variable group of population, particularly, ten million people in various forms of detention or 
imprisonment. Specifically, on the practical level, Switzerland is bridging the gap between the 
enlightened discussions in Geneva and the reality on the ground in the prisons of the world. Over 
the last eight year, in cooperation with Prison Fellowship International, Switzerland delivered for 
the needs of prisoners in over 30 countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Africa. 
Switzerland provided various assistance programmes to prisons including training programmes 
on human rights and financed other projects together with other donors from the United States of 
America, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. It praised the spirit of openness and 
sincerity demonstrated by the Swiss delegation during the interactive dialogue, and hoped that 
Switzerland will continue its development assistance in defence of human rights in the spirit of 
global solidarity. 
</p>
<p>749. Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed Switzerland&#8217;s acceptance to create a 
national institution in accordance with the Paris Principles, which will greatly assist in carrying 
forward its commitment to non-discrimination. It was concerned about Switzerland&#8217;s refusal of 
recommendation 18 regarding a Federal anti-discrimination law, including on grounds of gender 
identity and sexual orientation. It noted that the reasons put forward, namely that Switzerland is 
reluctant to single out a particular ground such as gender identity and sexual orientation, was 
unconvincing and it highlighted a number of recommendations where Switzerland had accepted 
that particular needs be addressed separately. Moreover the recommendation did not state that 
sexual orientation and gender identity should be the sole grounds covered, solely that these 
grounds be included. Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network encouraged Switzerland to reflect on 
its response to the recommendation and to put in place such a law which would be inclusive of 
all grounds. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review on  
the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>750. The Swiss delegation also welcomed the fact that representatives of civil society had 
taken the floor before it made its concluding remarks. The delegation then thanked the States and 
non-governmental organizations that had spoken. It wished to dispel a misunderstanding by 
reaffirming that Switzerland believed that economic and social rights were ipso jure obligations. 
There was no distinction between economic, social and cultural rights on the one hand and civil 
and political rights on the other. Rather, the question had to do with the persons to whom those 
rights were addressed in the domestic legal order: were those rights aimed at lawmakers, or were 
they sufficiently clear to be invoked directly in the domestic legal order? That was the distinction 
that the Federal Tribunal had drawn. Switzerland believed that economic, social and cultural 
rights were intended for lawmakers and must be implemented by legislative measures and 
policies. Furthermore, Switzerland had a monistic system that allowed it to invoke the violation 
of those rights, which were also guaranteed by the Constitution, directly before the courts. With 
regard to discrimination, particularly discrimination based on sexual orientation, it had been 
pointed out that Switzerland had chosen to take a global approach. The delegation then outlined 
a number of preliminary lessons that Switzerland had learned in recent months as well as 
planned next steps. 
</p>
<p>751. The first lesson was the high degree of interest in Switzerland shown by Member State and 
observer delegations. The Swiss delegation had been impressed by the quality of the statements 
delivered and of the constructive dialogue that had ensued. 
</p>
<p>752. The second lesson had to do with Switzerland&#8217;s contacts with civil society. The universal 
periodic review exercise had made it possible to open up the Swiss authorities&#8217; dialogue with 
civil society to a certain extent. A dialogue that encompassed the whole range of rights and went 
beyond the usual framework of sectoral discussion had been initiated. 
</p>
<p>753. The third lesson was related to the opportunity that had been provided to discern a number 
of major points and certain aspects that needed improvement in the internal consultation process. 
</p><p>754. A number of measures that were to be implemented in the coming months to ensure 
that the universal periodic review, which should not be merely an exercise carried out in 
Geneva, remained an ongoing process were identified. One of the first major effects that the 
universal periodic review had had on Switzerland had been the setting up of a coalition of 
some 30 non-governmental organizations, to which the representative of Amnesty International 
had referred. That step would help to continue the general dialogue that had been begun during 
the preparation of Switzerland&#8217;s national report with civil society. During the follow-up the need 
to keep the Human Rights Council informed in a spontaneous way of the progress made in 
implementing the recommendations that had been accepted had been recognized; such informal 
reports would constitute a sort of voluntary intermediate review before the next report was 
submitted in 2012. 
</p>
<p>755. Switzerland fully intended to learn from the universal periodic review, which sought to 
bring about a genuine improvement in the implementation of human rights in the country, and it 
was prepared to take all necessary steps to make the review mechanism a tool for achieving that 
objective. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>756. In conclusion, the Swiss delegation wished to thank the Secretariat for its untiring efforts 
without which it would have been impossible to carry out the review in the very short amount of 
time allotted. 
</p>
<p><b>Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>757. The review of the Republic of Korea was held on 7 May 2008 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: the national report submitted by the Republic of Korea in accordance with the annex 
to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/KOR/1); the compilation prepared 
by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/KOR/2); and the summary 
prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/KOR/3). 
</p>
<p>758. At its 19th meeting, on 12 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on the Republic of Korea (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>759. The outcome of the review on the Republic of Korea is constituted of the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/40), together with the views of the 
Republic of Korea concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to

<p>760. The Government of the Republic of Korea reiterated its full support for the review 
mechanism on the highly significant occasion of the adoption of the outcome of its review. The 
Republic of Korea stated that this also offers an opportunity to reaffirm its unswerving 
commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, a priority in its national agenda. 
</p>
<p>761. The Republic of Korea deeply appreciated the valuable contribution by States and all other 
stakeholders in the universal periodic review of the Republic of Korea. It stated that it has been a 
collaborative effort and that the bonds of cooperation formed have in themselves proved to be 
another further benefit of this process. It reiterated its thanks to the members of troika for their 
invaluable work and for the outstanding leadership they have displayed in guiding it through this 
significant process. 
</p>
<p>762. According to the Republic of Korea, the international community, with these two universal 
periodic review sessions, has embarked on the task of addressing all human rights situations of 
all States in a fairer and more inclusive way. This is indeed a task of the utmost importance. The 
Republic of Korea noted that the launch of the universal periodic review represents a milestone 
and all earnest efforts should focus on ensuring that it is truly effective. The member States, the 
treaty monitoring bodies, non-governmental organizations and OHCHR are all involved in 
ensuring that the mechanism does indeed prove to be effective. In its case, the Republic of Korea 
stressed that the review has been constructive in terms of reaffirming the human rights issues and 
that it has provided a valuable opportunity to galvanize its will to achieve improvements in the 
areas concerned. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>763. Following the review by the Working Group in May, the Republic of Korea has given 
thorough consideration to all the recommendations made by States. It believes that 
the 33 recommendations contained in the report of the Working Group cover almost all key 
human rights issues, long-standing ones and relatively new ones alike. 
</p>
<p>764. As part of its efforts to gain a clearer overall picture of the recommendations, the 
Republic of Korea held an inter-ministerial meeting on 30 May. Each ministry which was 
involved in the review process has undertaken a thorough study of the human rights issues raised 
in the review. The Republic of Korea briefly touched upon its Government&#8217;s responses to the 
recommendations contained in paragraph 64 of the report. 
</p>
<p>765. It was pleased to say that the Republic of Korea accepts most of the recommendations, 
either in full or in part. Further detailed information on the responses to all recommendations 
(A/HRC/8/KOR/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>766. First of all, the Republic of Korea accepted the entire group of recommendations relating 
to women&#8217;s rights. It has been consistent in its pursuit of a policy of advancing women&#8217;s rights. 
The Ministry of Gender Equality is deeply committed to incorporating a gender perspective into 
government policies. To this end, it has been developing concrete initiatives and playing a 
leading role in addressing the issues in inter-ministerial meetings. 
</p>
<p>767. Secondly, the Republic of Korea stated that the Government will intensify efforts to 
effectively protect the rights of foreign workers by upholding relevant laws, including the 
Employment of Foreign Workers Act. It also stressed that continued efforts focusing on various 
measures for their fuller social integration will be made and more effective remedies developed 
to further protect the rights and interests of foreign workers. 
</p>
<p>768. Thirdly, the Republic of Korea noted that it continues to make sincere efforts to protect the 
rights of disabled persons. To this end, it is currently pursuing domestic procedures for the 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>769. Fourthly, the Republic of Korea also welcomed other important recommendations relating 
to matters such as the implementation of observations of treaty bodies, freedom of association 
and assembly, human rights training for law enforcement personnel, the Resident Registration 
System, marital rape, child abuse and domestic violence, sexual crime, and refugee recognition 
procedures. It stated that it will continue to seek ways to strengthen and improve the relevant 
domestic laws, institutions and procedures in these areas. 
</p>
<p>770. Some of the recommendations contained in paragraph 64 of the report will need further 
study regarding their implementation as this may require legislative actions or entail an 
interpretation of domestic law. 
</p>
<p>771. First of all, on the recommendations advocating further ratification of and accession to 
human rights treaties, the Government will indeed carefully consider accession to several of 
them, such as the Optional Protocol on the Convention against Torture. More efforts are needed 
to bring domestic legislation and regulations in full conformity with these human rights norms 
and standards. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>772. Secondly, as the Republic of Korea indicated during the interactive dialogue of its review, 
issues such as the death penalty, the National Security Law and conscientious objection to 
military service require further study and the forging of a broad national consensus; there is 
therefore a need for the Government to continue to make efforts in this direction. 
</p>
<p>773. Thirdly, issues such as the definition of torture, corporal punishment and the security 
surveillance law also entail amending important provisions of its domestic law, and the 
Government therefore needs to give careful thought to ways to overcome the difficulties of such 
a process. 
</p>
<p>774. Fourthly, the Republic of Korea noted that the withdrawal of the reservation to article 22 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is another matter which requires further 
examination and in-depth consultations. In particular, there is a call for further tripartite 
consultations and inter-ministerial consultations for a review of the matter of trade union 
pluralism and labour rights of public officials. 
</p>
<p>775. Lastly, the Republic of Korea highlighted that the recommendation on the accession to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members 
of Their Families is the only one that its Government is not in a position to accept at this stage. It 
welcomed the intention and spirit of this recommendation, which is to protect migrant workers 
and their family members. However, it considered that some provisions of the Convention are in 
conflict with some key domestic laws. In the meantime, the Republic of Korea will make every 
possible effort to protect the human rights of migrant workers under the current national laws 
that cover the human rights and welfare of foreigners. 
</p>
<p>776. The Republic of Korea further noted that for the universal periodic review to be a credible 
mechanism leading to actual improvements in human rights, effective follow-up measures are 
imperative. These should include mechanisms to promote implementation at the national level by 
providing a platform for national dialogue on human rights between various stakeholders. It is 
also crucial to provide an opportunity for public scrutiny of government policies. 
</p>
<p>777. In this regard, the Republic of Korea also engaged in discussions on a mechanism for the 
systematic implementation of the recommendations in the coming four years. One suggestion put 
forward was that the recommendations could be included in the ongoing National Action Plan 
for 2007-2011 for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. Another suggestion was to 
create a mechanism tasked exclusively with follow-up to issues raised during the review process. 
</p>
<p>778. The Republic of Korea emphasized that neither suggestion should exclude the 
recommendations considered, prima facie, difficult to implement. In this regard, it underlined 
that even a recommendation that it feels unable to accept for the moment will be given due 
consideration and, if necessary, may be the subject of discussions with all stakeholders. 
</p><p>779. The Republic of Korea stressed that the Government will continue to bear in mind all the 
recommendations made, as it seeks to strengthen its institutional and policy responses to achieve 
greater human rights protection and promotion in the country. It looks forward to seeing these 
recommendations serve as a valuable guide in its efforts in the months and years ahead, as it 
constructively engages with the Council, other international mechanisms and bilateral and 
regional partners on human rights issues. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>780. The Republic of Korea reiterated the great importance it attaches to the universal periodic 
review. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>781. Malaysia expressed its appreciation to the Republic of Korea for its opening statement and 
for the response it gave to its question during the interactive dialogue in the review. It also 
welcomed the positive engagement by the Republic of Korea with the Council in the universal 
periodic review and the additional responses provided before the adoption of the outcome. 
Malaysia noted that the Republic of Korea has undertaken positive legislative and policy 
measures to further improve the human rights situation in the country while taking steps to 
overcome the challenges that it continues to face. It also stressed that notable improvements 
include the empowerment of women, the rights of children and the rights of the disabled. 
</p>
<p>782. The Democratic<b> </b>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea referred to the numerous recommendations it 
made during the interactive dialogue which are contained in the report of the Working Group, 
and requested more details about the practical and guaranteed measures vis-&#224;-vis those 
recommendations. Following the responses provided by the Republic of Korea and in the light of 
the situation on the ground, it reiterated its call for more concrete and comprehensive measures 
on the recommendations it made, in particular on the abolition of the National Security Law. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>783. The National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea noted its active 
participation in the universal periodic review process through consultations with the Government 
and non-governmental organizations and by submitting a stakeholders&#8217; report. It welcomed the 
33 final recommendations made to the Republic of Korea, all of which come under the 
Commission&#8217;s core mandate. It noted that especially in regard to the death penalty and the 
National Security Law, the Commission had already made recommendations calling for their 
abolishment. With regard to petitions outlining alleged violations of the right to freedom of 
assembly, it recommended that the Assembly and Demonstration Act be amended because 
article 8 is subject to arbitrary interpretation. It urged the Government to adopt viable measures 
for the implementation of the recommendations. It welcomed the re-election of the 
Republic of Korea to the Council, with the anticipation that the Government will fully and 
actively implement the voluntary pledges made upon its initial election to the Council and the 
newly affirmed pledges. It anticipated that the role of national human rights institutions will be 
expanded in the universal periodic review and the follow-up processes thereto. 
</p>
<p>784. The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum-Asia) and the People&#8217;s 
Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, in a joint statement, welcomed the engagement of the 
Republic of Korea in the review process, but expressed their extreme disappointment at the 
inadequate and evasive responses. Reference was made to concerns voiced about threats to 
freedom of assembly. They referred to the fact that numerous documented cases and evidence 
show police and security personnel using excessive force and arbitrarily detaining demonstrators 
at will. They echoed the recommendation for mandatory human rights training and education for 
all security and law enforcement personnel, and strongly urged the review of and amendment to 
the Act on Assemblies and Demonstrations. It referred to arrest of migrant workers and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>deportation of union leaders without due process. It called upon the Government to, inter alia, 
take concrete measures to stop all acts of discrimination against migrant workers, and to ratify 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members 
of Their Families. It also urged the Government to reduce the disparity in wages between 
irregular and regular workers, and to maintain a gender perspective in addressing the specific 
needs of women irregular workers. 
</p>
<p>785. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network delivered a statement on behalf of 86 grass-roots 
human and cultural rights organizations from the Republic of Korea, in reference to 
recommendation No. 23 of the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, 
which suggested that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation be included in the draft 
anti-discrimination bill. It noted also the exclusion of six other categories from the bill. It stated 
that exclusion is a tacit approval of discrimination against groups that need protection, and 
expressed its deep concern that it may provide basis for future structural and interpersonal 
violence. It noted the Republic of Korea&#8217;s significant achievements and the demonstrated 
international leadership to uphold and respect international law protecting minorities. It stated 
that civil society is very proud of being a part of the nation&#8217;s efforts toward equality and equity, 
and expressed disappointment and alarm about the growing communication gap between civil 
society and the current administration. It noted that in order to fully acknowledge the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the non-discrimination law must be inclusive and explicit, and it 
urged the Government to immediately re-introduce the six dropped categories with specification 
of gender identity in the federal non-discrimination law. 
</p>
<p>786. Amnesty International welcomed the call on the Government to pass into law the special 
bill to abolish the death penalty. It also welcomed recommendations to abolish the National 
Security Law, or to amend it to bring it in line with international standards, and to ratify the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Several recommendations focused on the need to ensure 
increased protection of the rights of migrant workers. It stressed that since November 2003, the 
Government has conducted a series of crackdowns leading to the arrest, detention and 
deportation of irregular migrant workers. It also deeply regretted the deportation of the president 
and vice-president of the Migrants&#8217; Trade Union. It strongly encouraged the Government to 
implement recommendations to accede to the International Convention on the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, to withdraw the reservation to article 22 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to protect female migrant workers against 
discriminatory practices, and to ensure access of all migrant workers to the justice system. It also 
called on the Government to follow through on its Council election pledge to ratify the 
four International Labour Organization fundamental conventions related to the right to freedom 
of association, to organize and on abolition of forced labour. 
</p>
<p>787. MINBYUN - Lawyers for a Democratic Society stressed that the report of the Working 
Group pointed out that the National Security Law has been arbitrarily limiting freedom of 
expression and association in the Republic of Korea and recommended its abolition several 
times. The Government&#8217;s response that this law was not overused was not true according to 
Lawyers for a Democratic Society, which cited a number of examples to the contrary. The police 
had censored certain websites without a court order. The Government was strongly urged to 
follow the recommendation of the Working Group and to abolish the National Security Law as 
soon as possible. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed by the State under review 
on the outcome and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>788. Following the interventions from the States delegations and representatives of civil society, 
the Republic of Korea thanked them for their constructive comments and noted that a number of 
concerns and issues raised and advice offered could be a valuable source of inspiration for the 
Government to further materialize its commitment to achieving high standards in relevant areas 
of human rights. It also thanked the troika members and the Council Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>789. The Republic of Korea noted that many of the comments made by the speakers, including 
on the issue of migrant workers and the National Security Law, were already dealt with in the 
report of the Working Group and responses were provided either in its written responses or in its 
opening statement. 
</p>
<p>790. The Republic of Korea reaffirmed that the National Security Law should not be misused or 
interpreted arbitrarily and that the Constitutional Court has formulated strict criteria regarding 
the interpretation of the law to prevent abuse and to ascertain the constitutionality of its 
application. Moreover, it noted that the Ministry of Justice and the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office are 
making efforts to apply the law prudently and in accordance with the constitutional 
jurisprudence. 
</p><p>791. Lastly, the Republic of Korea pointed out that the review was an opportunity to take stock 
of a specific country human rights situation and that a broad consultative process at the 
preparation stage of the national report contributes to identify what the State under review should 
do for the cause of human rights. It further noted that interaction between all relevant 
stakeholders will be inevitable and critical for the follow-up process. The Republic of Korea 
stated that this is one of the good reasons to be optimistic and that the universal periodic review 
will serve to improve human rights in the long run. 
</p>
<p>792. Regarding the demonstrations presently under way in the country to which a civil society 
organization referred, the Republic of Korea stressed that it has always guaranteed the freedom 
of lawful and peaceful demonstration but noted that when demonstrators violate laws by 
resorting to unlawful means, it is inevitable for the Government to take measures necessary to 
maintaining law and order and to protect public safety. 
</p>
<p><b>Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p>793. The review of Pakistan was held on 8 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Pakistan in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/PAK/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/PAK/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/PAK/3). 
</p>
<p>794. At its 20th meeting, on 12 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Pakistan (see section C below). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>795. The outcome of the review on Pakistan is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/42), together with the views of Pakistan concerning 
the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/8/42/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations 
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>796. In the context of the consideration of the universal periodic review outcome of Pakistan, 
the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations Office at Geneva presented 
information (A/HRC/8/42/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>797. China noted its appreciation of the open and frank attitude with which Pakistan has 
participated in the universal periodic review mechanism as well as the frank and full dialogue 
Pakistan has conducted with various parties during the entire review process. It also appreciated 
the measures taken by Pakistan to protect human rights, promote democratic values and the rule 
of law and in combating terrorism at its source. China welcomed the signature and ratification of 
international human rights instruments and Pakistan&#8217;s commitment to further promote and 
protect human rights. It welcomed the great importance that Pakistan has attached to the 
effective implementation of international obligations as well as its positive efforts to promote the 
protection of the human rights of women, children, persons with disabilities, ethnic minority 
groups and other people. China stated its conviction that Pakistan is entirely capable of 
strengthening protection of human rights for its people, achieving sustainable progress in 
economic, political and social areas and playing a positive and constructive role for the healthy 
development of the Council. 
</p>
<p>798. Bahrain noted that Pakistan was a party to a number of human rights instruments, and that 
Pakistan is fully committed to fulfilling its obligations by virtue of its membership in the 
Council. Bahrain noted the achievements of Pakistan in the field of human rights and in pursuit 
of democracy, despite the daunting challenges it is facing. Bahrain welcomed the efforts made 
by Pakistan in the fields of education, health, rights of women, elimination of poverty and 
empowerment of women as well as its determination to deal with all urgent matters. 
</p>
<p>799. Canada expressed its appreciation for Pakistan&#8217;s response to the report on its review and 
looks forward to its final response to recommendations made by the Working Group. In 
particular, Canada appreciated Pakistan&#8217;s commitment to reviewing statutes that could lead to 
discrimination against religious minorities. Canada noted that one of its recommendations had 
not been accurately reflected in paragraph 106 of the report of the Working Group. The 
recommendation as made included a specific reference to the Quadiani, Lahori and Ahmadi 
religions. This is correctly reflected in paragraph 23 of the report. Canada requested that the 
Secretariat correct this error prior to the adoption of the report of the Working Group within the 
deadlines for corrections. Canada accepted the adoption of this report in plenary on the 
understanding that it will be corrected to accurately reflect the recommendations as made. The </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>2nd Amendment to the Pakistan Constitution outlaws the Ahmadi religion and the Penal Code 
allows for the imprisonment of members of the Quadiani, Lahori and Ahmadi religions for 
preaching their faith. Canada was disappointed that Pakistan had rejected its recommendations to 
repeal provisions of the <i>Hudood</i> Ordinances that criminalize non-marital consensual sex and 
failed to recognize marital rape. The right to liberty and the prohibition of arbitrary interference 
in privacy are universally recognized freedoms found in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. Canada stated its disappointment that Pakistan rejected its recommendations to 
decriminalize defamation. The right to freedom of opinion and expression is a universally 
recognized right found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Vaguely defined 
blasphemy laws criminalize insulting the name of the Prophet Mohammed and prescribe the 
death penalty in some cases. Lawyers defending those accused of blasphemy often face death 
threats and physical assault. Such restrictions on freedom of opinion and expression are not 
justifiable under the limitations on this freedom permitted under international law. Canada 
encouraged Pakistan to update the Council on measures taken in follow-up to these 
recommendations on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p>800. Morocco congratulated Pakistan for its sincerity and frankness during the review and its 
efforts to create a state of rule of law and fundamental rights, despite the difficulties faced. 
Morocco noted that Pakistan has met many challenges which are slowing down the country, such 
as terrorism and large flows of immigrants. Ensuring transparency in the most recent elections 
also reflected these efforts. Morocco was pleased to see the efforts made to protect women and 
children and the implementation of the right to education and health, and welcomed the efforts 
and reforms made along these lines. Morocco also noted with satisfaction the fact that Pakistan 
considers the independence of the judiciary and freedom of expression as priorities on its agenda 
and welcomed the availability of Pakistan to share its good experiences with others. Lastly, 
Morocco welcomed Pakistan&#8217;s commitment to implementing the recommendations of the 
Working Group, recalling that all recommendations cannot be immediately implemented and 
may require a medium or even longer term process to be fully implemented and enjoyed. 
</p><p>801. Kuwait recognized the great efforts made by Pakistan in the universal periodic review 
process. This showed the great interest and deep-rooted cooperation of Pakistan with all 
organizations dealing with human rights. Kuwait referred to the democratization process and the 
efforts made by the late Benazir Bhutto and her great sacrifice for democracy and basic liberties. 
Kuwait noted that all measures taken by Pakistan reflect its political will to uphold all rights and 
reinforce the role of civil society. 
</p>
<p>802. Algeria referred to Pakistan&#8217;s comments as relevant and progressive in view of the 
challenges Pakistan faces, especially in its fight against terrorism which has an impact on the 
whole world. Algeria noted that the conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group 
highlighted the fact that Pakistan continues its efforts to fight terrorism. Therefore it is essential 
that Pakistan receives adequate support from the international community and benefits from a 
full understanding of the country&#8217;s constraints. Algeria commended Pakistan on the progressive 
efforts made in the promotion and protection of human rights, its continued efforts to spearhead 
progress towards gender equality and development for women in the areas of education and 
employment, and on developments in children&#8217;s rights and its steady economic progress in its 
fight against poverty. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>803. Indonesia noted with appreciation that many of the recommendations put forward to 
Pakistan during the universal periodic review had already been taken into account and measures 
taken to carry them out. Indonesia welcomed the fact that Pakistan has undertaken the transition 
to a full democracy. It commended Pakistan on the serious efforts made to develop relevant legal 
structures to eradicate violence against women, and encouraged Pakistan to ensure the faithful 
implementation of the laws adopted to combat violence against women. It also noted that there 
has been a positive change with regard to women and believed this would translate into a 
positive contribution by the office holders into an active policymaking debate on issues related to 
women and children. Indonesia expressed the view that Pakistan is on the right track in 
addressing the issue of ensuring the independence of the judiciary, through Pakistan&#8217;s elected 
Parliament, but that ample time may be required and that the approach therefore must be 
supported. 
</p>
<p>804. India stated that the national report of Pakistan to the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review refers to the territory of the so-called &#8220;AJ&amp;K&#8221; (para. 72) and &#8220;AJK&#8221; (para. 81). 
India wished to state for the record that the territory referred to is part of the Indian State of 
Jammu and Kashmir and is under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>805. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues and the Human Rights 
Commission of Pakistan welcomed Pakistan&#8217;s recent ratification of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the signature of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. It also expressed interest in the future 
establishment of an independent human rights commission in accordance with the Paris 
Principles. However, it expressed its deepest concern about the comment made by Pakistan in 
paragraph 108 of the report of the Working Group, namely that a number of recommendations 
neither fall under the framework of universally recognized human rights nor are consistent with 
the pledges and commitments made by Pakistan. In relation to paragraph 43 of the report of the 
Working Group, the organizations urged Pakistan to consider the adoption of a moratorium on 
executions, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 62/149. Regarding paragraph 43, 
they raised the issue of women who continue to be haunted under accusations of <i>Zina</i> even when 
legally married but without the blessing of their families. They stressed that for awarding <i>Hadd</i> 
punishment, the evidence of non-Muslims and women is not acceptable despite the fact that 
<i>Hadd</i> punishment is also prescribed for the crime of rape, where women are victims. Concerning 
paragraph 23 on the criminalization of defamation, they deplored the refusal of Pakistan to 
review the existing restrictions in the laws that are incompatible with the principles of the right 
to freedom of expression. They called on Pakistan to cooperate fully with United Nations treaty 
bodies and the special procedures, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders. Finally, they urged Pakistan to agree with all the recommendations 
made by the Working Group and to implement them over the next four years. 
</p>
<p>806. Human Rights Watch noted that the universal periodic review came at an opportune time 
when the newly elected government had engaged in a number of human rights reforms. It 
welcomed the repeal of laws that limit the freedom of the press and the restoration of rights 
exercised by workers organizations, and urged Pakistan to implement the recommendations 
aimed at restoring all freedoms suspended during the imposition of the state of emergency. This </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>includes blanket indemnity granted by President Musharraf to himself for suspending the 
Constitution, and that in spite of this recommendation, elections on 18 February and an elected 
government assuming office, the country has yet to return to constitutional rule. It regretted that 
Pakistan has not clearly announced a decision to implement the recommendation that it reinstate 
the dismissed members of the judiciary and recommended that Pakistan, in the future, fully 
involve civil society in consultations with the universal periodic review process. It also stated 
that the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed discontent with the position taken 
by the Government during the review that certain recommendations fall outside the scope of 
universally recognized rights, and do not conform to national commitments. It supports their 
recognition that safeguards and restrictions to the imposition of the death penalty is a universal 
and recognized human rights principle and that the Government is misleading itself by denying 
that the vulnerability of women accused of <i>Zina</i> is not a violation of their rights. Lastly, it 
regretted the absence of recommendations on disappearances and noted the secrecy surrounding 
counter-terrorism operations. It welcomed Mexico&#8217;s recommendation for Pakistan to adhere to 
international human rights, humanitarian and refugee laws in its fight against terrorism. 
</p>
<p>807. The International Commission of Jurists called for the prompt implementation of all 
recommendations, including recommendations 4, 5, 14, 15 and 16. It noted that Pakistan had yet 
to address the consequences of the rule of law crisis which culminated in the 2007 state of 
emergency. It noted that the new Parliament had not yet decided on a method to clearly revoke 
constitutional amendments made by the Musharraf Government as well as the emergency 
decrees made under them. The International Commission of Jurists stated that while the Working 
Group recommended re-establishing an independent judiciary, the governing coalition had been 
unable to reinstate all the justices and judges deposed during the state of emergency. It 
highlighted that action against terrorist suspects must comply with the principles of the rule of 
law and international human rights standards. It further reminded Pakistan of the accessory and 
substantive nature of the right to equality before the law and to equal protection of the law, and 
suggested that the Council disregard the contents of paragraph 108 of the universal report of the 
Working Group on Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>808. Amnesty International welcomed the substantive exchange that took place in connection 
with the review of Pakistan and the positive commitments made by the Government. It 
encouraged it to pursue its work towards the abolition of the death penalty. It welcomed 
Pakistan&#8217;s announced intention to accede to the Convention on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance, by the Government&#8217;s commitment to the rule of law and by its 
undertaking to investigate and remedy any alleged human rights violations in pursuit of the war 
on terror. It urged Pakistan to immediately resolve all acts of enforced disappearance; to ensure 
the immediate release of all persons held in secret detention or their transfer to official places of 
detention open to independent monitoring; and to bring to justice officials found responsible. It 
encouraged the Government to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the Convention against Torture and implement them in domestic law. It stressed the need to 
restore judges who had been removed under the emergency rule and the establishment of a 
transparent procedure for the appointment and removal of judges to ensure that tenure is secure 
and free from conflicts of interest, undue influence and intimidation. It noted that Pakistan 
rejected some recommendations on the grounds that they do not refer to universally recognized 
human rights while many of these recommendations deal with issues addressed in  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights instruments ratified by Pakistan. It encouraged Pakistan to 
reconsider the recommendations referred to in paragraph 108 of the report of the Working Group 
and to respond to their substance rather than their form. 
</p>
<p>809. The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum-Asia), in a joint statement 
with the International Movement against Discrimination and Racism and Pax Romana, expressed 
grave concern and disappointment about the constant denials of Pakistan during the review on its 
human rights record. It stated that the new Government should recognize the oppression, and in 
some cases indifference in others, exercised by the military-led government in the very recent 
past. It underlined that while Pakistan stated during the session of the Working Group that there 
was no form of caste-based discrimination and no Dalits in the country, new research points to 
the fact that caste-based discrimination is indeed a reality for approximately 2 million people in 
Pakistan, and the majority of bonded labourers in agriculture, and strongly urged Pakistan to 
acknowledge this form of discrimination; to prevent the exploitation of bonded labourers; and 
take effective measures, in line with other affected countries, in order to eliminate this form of 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>810. The European Centre for Law and Justice noted with satisfaction that the important 
question of religious freedom and the rights of minorities was examined during the interactive 
dialogue. It noted that, as mentioned by a number of States, the three main issues linked to 
freedom of religion in Pakistan are the prohibition of religious groups, the existence of 
blasphemy laws and the frequency of physical violence against religious minorities. Recalling 
the relevant articles in the Pakistani Criminal Code, the European Centre for Law and Justice 
noted that although all religions benefit from legal protection according to the Criminal Code, 
none was as important as the protection afforded to Islam. The European Centre for Law and 
Justice stated that, in actual fact, the blasphemy law is a repressive tool given to the State 
religion against the expression of minority political and religious views. The European Centre 
for Law and Justice concluded by hoping that a general process of revision of the judgements of 
persons currently imprisoned for blasphemy be undertaken. 
</p>
<p>811. The Asian Legal Resource Centre welcomed the acknowledgement by Pakistan of the 
importance of the March 2007 lawyers&#8217; movement and civil society&#8217;s role in the struggle for an 
independent judiciary. It noted the repeated calls for reinstatement of the judges in the report of 
the Working Group and the fact that the lack of an independent judiciary is equivalent to the 
suspension of fundamental rights in the country, as there is no effective legal redress available at 
present. It has recently identified 52 illegal detention centres in Pakistan, where people have 
been held incommunicado, tortured, disappeared or subjected to summary executions. It 
welcomed the repeated recommendations to ratify the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It expressed its serious concern with 
regard to Pakistan&#8217;s denial of the existence of caste-based discrimination. It however welcomes 
the call to Pakistan in the report of the Working Group to take concrete and effective measures to 
protect human rights defenders. It shared its disappointment with the Government&#8217;s attempts to 
undermine the review process as a whole and the review of Pakistan, by trying to disregard valid 
recommendations, notably concerning the <i>Hadood</i> Ordinances, blasphemy laws and the death 
penalty. It hoped that Pakistan refrains from such actions and commits to addressing all the 
issues raised. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>812. Interfaith International stated that several statements were made during the review of 
Pakistan to remove restrictions on the freedom of religion or belief, to amend legislation which 
discriminates against persons belonging to minority religions, to protect freedom of religion and 
belief in general, and urged Pakistan to take serious note of these recommendations. It referred to 
several recommendations made with regard to women&#8217;s rights, gender equality and opposing 
violence and discrimination against women, and called upon Pakistan to implement these 
recommendations seriously. It also recalled observations made during the review on the need of 
separating the powers of the judiciary from the executive and ensuring the independence of the 
judiciary. Interfaith International stressed that such matters should be given high priority and 
serious efforts should be made to satisfy the political, civil, economic, social and cultural 
aspirations of the Pakistani people. 
</p>
<p>813. International Women&#8217;s Rights Action Watch Asia-Pacific expressed its deepest concern on 
the rejection by Pakistan on recommendations which according to it are not universally 
recognized human rights. It noted the rejection of recommendation 23 (b) and 30 (d) relating to 
the non-recognition of marital rape, but welcomed the statement made by Pakistan that it would 
address marital rape through its criminal justice system, including the proposed domestic 
violence law. It urged Pakistan to ensure that the perpetrators of marital rape are punished 
through the effective implementation of the law and hoped that Pakistan&#8217;s statement would be 
accompanied by an acceptance of recommendations 23 (b) and 30 (d). It also noted Pakistan&#8217;s 
rejection of recommendation 62 (e) despite the recommendation of the Committee on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 2007 to ensure that Qisas and 
Diyat law has no application in cases of violence against women and urged Pakistan to ensure 
that domestic law complied with the recommendation of the Committee. Regarding 
recommendations 23 (b) and 62 (b), it noted that the criminalization of non-marital consensual 
sex and adultery had been recognized by the Human Rights Committee as a violation of human 
rights law and noted that it is a practice which particularly discriminates against women and 
sexual minorities. It called on Pakistan to accept these recommendations. 
</p>
<p>814. The Islamic Human Rights Commission expressed concern that women&#8217;s health rights 
appear to be neglected in Pakistan. It expressed its deep concern about the outcome of the draft 
Bill on the National Human Rights Commission, which has not moved since February 2005. It 
recalled that a number of provisions in the Bill have given rise to criticism, such as the 
requirement that the members of the National Human Rights Commission must be former 
government employees, an issue which could have an impact on their independence. Other 
aspects include methods of appointment of commissioners, their salaries and the funding of the 
National Human Rights Commission. Finally, it stated that the recent ratification and signature 
of three core human rights instruments is a significant step forward by Pakistan in fulfilling its 
pledges and commitments to promoting human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed on the outcome by the State 
under review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>815. In closing, Pakistan thanked member States for their kind words and for having 
congratulated Pakistan on its strong commitment to human rights and democracy. It particularly 
thanked Algeria for its statement that Pakistan should be given support by the international 
community to combat terrorism. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>816. In response to Canada&#8217;s intervention, Pakistan stated that Canada did not meet the deadline 
for the submission of changes to the report of the Working Group, and that there was an 
omission in the report, which happens from time to time, and which can usually be resolved 
through dialogue. On the issue of consensual sex out of wedlock, Pakistan stated that it cannot be 
legalized in Pakistan. Pakistan&#8217;s law stem from its norms, and it was of the view that this is not a 
universal human right or recognized as such. Further, Pakistan is trying to reform the national 
law on defamation, and there is some tendency towards abuse of the law which must be 
corrected. Some members of civil society have been demanding abolition, but at the end of the 
day, the Government aggregates views of all members of society and takes a decision. In this 
regard, Pakistan recalled Council resolution 7/36, in which the Council requests the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression to 
report on instances in which the abuse of the right of freedom of expression constitutes an act of 
racial or religious discrimination. This is part of international law, and ought to be respected. 
</p>
<p>817. Pakistan took note of the constructive proposals made by some of the non-governmental 
organizations that took the floor, and will transmit their input to Pakistan. However, it stated that 
some of the speeches were outdated and written without looking at Pakistan&#8217;s statement which 
was just read out or at the one made on 8 May 2008. In some statements, there was poor 
homework which did not monitor developments since March 2008. Regarding the intervention of 
the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues, Pakistan stated that it rejected some of 
the recommendations, and did so in accordance with the procedure agreed on within the Council. 
Pakistan recalled that a review of the issue of the use of capital punishment has been mandated 
by the new Government. It stressed that simple accusations do not resolve issues, rather, a 
dialogue is needed. Pakistan informed that it has started the reform of <i>Zina</i> law, and as already 
mentioned, is looking into flaws within registration procedures; rape victims are of special 
concern to Pakistan, which is trying to provide redress to them. 
</p>
<p>818. In reference to India&#8217;s intervention, Pakistan rejected that Azad Jammu and Kashmir was 
part of Indian territory. The whole state of Jammu and Kashmir was a disputed territory, 
including the Indian Occupied Kashmir, in accordance with the relevant Security Council 
resolutions, awaiting a final settlement. 
</p>
<p>819. Lastly, Pakistan thanked the President of the Council, the Secretariat and civil society. It 
stressed that all points raised will be faithfully transmitted to Islamabad, and that it appreciated 
independent and impartial criticism so it can help it gain traction to correct its course, if it is 
headed in the wrong direction. 
</p>
<p><b>Zambia 
</b></p>
<p>820. The review of Zambia was held on 9 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Zambia in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/ZMB/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/ZMB/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/ZMB/3). 
</p>
<p>821. At its 20th meeting, on 12 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Zambia (see section C below). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>822. The outcome of the review on Zambia is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/43), together with the views of Zambia concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/8/43/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations 
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>823. Zambia welcomed the universal periodic review mechanism and the active participation of 
States that characterized its review. The Council was invited to note that while Zambia faces a 
number of wide-ranging challenges in promoting and protecting all human rights within its 
territory, it has undergone positive changes in the area of human rights. 
</p>
<p>824. This can be seen from the consultative process that was undertaken in the preparation of 
the national report for the universal periodic review; the plans Zambia put in place in the 
Fifth National Development Plan relating to human rights; the importance it places on reporting 
to both regional and international treaty bodies to which it is a party; and the voluntary 
commitment made by Zambia to extend a standing invitation to special mandate holders on 
human rights, to mention but a few. 
</p>
<p>825. Under paragraph 59 of the report of the Working Group (A/HRC/8/39), Zambia undertook 
to examine 11 recommendations and to provide its responses thereon at the present session of the 
Council. These responses are contained in document A/HRC/8/39/Add.1. 
</p>
<p>826. With regard to the recommendation to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, Zambia was pleased to report that it has signed the Convention in May 2008. 
</p>
<p>827. In conclusion, Zambia reiterated its commitment to the promotion and protection of all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is in this regard that Zambia pledges its continued 
commitment to improving the situation of human rights within its territory and welcomes the 
opportunity to contribute to the work of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed on the outcome by States 
members and observers of the Council 
</b></p>
<p>828. China welcomed the honest and serious attitude shown by Zambia during the review. It 
noted that Zambia had made positive progress in the promotion and protection of human rights, 
not only in building a comprehensive system of human rights norms and human rights protection 
but also in formulating and implementing many human rights measures. China also noted the 
progress made in ensuring judicial justice and the rights to education, housing and health. 
Finally, it noted with appreciation the frank and open attitude of Zambia in dealing with many 
difficulties and challenges in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>829. Algeria congratulated Zambia for the report and commended Zambia on its commitments 
to promote and protect human rights as well as to cooperate with the universal periodic review. 
Algeria was encouraged by Zambia&#8217;s acceptance to strengthen its efforts on gender issues and to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>address extreme poverty and its impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, 
including regarding vulnerable groups such as girl children and those affected by HIV/AIDS. It 
also encouraged Zambia to pursue its efforts to improve its educational system, the living 
conditions of detainees and to seek international assistance for implementing its objectives. 
</p><p>830. Ireland applauded the broad consultations with civil society in the preparation of the 
national report and encouraged Zambia to deepen this engagement in addressing the issues raised 
during the process. It welcomed that Zambia has accepted 19 recommendations and has agreed 
to examine 11 others. It also welcomed that Zambia has extended a standing invitation to all 
special procedures. It took note that the improvement of prison conditions is being addressed and 
recommended the continued prioritization of such an improvement. It also welcomed progress 
made by Zambia in incorporating the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women into domestic law and urged the full implementation of this 
instrument. It noted with appreciation that Zambia has recognized the need for reforms in 
relation to laws on freedom of expression. It also expressed the hope that Zambia will abolish the 
death penalty. Finally, Ireland asked for information, in due course, about the mechanisms to be 
developed to ensure follow-up on the recommendations and invited Zambia to update the 
Council on progress made, even before the next review. 
</p>
<p>831. Nigeria was pleased both by the transparency demonstrated by Zambia throughout the 
review process and by its initiatives aimed at ensuring the implementation of the various 
recommendations formulated during the review. As a developing country, Nigeria also 
recognized the challenges faced by Zambia in its efforts to promote and protect the rights of its 
citizens and called on the international community to complement Zambia&#8217;s efforts in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>832. Switzerland noted with appreciation the constructive and cooperative spirit showed by 
Zambia during the entire exercise. It welcomed that, amongst the 19 recommendations accepted 
by Zambia, several aim at improving the situation of women and children. As regards the 
situation of women, it welcomed the fact that Zambia wishes to incorporate systematically a 
gender perspective in the follow-up to the review. Aware of the challenges that Zambia faces, it 
noted however that the allocation of resources for the implementation of national programmes 
for children should be a priority. It noted in particular the situation of children belonging to 
vulnerable groups as regards, among other things, their access to health and education. 
According to Switzerland, particular attention should be given to girl children. It encouraged 
Zambia to implement the recommendations accepted and to continue to work with civil society 
to this effect. 
</p>
<p>833. Uganda congratulated Zambia on taking steps to address the bottlenecks in its justice 
system and for the measures that have been taken to put legislation in place to mainstream 
gender issues, particularly the challenge of gender-based violence. Uganda also noted that 
legislative measures and strategies that deal with issues of reproductive health to reduce both 
maternal and child mortality will go a long way to improve and develop health services and the 
delivery of health care to the most vulnerable groups, women and children. It stated that 
HIV/AIDS has compounded the problem of child labour, not only in Zambia but on the whole 
African continent, as child-headed families are forced to fend for themselves thus depriving them  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the right to education. It highly commended Zambia on having taken a holistic approach to 
deal with all those issues, and appreciated Zambia&#8217;s commitment to implementing the 
recommendations made during the review. 
</p>
<p>834. Botswana welcomed the additional information provided in responses to some of the issues 
raised during the review, which demonstrates the positive and constructive commitment of 
Zambia in the whole exercise of the review process. The fact that Zambia accommodates some 
of the recommendations made shows its commitment to placing a high priority on the promotion 
and protection of human rights. It expressed hope that Zambia will benefit from the full support 
and understanding of the international community and an allowance of sufficient policy space to 
meet its international obligations in the context of human rights. It also commended Zambia on 
its resolve to embrace civil society as partners in the review process. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>835. Franciscans International, in line with the recommendations already formulated, suggested 
that the Government of Zambia continue and strengthen its efforts to guarantee free and 
compulsory basic education. It also suggested that the Government support civil society 
organizations that provide basic education services and involve them in a permanent and open 
dialogue. It expressed serious concern about the high number of street children, who are exposed 
to trafficking, physical and sexual abuse, forced labour and even police brutality. It called on 
Zambia to follow up on the recommendations expressed during the universal periodic review to 
develop and implement an effective strategy of assistance and prevention for street children in 
order to protect and guarantee their rights. Zambia should also give maximum priority to the 
recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Echoing concern expressed by 
the Committee, it called on the Government to urgently develop and implement a specific 
assistance and protection programme for orphans. It finally welcomed Zambia&#8217;s commitment to 
continue engaging with all the stakeholders in the follow-up to the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed on the outcome by the State 
under review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>836. Mrs. Gertrude M.K. Imbwae, Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Justice, concluded by 
stating that Zambia thanked all the countries that have contributed to the successful review of 
Zambia during the universal periodic review and that it appreciates the recommendations and 
statements that have been made by States and civil society organizations. Zambia considers 
dialogue as an effective tool for dealing with issues, including those that relate to human rights. 
She indicated that Zambia appreciates the role that this process will play in the improvement of 
human rights and in this regard, called upon the international community to play a positive role 
in the fulfilment of the objectives of the review process. She also welcomed Zambia&#8217;s re-election 
to the Council and took this opportunity to thank the international community for the confidence 
it has in Zambia&#8217;s ability to contribute to the human rights agenda. 
</p>
<p><b>Japan 
</b></p>
<p>837. The review of Japan was held on 9 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant provisions 
contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the national 
report submitted by Japan in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/JPN/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/JPN/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/JPN/3). 
</p>
<p>838. At its 20th meeting, on 12 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Japan (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>839. The outcome of the review on Japan is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/44), together with the views of Japan concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were 
not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see 
also A/HRC/8/44/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations 
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>840. At the 20th meeting of the Council, on 12 June 2008, during the adoption of the final 
outcome of the universal periodic review on Japan, the Deputy Representative of Japan to the 
United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva indicated that his country had 
the pleasure of being considered under the review mechanism almost one month ago. It had been 
gratified that many delegations in the Council had expressed interest in the promotion and 
protection of human rights in Japan. It had been delighted to have heard from the more 
than 40 delegations that had raised a number of questions, requested clarifications and made a 
variety of suggestions, which the delegation realized were very useful for their future 
undertakings. 
</p>
<p>841. He reaffirmed that several delegations had also very kindly expressed appreciation about 
Japan&#8217;s efforts for human rights education, for the elimination of discrimination against persons 
affected by leprosy - and for its assistance, including technical assistance. They also stressed 
their expectation for Japan&#8217;s continued efforts in those fields. He stated that Japan was willing 
and ready to undertake further efforts to meet those expectations. As a reappointed member of 
the Council for the next three years, Japan also indicated that it was willing to do its utmost to 
realize its voluntary pledges and commitments. 
</p>
<p>842. With reference to the 26 recommendations which the delegation received during the review 
by the Working Group, Japan indicated that it has submitted comments to each of those 
recommendations (A/HRC/8/44/Add.1) and reflect Japan&#8217;s efforts to accommodate positively 
many recommendations. 
</p>
<p>843. Several delegations, like Qatar, Algeria, Canada and Mexico, referred to the need for Japan 
to make efforts to establish a national human rights institution. The delegation clarified that, in 
March 2002, a bill was in fact submitted to the Parliament with a view to establishing a new 
human rights commission, which was expected to function as an independent administrative 
commission and to create a new human rights redress system. The deliberation of this bill was 
not completed due to the dissolution of the lower house in October 2003. While this bill did not 
pass, the Ministry of Justice is now continuing its efforts to review the bill. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>844. A number of delegations, including Albania, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil, Canada 
and Portugal, recommended that Japan should consider ratifying various human rights treaties, 
including the First and Second Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the International 
Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Convention on 
the Rights of All Persons with Disabilities and the Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of 
International Child Abduction. In response, the delegation explained that Japan has already 
ratified most of the major human rights instruments and fulfils the obligations set out in them. In 
April 2008, Japan submitted its third periodic report on the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, its initial reports on the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution 
and child pornography, and its sixth periodic report on the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>845. Japan also stated that it had already signed the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and that it will proceed to the examination of ratifying them as early as possible. 
Japan also stated that it will consider adhering to the remaining recommended human rights 
treaties, except for the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>846. Regarding the standing invitation to special procedures of the Council, Japan will consider 
this on the premise that the dates and the duration of their visits will be arranged at the working 
level. At any rate, Japan clarified that it has been and is willing to cooperate with them and stated 
that it is ready to know the interests of each of them and arrange his or her visit to Japan as time 
permits. 
</p>
<p>847. Japan stated that the delegation of Canada recommended that the Japanese Government 
should take measures to eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. 
Japan replied that for the purpose of eliminating all forms of discrimination including 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, the human rights organs of the 
Ministry of Justice were conducting awareness-raising activities for human rights, human rights 
counselling, and the investigation and resolution of human rights violation cases. 
</p>
<p>848. It was stated that the delegation of Italy made a recommendation that all forms of corporal 
punishment of children should expressly be prohibited, and that positive and non-violent forms 
of discipline should be promoted. Japan accepted to follow up on the recommendation to prohibit 
corporal punishment of children. It was pleased to note that some of the recommended steps had 
already been put in practice. Japan further clarified that as for corporal punishment at schools, it 
was already explicitly prohibited by article 11 of the School Education Law in Japan. The 
Government of Japan had also been promoting appropriate guidance to students at schools based 
on this law and will continue such efforts. 
</p>
<p>849. The delegation of Bangladesh recommended that Japan should continue to provide 
financial assistance for countries in need of socio-economic development and extend support for 
the global effort in the realization of the right to development as stipulated in the Millennium 
Development Goal 8. The Japanese Government accepted to follow up on this recommendation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>850. Several delegations recommended that Japan adapt its national legislation to the principles 
of equality and non-discrimination, or that Japan adopt a national law against racism, 
discrimination and xenophobia. In response, it was stated that the Japanese Constitution, in its 
paragraph 1 of article 14, stipulated that all people are equal under the law. It was further 
clarified that Japan, based on its Constitution and relevant domestic laws, has been striving to 
realize a society without any form of racial or ethnic discrimination. Japan acceded to the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1995. The 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, to which Japan became party in 1979, also prohibited 
discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnicity. In order to prevent human rights violations by 
racial discrimination, the Japanese Government has been pursuing the strict implementation of 
relevant domestic laws and has been promoting activities to raise public awareness. 
</p>
<p>851. The delegation of Poland made a future-oriented, forward-looking and therefore very 
pertinent recommendation on a human rights issue, namely the violation of human rights on the 
Internet. Japan replied that as for human rights violations in the Internet society, the human 
rights sections of the Ministry of Justice were working closely to eliminate malicious incidents, 
such as an intrusion of privacy or defamation, by warning the perpetrator in case the perpetrator 
can be identified, or by requesting the provider to remove the offending contents if the 
perpetrator cannot be identified. The Provider Liability Limitation Law was enacted in 2001 
stipulating liability for violating human rights including defamation. As a guideline to observe 
this law, the Telecommunications Carrier Organizations issued the Guidelines related to 
Defamation and Privacy Protection for enterprises. 
</p>
<p>852. As for the question posed by Sri Lanka during the review, the Government of Japan 
formulated the National Youth Development Policy in December 2003, in order to indicate the 
future direction of the Government&#8217;s basic principles and medium and long-term measures 
regarding the development of youth. The Government is promoting measures for youth 
development in coordination among the related ministries and agencies, giving due consideration 
to the protection of rights of the youth, as indicated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
Four years have passed since the initial policy, and in order to continue to promote the 
strengthening of its commitment for children, the Government of Japan will formulate the new 
policy later this year and its concrete contents will be considered by related ministries and 
agencies. 
</p>
<p>853. A number of delegations raised concerns on the interrogation of detainees in police 
custody, and recommended that the interrogation in police custody should be monitored and 
recorded. It further recommended that the Japanese Government should review those systems. 
Japan continues its efforts to ensure appropriate treatment under the substitute detention system. 
Although a careful consideration is needed to introduce mandated recording or videotaping of all 
interrogations, Japan continues its efforts to ensure appropriate interrogation. 
</p>
<p>854. On the death penalty, several delegations, including the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, 
Portugal, Mexico, Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey, made recommendations at the 
session of the Working Group that Japan should review urgently the use of the death penalty 
with a view to a moratorium and abolition. Japan reaffirmed that its position on this matter was </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>stated during the interactive dialogue and recorded in the report of the Working Group. Japan 
was not in a position either to consider granting a moratorium on executions or to abolish the 
death penalty. 
</p>
<p>855. The delegation of Slovakia recommended the establishment of an independent body to 
review asylum applications. Japan indicated that it would be delighted to explain recent 
developments in this field including that refugee examination counsellors are appointed from 
among experts specialized in a broad range of fields and operate as a neutral, third-party 
institution to inspect refugee applications on a secondary basis. 
</p>
<p>856. On the Ainu people, the Japanese Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution concerning 
the Ainu people on 6 June 2008. Responding to this resolution, the Government of Japan issued 
the statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary and will plan policies in accordance with this 
statement. 
</p>
<p>857. The delegation of Guatemala presented a recommendation on abolishing the system 
established to ask citizens to provide information on migrants suspected of being in an irregular 
situation. Japan did not have any intention to incite racial or ethnic discrimination and careful 
attention was paid in the operation of the system not to incite such discrimination. Japan stated 
that this was necessary for the purpose of strict law enforcement aimed at illegal immigration 
and that information provided by people was valuable in performing the Immigration Bureau&#8217;s 
task. 
</p>
<p>858. As for the recommendations regarding the issue of the so-called &#8220;comfort women&#8221;, Japan 
stated that it continued to promote understanding in the international community with regard to 
the sympathy of the Japanese people represented by the Asian Women&#8217;s Fund and that it 
continued to have a dialogue with the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>859. Indonesia congratulated the Government on its open and thorough report, which presents 
in detail its careful consideration for the observations, concerns and recommendations expressed 
by various States during the review which took place in May. It also noted with appreciation that 
the report clearly expressed commitment to human rights education, to improving their criminal 
justice system and procedures which normally follows a very thorough investigative 
methodology. It commended Japan on the recent signing of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance. It noted that in October 2007 Japan became a party to the Rome Statute 
of the International Criminal Court and it considered this a constructive example of Japan&#8217;s 
legitimate concern and commitment to the rule of law. From the consideration of its report, it is 
clear also that Japan is aware of areas where improvements can be made and Indonesia 
considered that the efforts in this regard form part of an ongoing process towards a full 
enjoyment of human rights in the country. It was encouraged by Japan&#8217;s positive response to 
United Nations mechanisms as well as by its commitment to improving existing standards and 
norms. Indonesia stated that it is confident that Japan&#8217;s efforts to fully implement these human 
rights norms will further enhance its latest commitments and achievements in the field of the 
promotion and protection of human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>860. Malaysia appreciated the opening statement by Japan. It appreciated the substantive 
responses to the comments Malaysia made during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
on 9 May 2008. It welcomed the frank manner in which Japan undertook the universal periodic 
review process. It noted that Japan has made great progress in several spheres and is widely 
acknowledged as one of the leading countries in promoting assistance to developing countries in 
numerous areas, including social, economic and cultural rights, as evidenced by the numerous 
cooperation programmes Japan has with other countries. Malaysia was encouraged that Japan 
continues to take this cooperative stance. Malaysia remained confident that Japan will continue 
to engage constructively with the international community in realizing the promotion and 
protection of human rights worldwide. 
</p>
<p>861. Thailand thanked the Japanese delegation for providing further information and responses 
to several outstanding recommendations of the Working Group. It commended Japan on the 
sincerity and commitment of the Government to advancing the cause of human rights in Japan. 
Many important recommendations that Japan has agreed to implement are both instrumental and 
crucial to improving the situation of human rights on the ground in a practical manner. Specific 
measures worth highlighting were the follow-up on the establishment of human rights 
institutions, the elimination of all forms of discrimination including discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as the intention to consider signing or ratifying 
relevant human rights treaties. It commended the Japanese Government on these steps. 
Thailand&#8217;s delegation was impressed by the determination of the Japanese Government to 
seriously address other difficult issues and the challenges ahead. It believed that such 
determination should be supported and encouraged by the international community with a view 
to further enhancing the promotion and protection of human rights for all people in the Japanese 
society. 
</p>
<p>862. The Philippines<b> </b>thanked and congratulated the delegation of Japan on the presentation and 
its cooperative approach throughout the universal periodic review process, which reflected the 
importance the Government attaches to the promotion and protection of human rights and was 
demonstrated by the number of recommendations accepted by Japan. It recognized the clear 
intent of the Government to improve and strengthen its legislative and institutional human rights 
framework. It encouraged the Government to work with relevant partners and stakeholders to 
continue efforts in this regard. It appreciated that Japan accepted recommendations to enhance 
measures to address discrimination against women and minorities, and to combat trafficking in 
persons, with a special emphasis on women and children. It encouraged Japan to continue to pay 
attention to vulnerable groups and sectors of society, including migrants. It also commended 
Japan on its great contribution to the fight against poverty throughout the world. It expressed its 
confidence that the Government, through the strong commitment expressed before the Council, 
will indeed make steady progress in bringing better human rights promotion and protection to its 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>863. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea<b> </b>referred to the three recommendations it had 
made during the interactive dialogue, namely the settlements by Japan of its past human rights 
violations committed in Korea and other countries, the elimination of discrimination against 
Koreans in Japan, and the cessation of the distortion of the history. With regard to the responses 
made, it regretted some of the misleading arguments, and the lack or no mention of the concrete 
measures or commitments on the part of Japan vis-&#224;-vis these recommendations. For example, 
the arguments in the response of Japan regarding Japanese military sexual slavery are construed </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>as impeding the solution of this problem. The surviving victims in their 80s and 90s are now 
continuing to take legal proceedings against Japan. This was followed by many parliaments and 
treaty bodies which have urged the Government to resolve the sexual slavery problem without 
any condition or delay. Its recommendations are based on the desire and aspirations, as well as 
the interests of not only the Korean people but also the many peoples throughout the world. It 
would be good for Japan if these recommendations were implemented. It called upon Japan once 
again to adopt practical and sincere measures or commitments aimed at implementing all these 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>864. The International Movement against Discrimination and All Forms of Racism<b> </b>welcomed 
the acceptance by Japan to a number of the recommendations but regretted its established 
position, for example in respect of the issues of comfort women, the death penalty, the lack of 
any domestic legislation prohibiting discrimination and the human rights of the indigenous Ainu 
peoples. It regretted that Japan had chosen not to accept a large number of recommendations, 
including the enactment of a national law to prohibit discrimination in spite of its obligations. It 
welcomed the recommendations on implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, and applauded the recent resolution by Japan&#8217;s national Parliament, 
followed by the official statement of the Government, regarding recognition of the Ainu as 
indigenous peoples. It welcomed Japan&#8217;s commitment to fully involve civil society in the 
follow-up process, and regretted that it did not undertake broad or meaningful consultations with 
civil society for its national report. 
</p>
<p>865. The World Organization against Torture and the Asia-Japan Women&#8217;s Resource Centre 
made a joint statement in which they warmly welcomed the comprehensive examination by the 
Council of the human rights situation in Japan, including gender-based violence and 
discrimination against women. They also welcomed the fact that Japan has expressed its 
determination, as a re-elected member of the Council, to implement its obligations under the 
human rights instruments and to address &#8220;situations of violation of human rights, including gross 
and systematic violations&#8221; worldwide in its voluntary pledges and commitments. They stated that 
they expect Japan to prove its commitment notably in addressing the &#8220;gross and systematic 
violations&#8221; of women&#8217;s human rights for which it is responsible, namely Japan&#8217;s military sexual 
slavery during World War II. According to the Committee against Torture, sexual violence and 
slavery in this context amounted to torture and called on Japan to stop the &#8220;continuing abuse and 
re-traumatization&#8221; that result from &#8220;official denial of the facts, concealment or failure to disclose 
other facts, failure to prosecute those criminally responsible for acts of torture, and failure to 
provide adequate rehabilitation to the victims and survivors&#8221;. They called on Japan to urgently 
act on all recommendations including those on military sexual slavery without reservation, and 
set a best practice in ensuring remedies for the survivors of the most serious forms of violence 
against women in armed conflict. They stated that failure to do so would raise a serious doubt as 
to Japan&#8217;s ability to act as a responsible member of the Council. 
</p>
<p>866. International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Indian Council of South America and 
Interfaith International made a joint statement indicating their full support for the 
recommendation that Japan should urgently review the use of the death penalty, have a 
moratorium and abolish it. They raised the question whether many Japanese people knew about 
the content of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Rights and the resolution adopted by the General Assembly seeking a moratorium. They 
suggested that the United Nations advise and cooperate with the Government of Japan so that the 
Japanese people become aware of the international tendency to create a society without the death 
penalty and that Japan would abolish the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>867. The Japan Federation of Bar Associations appreciated the positive approach shown by 
the Government of Japan during the session of the Working Group by involving officials 
of the relevant ministries and in engaging itself into a constructive dialogue. A total 
of 26 recommendations were made by States on various human rights issues, including on those 
that have remained unsolved despite repeated recommendations made by treaty bodies, in 
particular on the death penalty, the <i>Daiyo-Kangoku</i> substitute prison system and a national 
human rights institution. It was pleased to note that the Government had today accepted some of 
the recommendations, including regarding the establishment of a national human rights 
institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. It was also encouraged by the willingness of 
the Government to involve civil society in the follow-up to the universal periodic review process 
and to consider adhering to human rights treaties, including the First Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It noted with appreciation the Government 
intention to carefully consider the need to introduce mandated recording or videotaping of all 
interrogations. It was disappointed by the reluctance of the Government to accept a number of 
recommendations and urged it to re-examine its position and start to move towards acceptance of 
the recommendations, in particular, on a moratorium on executions and the review of the 
<i>Daiyo-Kangoku</i> system. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed on the outcome by the State 
under review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>868. Japan thanked all delegations for participating in the discussions on its country and for 
their suggestions, encouragement and recommendations and for the different comments from 
non-governmental organizations. Japan shared the view that the universal periodic review should 
be a cooperative and effective mechanism and hoped that it will function as a mechanism that 
can contribute to the improvement of human rights all around the world. 
</p>
<p>869. Japan intended to make a positive contribution towards the improvement of human rights, 
while taking into consideration each country&#8217;s situation, such as its history, traditions and a 
variety of other elements and bearing in mind Japan&#8217;s basic approach of dialogue and 
cooperation. 
</p>
<p>870. Japan stated that new challenges and new kinds of human rights problems were being 
faced and that the Governments of all countries had to tackle them and take necessary measures. 
Japan further stated that it will continue to contribute to achieving better results for the human 
rights in the international community, in close cooperation with the United Nations, regional 
communities, other national Governments and civil society. 
</p>
<p>871. The delegation stated that the Council gave birth to the universal periodic review and Japan 
participated in this new endeavour as one of the first States to be under review. In Japan&#8217;s view, 
the Council was steadily gaining in experience and formulating the practices of the review. Japan </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>would continue to participate actively in the review process and would make a further 
contribution so that it could function as an effective tool of the Council towards the improvement 
of the human rights situation around the world. 
</p>
<p>872. Japan sincerely hoped that in the course of the interactive dialogue there could be fruitful 
and constructive exchanges of opinions on Japan&#8217;s human rights situation. Lastly, Japan thanked 
all delegations, and in particular the President of the Council and the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b>Ukraine 
</b></p>
<p>873. The review of Ukraine was held on 13 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Ukraine in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/UKR/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/UKR/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/UKR/3). 
</p>
<p>874. At its 20th meeting, on 12 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Ukraine (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>875. The outcome of the review on Ukraine is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/45), together with the views of Ukraine concerning 
the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations 
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>876. The delegation of Ukraine stated that the Government of Ukraine carefully examined the 
five recommendations contained in paragraph 58 of the report, and as a result has decided to 
accept recommendation 2 made by Portugal on signing and ratifying the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto, and recommendation 4 
made by Italy on ensuring the safety and proper treatment of all persons held in custody by the 
police and to consider the establishment of an independent police complaints mechanism. 
</p>
<p>877. The delegation of Ukraine added that recommendations 3 and 5 were not accepted. 
Regarding recommendation 1 proposed by Mexico on strengthening efforts to ratify the 
International Convention on the Protection of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 
the Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of 1954 and the Convention to Reduce 
Statelessness of 1961, Ukraine stated that for the time being, this recommendation was not 
accepted. However, it emphasized that Ukraine makes all necessary efforts at national level to 
protect the rights of migrants, migrant workers and stateless persons. Furthermore, the 
Government was elaborating the concept of State Migration Policy, which will draw on 
international and European experience in solving migration issues. In this connection, a number 
of amendments were to be introduced into national legislation, in particular, in the law on the 
legal status of foreigners and stateless persons, the law on migration and the new law on refugees 
and persons who are in need of additional temporary protection in Ukraine. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>878. The Russian Federation noted with satisfaction that Ukraine has adopted the majority of 
recommendations made during the review and its intention to ensure full and effective alignment 
of its national legislation and practices in applying the law with the obligations deriving from its 
accession to international legal instruments, including treaties related to the protection of 
national minorities, as suggested in one of the recommendations made by the 
Russian Federation. It expressed disappointment at Ukraine&#8217;s refusal to consider other 
recommendations, specifically those related to providing access to education in a mother tongue 
for minorities compactly settled in some areas. Further, Russian should be assigned the status of 
second official language, as the Russian language was historically a mother tongue for almost 
half the people of the country. The attitude of the Ukrainian authorities towards the interests and 
rights of its own citizens runs counter to realities of life existing in Ukraine, as well as to its 
obligations under the regional and international legal instruments related to the protection of 
minorities. 
</p>
<p>879. Azerbaijan commended Ukraine on its national report, efforts undertaken, and ground 
covered since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s towards building a free and 
democratic society, ensuring the rule of law and protecting and promoting human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. Azerbaijan also welcomed efforts of the Government of Ukraine to 
reform the criminal justice system, to counter violence against women and children, and to 
improve the conditions in prisons and correctional institutions. The Government of Ukraine was 
encouraged to continue progressing in future and Azerbaijan noted that it had accepted a number 
of recommendations, demonstrating Ukraine&#8217;s will and genuine commitment to human rights. 
</p>
<p>880. Guatemala commended Ukraine on the constructive and positive role that Ukraine played 
in the universal periodic review process. As a member of the troika, Guatemala welcomed the 
openness and cooperation shown by the members of the Ukrainian delegation, composed of 
high-level governmental representatives from different sectors, which reflected the importance 
attached by the Government of Ukraine to the review exercise, as well as its commitment to the 
protection of human rights. Guatemala was convinced that Ukraine will make further efforts to 
implement and follow up on the large number of recommendations made by the Working Group 
and which it had accepted. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>881. Prison Fellowship International expressed satisfaction with the proceedings of the 
universal periodic review concerning Ukraine and noted the attention it paid to the situation in 
prisons and the justice system, including by adopting a new criminal procedure code, introducing 
alternatives to prison, and drawing up a State programme for the improvement of prison 
conditions. Among the promising steps towards progressive change in the prison system, it noted 
the increasing cooperation with civil society, the possibility for visits by chaplains and 
volunteers of religious organizations, the creative use of humanitarian assistance for vocational 
training of juvenile prisoners, and the post-penitentiary centres for released prisoners. Prison 
Fellowship International suggested that the procedures for receiving humanitarian assistance for 
prisons be simplified. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed on the outcome by the State 
under review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>882. The delegation of Ukraine expressed its gratitude to all members of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review for the grounded and well-balanced approach in their examination 
of the Ukrainian national report. Special gratitude went to all those who participated in the 
interactive dialogue, which took place during the review of the national report. Ukraine attaches 
great importance to the recommendations contained in the report of the Working Group, and it 
was the delegation&#8217;s strong conviction that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure their 
fulfilment.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>883. The review of Sri Lanka was held on 13 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Sri Lanka in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/LKA/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/LKA/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/LKA/3). 
</p>
<p>884. At its 21st meeting, on 13 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Sri Lanka (see A/HRC/8/52, chap. VI, paras. 257-259). 
</p>
<p>885. The outcome of the review on Sri Lanka is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/46), together with the views of Sri Lanka 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(A/HRC/8/46/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations 
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>886. Sri Lanka reaffirmed its firm resolve to constructively discuss critical issues connected 
with the human rights situation, as exemplified in its candid presentation and open engagement 
with members of the Working Group on 13 May 2008 and thereafter with the troika of 
rapporteurs and the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>887. Sri Lanka expressed concerns relating to recording of the interactive dialogue in the report 
of the Working Group and placed on record its recommendation that all countries that make 
interventions are given equal weight in the report. Of the recommendations made, Sri Lanka had 
accepted 45, and had undertaken to further consider 11 others, while being unable to 
support 26 others. These last on analysis were in fact just about 10 since several of them were 
repetitions. 
</p>
<p>888. Sri Lanka submitted a document giving its responses to the 11 recommendations it had 
considered, and indicated its general agreement with a majority of these, which included items 
such as action against torture and action to prevent the use of child soldiers, all of which it </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>abhors and which should be stopped. With regard to other recommendations, Sri Lanka has 
undertaken a thorough review of the requirements of several instruments and will reach decisions 
having further studied the implications of participation. As a party to the seven core international 
human rights instruments and several protocols and as a State making legislative preparations for 
the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Sri Lanka must 
focus keener attention on domestic legislative incorporation. In relation to domestic issues such 
as the re-establishment of the Constitutional Council, Sri Lanka has made its position clear, that 
it awaits the outcome of a parliamentary body tasked with proposing measures to rectify 
deficiencies in the seventeenth amendment to the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>889. Sri Lanka gave close attention<b> </b>to the 26 recommendations made by 17<b> </b>countries; 12 of 
these recommendations related to the expanded presence of an office of the High Commissioner 
in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has already made clear that this is not acceptable. As to another repeated 
recommendation, i.e. in relation to the issuance of a standing invitation for visits by special 
rapporteurs, Sri Lanka has demonstrated its willingness to engage with them through several 
successful missions last year. Sri Lanka noted the very helpful visits from the Special Rapporteur 
on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on internally 
displaced persons, and expects productive outcomes from this engagement, as for instance 
through its current work with the latter and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
on a workshop on durable solutions for internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>890. Amongst the rejected recommendations were several in relation to initiatives which have 
already commenced. Thus, the rejection was primarily of the language used, which implied that 
little or no action had been taken. In other cases the underlying premise was flawed or 
non-factual. With regard to one recommendation Sri Lanka noted that further time was required 
for consideration. 
</p>
<p>891. Sri Lanka also made 26 voluntary pledges. Promoting and protecting human rights takes 
pride of place in ensuring the welfare of its people and Sri Lanka attempts to do this whilst 
facing increasingly brutal and vicious atrocities from one of the most deadly terrorist forces in 
the contemporary world. Sri Lanka recently faced a spate of bombs targeting civilians, which 
were also attempts to destabilize the southern part of the country. This tactic of the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, when faced with military reverses in the North, suggests their 
desperation. But Sri Lanka assured the Council of its determination to defeat the forces of terror 
and to restore peace, pluralistic democracy and development to all its peoples. It legitimately 
expects the understanding and support of its international friends and partners. 
</p>
<p>892. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights is preparing a national action 
plan, in consultation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Human 
Rights Adviser to the United Nations country team. The Human Rights Commission of 
Sri Lanka also has its own plan and will be part of this process. Sri Lanka has, in accordance 
with the Stocktaking Report commissioned from Peter Hosking by the United Nations 
Development Programme and issued in April 2007, suggested to the National Human Rights 
Commission that the Government and the Commission should have a memorandum of 
understanding, which would help in establishing and institutionalizing the technical support and 
mechanisms that are needed. Sri Lanka strongly regretted that that report had been ignored by 
UNDP for over a year and was glad that the new UNDP team in Sri Lanka was now working on 
some of the suggestions contained therein. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>893. Sri Lanka has made significant efforts to train and upgrade its law enforcement machinery. 
The Sri Lankan Police Department has established a task force to look into key aspects of 
training. Sri Lanka believes that a disciplined, well-trained and inclusive police force will be one 
of the principal instruments to facilitate some of the necessary changes. Targeted recruitment and 
commissioning of Tamil policemen has begun, and these are initiatives that Sri Lanka intends to 
develop. 
</p>
<p>894. Sri Lanka also apprised the Council of an important development in the legal system, the 
presentation to Parliament by the Government of comprehensive victim and witness protection 
legislation. The Bill is in line with the United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice 
for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. 
</p>
<p>895. In conclusion, Sri Lanka acknowledged the involvement of those who made the universal 
periodic review of Sri Lanka a valuable and productive exercise, thanked member States who 
had contributed constructively, and noted with gratitude the contribution of the three rapporteurs 
and the secretariat. This presentation was followed by comments by States&#8217; delegations and 
non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>896. With reference to the fact that the Sri Lankan Government accepted 45 recommendations 
and refused to accept 26 others, Denmark found that the report does not sufficiently provide 
adequate recommendations. It noted that the International Independent Group of Eminent 
Persons in charge of observing the work of the Commission of Inquiry has recently decided to 
terminate its observation mission due - according to the majority of the Eminent Persons - to a 
lack of political will to support a search for the truth. Denmark would have liked a firm 
recommendation that the Commission be given total independence and the necessary funds. 
According to Denmark, strong recommendations were missing in the report, including to bring 
perpetrators to justice and to establish an international human rights monitoring mission. It 
further stated that the establishment of an office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
should have been accepted and that intimidations and killings of journalists must be stopped. 
Regarding 25 measures recommended by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
Denmark noted that non-binding words without a set timetable are easily forgotten without any 
international observers or follow-up measures in the Council. 
</p>
<p>897. Sweden welcomed the fact that Sri Lanka agreed to a large number of recommendations, 
including the Swedish delegation&#8217;s recommendation on measures to investigate, prosecute and 
punish those responsible for serious human rights crimes such as enforced disappearances and 
the recruitment of child soldiers. Sweden hoped that all these recommendations would be 
implemented and followed up on, so that progress can be reported at the second round of the 
universal periodic review, if not earlier. Sweden regretted however the lack of support for many 
of the recommendations, including those concerning independent international monitoring and 
the establishment of a proper presence of OHCHR in Sri Lanka, made by several delegations, 
including Sweden. Sweden remained convinced that increased international and independent 
monitoring would make a significant contribution to improving the human rights situation and 
the persisting impunity, which continued to give cause for great concern. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>898. Algeria appreciated Sri Lanka&#8217;s willingness to address recommendations made by the 
Working Group and was encouraged by the voluntary commitment of Sri Lanka to guarantee 
civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights by drafting a 
constitutional charter on a human rights protection framework to harmonize Sri Lanka&#8217;s 
constitutional human rights guarantees with its international obligations. It welcomed the efforts 
of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights to organize a regional seminar for 
parliamentarians and to launch a national human rights awareness campaign. Algeria was 
encouraged by the steps taken to safeguard and advance the rights of children and women, and 
efforts to address the situation and rehabilitation of former child soldiers. It also welcomed the 
commitment to restoring democracy and good governance in the newly liberated areas of the 
country. 
</p>
<p>899. Canada restated its strong recommendation that Sri Lanka allow for a full investigation of 
all allegations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings and bring perpetrators to justice. 
Canada noted that evidence given during the public hearings of the Presidential Commission of 
Inquiry has implicated members of the security forces in the killing of 17 members of Action 
contre la faim and in the murder of 5 boys in Trincomalee. Canada recommended that Sri Lanka 
fully support the Commission of Inquiry in determining the facts of these cases and take action 
so that the perpetrators are brought to justice. Canada also reiterated the importance of Sri Lanka 
ensuring that the Thamil Makkal Viduthalai Puligal and any other group with which it is 
affiliated disarm, release the child soldiers within their ranks, and stop such recruitment. Canada 
also continued to emphasize the importance of Sri Lanka providing for the independence of a 
national human rights protection institution and urged Sri Lanka to accept the presence of 
OHCHR with a full mandate to report on the situation throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>900. Qatar welcomed the steps taken for the promotion of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. It welcomed that in spite of complex and recurrent challenges faced by Sri Lanka 
which impede its reform process, Sri Lanka has positively responded to the Council and spared 
no efforts since the review to examine means to respond to the recommendations of the Working 
Group. It highly valued Sri Lanka&#8217;s acceptance of most of the recommendations, which proves 
its aspirations to promote all human rights and to consolidate the rule of law. Qatar welcomed 
Sri Lanka&#8217;s declaration to continue its institutional capacity-building in the field of human rights 
with the support of the international community, including OHCHR, and to guarantee the 
independence of its institutions in accordance with the Paris Principles. It welcomed the 
continuation of dialogue and cooperation with the United Nations mechanisms. It noted that 
Sri Lanka has also accepted the recommendation calling for integrating all substantive provisions 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in its national legislation, as well as 
the recommendation on the Convention against Torture. Qatar appreciated the acceptance to 
involve all civil society institutions in the universal periodic review process, in addition to 
accepting measures to guarantee access of vulnerable groups to humanitarian assistance, as well 
as civilian protection, including of human rights defenders and humanitarian workers. Qatar 
noted that all these reforms prove that Sri Lanka is promoting the rule of law and fundamental 
freedoms. 
</p>
<p>901. China appreciated the serious and responsible attitude of Sri Lanka in answering the 
questions raised by the countries and in accepting most of the suggestions of the Working Group 
in an open and constructive spirit. China noted that Sri Lanka is a developing country, affected 
by terrorist activities, and that years of conflict and wars have caused serious disruption to its </p>

<p>nation building process. Despite these, Sri Lanka has never given up its efforts to promote and 
protect human rights. It has established a national human rights committee and will implement 
its National Human Rights Plan. The human development index for Sri Lanka has moved up in 
the ranking of the region. China further noted the effective cooperation of Sri Lanka with the 
United Nations human rights mechanisms. It welcomed the fact that Sri Lanka would fully 
cooperate with the international community for the settlement of the issue of child soldiers, and 
would make further efforts to promote democracy and good governance. It expressed its hope 
that the international community, in a spirit of mutual respect and equality, would provide 
technical assistance to meet the real needs of the country. 
</p>
<p>902. Bahrain appreciated efforts made by Sri Lanka for the promotion and protection of human 
rights, in spite of the challenges it faced, including natural disasters. It noted that Sri Lanka&#8217;s 
constructive and positive approach during the universal periodic review process proves its 
willingness to develop human rights and achieve more progress in this field. It welcomed 
Sri Lanka&#8217;s initiative to implement a national plan of action in the field of human rights and its 
commitment to taking steps to rehabilitate former child soldiers, in cooperation with the 
international community. Bahrain welcomed that Sri Lanka accepted 45 recommendations and in 
addition made more than 25 voluntary pledges. It wished Sri Lanka all success in its efforts 
aimed at achieving progress in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>903. Indonesia commended Sri Lanka on the straightforward and transparent manner in which it 
answered the questions raised by the delegations on the various human rights issues. The tone of 
these replies was in keeping with the consistent efforts made by Sri Lanka and the good will and 
commitment it demonstrated in striving to maintain democratic standards. Indonesia noted that 
Sri Lanka has worked hard to keep the channels of communication open despite frequent and 
murderous terrorist attacks, and that it had fought consistently to uphold and protect human 
rights in difficult circumstances. Indonesia took note of Sri Lanka&#8217;s commitment to democracy 
and good governance. It noted that the national reconciliation efforts have been successful and 
should be consolidated through the extension and implementation of human rights standards and 
policies in all parts of the country. Sri Lanka&#8217;s strong commitment to this goal, notably through 
its initiative to establish and implement a national plan of action for the promotion and protection 
of human rights, the drafting of the projected constitutional charter and its clear identification of 
its capacity-building needs, should be appreciated. Indonesia also appreciated Sri Lanka&#8217;s 
positive and participatory approach to the universal periodic review. Indonesia commended 
Sri Lanka on its commitment to stepping up the rehabilitation of former child soldiers, through 
enhanced cooperation with the international community. Time should be given to Sri Lanka so 
that it has the opportunity to achieve the desired results. 
</p>
<p>904. Japan welcomed Sri Lanka&#8217;s voluntary commitments and its support 
to 45 recommendations, especially in relation to increased efforts to further prevent cases of 
kidnapping, forced disappearances and extrajudicial executions, putting an end to the culture of 
impunity by bringing all perpetrators to justice, and enhancing its capacity in the areas of crime 
investigation, judiciary and the National Human Rights Institution. Japan was concerned about 
not having seen tangible results so far and, with reference to the recent dissolution of the 
International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, noted that it was important to secure an 
international presence in some form, in a manner acceptable to the Government of Sri Lanka, to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>assist its efforts for the improvement of the situation. Japan reiterated that it expected further 
efforts by the Government of Sri Lanka to improve its human rights situation, and that it 
continued to support these efforts by the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>905. Amnesty International, in a joint statement with Human Rights Watch, welcomed the 
recommendations made to Sri Lanka, in particular to investigate and prosecute all allegations of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings, and bring the perpetrators to justice. In May, the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions informed the Council that 
the Government appeared to rely on paramilitary groups to maintain control in the east and that 
there was evidence that these groups were responsible for extrajudicial executions. It welcomed 
the recommendation to cooperate actively with special procedures. Given the pattern of 
increased disappearances as noted by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances, it urged the Government to set an early date for the visit requested by the 
Working Group. It was deeply disappointed that Sri Lanka does not support the recommendation 
made by at least 12 States to establish an international human rights monitoring mechanism 
under United Nations auspices, essential to the protection of human rights, because effective 
domestic mechanisms to monitor and investigate abuses by all sides are ineffective. It further 
noted that the status of the national human rights commission was downgraded in 
December 2007 because of concerns in the appointment of its commissioners and its inability to 
investigate disappearances. It stressed that the Government must end the current climate of 
impunity for human rights violations, noting that none of those responsible for the most serious 
atrocities in the past two years, such as the killings of 5 students in Trincomalee and of the 17 aid 
workers have been prosecuted, and welcomed the Government&#8217;s voluntary commitment to 
continue a constructive dialogue with the High Commissioner to strengthen national mechanisms 
in all aspects. 
</p>
<p>906. Interfaith International noted that the report of the Working Group indicated that many 
States are concerned about child recruitment in relation to all factions and some have 
recommended that Sri Lanka investigate the role of security forces in child recruitment and hold 
to account all those responsible. It also stressed the need to consider other child rights, in 
particular child labour, poverty and sexual abuse, and that there are many children affected by 
war, without parents, shelter and food, and without consistent assistance. It regretted that the 
review has not mentioned the recommendations of the report of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (A/HRC/8/3/Add.3), in which he urged the two 
parties of the conflict, the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), to 
initiate and regularize contact between the government police and the policing forces that operate 
in LTTE-controlled areas. Referring to paragraph 82 of the report of the Working Group, it 
observed that even though some countries recommended that the independence of Sri Lanka&#8217;s 
human rights institutions be strengthened, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and special 
procedures go further by asserting that the National Human Rights Commission is no longer 
independent. The Council should urge the Government of Sri Lanka to accept an independent 
presence of OHCHR and to allow the entry of international human rights monitors. 
</p>
<p>907. The International Educational Development, while it appreciated the many concerns 
reflected in the report regarding humanitarian law violations, regretted that in the absence of a 
detailed evaluation of the acts and policies of Sri Lanka in light of humanitarian law. It regretted </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that the recommendations relate to the armed conflict or to the need for an enhanced 
representation of OHCHR do not enjoy the support of Sri Lanka. It also noted that Sri Lanka has 
not made any voluntary commitment relating to its humanitarian law obligations, but has in 
relation to humanitarian assistance and internally displaced persons. It noted that the vast 
majority of the internally displaced persons are Tamil civilians and that Sri Lanka has not fully 
complied with recommendations already made regarding human rights and humanitarian law. It 
highlighted that, in fact, violations have escalated, that the Sri Lanka monitoring mission was no 
longer in operation, that the national human rights institution did not meet the Paris Principles, 
and that even the narrowly focused International Independent Group of Eminent Persons has 
failed to make headway and has been disbanded. 
</p>
<p>908. The International Commission of Jurists called for prompt implementation of all 
recommendations by the Sri Lankan Government, and referred to recommendations 2, 3, 14, 17, 
18 and paragraph 84 thereon. It noted that the information provided during the review showed 
that Sri Lanka&#8217;s national human rights protection system does not function as part of a coherent 
and regular justice system. It noted that the Government must strengthen the independence, 
impartiality and capacity of the justice system to ensure adequate investigation, prosecution and 
conviction of the perpetrators of gross human rights violations and of the disproportionate and 
indiscriminate use of force and other breaches of international humanitarian law by both the 
Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE and other non-State actors. It also maintained that the 
Government&#8217;s reservations to the recommendations to combat impunity, as stated in 
paragraph 84 of the report of the Working Group, are absurd and should be disregarded, along 
with the reservations to the recommendations to protect humanitarian personnel. It was also 
concerned that the Constitutional Council remained dissolved and called for the swift 
appointment of its members as well as for the specification of a time frame for the adoption of 
the Victim and Witness Assistance and Protection Act. Finally, it noted that the volatile human 
rights situation in Sri Lanka largely prevails due to a lack of political will to ensure 
accountability for human rights violations and stressed that the meaningfulness of any future 
assistance to empower the regular justice systems will depend on the support from the 
international monitoring and reporting presence, which must be swiftly re-established. 
</p>
<p>909. The International Movement against all Forms of Discrimination and Racism and 
Pax Romana noted the recommendations made to address impunity, media freedom, the increase 
in disappearances and extrajudicial killings, and the continuing attacks on peace activists and 
human rights defenders. It expressed concern at the racial profiling of detainees, the majority of 
whom are Tamils, heightened communal tensions and violence faced by Muslims in the east, 
sexual violence faced by Tamil women in Akkaraipattu, and threat and intimidation faced by 
two journalists. They recalled the recommendation urging Sri Lanka to address torture, combat 
impunity, reconsider establishing a local presence of OHCHR, increase cooperation providing 
unrestricted access for humanitarian aid and ensure the protection and security of internally 
displaced persons. All initiatives taken by Sri Lanka have failed to address these issues 
effectively. It called upon Sri Lanka to provide information on a date or timeline related to the 
reconstitution of the Human Rights Commission in accordance with the Paris Principles; on the 
full implementation of the provisions of international human rights instruments at the national 
level, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention 
against Torture; on the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance; and on an action plan related to the implementation of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the voluntary pledges with benchmarks. It noted that several countries have spoken rightly about 
poverty and development challenges faced by Sri Lanka, and stated that the mere eradication of 
poverty does not make a guarantee of certain minimum human rights standards optional. 
</p>
<p>910. The Asian Legal Resource Centre noted that the report of the Working Group underlined 
the worsening of the human rights situation and the need for the Government to investigate, 
prosecute and convict those responsible for widespread torture, extrajudicial killings and forced 
disappearances. It was concerned about Sri Lanka&#8217;s lack of credibility and unwillingness to 
address the widespread use of torture and impunity. It welcomed the recommendation made by 
the Islamic Republic of Iran on this issue, and noted that calls on the implementation of the 
recommendation of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the Rome Statute and the International 
Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance must be heeded by 
Sri Lanka. It noted that despite its repeated requests for Sri Lanka to provide evidence of the 
alleged 599 prosecutions of State agents concerning disappearances, it had not received a shred 
of information, and was concerned that these statistics relate to cases committed in the past. It 
stated that there was an undeniable gap in protection in Sri Lanka, which showed the need for an 
appropriately sized international presence, and highlighted that recommendations calling for the 
strengthening of the rule of law were of paramount importance, and stated that the worsening 
situation in Sri Lanka was driven by the paralysis of its institutions of the rule of law and the 
active role played by those in power to remain above the law. 
</p>
<p>911. International Women&#8217;s Rights Action Watch Asia-Pacific noted that the vast majority of 
the recommendations rejected by Sri Lanka related to allowing international scrutiny of the 
human rights situation in and to assistance from United Nations agencies in addressing the 
human rights concerns in the country. It stated that this rejection demonstrated a lack of 
accountability and transparency contrary to the spirit of the universal periodic review process. It 
called on the Sri Lankan Government to allow for a strong and sustained international human 
rights presence in the country to monitor, investigate and report on human rights violations and 
assist in efforts to end human rights violations and impunity. It also expressed its deep concern at 
the fact that Sri Lanka had rejected recommendations 28 (b), 33 (b) and 55 (a) relating to 
addressing impunity for human rights violations. It added that Sri Lanka had rejected 
recommendation 32 (d) relating to the implementation of the recommendations made by the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situations of human rights defenders in 
relation to restricting the registration and activities of non-governmental organizations and civil 
society, thereby signalling an intention to maintain the lack of accountability and transparency 
with which the Government is responding to the human rights crisis in the country. While 
welcoming recommendation 35, it also expressed concern that women&#8217;s specific human rights 
concerns were not raised during the interactive dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed on the outcome by the State 
under review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>912. In its final response, which dealt with certain key issues, Sri Lanka stated that, with regard 
to the question of torture and extrajudicial executions, Sri Lanka of course accepted the 
recommendations since it did not, at any stage, condone such acts. Sri Lanka strongly refuted 
some suggestions that it has been complicit in torture or extrajudicial executions. It stressed that 
there is an absolute constitutional guarantee against torture in article 11 of the Constitution and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that this constitutes a criminal offence with a seven-year minimum term of imprisonment 
applicable to convicted persons. The Supreme Court is empowered to make determinations 
regarding allegations of torture and award compensation. Sri Lanka also indicated that all 
complaints of torture are impartially and comprehensively investigated and perpetrators 
prosecuted in courts. It stressed that the civil legal system enables victims to obtain damages 
additionally and that in some cases disciplinary action is taken against public officials if found 
guilty of such offences. 
</p>
<p>913. Sri Lanka noted that extrajudicial killings are also criminalized without any exception and 
that comprehensive legal processes are available to act against those responsible for such 
criminal activity. Sri Lanka stated that it will, as it does at present, continue to implement and 
further develop safeguards to prevent the occurrence of such criminal activity. 
</p>
<p>914. On the allegations of impunity, Sri Lanka indicated that every effort is being made to bring 
to justice perpetuators of offences or violators of human rights. It refuted the allegation that there 
is no will of the Government to deal with this issue and indicated that necessary structures have 
been set up. Sri Lanka stressed that it has persistently asked OHCHR for technical assistance to 
develop local structures that deal with such matters, and for assistance with capacity-building for 
its national institutions. Sri Lanka recalled its long history of a highly developed legal system 
and referred to its complex system of laws. It stressed that it does not require any more 
assistance in terms of legal inputs to deal with matters of human rights. However Sri Lanka 
asked the Council to appreciate current difficulties and understand the need for technical 
assistance and capacity-building as requested. 
</p>
<p>915. Sri Lanka noted that a principal difficulty in ensuring the rule of law was its ongoing 
problems with terrorism, and expressed its deep concern about the failure of some of its friends 
to deal satisfactorily with funding flowing from their States for terrorist activity. It pleaded that 
every effort be made and that every assistance be given with regard to the endeavour to stop the 
funding of terrorism, internationally and in particular for Sri Lanka. It stressed that large sums 
flow from other jurisdictions to Sri Lanka to fund terrorism. Sri Lanka strongly believes that if 
the funding is curtailed, the fight against terrorism could be far more successful and that the 
conflict could be brought to a peaceful end, which would contribute immeasurably to 
strengthening efforts to protect all human rights. 
</p>
<p>916. On the question that had been raised with regard to sexual violence against women in 
Akkaraipattu, Sri Lanka indicated that mechanisms are in place both in criminal law and civil 
law to deal with questions of sexual violence against women all over the country. Perpetrators 
are brought to book as a matter of routine. 
</p>
<p>917. There had also been criticism as to threats to journalists allegedly made by the Secretary of 
Defence. Sri Lanka is conscious of its constitutional guarantees for the freedom of expression 
and respects such freedom. However it was necessary to understand that this did not preclude 
Government criticism of the press with regard to some matters concerning national security. 
Sri Lanka insisted that it cannot be in a position of compromising national security even whilst 
assuring the freedom of the press which it cherishes and would like to protect. The press must be 
conscious of and sensitive to the requirements of national security in the context of the crisis the 
country faces. The Government is committed to the protection of a free press and every freedom 
would be granted to every journalist in carrying out his or her work. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>918. Sri Lanka stressed that the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons is still in 
existence and disagreed with the comment that this mechanism had failed. The previous 
members of the Group had withdrawn but the principle was still in place and could be activated. 
Sri Lanka invited member States to assist in whatever way possible to enhance the effectiveness 
of the commission investigating the offences to which attention had been drawn such as those 
related to the Action contre la faim incident and the incident in Trincomalee. 
</p>
<p>919. With regard to cooperation with United Nations mechanisms, Sri Lanka noted again its 
concern about torture, which is why it had welcomed the visit of the Special Rapporteur, who 
had provided a very helpful report on which action was being taken. It was also concerned about 
allegations of impunity, and noted that in this context it had found the 2006 report of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions very helpful, inasmuch as it drew 
attention to many problems and suggested mechanisms to address them. Though action in this 
regard had been slower than Sri Lanka would have liked, for various reasons, further cooperation 
with the<b> </b>Special Rapporteur was desirable, and it was regrettable that he had failed to respond to 
recent communication which noted areas in which action was being taken and assistance and 
advice would be welcome. Sri Lanka however would proceed as necessary, and noted the 
assistance with police training provided by Sweden and the United Kingdom. It was a pity the 
so-called international Police Support Group had not been more effective, but action had been 
taken to revive it, and in particular to actively involve also the Government of Japan, which had 
provided such constructive suggestions. 
</p>
<p>920. Regarding the criticism of the National Human Rights Commission, Sri Lanka requested 
the President and the Council to investigate why the Stocktaking Report commissioned by 
UNDP in 2007 had been ignored. Sri Lanka indicated that this affirmed confidence in the 
existing Commission but suggested areas in which it could be strengthened, and its 
recommendations should have been implemented. Sri Lanka regretted what seemed a lack of 
efficiency or commitment on the part of some officials of OHCHR in this regard, and that senior 
officials had not been aware of the report. It was unfortunate that assistance requested to deal 
with disappearances that had occurred 15 years previously had not been provided. Since then 
these had been dismissed by the National Human Rights Commission, which ought not to have 
occurred, but the questions could be cleared with appropriate assistance, and it was hoped that 
this would be forthcoming. 
</p>
<p>921. Regarding the issue of the international monitoring mission, Sri Lanka felt that the 
continuous finger-wagging in this regard by some European States was not at all helpful. It was 
striking that out of the 12 recommendations as to a monitoring mission, 11 came from 
European countries. Greater efforts to improve national mechanisms and to eradicate the 
problems that complicated improvements with regard to all aspects of human rights for all 
Sri Lankan citizens would be more useful. Sri Lanka appreciated that all countries wished to put 
a stop to terrorism, but it was sad that some claimed that the mechanisms to stop the flow of 
terrorist funding were not in place or that there were other priorities. Sri Lanka expressed 
appreciation of the efforts of countries such as France and the United Kingdom for their efforts 
in this regard, but noted that unless there was greater commitment to deal with that issue, 
progress in many areas would be difficult. It did understand that legal niceties were difficult to 
resolve, but it trusted that similar understanding would be extended to Sri Lanka in the difficult 
situation it faced. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>922. Sri Lanka was of the view that the comment made by Denmark stating that Sri Lanka did 
not look at recommendations because it rejected a few was just completely not true. Sri Lanka 
regretted such an intervention, in marked contrast to those of all other countries which, whilst 
drawing attention to matters that could be remedied, had tried to understand the difficulties 
Sri Lanka faced and the efforts it was making. There were four pillars Sri Lanka was 
strengthening in its efforts to develop a fully democratic and pluralistic society for its citizens. 
One of them was human rights, but it also needed to eradicate terrorism, to promote pluralism 
and to ensure development. It hoped its friends understood that all these needed to go together, 
and that assistance and support was desirable in all these areas. In this regard, Sri Lanka 
presented the President of the Council with a publication entitled &#8220;Pursuing Peace, Fighting 
Falsehood&#8221;, which it hoped would make clear the difficulties it faced and the efforts it was 
making to promote pluralism and democracy under testing circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b>France 
</b></p>
<p>923. The review of France was held on 14 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by France in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/FRA/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/FRA/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/FRA/3). 
</p>
<p>924. At its 21st meeting, on 13 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on France (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>925. The outcome of the review on France is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/47), together with the views of France concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/8/47/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations  
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>926. The French delegation said that it was a privilege for France to be one of the first States to 
be reviewed under the universal periodic review mechanism. The preparation for the review, and 
the preparation of the national report in particular, had entailed a broad consultation involving 
government bodies and civil society, including the National Consultative Commission for 
Human Rights (CNCDH), and those parties had been consulted during the preparation of 
France&#8217;s responses to the recommendations made during the review on 14 May 2008. 
</p>
<p>927. The delegation then summarized France&#8217;s response to those recommendations, which were 
contained in document A/HRC/8/47/Add.1. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>928. Qatar congratulated France for the information submitted at all stages of the universal 
periodic review process and acknowledged positively the constructive and cooperative spirit. It 
stated that several recommendations had been made and that France had accepted a majority of 
them. Qatar noted that France took the initiative, in its preliminary statement and during the 
dialogue, to make many other commitments to reinforce its human rights protection system. 
France, inter alia, committed itself to organizing a consultation to follow up on the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action and the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. 
Qatar noted that France further committed itself to submit for ratification to Parliament the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
Finally, Qatar noted with satisfaction that many of the accepted recommendations by France aim 
at improving living conditions of persons belonging to vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p>929. Morocco thanked France for its exhaustive replies to the deliberations of the Working 
Group. Morocco noted in particular the measures taken to reinforce the rights of migrants and 
the expressed will of France to address this issue during its presidency of the European Union. 
The priority given in the penal sphere to combat all forms of discrimination was also noted. 
Morocco expressed the wish that these two areas - non-discrimination and migration - will be 
part of the communications that France will be transmitting to the Council as part of the 
follow-up to which they have committed themselves. 
</p>
<p>930. Algeria paid tribute to the French delegation and made three comments with regard to the 
review process. Algeria regretted that it is not possible for France to ratify the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families and expressed the hope that the time will come when France will be able to accede to 
this treaty. Algeria is pleased that incitement to religious and racial hatred are considered crimes 
in France. Finally, Algeria noted the recognition by France of the suffering relating to 
colonialism in accordance with paragraph 101 of the Durban Declaration and it expressed the 
hope that this would also be expressed regarding colonialism in Algeria.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>931. The Commission Nationale Consultative des Droits de l&#8217;Homme congratulated France on 
the involvement of civil society and the national human rights institution in the universal 
periodic review process. The recommendations made to France in the Working Group reflect 
similar observations already made by treaty bodies or by the Council of Europe, such as on the 
issue of prisons and places of detention, which have been the subject of increasing criticism by 
international and non-governmental organizations. Concerns were expressed regarding the 
treatment of asylum-seekers, police violence, and expulsion to borders in inhumane 
circumstances. It was of the view that France&#8217;s position regarding the issue of minorities should 
be re-examined. The Commission stated that it would follow the implementation of 
commitments undertaken by France and proposed to keep States, the Council and treaty bodies 
regularly updated through its annual report on the human rights situation in France. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>932. The F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture - 
FIACAT, jointly with Human Rights Watch, on the issue of places of detention, noted the 
commitments undertaken by France to develop alternative penalties to prison, and encouraged 
France to take concrete measures and establish a timeline to eliminate prison overpopulation, 
since it amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment. A clear response must also be provided to 
follow-up on allegations of ill treatment committed by security forces against persons deprived 
of their liberty. The existence of the National Commission on Ethics and Safety is threatened, 
while its role should, on the contrary, be maintained and strengthened. It is opposed to the use of 
electric stun guns, which results in sharp pain constituting a form of torture, according to the 
Committee against Torture, and called for their prohibition. It remained concerned at the absence 
of an automatic suspension of expulsion measures. It regretted that France did not go into details 
concerning persons held in custody for terrorism, including the lack of access to legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>933. The Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action said that France was one of 
the birthplaces of human rights and inquired on the issuance of an invitation to the Special 
Rapporteur on human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people to visit Tahiti and 
Kanaky. It also asked how France planned to implement the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples and noted that France had stopped nuclear testing in the Pacific. It 
noted the importance of the promises made to Tahitian workers in Mururoa and Fangataufa, 
especially to release health records of the workers. Further, it noted the imminent issues of land, 
health and environmental rights in Kanaky. Pollution from the mining at the Goro Nickel mining 
project is affecting the indigenous Kanaky living in their historic homeland, and it asked whether 
France would assist the Kanaky to ensure the right of free, prior and informed consent in this 
regard. The people in Tahiti were interested in learning more about human rights, inquired in 
whether France would be willing to work with non-governmental organizations in the region to 
sponsor trainings, seminars and workshops, including on how non-governmental organizations 
can access United Nations human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>934. The Islamic Human Rights Commission was grateful for the conclusions and 
recommendations on the review of France, and was pleased to see that the recommendations 
reflect their concerns, especially on the issue of the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. 
Serious concern was expressed regarding the Government&#8217;s failure to provide even the basic 
rights of ethnic and religious minority groups. By doing so, the Government harmed the 
minorities but consequently it also led to depriving the majority from taking advantage of a 
peaceful society. Some of the existing laws and many, in their application, were discriminatory, 
especially the headscarf (hijab) ban in schools which damaged the progress and advancement of 
Muslim women by depriving them of their basic right to education. The Islamic Human Rights 
Commission strongly recommended that the ban be removed and further urged the Government 
to stop its anti-religious attitude. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed on the outcome by the State  
under review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>935. The representative of France concluded by taking note of the observations made by 
member States, CNCDH and non-governmental organizations. Attention was drawn to France&#8217;s 
response to the recommendations made during the review exercise, contained in document 
A/HRC/8/47/Add.1, which consisted of replies dealing with the following topics: ratification of 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Members of their Families; colonialism; prison conditions; the right to asylum; efforts to combat 
terrorism; France&#8217;s Overseas Territories; and the wearing in schools of symbols or clothing 
indicative of one&#8217;s religion. France would continue to honour its international commitments and 
keep the Council informed, and it would also continue to encourage civil society and CNCDH to 
participate in the follow-up to the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b>Tonga 
</b></p>
<p>936. The review of Tonga was held on 14 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Tonga in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/TON/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/TON/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/TON/3). 
</p>
<p>937. At its 21st meeting, on 13 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Tonga (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>938. The outcome of the review on Tonga is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/48), together with the views of Tonga concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations  
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>939. The delegation of Tonga expressed its deep thanks to the States that contributed to Tonga&#8217;s 
review on 14 May 2008. Their involvement and contributions were a source of deep appreciation 
for Tonga.  
</p>
<p>940. Tonga paid a particular tribute to the role and work of the troika (Mexico, Nigeria and 
Qatar) as well as to the secretariat of OHCHR, with whom it was able to achieve and 
accept 31 recommendations.  
</p>
<p>941. Tonga also paid tribute to the support and assistance of New Zealand and the 
Commonwealth Secretariat, which assisted Tonga during the process for the preparatory work 
for the universal periodic review. Tonga noted that the time and capacity constraints were in no 
way an obstacle for the Government to sincerely support and contribute to the work of the 
Council.  
</p>
<p>942. Tonga stressed that the national report submitted to the universal periodic review 
mechanism was the result of an intense and broad consultation which included the civil society, 
the private sector and the Church. Tonga reiterated its willingness to share its experience with 
small island States of the Pacific region as well as others. It also reaffirmed its pledges and 
commitment to continue to support and cooperate with the Council and its universal periodic 
review. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>943. Algeria thanked Tonga for its presentation and commended it on their open and transparent 
dialogue and willingness to promote and protect human rights and international obligations. It 
noted Tonga&#8217;s commitment to heightening public awareness and conducting training 
programmes on the legal rights of women and for non-governmental organizations in support of 
women. It commended Tonga on having followed up on the recommendation to enact laws to 
protect women in employment from discrimination. Algeria was encouraged by the initiative of 
the Pacific Plan to set up a regional human rights institution, which complies with Algeria&#8217;s 
recommendations contained in recommendation 25 of the report of the Working Group. Algeria 
also commended Tonga on the core values enshrined in its Constitution and welcomed its 
willingness to implement recommendation 26 to ensure human rights and fundamental freedoms 
for all Tongans and advocated that OHCHR provide support to attain this objective. It welcomed 
a representation in Geneva of the Pacific Islands Forum to pursue a fruitful dialogue. 
</p>
<p>944. Morocco welcomed the delegation of Tonga and thanked them for the presentation and 
cooperation with the Council throughout the universal periodic review process. It commended 
Tonga on its commitment to ratifying the key international human rights instruments to which it 
is not a party and the steps taken towards instituting a democracy. It indicated that the review of 
Tonga, which has no representation in Geneva, raised the question of the contributions by 
small islands. It stated that the proposal to open an office of cooperation for Pacific islands in 
Geneva deserves full attention and would have a positive impact on the work of the Council. At 
the same time, it noted the expectations of Tonga in terms of technical assistance and 
capacity-building and indicated that this should be considered with the greatest diligence by 
OHCHR in order to assist Tonga in its efforts to build a democracy and ensure the promotion 
and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>945. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland wished to place on record its 
thanks to the delegation of Tonga for the open and constructive approach it has taken to the 
universal periodic review. As noted by many countries throughout the review process, it 
observed that to be among the first countries to be reviewed by a new mechanism offered 
particular challenges and that for a smaller country, those challenges were even greater. The 
United Kingdom believed that Tonga&#8217;s approach to the universal periodic review had shown that 
this mechanism was truly universal and could offer added value to countries&#8217; efforts to advance 
their human rights record. The United Kingdom made recommendations to Tonga on the 
adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
and on the involvement of civil society in the follow-up to the review, and was gratified that 
those and other recommendations were accepted by Tonga. It looked forward to seeing progress 
on those recommendations at Tonga&#8217;s next review in four years&#8217; time. 
</p>
<p>946. Maldives welcomed the report of the Working Group and congratulated Tonga for 
conducting itself in an exemplary manner throughout the process. It noted that the report 
reflected the proud cultural heritage of Tonga and its belief in the importance of individual rights 
and freedoms. The report also reflected the forward-looking nature of Tonga&#8217;s national report 
which identified a number of important challenges facing the country, and included many useful 
recommendations to help Tonga meet these challenges and strengthen the human rights 
protection for all its citizens. Maldives noted that the determination of small island States to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>improve the human rights promotion and protection in line with the core international 
conventions is not always matched by the necessary resources necessary and that capacity 
constraints are the biggest factor preventing small island States from cooperating more fully with 
the Council and other human rights mechanisms. Maldives requested the international 
community, including donor agencies and OHCHR to enter into a dialogue with Tonga and to 
work with it to help it in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of 
the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>947. New Zealand stated that Tonga was the first country from the South Pacific region to be 
reviewed. It stated that Tonga had given the universal periodic review high priority, with the 
preparation of a comprehensive national report with the input of a number of non-governmental 
organizations. It observed that the quality of Tonga&#8217;s presentation resulted in a wide-ranging 
discussion during the review, in which many delegations actively participated. New Zealand 
recalled that, as a sign of the importance attached by the Government of Tonga to its 
participation in the review, the Prime Minister visited Geneva shortly before the review took 
place. New Zealand stated that for small island States of the Pacific, many with populations of 
100,000 or less, participation in the universal periodic review was a major undertaking. It 
recognized the practical difficulties they faced in meeting their obligations under the universal 
periodic review process. New Zealand intended to convene a seminar early next year to assist 
officials of the Pacific Island Governments in working through the universal periodic review 
process. It would be most valuable to have a representation from Tonga, as a pioneer of the 
universal periodic review in the Pacific, to make the planned seminar a success. 
</p>
<p>948. Switzerland congratulated the delegation of Tonga for its commitment and cooperation 
during the universal periodic review. It was pleased to note that even a small State with limited 
resources was able to participate with a large delegation, was able to present a report, and engage 
in a substantive dialogue with the international community. It encouraged Tonga to continue its 
commitments along these lines, in particular its cooperation with civil society. It noted that the 
universal periodic review is a tool to enhance dialogue and therefore recommendations next time 
should be formulated in a targeted manner so as to enable small countries to accept and 
implement them. Switzerland reiterated its appreciation for the openness of Tonga in presenting 
its aspirations in the field of human rights while at the same time noting its remaining challenges. 
</p>
<p>949. Qatar appreciated Tonga&#8217;s cooperation and the constructive dialogue. It noted that Tonga 
responded to many of the recommendations made during the interactive dialogue and noted its 
agreement to these recommendations. It welcomed the pledge made by Tonga to continue the 
democratic reforms and to consider positively the recommendation to ensure ratification of core 
human rights treaties in addition to furthering cooperation with human rights mechanisms. It 
noted that Tonga expressed its willingness to ratify the two international covenants and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and to enact 
national laws to further the protection of women in employment. It also noted Tonga&#8217;s 
willingness to promote the protection of freedom of expression and information and the right to 
education, and to offer training for law enforcement agencies and to promote the participation of 
civil society in the protection and promotion of human rights. Qatar appreciated all the measures 
that have been taken by Tonga to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. It called 
upon Tonga to continue the reform process which is under way for the benefit of the people of 
Tonga. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>950. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed Tonga&#8217;s constructive engagement in 
the universal periodic review and its cultural commitment to the respect for all people, the values 
of community and inclusiveness and the commitment to human rights. It however expressed its 
disappointment that Tonga did not accept the recommendation to decriminalize certain forms of 
consensual conduct, which despite the fact that the law is not enforced, is inconsistent with 
Tonga&#8217;s commitment to international human rights principles. It also noted that, in the outcome 
report, Tonga welcomed a continuing frank and robust discussion of the issue. It hoped that 
Tonga will continue to keep an open mind and maintain that dialogue with a view to 
decriminalizing such consensual conduct in the near future so that all Tongans may participate in 
the life of their community in equal dignity and respect. 
</p>
<p>951. The Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action noted that throughout the 
region of the Pacific, ratification of the core international human rights instruments such as the 
Bill of Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women is low, as is the level of completion of reports in a timely manner and of full 
participation in the treaty body mechanisms. It looked forward to working with Tonga in 
collaboration with civil society to complete its periodic report and to appear before the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 2009 or 2010, as well as to finalize its 
initial report and appear before the Committee on the Rights of the Child. It encouraged Tonga to 
continue its leadership in the region and to work on the idea of establishing an office in Geneva. 
It indicated that special procedures rarely visit the Pacific region and noted the importance that 
such visits would have to assist and support follow-up activities of these countries. It noted the 
requests made by special procedures to visit Tonga and the low interest demonstrated by the 
Government. It noted that since the session of Working Group, a meeting has taken place in 
New York between the United Nations and the Permanent Mission of Tonga to the 
United Nations. It noted its aim to assist Governments of the Pacific islands in the promotion 
and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>952. International Women&#8217;s Rights Action Watch Asia-Pacific (also on behalf of Action 
Canada for Population and Development, the Federation for Women and Family Planning and 
the Latin American Committee for the Defence of Women&#8217;s Rights) welcomed the engagement 
of Tonga in the universal periodic review process and the scrutiny to which the national human 
rights situation was submitted. It noted that Tonga rejected recommendations 38 (c) and 39 (a) 
which called on the Government to repeal national laws which discriminated against women, 
including in the area of inheritance, ownership to land and child support. It was deeply 
concerned by the Government&#8217;s lack of willingness to bring its national laws into conformity 
with international human rights norms relating to equality and non-discrimination between men 
and women, and called on Tonga to accept those recommendations to bring its national law into 
line with its international human rights obligations. It also noted with serious concern that Tonga 
had rejected recommendation 39 (b) and others calling on the Government to decriminalize 
consensual same-sex activities, observing that the criminalization of consensual same-sex 
activities has been recognized by the Human Rights Committee as a violation of the human 
rights to privacy and non-discrimination guaranteed to all people by international instruments. It 
did, however, appreciate the rejection of recommendation 58 (b), as this erroneous 
recommendation failed to take account of international law and jurisprudence and the respect of 
the human rights of all people. It called on the Government to accept recommendations in the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>outcome document which related to addressing discrimination against women and sexual 
minorities, thereby furthering the full implementation of human rights norms and the full 
enjoyment of all people of their human rights; and to this end, urged Tonga to ratify the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>953. Amnesty International appreciated the positive participation of Tonga in the universal 
periodic review, noting its contribution to the improvement of the human rights situation in the 
country as well as to making the universal periodic review a universal mechanism. It also noted 
Tonga&#8217;s leadership role as the Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum secretariat. It encouraged 
Tonga to implement the recommendations of the Working Group, particularly in relation to 
accession to core human rights treaties and to obligations under the treaties to which Tonga is 
already a party. It also encouraged Tonga to continue to engage actively with civil society 
organizations in human rights work, including capacity-building and training initiatives and 
general discussion of proposed legislative reforms. It acknowledged Tonga&#8217;s challenges in 
preparing the national report and expressed hope that its experience would facilitate the process 
for the preparation of the next report, as well as of reports to the human rights treaty bodies. It 
also noted the importance of ensuring the wide dissemination of the review outcome to all 
stakeholders in the country, with the aim of providing greater understanding of the process, the 
importance of human rights, and measures that can be taken to improve the human rights 
situation in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed on the outcome by the State  
under review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>954. In conclusion to the outcome of the review, the delegation of Tonga expressed its deep 
appreciation and gratitude to the speakers who had taken the floor and thanked them for their 
reflections, which have a positive impact on the experience of Tonga under the universal 
periodic review mechanism. With respect to the initiative mentioned by New Zealand to 
organize a regional seminar, Tonga, as already pledged, is prepared to share its experience and 
would be pleased to participate. As to enhancing the Pacific voice, it noted that this is a current 
discussion, which requires the consultation of the States members of the Pacific Islands Forum.  
</p>
<p>955. The delegation of Tonga also thanked all the stakeholders who took the floor. With respect 
to some of the issues that have been raised, in particular the decriminalization of certain sexual 
activities and the status of Tongan women in society, these had been already dealt with during 
the review and it did not intend to repeat the position of Tonga or to create a debate on those 
issues at this stage, and Tonga certainly noted the interventions made in that regard. It also noted 
that, in general, Tonga values the partnership with civil society and recalled that during the 
process of the preparation of the national report, the Government had engaged various local civil 
society members in the drafting process. While there was not participation of international 
non-governmental organizations, Tonga believes that the report reflects the views of the local 
civil society. It highlighted that one of the outcomes of the national report was to seek assistance 
from the international community for education programmes directed and led by the local civil 
society, with proper support. Such initiatives could certainly lead to a greater promotion and 
protection as well as understanding of human rights within the country. Despite the distance and 
its capacity constraints, Tonga will make every effort to enhance the spirit and values of its 
children. Tonga reiterated its thanks to the Council for its continued engagement and is looking 
forward to presenting its follow-up report in four years&#8217; time. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Romania 
</b></p>
<p>956. The review of Romania was held on 15 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Romania in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/ROM/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/ROM/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/ROM/3). 
</p>
<p>957. At its 22nd meeting, on 13 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Romania (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>958. The outcome of the review on Romania is constituted of the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/49), together with the views of Romania 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and 
its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that 
were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/8/49/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations  
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>959. The Government of Romania welcomed the recommendations made during the second 
session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review on 15 May 2008 and thanked 
all States who participated in the interactive dialogue. Romania reiterated that it intended to 
make the best use of this process in order to further consolidate its national system of human 
rights protection. It noted that the universal periodic review offered Romania a good opportunity 
to undertake a comprehensive review of the current implementation status of its commitments in 
the area of human rights. It also helped to get a better picture of areas in need of remedies, 
including in terms of improving inter-institutional coordination. 
</p>
<p>960. Based on a careful consideration by relevant national authorities, Romania was pleased to 
inform that, with two exceptions, it accepted all recommendations received from States. The 
two recommendations which Romania was not ready to accept, at this time, refer to the 
ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families (recommendation 1) and the need to further harmonize 
its legislation in the field of religious freedom with international standards (recommendation 18). 
</p>
<p>961. Romania would consider the possibility to become party to the Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families based on an 
evaluation of all relevant factors proving the added value of such a decision. At present, 
Romania considered that the rights of migrant workers are adequately protected by 
European Union law and existing national legislation. 
</p>
<p>962. Romania accepted the recommendation to become party to the Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons against Enforced Disappearance, the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. Internal 
procedures have already been initiated to sign the former and ratify the latter two. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>963. With regard to its legislation regarding freedom of religion, Romania considered that 
its 2006 law is in line with international standards. The Romanian legislation provides for a 
framework that ensures the non-discriminatory exercise of the freedom of conscience by all 
Romanian citizens. 
</p>
<p>964. The new law establishes a transparent system for the recognition of religious 
denomination. The law also regulates the institution of religious associations. Both religious 
denominations and religious associations represent associative structures with legal personality 
and religious purpose, being differentiated only by the fact that the religious denominations are 
granted de jure the status of public utility and, therefore, benefit from direct financial support 
from the State. This delineation does not infringe, in any way, upon a person&#8217;s right to freely 
exercise his/her religion or belief. In addition, the religious associations also benefit from a series 
of fiscal exemptions. 
</p>
<p>965. Romania has undertaken resolute actions in all human rights sectors, on the normative, 
institutional and implementation levels and is determined to continue its efforts in this regard. 
While it openly considered and embraced suggestions received during the universal periodic 
review, it underlined that many of the recommendations are already a work in progress for the 
relevant national authorities. 
</p>
<p>966. Additional comments by Romania related to some of the recommendations and issues that 
may not have been sufficiently covered by the national report or during the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>967. With regard to recommendation 3, in recent years, successive legislative amendments 
related to public safety have also generated changes in the working methods of the law 
enforcement personnel. 
</p>
<p>968. Romania is committed to further ensuring adequate human rights training for law 
enforcement officials, including in the area of combating discriminatory practices and prejudices, 
and to closely monitoring the observance of the relevant provisions regarding their professional 
conduct. 
</p>
<p>969. With regard to recommendation 8, 280 policemen and 450 gendarmes were involved in 
maintaining order and public safety during the Gay Fest parade organized in 2007; 65 sanctions 
were applied on that occasion for disturbances of public order; 11 people have been further 
investigated for minor crimes, 9 of whom were prosecuted. As in previous years, the Romanian 
Police took adequate measures to ensure the organization of this year&#8217;s Gay Fest in good 
conditions. The Police and Gendarmerie collaborated very well with the organizers. No incidents 
were registered during the Gay Fest parade that took place in Bucharest on 24 May 2008.  
</p>
<p>970. With regard to recommendations 4 and 5, Romania is determined to continue its efforts to 
combat any form of discrimination. As mentioned in its national report, Romania has already 
built up an efficient and advanced legislative and institutional framework in this area. 
</p>
<p>971. The National Council for Combating Discrimination and the Ombudsman remain at the 
forefront of this fight. Its regulatory and monitoring functions are complemented by 
awareness-raising activities, through the organization of educational campaigns. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>972. The National Agency for Roma is working towards improving the condition of the Roma 
minority in the country. The Agency will continue to collaborate with competent governmental 
agencies and non-governmental organizations with the view to implementing the objectives set 
out in the National Strategy for Improving the Situation of Roma for 2001-2010 and in the 
related action plans. Ongoing programmes and projects are mostly focused on housing, 
education, employment and health sectors.  
</p>
<p>973. With regard to recommendation 6, the National Authority for Persons with Disabilities 
coordinates the activities dedicated to the protection and promotion of the rights of persons with 
disabilities, based on objectives set out in the National Strategy for the protection, integration 
and social inclusion of persons with disabilities for 2006-2013 and its related plan of action. 
</p>
<p>974. New measures were taken to encourage persons with disabilities to apply for the disability 
certificate issued by the National Authority. Based on this, they could have access to financial 
facilities and social services stipulated by the law. The disability law also contains special 
provisions to facilitate the employment of disabled persons.  
</p>
<p>975. With regard to recommendation 9, the situation of HIV/AIDS-infected persons is one of 
the priorities of the Ministry of Public Health.  
</p>
<p>976. While many efforts have already been made to reduce the number of HIV/AIDS-infected 
persons, authorities awarded increased attention to combating discrimination against such 
persons.  
</p>
<p>977. The National Authority for Persons with Disabilities took a set of measures meant to 
protect confidentiality with regard to such persons. Thus, any reference to the type of disability is 
eliminated from the certificate, in order to avoid discrimination.  
</p>
<p>978. According to the Labour Code, a person can only be employed if he/she can provide a 
medical certificate which attests that he or she is capable to carry out the required work. Hence, 
there is no obligation for HIV-testing upon employment. 
</p>
<p>979. With regard to recommendation 13, as previously described, Romania has put in place a 
coherent legislative and institutional framework meant to specifically address the problem of 
domestic violence. A new strategy to combat domestic violence for 2008-2013 and a related 
action plan are currently being finalized, based on consultations with institutional partners and 
non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>980. With regard to recommendation 12, Romania is fully committed to combating trafficking 
in persons. It highlighted that it already has in place a system of witness protection for cases of 
trafficking. According to the Witness Protection Law, a witness to a serious crime, such as 
trafficking in persons, can be included in the witness protection programme, based on the 
decision of a prosecutor or a court of law. The law for the prevention and combating trafficking 
in persons criminalizes all forms of trafficking in persons and provides for special measures to 
protect and assist victims and their families (out of the 1,779 victims identified in 2007, 
1,405 participated in the criminal process as injured parties and 270 were heard as witnesses). 
The Romanian Police works on developing the capacity of front-line police officers to identify </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>victims, inter alia, by organizing specialized courses for them. As part of basic training, the 
curricula of police schools include proper forms of conduct in relation to victims of trafficking 
and sexual abuse. 
</p>
<p>981. Romania provided additional information on other relevant recommendations 
(A/HRC/8/49/Add.1). To conclude its opening statement, Romania stressed that throughout this 
process, it has tried to cover all questions and concerns raised during the session of the Working 
Group, within time and page limit constraints. It stood ready to continue this cooperation, in an 
open spirit and it will, definitely, come back to all these useful inputs under the internal 
follow-up process to the outcome report. 
</p>
<p>982. As mentioned during the session of the Working Group, Romanian authorities are 
preparing to launch a reflection process for the drafting of a comprehensive national plan of 
action for human rights. The review outcome may, hopefully, create the best premises for the 
successful launch of such a national plan in the second half of this year. 
</p>
<p>983. As a staunch supporter of the Council from its very beginning, Romania was pleased that 
the outcome of its review would be adopted shortly before the end of its mandate as a member of 
the Council, as well as before the end of the presidency of the second cycle of the Council, 
exercised tirelessly and with resolute commitment by the Permanent Representative of Romania 
to the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>984. China was grateful to the delegation of Romania for its briefing. It noted that Romania had 
placed importance in preparing the national report and had held the interactive dialogue in a very 
constructive manner, for which it expressed its appreciation. During the review, the Government 
had reported on efforts it made in promoting and protecting human rights and its achievements, 
including improvement of national legislation, formulation of national policies and programmes 
of action, and the establishment of national institutions. It also noted that the Government had 
outlined challenges faced by the country in promoting and protecting human rights, and it 
welcomed the latest information and commitments made by Romania. All had highlighted 
Romania&#8217;s readiness to fulfil its commitments and its determination to promote and protect 
human rights, and China considered that Romania will further implement its commitments and 
score new progress in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>985. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland thanked Romania for its 
detailed presentation and noted that Romania has admitted frankly both the key areas where 
progress has been made and where further efforts are needed. It highlighted this frank and 
self-critical approach as a good result both for human rights in Romania and for the strength of 
the universal periodic review mechanism as a whole. The United Kingdom thanked Romania for 
the detailed response to all of the recommendations, which in its view shows that the universal 
periodic review can provide challenging suggestions to countries, which need consideration by a 
number of different domestic ministries. In conclusion, the United Kingdom was pleased to see 
that its recommendations had been accepted and stated that it looks forward to further bilateral 
discussions on these in coming months and years. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>986. Algeria expressed its thanks to the delegation of Romania for the very exhaustive and 
clear presentation. It appreciated the action that Romania had taken on the basis of 
recommendation 10 made by Algeria. It had one question following the presentation, the 
delegation of Romania having indicated that at the present time, Romania had reservations 
regarding recommendations 1 and 18. In this regard, Algeria noted that in the very exhaustive 
presentation, Romania had not mentioned action taken on recommendation 14, put forward by 
Algeria, Tunisia and France. It asked Romania whether this recommendation was in addition to 
the recommendations mentioned where there were some problems, or if it was just an omission 
in the presentation. It reiterated its thanks for Romania&#8217;s efforts to uphold human rights, and 
noted that one of its major contributions in this regard was the presidency of Ambassador Costea 
heading the Council, which contributes to the enhancement of human rights around the world.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>987. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA-Europe) 
and the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network underlined, in a joint statement, that the universal 
periodic review had given them the opportunity to look at the future and identify better respect, 
protection and fulfilment of the human rights of all, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender people. In this respect, referring to recommendation 4 made by Argentina and 
Canada, they encouraged Romania to continue in its efforts: to strengthen the anti-discrimination 
mechanism, in particular the National Council for Combating Discrimination; to include gender 
identity and expression in addition to sex among the non-discrimination criteria of 
Ordinance 137/2000, so that transgender persons are explicitly protected by the law; to raise 
awareness of discrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender professionals in the 
education and health systems; and, lastly, to eliminate discrimination with regard to rights 
accessed through the institution of marriage, which is currently available only to heterosexual 
couples. With regard to recommendation 6 made by Finland, it encouraged the Romanian police 
to finalize the investigation of several cases of violence instigated in connection with the 2006 
and 2007 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender marches in Bucharest. Lastly, they commended 
Romania on several important achievements, including repealing article 200 of the Penal Code 
which criminalized private same-sex relations among consenting adults, the development of an 
anti-discrimination mechanism which from the beginning included sexual orientation among 
non-discrimination grounds, and the police protection ensured at lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender marches in the last four years in Bucharest. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed on the outcome by the State 
under review and concluding remarks  
</b></p>
<p>988. In its concluding remarks, Romania expressed its gratitude to all States and 
non-governmental organizations that took an interest, either in written form or during the 
session, in the development and challenges encountered by Romania in ensuring the full respect 
for human rights. Romania has tried to address all queries raised during this interactive dialogue 
either by providing additional information or stating its position with regard to recommendations 
received. 
</p>
<p>989. Romania stressed that it is of the view that the universal periodic review mechanism has 
proven to be a useful tool for States in terms of reassessing and reasserting their national and 
international commitments in the field of human rights. Romania was grateful for all comments </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and recommendations made, aimed at strengthening the human rights protection in the country. 
In response to a question raised by one of the delegations, Romania stated that it has accepted 
recommendation 14; additional information on the recommendation is available in document 
A/HRC/8/49/Add.1. 
</p>
<p>990. Romania finally thanked the representatives of the civil society which have contributed to 
the elaboration of its national report and to those participating in the present debate. It noted that 
their inputs have been duly taken into account and that it is open to continue this fruitful 
cooperation with the civil society during the follow-up process to the outcome report. It also 
thanked the members of the troika Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Canada. 
</p>
<p><b>Mali 
</b></p>
<p>991. The review of Mali was held on 15 May 2008 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: the 
national report submitted by Mali in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/MLI/1); the compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/MLI/2); and the summary prepared by OHCHR in 
accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/MLI/3). 
</p>
<p>992. At its 22nd meeting, on 13 June 2008, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Mali (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>993. The outcome of the review on Mali is constituted of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/8/50), together with the views of Mali concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and its replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/8/50/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views of the State under review concerning recommendations 
and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments 
</b></p>
<p>994. In its introduction, the delegation of Mali deplored the late issuance of its report and 
thanked Mauritius, Brazil and Japan, the members of the troika, and all member States for 
participating in the dialogue when Mali&#8217;s national report had been considered. At the conclusion 
of the review, Mali had pledged to respond to some of the recommendations that had been made. 
</p>
<p>995. In response to the recommendation that Mali should issue a standing invitation to special 
procedures mandate holders, the delegation said that the country was prepared to cooperate fully 
with all special procedures of the Human Rights Council. Mali pledged to give thorough 
consideration to all requests for visits addressed by the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>996. A group of countries had recommended that Mali should: enact legislation prohibiting all 
forms of female genital mutilation, in keeping with recommendations made by the Human 
Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child; adopt legislative and other measures, including 
awareness-raising campaigns, with a view to eradicating harmful traditional practices that </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>impeded women&#8217;s full enjoyment of their fundamental rights; and, in particular, adopt legislation 
penalizing female genital mutilation, domestic violence and all forms of violence against 
women. 
</p>
<p>997. In response to those recommendations, the representative of Mali said that excision was 
deeply rooted in Malian cultural practice. While the Government recognized the need to adopt a 
law prohibiting female genital mutilation, it had given priority to public education and 
awareness-raising campaigns rather than to the adoption of repressive measures whose practical 
application could not be guaranteed without the support of all segments of society. It was against 
that background that the Government had in 2002 established the National Programme to 
Combat the Practice of Excision. The educational approach taken by the Government had 
already succeeded in reducing excision rates from 94 per cent to 85 per cent between 1996 and 
</p><p>2006. Furthermore, a nationwide survey on excision was currently being carried out. The survey 
findings would determine what steps should be taken in the medium term with regard to the 
adoption of a law prohibiting and punishing that practice. 
</p>
<p>998. With regard to violence against women and girls, the Malian delegation said that the 
country&#8217;s Criminal Code criminalized all forms of violence, including domestic violence. In 
addition, the National Plan to Combat Violence against Women and Girls for the period 
2006-2011, which was currently being implemented, contained measures that targeted excision 
as well as other forms of violence against women and girls; those measures ranged from the 
creation of intervention mechanisms, the provision of assistance to victims and information, 
education and communication (IEC) activities to the revision of existing legislation and the 
adoption of new texts. 
</p>
<p>999. Luxembourg had recommended that Mali should, inter alia, establish legal equality 
between men and women with a view to abolishing any discrimination and all violence. In 
response to that recommendation, Mali had stated that the revision of the Marriage and 
Guardianship Code, which had begun some years before, had led to the preparation of a draft 
Personal and Family Code that provided for the elimination of all discriminatory provisions 
relating to women. National consultations on the draft had already been concluded, and the 
resulting report had been officially transmitted to the President on 22 May 2008. It was slated for 
adoption by the Government in the near future and would then be submitted to Parliament. 
</p>
<p>1000.  The United States of America had recommended that Mali should increase awareness of 
efforts to combat forced labour, paying special attention to groups such as the Bellah, or black 
Tamacheks. In reply, Mali had noted that the country&#8217;s Constitution and legislation prohibited 
forced labour, which was also prohibited by law. However, certain cultural practices did persist 
in some parts of the country, although they tended to disappear as the school enrolment rate rose 
in the community concerned. 
</p>
<p>1001.  Canada had recommended that Mali should revise the &#8220;insult law&#8221;, respect the freedom of 
opinion and expression and refrain from imposing penal sanctions on journalists. Mali had 
responded that the country&#8217;s Constitution recognized the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression as well as freedom of the press. According to those constitutional provisions, those 
rights and freedoms were exercised within the framework of the law. That was why the Act on </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the press and offences against legislation governing the press and the Criminal Code provided 
for sanctions in that area. However, the issue was under discussion in Mali, and the trend was 
towards the decriminalization of press-related offences. 
</p>
<p>1002.  The Malian delegation recalled the voluntary pledges and commitments undertaken by the 
country pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251, on the Human Rights Council. Mali 
fully endorsed respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as enshrined in its 
Constitution and the international legal instruments to which it was a party. In accordance with 
its international commitments, it had submitted its initial and periodic reports to the monitoring 
mechanisms created for that purpose, such as the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. 
Mali had been the first State party to submit its initial report to the Committee on Migrant 
Workers.  
</p>
<p>1003.  In the wake of the democratization that had taken place in 1991, Mali had strengthened its 
institutional mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, in particular through the National Advisory Commission on Human Rights, the 
Ombudsman, the Private-Sector Facilitator, the Higher Council on Communication and the 
National Committee on Equal Access to State Media. It had also reaffirmed the principle of the 
separation of powers and laid down clear definitions of each authority&#8217;s sphere of competencies. 
</p>
<p>1004.  In addition, Mali had in 1994 created a unique mechanism for the promotion and 
protection of human rights: the Forum for Democratic Challenges (<i>Espace d&#8217;interpellation 
d&#233;mocratique</i>). Every year on 10 December the Government of Mali organized a forum to pay a 
special tribute to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the anniversary of its 
adoption; the Forum was presided over by a jury that gave citizens an opportunity to air their 
grievances to government officials and hear their responses. After the discussion, the jury made 
recommendations whose implementation was monitored and evaluated before the next Forum 
was held. 
</p>
<p>1005.  The Constitution reaffirmed the lay nature of the Malian State. It guaranteed freedom of 
opinion, religion, association, assembly and protest as well as the right to vote. The Constitution 
also guaranteed freedom of the press; Mali had more than 30 private newspapers and more 
than 150 independent local radio stations. 
</p>
<p>1006.  Article 1 of the Malian Constitution provided that &#8220;the human person is sacred and 
inviolable. All individuals have the right to life, liberty, security and integrity of person&#8221;. In that 
spirit, the Government of Mali had in 2002 adopted a draft law declaring a moratorium on the 
death penalty for a period of two years. It should be noted that the death penalty had not been 
imposed in Mali since 1984. The National Assembly of Mali was currently considering a bill 
abolishing capital punishment. 
</p>
<p>1007.  Mali had also adopted a number of measures to strengthen the rule of law and the 
Government&#8217;s obligation to enforce the principle of equality of all citizens in their relations with 
the civil service. Those measures were set out in Act No. 98/12 of 19 January 1998, on relations 
between the civil service and public service users. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>1008.  Mali was a member of a number of intergovernmental mechanisms for the promotion and 
protection of human rights, including the Community of Democracies, which it had chaired 
during the period 2005-2007. Given its tradition of unwavering commitment to the promotion 
and protection of human rights, the Government of Mali had decided to submit its candidacy for 
the Human Rights Council. Mali had pledged that, if elected, it would, inter alia: 
</p>
<p> (a) Stress cooperation and constructive dialogue between members and non-members of 
the Human Rights Council with a view to enhancing the effective execution of the Council&#8217;s 
mandate; 
</p>
<p> (b) Continue to discharge its obligations to submit, under the international legal 
instruments to which it was a party, initial and periodic reports to the respective 
treaty-monitoring bodies and to implement the recommendations of those bodies; 
</p>
<p> (c) Support the active participation of non-governmental organizations and other civil 
society representatives in the work of the Council; 
</p>
<p> (d) Encourage States that had not yet done so to become parties to the major human 
rights instruments and, accordingly, to comply with their obligations thereunder; 
</p>
<p> (e) Strengthen democracy, good governance, the rule of law and human rights through 
bilateral and multilateral cooperation, particularly through the United Nations; 
</p>
<p> (f) Cooperate fully with the procedures and mechanisms of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p> (g) Promote the development of human rights norms; and 
</p>
<p> (h) Promote human rights education. 
</p>
<p>1009.  At the domestic level, Mali was taking or intended to take appropriate action in the 
following areas: 
</p>
<p> (a) Strengthening institutional support for the National Human Rights Commission and 
applying for its accreditation by the International Coordinating Committee of National Human 
Rights Institutions; 
</p>
<p> (b) Stepping up action to eliminate discrimination against women, violence against 
women and the practice of female genital mutilation; 
</p>
<p> (c) Provision of support for the implementation of the Ten-Year Justice Development 
Programme (PRODEJ) and other programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (d) Adoption of the draft Personal and Family Code and the bill on abolition of the death 
penalty; 
</p>
<p> (e) Continuation and strengthening of measures aimed at promoting equality between 
men and women; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (f) Establishment of juvenile courts and specialized detention, re-education and 
rehabilitation centres for women and children in the country&#8217;s eight regions; 
</p>
<p> (g) Establishment of compulsory health insurance and a medical care fund; 
</p>
<p> (h) Initiation, in 2007, of a review process in Mali within the framework of the 
New Partnership for Africa&#8217;s Development (NEPAD) African Peer Review Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>1010.  As to what was expected of Mali following the conclusion of the review process, the 
delegation said that Mali upheld the principles of the universality, interdependence, indivisibility 
and interrelatedness of all human rights. It was in that context that it had endorsed the adoption 
of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework in 2002 and a Growth and Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Framework in 2007. The Economic and Social Development Programme on the basis of 
which President Amadou Toumani Tour&#233; had been re-elected in 2007 attached priority to the 
promotion of all human rights. Mali remained convinced that, with the assistance of the 
international community, implementation of that Programme would do much to promote the 
development of a society that could offer a better life to the entire population. The delegation 
recalled that, as noted in Mali&#8217;s national report, that assistance was being requested in order to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Harmonize national legislation more fully with the provisions of international human 
rights instruments; 
</p>
<p> (b) Strengthen the capacity of State and non-State actors for the promotion and 
protection of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (c) Build institutional and operational capacity for the administration of justice, 
especially by increasing the number of courts and tribunals, providing training for judges and 
court officials and improving living conditions for inmates of prisons and correctional education 
institutions; 
</p>
<p> (d) Enhance technical capacity for the preparation and submission of Mali&#8217;s human 
rights reports; 
</p>
<p> (e) Incorporate content relating to human rights, the culture of peace, democracy and 
citizenship in formal and informal educational programmes; 
</p>
<p> (f) Ensure the translation of the main national, regional and international human rights 
instruments into the principal national languages; 
</p>
<p> (g) Improve the civil registry system; 
</p>
<p> (h) Organize various activities to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States of  
the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>1011.  Tunisia commended Mali on its commitment to the universal periodic review and its 
efforts in the promotion and protection of human rights, noting in particular the progress made in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the establishment of democratic institutions and consolidation of the rule of law. In this context, 
Tunisia noted that Mali should serve as an example. Tunisia also noted the establishment of a 
programme between the United Nations and Mali, to be implemented between 2008 and 2012 
with the aim of promoting human rights and gender issues. This programme will certainly 
strengthen the progress already made and the achievements in the areas of equal opportunity and 
equality. Tunisia further highlighted Mali&#8217;s determination to promote a culture of human rights, 
as reflected in the national programme of education and citizenship.  
</p>
<p>1012.  The Philippines indicated that the delegation of the Government of Mali has exhibited a 
clear and strong commitment to upholding human rights standards by constructively and openly 
engaging in the universal periodic review process. The Philippines commended Mali on this 
commitment, acknowledging that the Government has made substantial progress in promoting 
human rights, in spite of the constraints of limited resources. The Philippines encouraged the 
international community to support Mali&#8217;s initiatives to improve the socio-economic situation of 
its people. The Philippines appreciated that Mali has accepted a number of recommendations and 
supported the Government&#8217;s efforts to strengthen its democracy and the rule of law. The 
Philippines noted that Mali is seeking to strengthen national human rights policies and 
programmes, in adherence with international human rights treaties to which it is a party. The 
Philippines expressed its hope that Mali will continue on this progressive path and continue its 
efforts, especially in the fields of health and education. 
</p>
<p>1013.  Senegal expressed satisfaction that Mali had accepted the majority of the 
recommendations formulated during the debates of the Working Group. This position is a new 
manifestation of the constant commitment of the Malian authorities in favour of the defence of 
human rights and of Mali&#8217;s sincere will to advance in this regard. In particular, Senegal referred 
to progress already made in the areas of education, health care and the promotion of the rights of 
children and women. For that reason, Senegal was optimistic that the implementation of the 
recommendations accepted by Mali will improve the human rights situation in the country. 
However, Senegal underlined that in order to implement some of those recommendations, Mali 
will need assistance from the international community. 
</p>
<p>1014.  Algeria thanked the delegation of Mali for the responses and comments made to all 
recommendations formulated within the framework of the examination of the national report by 
the Working Group. Algeria acknowledged the participative democracy in Mali and the success 
of the country in complying with its international human rights obligations. Algeria welcomed 
Mali&#8217;s acceptance of 21 recommendations and noted that Mali expressed reservations to only 
1 recommendation and declared its intention to continue discussing 5 others. Algeria 
congratulated the Government of Mali for this sustained engagement, taking into consideration 
its limited resources and the challenges resulting from its commitment to pursuing its priorities 
in the areas of economic development and the fight against poverty. To better protect human 
rights, notably through the implementation of its economic and social development programme 
and its work against poverty, Mali requested the support of the international community. Algeria 
invited the international community, in particular OHCHR, to respond positively to this request 
and to provide Mali with the appropriate assistance, including assistance to enable it to submit its 
reports to the treaty bodies in a timely manner.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>1015.  No comments were made by other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Views expressed on the outcome by the State under  
review and concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>1016.  In its concluding remarks, the delegation of Mali thanked all States that had taken the 
floor to give advice and renew their support and assistance in the universal periodic review 
process. It also wished to thank the President of the Council, the Secretariat, the interpreters and 
&#8220;all those technicians who work behind the scenes and are not often seen in this brightly lit hall&#8221; 
for their efforts. Lastly, it reiterated Mali&#8217;s commitment to implementing all of the 
recommendations that the country had accepted.

Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva     $1,600

</p>
<p>17. Since the meeting called for in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution would in effect replace 
the annual sectoral consultation meeting foreseen for 2009, the estimated amount of $177,200, 
already included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, will be utilized to offset 
the requirements of $208,400, as shown above. 
</p>
<p>18. The amount of $177,200 already included in the programme budget relates to $42,200 
under section 23 for the attendance of the Special Representative and experts at an annual 
meeting of special procedures mandate holders referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above; 
$133,400, under section 2 for conference servicing requirements; and $1,600, under section 28 E 
for administrative support. Although on this basis it is anticipated that an additional amount of 
$31,200 will be required for the biennium 2008-2009 under section 23, no additional resources 
will be requested at this time in the light of the continuing review by the Council of its subsidiary 
machinery in response to General Assembly resolution 60/251. 
</p>
<p>19. Hence, a consolidated statement of requirements arising from the continuing review by the 
Council and potential absorptive capacity from reduced requirements arising from the amended 
programme of work under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 will be 
reported to the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to paragraph 8, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, the 
most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the role 
of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

strong support expressed by Member States for combating torture and assisting victims of 
torture.

</p>
<p>23. The requirements to implement the activities for the mandate of the Special Rapporteur

preparation of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. No additional 
appropriations will be required as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution.  
</p>
<p>24. With regard to paragraph 10, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of

requirements within the appropriations approved for sections 2, 23 and 28 E for the 
biennium 2008-2009.  
</p>
