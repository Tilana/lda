Trafficking in persons, especially women and children: regional and 
subregional cooperation in promoting a human rights-based approach 
to combating trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions on the problem of trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, in particular General Assembly resolutions 63/156 of 18 
December 2008 and 64/178 of 18 December 2009, and Council resolutions 8/12 of 18 June 
2008, in which it extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, and 11/3 of 17 June 2009, and recalling Council resolution 
12/15 of 1 October 2009 on regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of 
human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and 
declarations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol 
thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
and the Protocols thereto, and reaffirming in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and recalling the </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the 
Prostitution of Others, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29) and the Worst Forms 
of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the International Labour Organization, 
 <i>Recognizing </i>the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee, the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and the Committee against Torture about the persistence of trafficking and the 
vulnerability of victims to human rights violations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that trafficking in persons violates and impairs the enjoyment of human 
rights, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a concerted 
international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among 
countries of origin, transit and destination for its eradication, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are 
often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of 
gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as national or social origin, 
and that these forms of discrimination may themselves fuel trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to 
prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate instances of trafficking and punish 
perpetrators, to rescue victims and to provide for their protection, and that not doing so 
violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of victims, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular 
problem of trafficking in women and children, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> the challenges to combating trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children, owing to the lack of adequate legislation and implementation of 
existing legislation, the lack of availability of reliable sex- and age-disaggregated data and 
statistics and the lack of resources, and recognizing the role of international cooperation in 
this regard, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that some of the demand for prostitution and forced labour is met by 
trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that policies and programmes for prevention, rehabilitation, return and 
reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and 
multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the 
full enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of 
origin, transit and destination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming in particular</i> the efforts of Governments, United Nations bodies and 
agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the 
problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, including at the national, 
subregional and regional levels, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the convening of the seminar on the theme &#8220;A human rights approach to 
combating human trafficking: challenges and opportunities&#8221; by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva on 27 and 28 May 2010, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting also</i> the panel discussion on the theme &#8220;Giving voice to the victims and 
survivors of human trafficking&#8221;, held on 2 June 2010 during the fourteenth session of the 
Human Rights Council, </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting further</i> efforts to consider a possible review mechanism on the 
implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
and the Protocols thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the ongoing work at the United Nations in New York to elaborate the Global 
Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reiterates its concern</i> at: 
</p>
<p> (a) The high number of persons, especially women and children, in particular 
from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, who are being 
trafficked within and between regions and States; 
</p>
<p> (b) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime groups 
and others who profit from trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without 
regard for dangerous and inhumane conditions, in flagrant violation of domestic laws and 
international law and contrary to international standards; 
</p>
<p> (c) The use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for the 
purposes of exploitation of the prostitution of others and other forms of sexual exploitation, 
for trafficking in women as brides and for sex tourism, child pornography, paedophilia and 
any other form of sexual exploitation of children; 
</p>
<p> (d) The high level of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and their accomplices and 
the denial of rights and justice to victims of trafficking; 
 2. <i>Urges</i> Governments to incorporate a human rights-based approach into 
measures taken to prevent and end trafficking in persons and to protect, assist and provide 
access to adequate redress to victims, including the possibility of obtaining compensation 
from the perpetrators; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Emphasizes</i> the importance of giving voice to victims of trafficking in 
persons, with due consideration for their psychological well-being, with a view to 
reinforcing the centrality of their human rights and needs, and taking into account their 
recommendations, when devising actions to combat human trafficking; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Encourages</i> Governments to refer to the Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking developed by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/2002/68/Add.1) as a useful tool in 
integrating a human rights-based approach into their responses to combat trafficking in 
persons; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children (A/HRC/14/32); 
 6. <i>Calls upon </i>Governments to consider signing and ratifying, as a matter of 
priority, in the case of Governments that have not yet done so, and for States parties to 
implement relevant United Nations legal instruments, such as the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, in particular 
the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women 
and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime, and to take immediate steps to incorporate provisions of the Protocol into 
domestic legal systems; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also calls upon </i>Governments, with a view to enhancing regional and 
subregional cooperation to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, to take appropriate 
measures, inter alia: 
</p>
<p> (a) To promote the implementation of legally binding international instruments 
on combating trafficking in persons, including the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children and, in particular, to promote the 
criminalization of all forms of trafficking as defined therein;  
</p>
<p> (b) To promote a coordinated and comprehensive approach to preventing and 
combating human trafficking through, inter alia, the development of regional initiatives or 
plans of action based on relevant international instruments, such as the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and 
integrating a human rights-based approach to combating trafficking; 
</p>
<p> (c) To promote the provision of gender- and age-sensitive responses which 
adequately address the needs of women, children and men as victims, in full respect of their 
human rights, in order to enhance the level of protection, assistance and recovery, with 
special attention to the identification of victims and their access to shelter, medical and 
psychosocial assistance, and rehabilitation in line with relevant international instruments, 
and to cooperate in this regard with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations 
as appropriate; 
</p>
<p> (d) To promote an effective prosecutorial and judicial response with a victim-
oriented approach providing for access to effective legal remedies and, as appropriate, 
compensation as well as measures of protection for witnesses; 
</p>
<p> (e) To facilitate the establishment of a strong regional network of counter-
trafficking practitioners to promote cross-border cooperation, inter alia, through the 
organization of regular regional training and workshops for law-enforcement and 
immigration officials and members of Governments and diplomatic and consular personnel, 
as well as relevant stakeholders providing assistance to victims of trafficking; 
</p>
<p> (f) To support the adoption or strengthening of legislative or other measures to 
discourage the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women 
and children, that leads to trafficking in persons, including the demand created by sex 
tourism, especially in children, and forced labour, and the enhancement in this regard of 
preventive measures, including legislative measures, to deter exploiters of trafficked 
persons and ensure their accountability; 
</p>
<p> (g) To support the adoption or strengthening of measures to alleviate the factors 
that make persons vulnerable to trafficking, such as poverty, underdevelopment, lack of 
opportunity, gender inequality and discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (h) To develop and implement, in partnership with international organizations, 
civil society and the media, information campaigns for the general public, including 
children, aimed at promoting awareness of the dangers associated with all forms of 
trafficking and educating them on their human rights, gender equality, self-respect and 
mutual respect; 
</p>
<p> (i) To share good practices on the integration of a human rights-based approach 
into anti-trafficking policies and programmes of action, and to identify lessons learned and 
address obstacles to effective responses to human trafficking;

the pillars of the United Nations system and the foundations for collective security and

</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human

<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>all resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission on Human

debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural 
rights, including Commission resolutions 1998/24 of 17 April 1998, 1999/22 of 23 April

<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> its resolution S-10/1 of 23 February 2009 on the impact of the

human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international 
cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or 
humanitarian character, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights agreed to call upon the 
international community to make all efforts to help to alleviate the external debt burden of 
developing countries in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such 
countries to attain the full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights of their 
people, </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the determination expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration 
to deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low- and middle-income 
developing countries through various national and international measures designed to make 
their debt sustainable in the long term, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with concern</i> that the total external debt of low- and middle-income countries 
had risen to 2,983 billion United States dollars by 2006, from 1,951 billion dollars in 1995, 
and that, by 2007, the total debt service payments of developing countries had risen to 523 
billion dollars, from 220 billion dollars in 1995, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden faced 
by the most indebted developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, is 
unsustainable and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress in people-
centred sustainable development and poverty eradication and that, for many developing 
countries and countries with economies in transition, excessive debt servicing has severely 
constrained their capacity to promote social development and to provide basic services to 
realize economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its concern</i> that, despite repeated rescheduling of debt, developing 
countries continue to pay out more each year than the actual amount they receive in official 
development assistance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that debt burden further complicates the numerous problems facing 
developing countries, contributes to extreme poverty and is an obstacle to sustainable 
human development, and is thus a serious impediment to the realization of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt 
and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all 
human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights (A/HRC/14/21 and Add.1); 
 2. <i>Recalls </i>the proposed elements for a conceptual framework for understanding 
the relationship between foreign debt and human rights, and encourages the independent 
expert to continue to develop them with a view to addressing the debt crisis in a just, 
equitable and sustainable manner; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the areas of focus identified by the independent expert for the 
period 2009&#8211;2010, in particular the development of the draft general guidelines on foreign 
debt and human rights and the issue of illegitimate debt, and in that regard requests the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to assist 
the independent expert in the organization and holding of regional consultations on these 
issues, including through the allocation of sufficient budgetary resources; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also welcomes</i> the convening of regional consultations on the draft general 
guidelines on foreign debt and human rights, in June 2010 and March 2011, to obtain views 
on the form and content of the guidelines with a view to improving them, and encourages 
the widest possible participation of States and stakeholders from the public sector, the 
private sector, civil society and academia; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recalls </i>that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the 
economic, social and cultural development of its people and, to that end, has the right and 
responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to 
external specific prescriptions for economic policy; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recognizes</i> that structural-adjustment reform programmes limit public 
expenditure, impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give inadequate attention to the 
provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable 
higher growth under these programmes; </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the current global financial and economic crises should not 
result in a decrease in debt relief, nor should they be used as an excuse to stop debt relief 
measures, as that would have negative implications for the enjoyment of human rights in 
affected countries; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that the level of implementation and the reduction of 
overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still 
low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long-
term debt burden; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Reiterates</i> its conviction that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve 
debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the 
above-mentioned Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in 
the form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices 
for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt 
overhang; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Regrets</i> the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the 
unsustainable foreign debt burden of middle- and low-income heavily indebted countries, 
and that, to date, little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current 
system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those 
of indebted countries and the poor in those countries, and therefore calls for an 
intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce 
substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those 
severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, 
and by armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Affirms</i> that, from a human rights perspective, the settlement of excessive 
vulture funds has a direct negative effect on the capacity of Governments to fulfil their 
human rights obligations, especially with regard to economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also affirms</i> that the activities of vulture funds highlight some of the 
problems in the global financial system and are indicative of the unjust nature of the current 
system, and calls upon States to take measures to combat those vulture funds; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Acknowledges</i> that, in least developed countries and in several low- and 
middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a 
considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the 
Millennium Development Goals for development and poverty reduction will not be 
attained; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Recognizes</i> that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that 
should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and 
development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, 
including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that 
debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, 
ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are 
accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Recalls once again</i> the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the 
Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the 
heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official 
bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to 
poverty reduction; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Urges</i> the international community, including the United Nations system, the 
Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions 
for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of the major </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.12-17781

<p>United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World 
Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable 
Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular 
those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in 
particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with 
economies in transition; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Recalls </i>the pledge contained in the Political Declaration annexed to General 
Assembly resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the Assembly, to find effective, 
equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt 
servicing burdens of developing countries; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Stresses</i> the need for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign 
debt to be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new 
loan agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative 
frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established 
to ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people&#8217;s 
legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or 
disadvantaged, in the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and 
programmes, as well as in the follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their 
implementation, and for macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an 
equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of broader social development 
goals, taking into account the national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor 
countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the 
overall realization of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Also stresses</i> that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt 
should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national 
development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that 
ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of all human rights; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Further stresses</i> that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt 
relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not 
worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Calls upon </i>States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to 
continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without 
affecting ongoing programmes; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Calls upon </i>creditors, particularly international financial institutions, and 
debtors alike to consider the preparation of human rights impact assessments with regard to 
development projects, loan agreements or Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers; 
 23. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor 
countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy 
environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment 
policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Urges</i> States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take 
urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly 
affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health 
care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Reiterates</i> its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt 
problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral 
financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared 
interests and responsibilities; 
</p>
<p> 26. <i>Also reiterates</i> its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing 
countries, in particular of least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the 
measures arising from foreign debt; 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Requests </i>the independent expert to continue to explore the interlinkages with 
trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural 
adjustment and foreign debt, and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted 
with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a 
view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign 
debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 
 28. <i>Also requests </i>the independent expert to continue to seek the views and 
suggestions of States, international organizations, United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes, regional economic commissions, international and regional financial 
institutions and non-governmental organizations on the draft general guidelines and his 
proposal of possible elements for consideration, and urges them to respond to his requests; 
</p>
<p> 29. <i>Encourages</i> the independent expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance 
with his mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special 
rapporteurs, independent experts and members of the expert working groups of the Council 
and its Advisory Committee on issues relating to economic, social and cultural rights and 
the right to development in his work towards the elaboration of the draft general guidelines;

the General Assembly entitled &#8220;Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for 
the twenty-first century&#8221;, and the declarations adopted at the forty-ninth and fifty-fourth

</p>

violence against women and girls includes using all appropriate means of a legal, political, 
administrative and social nature that promote the protection of human rights and ensuring 
that acts of violence are considered and treated as illegal acts for which adequate, effective, 
prompt and appropriate punishment and remedies are available,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>that power imbalances and structural inequality between men and

progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing further</i> the importance of the full participation of women in the 
development of effective policies and programmes relating to the prevention of violence 
against women, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that confronting and changing the harmful attitudes, customs, 
practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women are 
fundamental to ensuring effective prevention,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the realization of all human rights by women and girls, such as those 
regarding education, access to health, economic participation, access to the labour market, 
conditions of work, disparities in salaries and compensation, public and political 
participation, access to decision-making processes, inheritance, financial services, including 
loans, nationality and legal capacity, ownership of land, property, housing, social security 
and cultural life, supported by appropriate responses dealing with legal literacy, skills 
training and access to productive resources, is a key factor in preventing violence against 
women and girls, and that, in many instances, the different treatment of women before the 
law has resulted in the lack of equal opportunities for them in these areas, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of 
discrimination and disadvantage, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of 
some women and girls, including women belonging to minority groups, indigenous women, 
refugee and internally displaced women, stateless women, migrant women, women living 
in rural or remote communities, women living in slums and informal settlements, women 
living in conditions of poverty, women in institutions or in detention, women with 
disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in all situations of armed conflict, women 
who face trafficking, sexual or labour exploitation, and women who are otherwise 
discriminated against, including on the basis of their HIV/AIDS status,  
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> that the threat or risk of being exposed to violence may constitute a 
barrier to women and girls realizing their right to education, 
</p>
<p> <i>Alarmed</i> that, in situations of armed conflict, women are particularly exposed to 
various forms of violence, including sexual violence, and recognizing the need to intensify 
efforts to prevent such violence in accordance with international humanitarian law and 
human rights law,

<p> 1. <i>Stresses</i> that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to 
prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and 
girls and provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or 
nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms;  
 2. <i>Calls upon </i>States to enact and, where necessary, reinforce or amend domestic 
legislation and take measures to enhance the protection of victims, to investigate, prosecute, 
punish and redress, including by ensuring access to adequate, effective, prompt and 
appropriate remedies, the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of 
violence, whether in the home, the workplace, the community or society, in custody or in 
situations of armed conflict, to ensure that such legislation conforms with relevant 
international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law, to abolish </p>

<p>existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against 
women, and to remove gender bias in the administration of justice;

implementing legal and policy measures that promote the full enjoyment by women and 
girls of all human rights, particularly those aimed at eliminating discrimination against 
women, promoting gender equality, empowering women and promoting their autonomy, 
including with regard to land, property, marriage and divorce, child custody and 
inheritance, and to promote equal access to literacy, education, skills training and 
employment opportunities, land, credit, agricultural extension, adequate housing, just and 
favourable conditions of work, and business and leadership skills training; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to take all measures to empower women and 
strengthen their economic independence, including through their full participation in the 
development and implementation of socio-economic policies and poverty eradication 
strategies, and through recognition of the value of the unremunerated work by women to 
better protect themselves against violence and, in this regard, to give priority to and to 
promote their access, without discrimination, to education, training, economic opportunity 
and economic advancement; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> States to adopt and implement policies and programmes that enable 
women to avoid and escape situations of violence and prevent its recurrence, and that 
provide, inter alia, financial support and affordable access to safe housing or shelters, 
childcare and other social supports, legal assistance, skills training and productive 
resources, and to make these services accessible to women and girls with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 6 <i>Also urges</i> States to promote, at all levels, environments and communities 
that are safe for women and girls, and to support the efforts of civil society and other 
stakeholders towards this end, including by taking measures designed to enhance personal 
security and reduce the risk of violence in the community, in the home and in the 
workplace, in particular those that eliminate barriers to safe access to schools and other 
educational settings, drinking water sources and sanitation facilities, workplaces and 
livelihoods, and participation in the life of the community; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Further urges</i> States to publicly condemn violence against women and 
provide visible and sustained leadership at the highest levels to prevent all forms of 
violence against women and girls, and, in particular, in efforts to confront the attitudes, 
customs, practices and gender stereotypes that lie at the core of discriminatory and harmful 
acts and practices that are violent towards women, such as female genital mutilation, forced 
and early marriage, femicide, crimes committed in the name of honour and crimes 
committed in the name of passion;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon </i>States to support initiatives undertaken by women&#8217;s groups, 
international and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, media, faith and 
community groups and other relevant civil society actors aimed at promoting gender 
equality and the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls, and raising 
awareness of and preventing violence against women and girls;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges</i> States to devote the resources necessary to ensure effective and 
ongoing outreach, awareness-raising, education, training and engagement with relevant 
stakeholders who have an important role in the prevention and early response to warning 
signs of violence against women and girls, including government officials, community and 
religious leaders, and health, education, justice and law enforcement personnel, including 
prison personnel; </p>

<p> 11. <i>Urges</i> Governments to identify and address the effects of all forms of

violence and, in this regard, that women have the right to have control over and decide 
freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and 
reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and urges States to take 
legislative and policy steps in this regard;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Urges</i> States to strengthen initiatives that would increase the capacity of 
women and adolescent girls to protect themselves from HIV infection, including by 
providing HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support services, to ensure 
protection from and prevention of stigma and discrimination, and to cooperate with United 
Nations bodies, programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-
governmental organizations in this regard;

encourages greater international cooperation in systematic research and the collection, 
analysis and dissemination of data, including data disaggregated by sex, age, disability and 
other relevant information on the extent, nature and consequences of violence against 
women and girls, as well as on the impact and effectiveness of policies and programmes 
aimed at combating this violence and, in this context, also urges States and the United 
Nations system to regularly provide information for inclusion in the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
database on violence against women; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Encourages</i> States to implement Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) 
and 1820 (2008); 
 18. <i>Also encourages</i> States to create gender-sensitized training and education 
programmes and other appropriate measures for their armed forces, civilian police, 
peacekeeping units and humanitarian personnel that include instructions on their 
responsibilities towards the civilian population, particularly women and children, as well as 
mechanisms to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent violence against women and full 
accountability in cases of misconduct involving their personnel; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Urges</i> States to establish or strengthen plans of action to eliminate violence 
against women and girls that clearly delineate government accountabilities for prevention 
and are supported by the necessary human, financial and technical resources, including, 
where appropriate, time-bound measurable targets, to promote the protection of women 
against any form of violence, and accelerate the implementation of existing plans of action 
that are regularly monitored and updated by Governments, taking into account inputs by

<p><b> VI. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>202. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251, Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and President&#8217;s statements (PRST/8/1 and PRST/9/2) on modalities and practices for 
the universal periodic review process, the Council considered the outcome of the reviews 
conducted during the seventh session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review, held from 8 to 19 February 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Consideration of universal periodic review outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>203. In accordance with paragraph 4.3 of President&#8217;s statement PRST/8/1, the section 
below contains a summary of the views expressed on the outcome by States under review, 
Member and observer States of the Human Rights Council, as well as general comments 
made by other relevant stakeholders before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary. 
</p>
<p><b>  Qatar 
</b>204. The review of Qatar was held on 8 February 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Qatar in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/QAT/1 and Corr.1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/QAT/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/QAT/3). 
</p><p>205. At its 20th meeting, on 9 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review on Qatar (see section C below). 
206. The outcome of the review on Qatar comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/2), the views of Qatar concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/14/2/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>207. The delegation stated that Qatar paid significant attention to the universal periodic 
review mechanism, which provided all countries with a great opportunity to improve, 
strengthen and promote their commitments under international human rights law. The 
interactive dialogue contributed greatly to strengthening cooperation and helped sharing 
experiences among countries, which led to the achievement of the Council&#8217;s objectives. 
</p><p>208. Qatar participated in the review process in an open and transparent spirit, and 
undertook to duly consider all the recommendations. To that end, all sections of society and 
relevant stakeholders were involved in the drafting process of commentaries and responses 
to the recommendations. Most of the recommendations made during the interactive 
dialogue enjoyed Qatar&#8217;s support; of a total of 112 recommendations, 76 had been accepted 
during the Working Group session, while more time was needed for 24 recommendations to </p>


<p><b>80</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>ensure detailed study, in-depth analysis and coordination with all stakeholders, as well as 
with the Qatari national human rights committee. 
</p><p>209. Several recommendations were already or currently being implemented, and they 
were consistent with the State&#8217;s objectives and strategies. Moreover, Qatar&#8217;s support for 
most of the recommendations and the many steps taken at both the national and 
international levels to promote fundamental human rights stemmed from its endeavour to 
improve human rights and promote constructive cooperation with relevant human rights 
mechanisms. This was confirmed by Qatar&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendation to extend 
an open and standing invitation to special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>210. Qatar could not accept some recommendations, as they related to issues that were 
incompatible with the provisions of Islamic law, the Constitution and laws, or contradicted 
national identity. Some temporary difficulties, such as the lack of technical capacities, 
prevented Qatar from acceding to more conventions at the present time. 
</p><p>211. Qatar&#8217;s position on the 24 pending recommendations was outlined in the addendum 
to the report of the Working Group (A/HRC/14/2/Add.1). 
212. A total of 11 recommendations had been accepted; 8 of them were regarded as either 
already implemented or in the process of implementation. They included recommendations 
7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17&#8211;21 and 24 (A/HRC/14/2, para. 85). 
213. A total of 13 recommendations did not enjoy the State&#8217;s support. They included 
recommendations 1&#8211;6, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 22 and 23 (A/HRC/14/2, para. 85). 
214. The delegation stressed that, although only four months had passed since Qatar was 
reviewed by the Working Group, it was pleased to report on the implementation of a 
number of constructive recommendations, as well as on its commitment to implement 
others in the near future. The follow-up to the recommendations accepted was no less 
important than preparing and discussing the report before the Working Group. In this 
respect, the national committee that prepared the national report would continue its work as 
a mechanism for following up on the implementation of recommendations. 
</p>
<p>215. The delegation added that no effort would be spared to build and strengthen 
capacities through technical cooperation with human rights mechanisms. In this regard, 
Qatar wished to benefit from the activities and programmes of the United Nations Human 
Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region in 
Doha, inaugurated in May 2009, in order to contribute to the training of national human 
resources and to the development and building of capacities. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>216. Saudi Arabia noted that the acceptance by Qatar of most of the recommendations 
and its constructive approach towards the universal periodic review process were clear 
evidence of its commitment to promote and protect human rights. Qatar&#8217;s policy of 
openness and the hosting of numerous international conferences on development, 
democracy, human rights and peace were testament to its political will to continue the 
reform process and the promotion of all rights. It commended Qatar for the numerous steps 
taken to guarantee the provision of social services, in particular in the areas of health and 
education. 
</p>
<p>217. Cuba noted the detailed information provided by Qatar during the interactive 
dialogue. Qatar&#8217;s achievements in the promotion and protection of all human rights for all 
people had been confirmed during its review. In particular, Cuba underscored Qatar&#8217;s 
advances in education, health, the rights of people with disabilities and many other areas. In 
addition, Cuba highlighted Qatar&#8217;s cooperation with other developing countries, as well as </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>81 
</b></p>
<p>its leading role in setting the world&#8217;s development agenda. Cuba welcomed the decision of 
Qatar to accept its recommendations, which had been made in a spirit of cooperation and 
constructive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>218. Jordan thanked Qatar for presenting its position on the recommendations. Jordan 
valued the steps taken to enhance women&#8217;s full participation in all areas of life. These steps 
were part of Qatar&#8217;s efforts to develop the necessary human rights legislative framework. 
Jordan welcomed the efforts made to combat human trafficking through the enactment of 
new legislative and institutional measures, and by supporting victims. Qatar&#8217;s cooperation 
with the United Nations system had been shown by the establishment of the Human Rights 
Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region. Jordan 
welcomed the contribution of Qatar to the promotion of dialogue and peaceful coexistence 
through the establishment of the Doha International Centre for Interfaith Dialogue. 
</p>
<p>219. Oman commended Qatar for its positive cooperation during the interactive dialogue, 
its acceptance of the majority of the recommendations and its readiness to implement them. 
This showed Qatar&#8217;s commitment to the principles of human rights in accordance with its 
constitutional provisions and national traditions and values, based on equality and 
tolerance. 
</p>
<p>220. The United Arab Emirates noted Qatar&#8217;s efforts to guarantee a decent life for its 
population, and expressed confidence in its capacity and political will to promote human 
rights. It welcomed Qatar&#8217;s determination to pursue the dissemination of a culture of human 
rights and to integrate human rights into development efforts, in particular by involving 
women in the development process and offering them the opportunity to participate actively 
in society. The delegation welcomed Qatar&#8217;s acceptance of a number of recommendations 
and its commitment to continue upholding national and international human rights 
obligations. 
</p>
<p>221. Bahrain commended Qatar for the positive steps taken in the context of accepting 
and implementing many recommendations, in particular those made by Bahrain relating to 
the protection and promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities. Bahrain welcomed 
the efforts made to continue combating human trafficking, the acceptance of a visit by the 
Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the 
consideration of draft laws on combating human trafficking and on domestic workers. The 
number of measures taken showed Qatar&#8217;s political determination to promote and protect 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>222. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) expressed its satisfaction at the responses 
provided by Qatar during the universal periodic review, in particular regarding its efforts to 
empower women and guarantee their fundamental rights. It stressed that Qatar placed the 
promotion and protection of human rights at the centre of its reform policies in the 
constitutional, economic, social and cultural spheres. Qatar&#8217;s support for the great majority 
of recommendations was an indication of the seriousness of its commitment to the universal 
periodic review. It also commended Qatar&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights in 
accordance with its customs and traditional values. 
</p>
<p>223. Egypt commended Qatar for its cooperation with the universal periodic review. It 
noted with appreciation Qatar&#8217;s serious approach to the preparation of the review and to the 
national discussions in relation to the recommendations, which had involved all State 
institutions, in consultation with civil society. The adoption of the outcome report would 
represent a significant boost to Qatar&#8217;s national efforts to promote human rights and to 
achieve the aspirations of the Government and the people alike. Egypt was confident that 
Qatar would continue to promote and protect human rights at the national level, and 
contribute to that end at the regional and international levels.  </p>


<p><b>82</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>224. Kuwait stated that, through the universal periodic review, Qatar had shown that 
human rights were the cornerstone to its comprehensive reform policies at the 
constitutional, economic, social and cultural levels. Qatar had established a national human 
rights commission in line with the Paris Principles, as well as other independent institutions 
dealing with interfaith dialogue and press freedom. Kuwait commended Qatar for hosting 
the United Nations Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia 
and the Arab Region, and for accepting a number of recommendations, particularly those 
made by Kuwait regarding the promotion of the rights of women and their role in society. 
</p>
<p>225. Pakistan noted that Qatar had accepted a large number of recommendations and 
welcomed its resolve to accelerate efforts to promote and protect human rights. It was 
pleased by Qatar&#8217;s readiness to consider ratifying international human rights instruments, in 
particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Pakistan noted that women were key 
partners in the social development of the country, and welcomed its commitment to 
continue ensuring women&#8217;s full participation in the social and political fields. Pakistan 
recognized the presence of considerable numbers of foreign workers in Qatar and noted the 
Government&#8217;s commitment to strengthen labour laws to improve their living and working 
conditions. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>226. The National Human Rights Committee of Qatar commended the efforts made to 
uphold human rights at the legislative and executive levels. It hoped that Qatar would soon 
accede to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Although national laws, with a few 
exceptions, guaranteed all rights, the Committee noted the efforts made to amend laws in 
the areas of media, housing, workers and labour, and hoped for their prompt adoption. The 
Committee also noted the efforts made in cooperating with treaty bodies, by submitting 
initial and periodic reports and presenting the necessary clarifications. The effective 
implementation of international obligations required further efforts in order to incorporate 
them into national legislation. 
</p>
<p>227. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies called for the repeal of two laws used 
to fight terrorism, which legalized de facto arbitrary and incommunicado detention. It asked 
Qatar to define torture in its domestic legislation, in conformity with article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, and to prohibit the expulsion, return or extradition of a person to another State 
that practices torture. It noted that the code governing nationality authorized the withdrawal 
of a citizen&#8217;s nationality in certain cases and that the law established inequality between 
naturalized citizens and those of Qatari origin. Measures should be taken to ensure de facto 
equal rights for all citizens and to fight against situations of statelessness. 
</p>
<p>228. The Indian Council of South America congratulated Qatar on having accepted many 
recommendations, including that on the death penalty. It welcomed the acceptance of the 
visit by the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
and the effort to draft laws on combating human trafficking and on domestic workers. It 
called upon Qatar to invite more special procedures mandate holders to visit the country 
and to continue to strengthen cooperation with civil society in areas such as the 
administration of justice, education, public health, migrant workers and gender equality. It 
asked for more women to be allowed in higher levels of government, and that Qatar support 
regional meetings to discuss the injustices that women face. 
</p><p>229. Organisation pour la communication en Afrique et de promotion de la coop&#233;ration 
&#233;conomique internationale welcomed the commitments made by Qatar during the universal 
periodic review, including with regard to women&#8217;s education. It congratulated Qatar on its </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>83 
</b></p>
<p>efforts to promote and protect human rights, in particular of women and children, as well as 
for its constructive participation in the review. While welcoming the ratification of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 
progress made in the promotion of gender equality and the emancipation of women in 
Qatar, it highlighted that much remained to be done. It recommended the ratification of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and encouraged Qatar to implement the economic, 
social and cultural rights of women in the country. 
</p>
<p>230. Action internationale pour la paix et le d&#233;veloppement dans la r&#233;gion des Grands 
Lacs welcomed the progress made in line with Qatar National Vision 2030, which 
addressed key human rights issues in the areas of health, environment, expatriate workers, 
women&#8217;s empowerment, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities. A series of 
international conferences had been hosted by Qatar on democracy, human rights, peace and 
trade. A number of centres had been established to promote interfaith dialogue and press 
freedom. It called on the Council to assist Qatar to include the crime of torture and 
appropriate penalties in its legislation, and to consider ratifying the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>231. The Al Hakim Foundation underscored Qatar&#8217;s positive engagement with the 
Council&#8217;s mechanisms, and commended Qatar for hosting the United Nations Human 
Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region. It 
congratulated Qatar on its leading role in the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, and welcomed the establishment of international centres to build 
a culture of dialogue, democracy and peaceful coexistence. It hoped that Qatar would 
reconsider the recommendations that had not been accepted, and would commit greater 
resources to combat domestic violence, promote the rights of children and reconsider the 
sponsorship system governing foreign workers. 
</p>
<p>232. Comit&#233; internationale pour le respect et l&#8217;application de la Charte Africaine des 
droits de l&#8217;homme et des peuples acknowledged Qatar&#8217;s determination to make the 
promotion and protection of human rights a non-negotiable priority. It highlighted the 
legislative measures taken to ensure improved protection of migrant workers, persons with 
disabilities, women and children, as well as freedom of religion, expression and association. 
Qatar&#8217;s contribution to establishing peace and security in many countries had been 
unanimously recognized by the international community. Qatar&#8217;s significant contribution to 
humanitarian aid programmes in Africa and other regions was also mentioned.  
</p>
<p>233. Amnesty International welcomed Qatar&#8217;s support for recommendations to consider 
ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and urged Qatar to do so without delay 
and without reservations. It encouraged Qatar to repeal provisions that criminalize 
legitimate forms of freedom of expression, and those that punish blasphemy and consensual 
&#8220;illicit sexual relations&#8221;. Amnesty International called on Qatar to reconsider its position 
regarding the rejection of recommendations to review and repeal laws that discriminate 
against women, and to establish an official moratorium on the use of the death penalty with 
a view to its abolition. It urged Qatar to ensure an end to the use of arbitrary detention 
without charge and trial, including in the context of counter-terrorism and public security. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>234. The delegation expressed its gratitude and appreciation to all States and stakeholders 
for their valuable observations and comments. It stressed that all the comments and 
observations would be taken into consideration. It renewed Qatar&#8217;s commitment to further 
its cooperation and consultation with all United Nations human rights mechanisms and its 
support for the Council. </p>

<p><b>  Nicaragua 
</b></p>
<p>235. The review of Nicaragua was held on 8 February 2010, in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Nicaragua in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/NIC/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/NIC/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/NIC/3). 
</p><p>236. At its 15th meeting, on 9 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review on Nicaragua (see section C below). 
237. The outcome of the review on Nicaragua comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/3), the views of Nicaragua concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>238. The Permanent Representative of Nicaragua to the United Nations Office at Geneva 
expressed Nicaragua&#8217;s appreciation for the recommendations made and for the participation 
of civil society organizations in the review. This process allowed Nicaragua to identify 
challenges and to continue to strengthen the protection and promotion of human rights in 
the country.  
</p>
<p>239. Nicaragua clarified its position with regard to 42 recommendations included in 
paragraph 92 of the report of the Working Group. Its position was based on its 
constitutional framework, the socioeconomic situation of the country and the full exercise 
of its sovereignty. 
</p>
<p>240. With regard to recommendations 1 to 4, on the adoption of new international 
instruments, Nicaragua accepted the recommendation regarding the ratification of the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal 
Peoples in Independent Countries (Convention No. 169). This step was commended by the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people. With regard to the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Rome Statute and the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
Nicaragua did not consider it appropriate for the moment to make additional commitments. 
</p>
<p>241. With regard to recommendations 5, 12 and 15&#8211;24, related to the protection, 
assistance and health care for women and girl victims of rape and violence, Nicaragua 
supported these recommendations, except for the amendment of the law prohibiting 
therapeutic abortion. This decision was the result of Nicaragua&#8217;s exercise of its sovereignty, 
and had been adopted by the National Assembly, which represented the majority of the 
Nicaraguan people, who upheld the right to life of the unborn child. Nicaragua had sought 
to improve the access of vulnerable groups to justice, and promoted the recourse to 
alternative conflict-resolution methods. Nicaragua had provided rehabilitation to victims of 
trafficking and sexual exploitation, and had set up a specialized department for women and 
children and 35 specialized police units for women and children. The Government had </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>85 
</b></p>
<p>developed a national strategy on reproductive and sexual health, with the aims of improving 
maternal and postnatal health, encouraging family planning and avoiding unwanted 
pregnancy. Primary obstetric care was provided by health-care centres, to preserve the life 
and integrity of women facing obstetric emergencies. 
</p>
<p>242. Nicaragua did not support recommendations 6 and 7, on the introduction of the 
definition of torture in its legislation, in accordance with the Convention against Torture, as 
it considered that the definition of torture in its legislation was more comprehensive than 
that of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>243. Regarding recommendation 8, to eliminate the crime of defamation from the Penal 
Code, the recommendation was not appropriate, as the above-mentioned crime did not 
appear as such in its Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>244. Nicaragua supported recommendation 9, on the establishment of a national council 
on women, which was in line with Government policies. 
</p>
<p>245. Nicaragua supported recommendations 10, 11 and 25 to 29 on the dissemination and 
full implementation of the Declaration on Human Right Defenders. No State policy against 
human rights defenders existed, and the promotion and protection of human rights, besides 
being a Government policy, was a State commitment. Accordingly, Nicaragua supported 
these recommendations. It added that incidents affecting human rights defenders had 
originated in the private sphere and that the police had investigated all seven reports, which 
was not an alarming figure. Nicaragua had conformed to respect human rights and to 
promote human rights education at all levels in order to ensure tolerance and respect of 
human rights defenders, in close coordination with the Procuraduria para la Defensa de los 
Derechos Humanos. Victims could also resort to legal remedies. 
</p>
<p>246. Nicaragua supported recommendations 13, 14, 40 and 41, on strengthening measures 
to tackle violence against women, stating that they were in line with its development 
policies, which focused on the &#8220;human being&#8221;. The new Penal Code of 2008 introduced 
domestic violence as a crime and provided for protection measures for victims. Other 
measures had been taken: offenders did not benefit from release on bail; crimes were tried 
by professional judges; the State promoted free access of women to justice; specialized 
police units promoted awareness-raising campaigns; and the Office of the Public Attorney 
had established a specialized unit on gender violence and a specialized office for the 
assistance of victims of crimes, adopted guidelines on domestic violence for prosecutors, 
and concluded an agreement to improve coordination with judges, police agents and 
forensic experts. 
</p>
<p>247. The right to freedom of expression was guaranteed by the State as a constitutional 
right. In that regard, recommendation 31 was not appropriate. 
</p>
<p>248. Nicaragua supported recommendation 32, relating to allowing civil society 
organizations to express themselves freely on Government policies. However, this right 
pertained only to national civil society organizations, since foreign or international 
organizations, by nature, could not interfere with the internal affairs of Government policy. 
</p>
<p>249. Regarding recommendation 33, which called for the establishment of an independent 
body to regulate the access to information, Nicaragua did not favour the establishment of 
such an organ; access to information was already regulated by the State through the Office 
for the Coordination on Access to Public Information. It added that access to information 
was guaranteed by law 621, which also provided for the <i>habeas data</i> remedy.  
</p>
<p>250. Nicaragua had noted recommendation 34, on measures to guarantee that opposition 
political parties could freely express their opinion, stating that measures had already been 
taken to guarantee this right, which was also protected by the Constitution. </p>


<p><b>86</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>251. Nicaragua noted recommendation 35, relating to the amendment to the electoral law 
to allow the participation of people living in autonomous regions in decision-making 
processes, because indigenous peoples&#8217; rights were already recognized by law and that, 
with respect to communities living in the Atlantic coast, this right had a constitutional 
recognition. 
</p>
<p>252. On recommendations 36 to 39, relating to ensuring the independence of the 
judiciary, Nicaragua was not in a position to make amendments in this regard, as the 
separation of powers was already guaranteed by the Constitution. Magistrates and judges 
were independent; their judgements were implemented by State authorities, and the law on 
the judicial career, which provided for a transparent system of appointment of judges, was 
being implemented. 
</p>
<p>253. Nicaragua supported recommendation 42, on increasing the national budget on 
education, and explained that steps had already been taken in this regard. The budget had 
already increased by 1,745 million c&#243;rdobas in the past four years. Measures had been 
taken to improve access to education for the most vulnerable sectors of the population, and 
food had been provided for nearly 1 million children. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>254. Cuba noted that the Sandinista revolution had made human rights a reality, and 
stated that a similar revolution was being carried out by President Ortega, building on the 
aftermath of a war financed and conducted by the Empire and successive neoliberal 
Governments. It highlighted Nicaragua&#8217;s approach to the universal periodic review, its 
efforts to make dignity and social justice a reality, and to combat poverty and ensure food 
security. It also highlighted the fact that access to health and education was free, and 
welcomed the elimination of illiteracy in 2008. It congratulated Nicaragua&#8217;s work in the 
implementation of recommendations and the ratification of ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>255. Qatar valued the positive and constructive attitude of Nicaragua in dealing with the 
recommendations. It noted Nicaragua&#8217;s acceptance of 68 recommendations, including the 
one made by Qatar, which demonstrated the seriousness and the importance attached by 
Nicaragua to the realization of human rights, despite obstacles. Qatar also noted a number 
of programmes and strategies aimed at reducing illiteracy and poverty and combating 
marginalization. Qatar supported Nicaragua&#8217;s efforts to realize economic and social 
development. Qatar also thanked Nicaragua for its support for the Palestinian cause. 
</p><p>256. Algeria was united to Nicaragua in the defence of the objectives and principles of 
the United Nations, as well as in the protection of human rights. It noted Nicaragua&#8217;s 
engagement with the international community through the Council. Algeria expressed its 
satisfaction at Nicaragua&#8217;s acceptance of its three recommendations. 
</p>
<p>257. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) welcomed the Sandinista Government&#8217;s open 
and constructive spirit during the review. It noted its achievements in the implementation of 
appropriate social policies in the field of education. It recognized Nicaragua&#8217;s valuable 
efforts in favour of human rights and the will and commitment shown to achieve goals in 
this regard, despite the difficulties due to the economic crisis. It highlighted Nicaragua&#8217;s 
efforts to guarantee access to free education. It encouraged Nicaragua to maintain this 
approach. 
</p>
<p>258. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) congratulated Nicaragua on its ratification of ILO 
Convention No. 169. It noted Nicaragua&#8217;s achievements in institutionalizing the conquests 
of the Sandinista revolution, seeking to eliminate exploitation through respect for human 
rights. It highlighted Nicaragua&#8217;s implementation of its human rights plan by harmonizing 
legislation to ensure the protection of human rights, prioritizing vulnerable groups. It was </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>87 
</b></p>
<p>pleased that Nicaragua had accepted its recommendation to continue implementing plans 
and programmes and following up on its obligations to human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>259. Pakistan noted that Nicaragua had accepted most of the recommendations, which 
showed its commitment to human rights. It also noted with satisfaction the readiness of 
Nicaragua to consider imposing sanctions against organizations that promoted racial 
discrimination and taking appropriate measures to combat racial prejudice in both the 
public and private media channels. Pakistan appreciated the special attention accorded to 
the realization of economic, social and cultural rights and the commitment to strengthen 
policies and programmes further for the welfare of its people. 
</p>
<p>260. Malaysia noted Nicaragua&#8217;s acceptance of a large number of recommendations, and 
that Nicaragua had already started to implement some of them. Malaysia commended 
Nicaragua for its commitment to the promotion of human development with a view to 
eradicating poverty. It also praised Nicaragua&#8217;s firm commitment to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals despite considerable constraints. 
</p>
<p>261. Sri Lanka appreciated Nicaragua&#8217;s detailed responses on the recommendations. Sri 
Lanka welcomed Nicaragua&#8217;s acceptance of 68 recommendations, and the detailed 
responses to the additional 42 recommendations, which was a clear sign of its constructive 
engagement with the Council. It encouraged Nicaragua to make all efforts to implement the 
accepted recommendations fully. Sri Lanka also noted that the key challenge facing 
Nicaragua was the fight against poverty, and was confident that the agreed 
recommendations would facilitate efforts further at the national level. 
</p>
<p>262. Uzbekistan welcomed Nicaragua&#8217;s national plan for human development for the 
period 2009&#8211;2011, taking into account a gender perspective, providing assistance to 
vulnerable groups as a priority, and conducting a massive awareness-raising campaign on 
human rights. Uzbekistan had also noted the efforts to improve the judiciary for 2009&#8211;
</p><p>2011. Uzbekistan expressed satisfaction that Nicaragua had accepted Uzbekistan&#8217;s 
recommendation that it continue to implement national priorities and measures aimed at 
settling issues relating to the promotion and protection of human rights in accordance with 
its legislation and international obligations. 
</p>
<p>263. The Islamic Republic of Iran welcomed the constructive engagement of Nicaragua 
in the universal periodic review, and thanked it for accepting many recommendations, 
including those that it had made. This clearly demonstrated Nicaragua&#8217;s will and 
commitment to human rights at international and national levels, particularly in the field of 
social and economic rights. It commended the principled position of the Government of 
Nicaragua on the occupied Palestinian territories, particularly following the recent, brutal 
attack against the humanitarian aid convoy. 
</p>
<p>264. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea appreciated the sincere and 
constructive approach adopted by Nicaragua towards the universal periodic review process. 
It noted its consistent policies and efforts aimed at the promotion and protection of human 
rights. Despite the difficulties and challenges, Nicaragua had made constant efforts and 
considerable achievements in the areas of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as in 
civil and political rights. It had also noted a series of measures taken to improve the living 
conditions of its people, particularly of vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>265. The Procuraduria para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos of Nicaragua welcomed 
the ratification of ILO Convention No. 169 and its extension to Afro-descendants. It 
recognized Nicaragua&#8217;s will and achievements in access to health, education, social housing 
and citizen security, in spite of the lack of resources. It suggested that Nicaragua should 
reconsider the legislative prohibition of therapeutic abortion; to this end, it urged the four </p>


<p><b>88</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>powers of State to coordinate, since this decision would override each one&#8217;s competency. It 
suggested that Nicaragua should assign more resources to develop public policies on 
sustainable land use and to promote food production. It highlighted the fact that the 
privatization of social security affected those over 60 years of age. It recognized that a lack 
of resources and drug trafficking threatened the well-being of the population in detention, 
and invited Nicaragua to continue to combat this scourge. 
</p>
<p>266. The World Organization against Torture, in a joint statement with the International 
Federation for Human Rights, referred to procedures lacking transparency, which had led to 
the electoral fraud in 2008 and remained in place in the 2010 elections, and would 
jeopardize the 2011 elections. It had also noted a presidential decree of January 2010 that, 
contrary to the Constitution, sought to keep the magistrates of the Supreme Electoral 
Council whose term of office ended in place, and which gravely affected the independence 
of the judiciary. It expressed its support for recommendations on the respect of rule of law, 
including the current Constitution, which prohibited the continuing re-election of the 
President. The State continued to discredit human rights defenders, and even encouraged 
new forms of aggression against them. It also stated that violence against women continued, 
noting Nicaragua&#8217;s refusal to allow therapeutic abortions despite the recommendations of 
four treaty bodies and more than 30 universal periodic review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>267. Madre, Inc. noted that the law prohibiting abortion could not be declared 
unconstitutional since the Supreme Court of Justice had itself been formed illegally. It 
noted that two lawyers whose terms of office had expired were still in the Court, a situation 
backed by an illegal Presidential decree. These illegal actions had been imposed through 
threats and intimidation, without any kind of investigation into the events. Madre, Inc. 
requested that the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
investigate the matter. 
</p>
<p>268. Amnesty International welcomed Nicaragua&#8217;s immediate support for 68 
recommendations, including those to uphold freedom of expression, assembly and 
association, and to ensure that human rights defenders work without harassment and that 
national laws comply with international human rights obligations. The total ban on 
abortions had been introduced in 2006, and subsequently enforced by the new criminal law 
introduced in 2008. Amnesty International expressed disappointment that Nicaragua was 
unable to support consistent calls for the repeal of the ban by treaty bodies and at the 
universal periodic review. It noted that, so long as the ban remained in place, victims of 
rape and incest would be subjected to health risks and imprisonment if they sought legal 
abortions. Furthermore, medical professionals fearful of prosecution would delay or deny 
life-saving medical treatment to women and girls who suffered complications during 
pregnancy. It urged Nicaragua to work to build support for changing legislation over time at 
the national level.  
</p>
<p>269. The International Save the Children Alliance welcomed the ban on corporal 
punishment. It regretted that the Government had limited its focus on child victims of rape, 
resulting in forced pregnancies. It expected the Government to allocate more resources to 
the education sector and to provide rehabilitation and education opportunities for street 
children. It urged sustained investment in education to achieve universal basic education. It 
welcomed the support for the follow-up to and strengthening and implementation of plans 
for combating poverty. It urged the Government to double its efforts to create decent jobs, 
in order to reduce migration and the risk of abandonment resulting in child exploitation. It 
welcomed the acceptance of recommendations on strengthening and impartiality of the 
ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>270. Action Canada for Population and Development, in a joint statement with Ipas, 
noted that the ban on therapeutic abortions continued, despite the recommendations of 
human rights bodies and those made during the universal periodic review. The law </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>89 
</b></p>
<p>prohibiting therapeutic abortion had been challenged on constitutionality grounds in 2008, 
but the remedy was still pending at the Supreme Court. A draft amendment of law 641, 
which allowed for exceptions in exceptional circumstances, enjoyed the support of all 
political parties, except for the Sandinista Front. It stated that the protocol for assistance in 
cases of obstetric emergencies was not an adequate solution, since it was not a law but only 
an administrative regulation, so medical personnel still feared reprisals of being punished. It 
requested the Council to maintain the recommendations regarding therapeutic abortion until 
the law was amended.  
</p>
<p>271. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation requested 
that all universal periodic review recommendations be implemented and that new and 
independent machinery be established by law to tackle discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. It urged the Government to ratify the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the San Salvador 
Protocol and the Rome Statute, and to adopt the Yogyakarta Principles and relevant 
resolutions of the Organization of American States as guidelines of its public policies. It 
also encouraged Nicaragua to include civil society in the implementation of 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>272. Nicaragua appreciated the opportunity to engage in a sincere, genuine and 
transparent dialogue, and all recommendations made. It would continue to cooperate with 
the Council, and reiterated its willingness to overcome human rights obstacles and 
challenges, highlighting the fact that its commitment to human rights was permanent. 
</p>
<p><b>  Italy 
</b></p>
<p>273. The review of Italy was held on 9 February 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Italy in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/ITA/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/ITA/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/ITA/3). 
</p><p>274. At its 20th meeting, on 9 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review on Italy (see section C below). 
275. The outcome of the review on Italy comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/4), the views of Italy concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/14/4/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>276. Italy noted that the universal periodic review had contributed significantly to an 
assessment of its domestic situation in the field of human rights. In presenting its national 
report, Italy had focused on priority areas, such as the fight against racism and racial 
discrimination, the situation of migrants and asylum seekers, the presence of Roma and </p>


<p><b>90</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>Sinti communities, the human rights of women and children, freedom of opinion and 
expression, the independence of the judiciary and administration of justice, and the 
commitment to establish an independent human rights institution.  
</p>
<p>277. Italy would take important decisions concerning migration policy within the 
framework of the European Union, with due regard for sustainability, social integration and 
the rule of law.  
</p>
<p>278. With regard to the recommendations made during the interactive dialogue, Italy 
referred to its responses in the addendum submitted before the session. In this context, it 
noted that, since February 2010, the authorities had convened two meetings with civil 
society organizations and two parliamentary hearings devoted to the results of the review. 
Italy stressed that it had accepted 78 of the 92 recommendations made, and had provided 
detailed comments and explanations in relation to its response to a large number of 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>279. Many recommendations focused on challenging areas, to which further attention was 
required, such as integration policies and equal opportunities. Italy noted that some 
concrete action had already been taken in recent months, such as the ratification of the 
Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; the 
allocation of a further 200 million euros to integration policies for migrants; and the 
imminent launching by the Minister for Equal Opportunities of an updated national plan of 
action against racism and racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>280. Algeria warmly thanked Italy for the replies given to the recommendations made. 
Italy had shown its commitment to human rights by accepting most recommendations, 
including three of the four recommendations made by Algeria. However, in the light of the 
difficulties encountered by migrant workers, it had hoped that its recommendation that Italy 
become a party to the Convention on Migrant Workers would also be accepted. Algeria 
welcomed the noble spirit of Italy in settling a historic conflict with a former colony, as 
well as its renewed commitment to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent for official 
development assistance set by the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>281. The Islamic Republic of Iran referred to the recommendations that it had made 
during the Working Group session, requesting that the delegation elaborate on the measures 
taken to effectively address them, including the recommendations to ratify the Convention 
on Migrant Workers; to develop a comprehensive strategy in areas such as housing, 
education, employment and health care, to improve the situation of Roma and Sinti 
communities; to take a comprehensive set of measures to combat racism and racist political 
platforms; and to develop a national integrated human rights plan in line with the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action. It deplored the position taken by Italy on Council 
resolution 14/1, which it considered brought into doubt Italy&#8217;s commitment to human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>282. Belarus was grateful for the detailed comments provided by Italy on the 
recommendations. It welcomed Italy&#8217;s goodwill and efforts in implementing 
recommendations, a sign of its continuing commitment to its international obligations in the 
area of human rights. Continuous efforts were needed to combat human trafficking, by 
reducing the demand for victims and taking victim identification measures. Additional 
efforts were also required to better manage the massive influx of illegal migrants and to 
counter discriminatory and racial acts. Belarus noted Italy&#8217;s comments in relation to the 
recommendations that could not be implemented, and expressed understanding in this 
regard. </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>91 
</b></p>
<p>283. The United States of America commended Italy for enhancing its commitment to 
address human rights issues with the proposed establishment of an independent national 
human rights institution. It aligned itself with the recommendations that Italy continue to 
ensure freedom of expression and the media, and called for the adoption of safeguards to 
ensure the independent functioning of all media. It expressed appreciation for Italy&#8217;s 
acceptance of recommendations regarding immigration, in particular those relating to 
Muslim immigrants and the Roma community. It underlined the importance of 
recommendations regarding the forced eviction of persons living in unauthorized camps, 
and encouraged Italy to accept these recommendations, if it had not already done so, and to 
intensify efforts to consult with affected residents.  
</p>
<p>284. Iraq greatly appreciated Italy&#8217;s efforts to prepare its report, which reflected its desire 
to promote human rights. It acknowledged the efforts made by Italy in ratifying the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, as well as its adoption of a bill of 
ratification of the Convention to combat trafficking in persons. Iraq valued the 
reaffirmation by Italy that it would fully abide by recently adopted legislation, particularly 
in relation to the treatment of migrants, also known as the security package, as well as other 
implementing measures, principles and obligations in the area of human rights. Iraq wished 
Italy success in making further progress, particularly in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>285. Somalia noted that a large number of recommendations had been made during the 
review of Italy, many of which were focused on such challenges as migration policies and 
the fight against racial discrimination. Somalia expressed satisfaction at the acceptance by 
Italy of most recommendations and the detailed explanations provided in this regard. It 
recalled its historic ties with Italy, and called on Italy to continue to devote attention and 
resources to the pursuit of a lasting solution to the political, social and economic problems 
that had affected Somalia for so many years. Somalia seized the opportunity to thank the 
Commission on Human Rights of the Parliament of Italy for organizing a special hearing on 
the situation of human rights in Somalia. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>286. Human Rights Watch shared the concerns expressed by many delegations about 
intolerance and xenophobia towards migrants and minorities, including the Roma and the 
Sinti. Racism and xenophobia characterized by violence, as well as offensive political 
discourse, were serious problems in Italy. Human Rights Watch noted that, although during 
its review Italy had reiterated its commitment to rescue operations at sea, to date it had 
failed to renounce publicly its policy of intercepting and summarily returning boat migrants 
on the high seas. It welcomed Italy&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendation to ensure that its 
legislation and practices comply with the principle of non-refoulement, stressing that it was 
vital for Italy to comply with this principle also in relation to terrorism suspects, as the 
global ban on torture and the European system of human rights protection would otherwise 
be undermined. 
</p>
<p>287. The Joint Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims expressed its concern at 
the persistence of xenophobic attitudes and reported instances of hate speech against 
foreign nationals. It also expressed concern at the role of the media in associating Muslims 
with extremism and terrorism. It asked that Italy rectify this situation by eliminating all 
forms of discrimination against minorities and migrants and ensuring equal opportunities 
for the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights; that it take administrative and 
legal measures against perpetrators of racially-motivated acts; and that it ratify the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture in order to permit the Subcommittee on 
Prevention of Torture to conduct visits to places of detention, including reclusion centres 
for migrants and asylum seekers.  </p>


<p><b>92</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>288. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues and its affiliated league in 
Italy, the Union of Jurists for the Protection of Human Rights, expressed satisfaction at the 
large number of pertinent recommendations that had been made. It noted a marked increase 
in racism and discriminatory behaviour against migrants and Roma and Sinti populations in 
Italy. Despite existing legal instruments, judicial authorities had failed to prosecute those 
responsible. It also stated that Italy&#8217;s reply in relation to questions on the treatment and 
refoulement of illegal migrants and asylum seekers did not reflect the widespread practice 
of pushing back migrants in the high seas. It further observed the increasing restrictions on 
the freedom of expression and the right to information, and indicated that concerns raised 
about media concentration were particularly relevant.  
</p>
<p>289. Amnesty International noted that many delegations had asked Italy to take effective 
measures to counter racism and prevent discrimination against migrants, asylum seekers 
and members of minorities. It welcomed Italy&#8217;s support for most recommendations on these 
issues. It also noted with appreciation that Italy had accepted recommendations to ensure 
compliance with international law in relation to forced evictions. It expressed 
disappointment at the rejection of the recommendations to incorporate into domestic law 
the crime of torture, as defined in the Convention against Torture, and urged Italy to 
reconsider. Lastly, it regretted that Italy had rejected recommendations made to eliminate 
from its legislation provisions that criminalized irregular entry and stay in the country, and 
called on Italy to amend or withdraw these provisions. 
</p>
<p>290. The International Save the Children Alliance noted that Italy had not accepted a 
recommendation relating to the prohibition of corporal punishment. It urged Italy to 
prohibit corporal punishment and other forms of cruel or degrading punishment in all 
settings, including the family, by enshrining the prohibition in national law. On the other 
hand, the Alliance welcomed Italy&#8217;s acceptance of a recommendation relating to the 
effective protection of the rights of unaccompanied children and their access to asylum 
procedures. It noted with concern, however, that the principle of the benefit of doubt was 
not applied in the assessment of a child&#8217;s age, and that migrants who arrived as children 
were not placed in integration projects for at least two years and were not entitled to have 
their residents permits renewed when adults. It called on Italy to introduce adequate legal 
safeguards to protect the rights of unaccompanied children, and welcomed the acceptance 
by Italy of recommendations relating to the improvement of asylum procedures and respect 
for the principle of non-refoulement.  
</p>
<p>291. Rencontre afrique pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme noted that Italy faced great 
difficulties in migration management. Some migrants lived in very difficult conditions, 
working in some instances over 16 hours a day for very low wages, half of which they had 
to give to the local mafia. It welcomed Italy&#8217;s contribution to the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals in many developing countries, through the promotion of 
food security and the right to safe drinking water. It encouraged Italy to establish a national 
dialogue to re-examine recommendations that it had not accepted. Lastly, it requested that 
Italy establish a favourable framework to rehabilitate victims of trafficking and to launch a 
dialogue with the countries concerned to put an end to the distress of migrants.  
</p>
<p>292. Reporters without Borders stated that Italy seemed to be drifting away from 
democratic standards with regard to press freedom, the financial status of the media and the 
separation of powers. It expressed concern at a draft law that would criminalize the 
publication of telephone recordings and prohibit publications relating to cases in which the 
investigation was not terminated as well as the use of hidden microphones or cameras, thus 
jeopardizing the freedom of the press and the investigative work of journalists. Reporters 
without Borders further referred to a conflict of interest created by the control exercised by 
the Prime Minister of Italy over public television channels and private media. In this 
context, it expressed alarm at the restrictions on investigative journalism and political </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>93 
</b></p>
<p>discourse on television, including during the electoral period. It also noted that a number of 
journalists needed to live under police protection owing to their investigative work on the 
mafia. 
</p>
<p>293. The Joint European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Federation 
commended Italy for accepting a recommendation to strengthen measures to prohibit 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and to ensure adequate 
protection of LGB people. It noted that legal protection against discrimination of LGB 
persons only existed in the area of employment. In view of increasing violence against 
these groups, they should be included in appropriate hate-crime legislation. Training should 
be provided to the police and other relevant authorities. Public education and awareness-
raising campaigns should also be promoted. It welcomed Italy&#8217;s support for the joint 
statement on sexual orientation and gender identity and human rights delivered in 
December 2008 at the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>294. Franciscans International was pleased with the involvement of Italian civil society in 
the universal periodic review process, and recommended that Italy put in place a follow-up 
mechanism and continue the dialogue with civil society. It appreciated Italy&#8217;s commitment 
to reduce pollution emissions from the Cerano coal power plant in the Apulia region and 
the Taranto metallurgical plant, and requested that concrete steps be taken and made public 
as soon as possible. It regretted the fact that Italy had declined to ratify the Convention on 
the Rights of Migrant Workers, and invited Italy to consider leading a consultation process 
to review the position vis-&#224;-vis the Convention among the members of the European Union. 
It regretted Italy&#8217;s reasons for rejecting recommendations concerning the decriminalization 
of irregular migrants.  
</p>
<p>295. Volontariato Internazionale per lo Sviluppo stated that Italy remained one of the few 
European countries without a national human rights institution, and expressed concern at 
the continuing delay in the establishment of such a body, noting that no concrete action had 
been taken to date. In this regard, it recalled the voluntary pledge made by Italy in 2008, 
when presenting its candidature for membership in the Council. It also noted that, in 2008, 
a draft bill had been announced, although its text had never been made public. It considered 
that budgetary constraints could not constitute a valid excuse, and recommended that Italy 
should establish such an institution as a matter of urgency. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>296. In response to the comments and queries, Italy observed that, to a great extent, they 
had focused on the area of migration and the integration of the Roma and the Sinti. In this 
regard, Italy acknowledged that the situation was not perfect, but it was improving. While 
Italy had still been a country of massive emigration some 30 years earlier, it had now 
suddenly become a country of massive immigration. This shift had brought about a number 
of complications for the legislature and for the general public.  
</p>
<p>297. A main feature of Italy&#8217;s policy was that it distinguished between regular and 
irregular migrants, to encourage the former and discourage the latter. Italy was not in a 
position to sign the Convention on Migrant Workers, which made no such distinction. A 
key component of the migration policy was the fight against organized crime, which took 
advantage of unfortunate people seeking to leave their countries. This fight was 
intensifying. The second goal was to work with countries of origin, which were supposed to 
treat their citizens well, but frequently failed to do so. This often resulted in the unfortunate 
departure of the most talented people, known as the &#8220;brain drain&#8221;. A third line of action was 
cooperation with transit countries, which were also responsible for the humane treatment of 
migrants. In addition, Italy was working with partners in the European Union towards 
increased regulation and burden-sharing, noting that a large number of migrants arriving in </p>


<p><b>94</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>Italy were continuing their path to other countries, and that only about 40 per cent of 
migrants stayed on in Italy.  
</p>
<p>298. Italy was committed to protecting the human rights of migrants, and recognized the 
positive contribution of migrant workers to the Italian economy and society. Its policies 
aimed at their full integration.  
</p>
<p>299. Italy highlighted its efforts aimed at rescuing migrants at sea, noting that 
approximately 40,000 migrants had been rescued by Italian vessels in 2008 and 2009. 
However, it was important to put a stop to this dramatic situation and to prevent criminal 
groups from profiting from it, with the help of all countries concerned. With regard to the 
issue of refoulement, the Frontex common patrol operation at sea, in which many European 
countries participated, was in full compliance with relevant legal standards and United 
Nations conventions.  
</p>
<p>300. Italy was making efforts to address the issue of the Roma and the Sinti. The Roma 
had long lived in Italy, and many were Italian citizens, but the recent arrival of large groups 
from other parts of Europe had posed problems with regard to their integration. In total, 
there were now more than 160,000 Roma and Sinti in Italy. Italy stressed that all incidents 
had been regularly condemned by all political forces, and that rigorous investigations had 
been conducted. The most important task was the social integration of the Roma, in 
particular with regard to housing, education and employment. Efforts in this regard were 
continuing. With regard to its recognition as a minority, however, this would not be in line 
with the Constitution of Italy, which required a certain stability and duration of settlement 
of relevant communities in a specific area of the country.  
</p>
<p>301. With regard to racial discrimination and xenophobia, Italy acknowledged that 
episodes of these phenomena did indeed still occur, and that related social attitudes still 
existed, although the Government was strongly committed to their eradication. The legal 
framework had a multitude of provisions to fight racial discrimination and xenophobia, 
including provisions prohibiting incitement to hatred, and the judicial system was very 
active in this regard. Italy also paid special attention to the educational system, fostering an 
intercultural approach through specific programmes. 
</p>
<p>302. Lastly, with regard to a query related to its negative vote on Council resolution 14/1, 
Italy explained that its decision in this regard had not been easy, and asserted its very 
friendly relations with the Palestinian people, the Arab world as a whole, and Turkey, 
which had also been directly and dramatically involved. Italy stressed its willingness to 
continue to work, in conjunction with the European Union, for a just and comprehensive 
solution to the Middle East conflict, taking into account the legitimate concerns of all 
parties involved. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p>303. The review of Kazakhstan was held on 12 February 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Kazakhstan in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/KAZ/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/KAZ/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/KAZ/3). </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>95 
</b></p>
<p>304. At its 22nd meeting, on 9 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review on Kazakhstan (see section C below). 
</p><p>305. The outcome of the review on Kazakhstan comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/10), the views of Kazakhstan 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/14/10/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>306. The delegation thanked the States that had participated in the review of Kazakhstan 
for their impartial assessment of the human rights situation in the country. Kazakhstan had 
accepted 121 recommendations, or 95 per cent of all recommendations made. It was not in 
a position to accept seven recommendations (1&#8211;4, 10, 12 and 19) in paragraph 97 of the 
Working Group report. The delegation reiterated Kazakhstan&#8217;s willingness to comply with 
the recommendations regarding the protection of human dignity, freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion, protection of the economic, social and cultural rights, and the 
strengthening of national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>307. The protection of parenthood and childhood remained a key priority of social policy. 
The delegation cited ongoing measures and new plans in several areas, including 
development, education, health care, law enforcement, juvenile justice, domestic violence 
and human rights education. The national human rights plan of action for the period 2009&#8211;
2012 and the Legal Policy Concept for the period 2010&#8211;2020, which were highly valued 
during the universal periodic review, would allow the continuation of the stage-by-stage 
implementation of strategies protecting all human rights.  
</p>
<p>308. The delegation referred to Kazakhstan&#8217;s intention to continue to adhere to 
international human rights treaties. Taking into account financial resources and a need for 
change in law and practice, Kazakhstan intended to ratify instruments gradually, the first 
step of which was the acceleration of the ratification process of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The ratification in March 2010 of the Hague 
Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 
would allow the country to cooperate with other States to protect the rights of children from 
Kazakhstan adopted by foreign citizens. 
</p>
<p>309. Kazakhstan would continue to accept regular visits from the special procedures 
mandate holders of the Human Rights Council in accordance with its extended standing 
invitation. It referred to the upcoming visit of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing.  
</p>
<p>310. The reforms in the judiciary and law enforcement system would continue, taking 
into due account the recommendations made during the review. The delegation referred to 
its plans and the steps taken to improve the penitentiary system and reducing the prison 
population. In April 2010, the Government had approved a separate plan of action to 
modernize legislation and law enforcement to prevent torture, and drafted a bill on the 
national torture prevention mechanism.  
</p>
<p>311. The delegation highlighted Kazakhstan&#8217;s acceptance of all recommendations 
regarding cooperation with non-governmental organizations, protection of human rights 
advocates and journalists, and the reinforcement of the role of the ombudsman. In that 
regard, the delegation shared the plans to, inter alia, introduce the draft bill on the 
reinforcement of the status of the human rights ombudsman to Parliament in 2011 and 
possible amendments to the legislation on public associations and, specifically, on the 
taxation of non-governmental organizations. The delegation also cited its continuous efforts </p>


<p><b>96</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>to protect the rights and freedoms of ethnic minorities and the targeted policy to support 
minority languages and ethnic cultures.  
</p>
<p>312. Kazakhstan would continue to expand and intensify its cooperation in the protection 
and promotion of human rights at the international level. The delegation expressed the 
Government&#8217;s readiness to share its experience and best practices with other States, 
particularly regarding issues on inter-ethnic and inter-denominational accords, the 
protection of the rights of women and children, and education, and to learn from the best 
experiences of other States. Kazakhstan expressed its firm intention to strive for successful 
achievements in sustainable development. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>313. Bahrain appreciated the steps and the measures taken by Kazakhstan for the 
implementation of the recommendations made during the universal periodic review. 
Bahrain appreciated Kazakhstan&#8217;s efforts reflected, inter alia, in its national human rights 
plan of action. It valued Kazakhstan&#8217;s commitment to continue its efforts to promote and 
protect the rights of children, to disseminate a human rights culture and to ensure education 
in human rights.  
</p>
<p>314. Algeria welcomed the additional information provided by Kazakhstan regarding the 
follow-up to recommendations made during the universal periodic review. It appreciated 
the Government&#8217;s commitment to promote and protect human rights, and highlighted the 
fact that half of the recommendations had been implemented by Kazakhstan. Algeria 
expressed its satisfaction that only one of the five recommendations made by Algeria and 
related to the ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Their Families did not enjoy the support of Kazakhstan. Having 
in mind the importance of the recommendation, Algeria encouraged Kazakhstan to protect 
the rights of the vulnerable population of migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>315. Uzbekistan thanked Kazakhstan for the comprehensive information on the 
recommendations made during the review. It praised Kazakhstan for the consistent steps 
taken for human rights protection, in particular for setting up national human rights 
priorities in the national human rights plan of action for the period 2009&#8211;2012 and in the 
Legal Policy Concept. Uzbekistan noted that Kazakhstan attached great importance to the 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights, including protection of the rights of 
women and children and the rights to health and education. Uzbekistan welcomed 
Kazakhstan&#8217;s efforts to, inter alia, develop international cooperation in the area of human 
rights. During its review, Kazakhstan demonstrated that it had developed national human 
rights mechanisms to address problems in this area effectively.  
</p>
<p>316. Pakistan noted with appreciation that Kazakhstan had accepted 112 
recommendations and that most of them had either been implemented or were in the 
process of implementation. Kazakhstan&#8217;s willingness to comply with the recommendations 
demonstrated the importance it attached to the universal periodic review. Pakistan 
appreciated the Government&#8217;s commitment to end gender discrimination, including 
domestic violence, and its readiness to strengthen law enforcement and the judicial system 
further. Pakistan highlighted Kazakhstan&#8217;s willingness to establish an independent national 
human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>317. Malaysia was encouraged by Kazakhstan&#8217;s commitment to pursue a non-
confrontational and dialogue-based approach in expanding its international cooperation in 
the promotion and protection of human rights. It appreciated the Government&#8217;s acceptance 
of a large number of recommendations, which demonstrated Kazakhstan&#8217;s commitment to 
strengthen democratic standards and to ensure respect for all human rights. It welcomed </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>97 
</b></p>
<p>Kazakhstan&#8217;s decision to accelerate the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>318. Indonesia appreciated Kazakhstan&#8217;s cooperative engagement within the Working 
Group, and commended the Government for its achievements in the field of economic, 
social and cultural rights and the remarkable results in education, health and social welfare. 
It also commended Kazakhstan for its efforts to modernize the judiciary, trial procedures 
and detention conditions. Kazakhstan should continue to pursue the total eradication of 
torture and the upgrading of all legislation relevant to the reform of the judiciary, to 
promote unrestricted freedom of the media and to intensify its measures regarding the rights 
of women, children and the disabled. An upgraded human rights commission would 
contribute to that endeavour. 
</p>
<p>319. Qatar welcomed the additional information provided by Kazakhstan. It noted that 
Kazakhstan had accepted many recommendations, including the recommendation made by 
Qatar. It welcomed Kazakhstan&#8217;s achievements, in particular the implementation of 
Millennium Development Goals, the enhancement of human rights and the improvements 
of the economic and social situation. 
</p>
<p>320. Belarus welcomed the detailed information provided by Kazakhstan regarding the 
recommendations made during the Working Group session. The universal periodic review 
had provided the Government with the opportunity to assess its successes in the areas of 
social, economic and cultural rights and the improvement of its national legislation and to 
identify areas that might require further attention. Belarus welcomed Kazakhstan&#8217;s 
determination to continue implementing universal periodic review recommendations. 
Belarus appreciated Kazakhstan&#8217;s readiness to step up measures to protect the rights of 
children, combat domestic violence and develop human rights education.  
</p>
<p>321. The United States of America commended Kazakhstan for the adoption of its 
national human rights plan of action and its plan to end torture by 2012, and encouraged 
Kazakhstan to implement both plans. It hoped that Kazakhstan would carry out, in close 
cooperation with civil society, the recommendations calling for the establishment of an 
independent monitoring mechanism to prevent torture. The United States appreciated the 
acceptance of recommendations regarding the protection of women&#8217;s rights, particularly 
through the enactment of the law on domestic violence, the rights of children, including 
children with disabilities, and the elimination of child labour. It reiterated its support for the 
recommendations calling for measures to ensure an impartial and independent judiciary. It 
was concerned that the Government did not see the need to decriminalize libel.  
</p>
<p>322. Iraq highly valued the Government&#8217;s efforts in preparing the national report. It 
highlighted Kazakhstan&#8217;s achievement in securing reconciliation among the ethnic and 
religious groups that peacefully coexisted in the country. It commended Kazakhstan for its 
economic growth achieved to reduce poverty and increase the prosperity of its citizens, its 
reform of public policies, and for having become a party to many international human 
rights treaties.  
</p>
<p>323. Norway noted that a significant number of recommendations had been accepted by 
Kazakhstan. The recommendations made by Norway regarding human rights defenders and 
journalists, fair trial, implementation of international treaties by courts and freedom of 
expression were regarded as implemented or in the process of implementation. At the time 
of proposing those recommendations, Norway was not aware of the advanced stage of their 
implementation and would continue to follow them up closely. Norway welcomed the 
acceptance of the recommendations to counter the practice of repression of free speech by 
easing the restrictions on web-based media. However, it regretted that Kazakhstan had not 
accepted to reconsider the rules for registration of religious groups and to take steps to 
promote interfaith harmony for those faiths considered to be non-traditional in the country.  </p>


<p><b>98</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>324. The Russian Federation welcomed the initiative of Kazakhstan to expand its treaty 
obligations in the area of human rights and implement relevant measures at a national level, 
and facilitate a constructive and non-confrontational dialogue on human rights in 
international forums. It noted Kazakhstan&#8217;s high level of cooperation throughout the 
process of the universal periodic review. Such cooperation was evident both during the 
discussion of Kazakhstan&#8217;s report in the Working Group and the Government&#8217;s response to 
the recommendations made by States. This was a sign of Kazakhstan&#8217;s decisiveness to 
strengthen respect for all categories of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>325. Human Rights Watch stated that a number of developments of the past four months, 
involving arrests and prosecutions of journalists, civil society activists and opposition party 
members underscored the urgent need for Kazakhstan to implement recommendations 
made during the review. It called on Kazakhstan to put an immediate end to the harassment 
of journalists and civil society activists and to implement without further delay meaningful 
reforms, as pledged by accepting recommendations made during the universal periodic 
review process. It welcomed Kazakhstan&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations regarding 
implementation of the national human rights plan of action, and urged the Government to it 
fully, including by allocating the necessary budget for its implementation.  
</p>
<p>326. The International Federation for Human Rights supported the recommendations 
made by a number of countries requesting Kazakhstan to protect the rights of migrants, and 
in particular to sign and ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. While referring to the violations 
found during the fact-finding mission in Kazakhstan, the Federation recommended that 
Kazakhstan ensure that the new law on migration, currently under preparation, was in full 
conformity with international law. It also recommended that Kazakhstan review the 
relevant legal provisions and practices with a view to ensuring strict compliance with the 
principle of non-refoulement. Since 2005, many Uzbek and Uyghur asylum seekers and 
refugees had been forcibly returned to the countries from which they had fled persecution. 
It indicated that some provisions of the regional agreements, such as the Minsk Convention 
and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, contradicted the principle of non-refoulement.  
</p>
<p>327. Amnesty International welcomed Kazakhstan&#8217;s support of the recommendations 
relating to strengthening safeguards against torture, and called on the Government to give 
immediate effect to those recommendations. It remained concerned, however, at the 
persistent allegations of torture or other ill-treatment of individuals deprived of their liberty 
by security officers, who often failed to respect current legislation with the requirement to 
register detainees within three hours of their deprivation of liberty. It also urged Kazakhstan 
to accept the recommendation to abolish the death penalty and to ratify the Second Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>328. Interfaith International indicated that Kazakhstan was a multi-ethnic and 
multicultural cosmopolitan society. It congratulated Kazakhstan on taking into account the 
recommendations made during the universal periodic review, as well as on the progress 
made with regard to the Millennium Development Goals. It noted the Government&#8217;s 
cooperation with special procedures mandate holders and treaty bodies, and the efforts to 
ensure the right to education and health. It encouraged Kazakhstan to establish a national 
commission for human rights in accordance with the Paris Principles, and to improve the 
independence of judges and the media. 
</p><p>329. Reporters sans Fronti&#232;res stated that, despite its chairmanship of the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Kazakhstan had not demonstrated any 
improvements in ensuring the press freedom. Independent or opposition press was 
frequently subject to excessive fines and closure. It stated that such forms of disguised </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>99 
</b></p>
<p>censorship were directed against publications that criticize the Government. The law 
promulgated by the President in July 2009 restricted editorial activities and freedom of 
expression on the Internet. Reporters sans Fronti&#232;res stated that there was also a restrictive 
law on protection of private life, which had drastically worsened conditions for 
investigative journalism.  
</p><p>330. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed Kazakhstan&#8217;s acceptance of the 
recommendations 39 and 40 in paragraph 95 of the Working Group report, and urged the 
Government to take steps to prevent HIV infection in prisons. It commended Kazakhstan 
for developing anti-discrimination legislation, and encouraged it to include sexual 
orientation and gender identity as grounds of discrimination. It urged Kazakhstan to apply 
international best practices, in particular the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of 
International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity to 
recognize the rights of transgender people to change gender and name in official documents 
in accordance with their self-defined identity. It asked Kazakhstan what measure might 
assist the Government to reach a favourable conclusion to recommendation 2 in paragraph 
97 related to joining the declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>331. The delegation stated that many recommendations made during the review had been 
included in the 2010 report on the human rights situation prepared by the national 
commission of human rights in close cooperation with civil society. Furthermore, the 
national commission had submitted a recommendation to relevant State bodies to take 
relevant steps for the decriminalization of libel and defamation in the media. The delegation 
also referred to Kazakhstan&#8217;s plan to establish a national human rights institution in 
accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>332. In response to the statements on cases of torture, the delegation referred to the 
Government&#8217;s decision with regard to the implementation of the Committee against Torture 
and the Prosecutor&#8217;s decision to initiate a prompt and thorough investigation in respect to 
individual complaints on cases of torture.  
</p>
<p>333. With regard to the reform of the judiciary, the Government was considering the 
recommendations to improve national legislation and practice in this area made by the 
national human rights mechanism and a number of countries in the Working Group. 
Kazakhstan had already established a judicial system that comprised three levels of courts, 
and all judges and law enforcement officials participated in human rights courses.  
</p><p>334. The delegation assured that Kazakhstan had taken all measures to ensure the equal 
enjoyment of rights of migrants. In December 2009, Kazakhstan ratified the Convention on 
the Status of Migrant Workers of the Commonwealth of Independent States. A new law on 
migration had been drafted and presented to civil society for its feedback. 
</p>
<p>335. In its response to statements on the freedom of religion, the delegation stated that, 
taking into account the recommendations made during the universal periodic review, the 
Government was working on a new draft law on religious organizations and freedom of 
religion and belief. 
</p>
<p>336. The national commission on human rights, with the active participation of 
Government agencies and non-governmental organizations, continued to work to address 
issues related to the protection of the rights of journalists. 
</p><p>337. Regarding gender equality, Kazakhstan was currently implementing a State 
programme on gender equality, with the goal of ensuring that 30 per cent of decision-
making positions were covered by women by 2016. </p>


<p><b>100</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>338. The delegation thanked the representatives of States and civil society for their 
comments and recommendations, and reassured the active cooperation of Kazakhstan with 
the Human Rights Council to implement the recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p><b>  Slovenia 
</b></p>
<p>339. The review of Slovenia was held on 16 February 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Slovenia in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/SVN/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/SVN/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/SVN/3). 
</p><p>340. At its 22nd meeting, on 9 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review on Slovenia (see section C below). 
341. The outcome of the review on Slovenia comprises the report of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/15), together with the views of Slovenia 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/14/15/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>342. Slovenia was pleased to address the Council on the adoption of the outcome 
document of its first review, noting that its commitment to the universal periodic review 
process had been demonstrated by, inter alia, the decision to have the delegation led by a 
person of ministerial rank. The preparation of the national report had been a comprehensive 
exercise involving all relevant ministries and Government offices, as well as civil society. 
Slovenia had viewed the process as an opportunity to take stock of its human rights 
situation; the dialogue had enabled it to compare its assessment of the situation with that 
made by other States Members of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>343. With regard to the recommendations made, Slovenia had decided to take them back 
to Ljubljana for consideration and to provide a response to each individually. Accordingly, 
the addendum to the report of the Working Group was submitted to OHCHR on 19 March 
</p><p>2010.  
</p>
<p>344. Slovenia informed the Council that it had rejected only 5 of the 97 recommendations 
made.  
</p>
<p>345. Regarding the rejected recommendations, Slovenia could not accept the 
recommendation to pass a law on domestic violence owing to the national criminal 
legislative system; in Slovenia, criminal offences and sanctions were defined by the 
Criminal Code and General Offences Act.  
</p>
<p>346. Slovenia could not accept the recommendation on specialized family courts, as it 
planned to strengthen existing family departments gradually and systematically at the 
district court level, and to facilitate the creation of new departments if the need was 
independently established by the judiciary. The introduction of new courts with sole </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>101 
</b></p>
<p>jurisdiction over family relations and children might result in new court backlogs and/or 
lengthy trials.  
</p>
<p>347. Additionally, Slovenia could not accept the recommendation to strengthen the status 
of the German-speaking community. The rights of this community were adequately 
protected by a bilateral agreement and a convention between the Government of Austria 
and the Government of Slovenia on cooperation in the fields of culture, education and 
science for the period 2008&#8211;2012. Furthermore, the rights of the members of the German-
speaking community, and in particular their rights to maintain their national, linguistic and 
cultural characteristics, were fully protected by the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>348. Slovenia could not make a definitive statement regarding the ratification of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, and noted this recommendation. Most of the rights contained in 
the Convention were already guaranteed by Slovenia to migrant workers and their families 
in its labour markets, in compliance with that treaty&#8217;s objectives.  
</p><p>349. One recommendation was not accepted, as it was considered unclear and 
contradictory. 
</p>
<p>350. Slovenia observed that many of the recommendations accepted were already being 
implemented. It gave the example of recent measures taken to improve the situation of the 
Roma community, in particular the national programme of measures for the Roma for the 
period 2010&#8211;2015.  
</p>
<p>351. A standing invitation had been made to the special procedures, and the first country 
visit, by the independent expert on access to safe drinking water and sanitation, had taken 
place from 24 to 28 March 2010. 
</p>
<p>352. Slovenia underlined the importance of a strong follow-up mechanism, and informed 
the Council that it had decided that the existing interministerial working commission on 
human rights, which included representatives of civil society, would monitor the follow-up 
to the recommendations. Another part of follow-up would be an analysis of existing 
institutional protection of human rights. The universal periodic review process had 
highlighted that some areas could be more efficiently covered, and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs had initiated a dialogue on how to improve institutional capacity for a more 
proactive promotion of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>353. Algeria expressed its appreciation at the acceptance by Slovenia of almost all 
recommendations received, which demonstrated the country&#8217;s commitment to the universal 
periodic review. It noted that two out of the three recommendations made by Algeria had 
been accepted. Algeria was encouraged by Slovenia&#8217;s determination to continue its efforts 
to promote and protect human rights, in particular those of vulnerable groups. It affirmed 
that, in this spirit, it would appreciate it if Slovenia continued to examine Algeria&#8217;s third 
recommendation in relation to the ratification of the Convention on Migrant Workers. 
Lastly, Algeria congratulated Slovenia on having pronounced itself in favour of 
humanitarian and human rights law during the consideration of Council resolution 14/1, 
thus giving priority to ethical values over political expedience.  
</p>
<p>354. The Islamic Republic of Iran referred to serious concerns expressed by various 
United Nations human rights mechanisms on a series of human rights violations in 
Slovenia, including the lack of a specific plan of action regarding human trafficking, the 
suffering of minorities, particularly the Roma, from prejudice and discrimination, reported 
cases of ill-treatment by law enforcement officials, and the trafficking of women for </p>


<p><b>102</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>prostitution. It also mentioned the recommendations that it itself had made. Iran invited 
Slovenia to elaborate on the measures taken to address the recommendations on developing 
a national plan of action aimed at addressing the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography; taking urgent and concrete measures to ensure the practical enjoyment 
by minorities, particularly the Roma, of their rights; taking appropriate measures to prevent 
and punish all forms of ill-treatment by law enforcement officials; and addressing gender-
based violence in a comprehensive manner, and combating all forms of trafficking in 
women and girls in Slovenia. 
</p>
<p>355. The United States of America expressed its deep appreciation for the conscientious 
manner in which Slovenia had approached the entire universal periodic review process and, 
in particular, the way it addressed the recommendations. It commended Slovenia for the 
establishment of the action plan of the interdepartmental working group against trafficking 
in human beings, and encouraged Slovenia to continue to strengthen its efforts to address 
that issue. The United States made reference to recommendations regarding the prosecution 
of sex and labour trafficking offences and the conviction and punishment of traffickers, 
including those involved in forced labour. The United States looked forward to receiving 
information on the progress in implementing the recommendations in this regard. 
</p>
<p>356. Iraq welcomed the efforts made by Slovenia in the drafting of its national report, 
which reflected Slovenia&#8217;s willingness to promote human rights. The situation of the 
protection of migrants and their integration into Slovenian society were positive elements. 
Iraq paid tribute to the efforts made to raise awareness of issues of human rights in the 
armed forces, police and law enforcement bodies. It expressed satisfaction at Slovenia&#8217;s 
national plan of action, which aimed to protect women and children during armed conflict. 
It wished Slovenia the best of success in its future work in the area of human rights and 
recommended the adoption of the report.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>357. Amnesty International welcomed the adoption of the integrated national programme 
of measures for Romani people 2010&#8211;2015, and called on Slovenia to ensure that the 
programme was implemented within the established deadlines and in consultation with the 
Roma communities. Amnesty International supported the recommendation to improve the 
living conditions of the Roma, and called on the authorities to address the inadequate 
housing conditions of many Roma, including the lack of access to water, sanitation and 
electricity. It was also crucial that the authorities refrain from the forcible eviction of Roma 
communities. The adoption of the law regulating the legal status of the &#8220;erased&#8221; was a 
positive development, however it was concerned at attempts to organize a referendum on 
the new law, which, if successful, could overturn it and could lead to further discrimination 
against the &#8220;erased&#8221;. Amnesty International also regretted the fact that the authorities had 
failed to take legislative and other measures to grant full reparation to the &#8220;erased&#8221;. It called 
on Slovenia to develop a reparation programme for the &#8220;erased&#8221;, which should include 
restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and guarantees of non-repetition, as defined by 
international law. 
</p>
<p>358. In a joint statement, the International Lesbian and Gay Federation and Federatie van 
Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie van Homoseksualiteit commended Slovenia for 
accepting recommendations 5, 6, 7, 8 and 22 made during the interactive dialogue, which 
included various measures to ensure that same-sex partners were treated equally to 
opposite-sex partners by Slovenian law. They encouraged Slovenia to continue its work on 
the draft family code. The two organizations shared the concerns of the Council of Europe 
Human Rights Commissioner, that homophobic and intolerant public statements had been 
made by some politicians during the discussion of the draft law. They recommended that 
the Government strengthen its existing efforts to counter negative public campaigns </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>103 
</b></p>
<p>through education and awareness-raising campaigns. They also urged the Government to 
consider applying the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human 
Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity as a guide in policy 
development. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>359. Before concluding, Slovenia responded to the additional questions raised. On ill-
treatment by law enforcement officials, Slovenia had accepted the recommendation made 
by Iran (Islamic Republic of), and recalled that the issue was dealt with seriously, although 
it was of the view that it was not a serious and widespread problem. It viewed this 
recommendation as a general and permanent one in the field of human rights protection, 
and observed that such cases occurred very rarely in Slovenia.  
</p>
<p>360. Regarding the Roma, Slovenia acknowledged the importance of the 1995 
programme of measures for assisting the Roma and the positive actions for the better 
integration of the community into society. Slovenia recalled the recent adoption of a 
national programme of action containing numerous measures to address this issue. 
</p>
<p>361. On trafficking, Slovenia clarified that anti-trafficking policies were part of the plan 
of action of the Interdepartmental Working Group against Trafficking in Human Beings, 
which focused on a wide range of communication activities aimed at raising awareness. 
Bearing in mind that women and children were the most vulnerable groups, the plan aimed 
to identify victims of trafficking and enhance prevention activities targeting these groups. 
Slovenia noted that women and children were the most vulnerable groups and therefore 
deserved special attention. It added that the plan also defined assistance and protection 
programmes for trafficked victims. One of the priorities set out in the plan was to involve 
non-governmental organizations to provide accommodation in safe houses and, in critical 
periods, to provide care and psychological assistance. 
</p>
<p>362. Regarding women&#8217;s rights, Slovenia affirmed that the situation was being constantly 
monitored with a view to the elimination of discrimination. Slovenia had adopted a national 
programme for equal opportunities for women and men. The Government also 
implemented various activities in this regard, and all acts of violence were criminalized. 
Moreover, Slovenia had been actively taking a number of measures to reduce violence 
against women. 
</p>
<p>363. On the question of the so-called &#8220;erased&#8221;, Slovenia recalled what was stated in the 
addendum to the Working Group report, that it accepted these recommendations in the light 
of the decision of the Constitutional Court in 2003 to the act amending the act regulating 
the legal status of citizens of the former Yugoslavia living in Slovenia, developed by the 
Government of Slovenia and presented to the National Assembly for adoption under a 
simplified procedure. It gave details regarding the act, adding that compensation claims by 
persons whose permanent residence has been terminated were dealt with by the relevant 
Slovenian courts under the general principles of compensation legislation, and that the 
Government was not drafting any special measures on this matter. Regarding a possible 
referendum, Slovenia could not provide details at this time, and it was uncertain whether it 
would take place.  
</p>
<p>364. In conclusion, Slovenia recalled that it was about to conclude its mandate within the 
Council, and that it has been a staunch supporter of the universal periodic review since the 
beginning. The mechanism had become indispensible in addressing the human rights 
situation in States Members of the United Nations, although the quality of 
recommendations and their implementation needed to be improved. Slovenia stated that it 
would continue to work hard to strengthen international norms, standards and mechanisms 
for their implementation, including the universal periodic review.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Bolivia (Plurinational State of) 
</b>365. The review of Bolivia (Plurinational State of) was held on 10 February 2010 in 
conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Bolivia in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/BOL/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/BOL/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/BOL/3). 
</p><p>366. At its 22nd meeting, on 9 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review on Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (see section C below). 
367. The outcome of the review on Bolivia (Plurinational State of) comprises the report 
of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/7), the views of 
Bolivia concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group (see also A/HRC/14/BOL/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>368. The delegation of Bolivia (Plurinational State of) valued the universal periodic 
review as a mechanism that allowed for the evaluation of the human rights situation among 
peers, in equal circumstances and with due respect for the universality of human rights. 
Bolivia had already indicated its position with regard to the 79 recommendations when the 
report was adopted by the Working Group. Bolivia reaffirmed its support for 78 
recommendations, and provided information on progress made to date, in particular since 
the experience in the preparation, review and follow-up to the universal periodic review had 
been, and continued to be, of great value.  
</p>
<p>369. The 78 recommendations were thoroughly reviewed by the national human rights 
council, which was composed of Government representatives and representatives from 
native indigenous peoples, social movements and non-governmental organizations. Many 
of the recommendations related to issues already reflected in the national human rights plan 
of action for the period 2009&#8211;2013 currently being implemented.  
</p>
<p>370. The delegation had distributed in the room a document with information on progress 
made to date with regard to all recommendations, as well as all its voluntary pledges and 
commitments. In this regard, the delegation highlighted the election of the Head of the 
Office of the Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo in May 2010 and the renewal of the memorandum of 
understanding for the extension of the mandate of OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>371. The Ministry of Justice was preparing reports due to be submitted to the Human 
Rights Committee, the Committee against Torture and the Committee on Migrant Workers. 
</p>
<p>372. With regard to recommendations on the judicial system, Bolivia (Plurinational State 
of) was committed to the full respect of the political constitution, which included all 
provisions with regard to the separation, independence, coordination and cooperation of 
powers. Measures to initiate judicial reforms were not isolated, and responded to the 
requests of the people, as reflected in the previous Constituent Assembly. In compliance 
with the relevant transitional law, the President had proceeded with the nomination of the 
judicial authorities, taking into account (a) that these nominations were to be made as an </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>105 
</b></p>
<p>urgent measure to address delays in the justice system, in accordance with the constitutional 
provisions and until the election of the magistrates scheduled for 5 December; (b) that the 
designated persons be recognized jurists without a political background, and be 
representative of the diversity of the population; (c) that the approval of the new judicial 
body be supported by all political actors of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly.  
</p>
<p>373. The delegation referred to the adoption on 31 March 2010 of the law to combat 
corruption, which also established a national council to combat corruption.  
</p>
<p>374. On 24 May 2010, on the occasion of the National Day to Combat Racial 
Discrimination, a draft law to fight racism and all forms of discrimination and racism was 
presented to the Plurinational Legislative Assembly. 
</p>
<p>375. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) announced that the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
would visit the country before the end of 2010.  
</p>
<p>376. In response to recommendations on the rights of children, Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of) was working on a plurinational plan for the communitarian development of 
children and adolescence with social inclusion and rights protection. 
</p>
<p>377. Lastly, the delegation made reference to the State&#8217;s term as a Member of the Council 
coming to an end, and highlighted its satisfaction for its involvement in the promotion and 
protection of human rights, in particular those of victims of discrimination and the rights of 
indigenous peoples, and stressed its continued commitment in this regard.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>378. Cuba made reference to the far-reaching changes made in recent years, which were 
aimed at making social justice and dignity a reality for all Bolivians. Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of) was advancing towards a society based on social equality, fairness and harmony, 
where discrimination and exclusion had no place among its peoples and nations. Cuba 
noted that the remarkable progress made in the effective enjoyment by all of human rights 
was an indisputable achievement. Cuba congratulated the State on its positive results and 
reassured it of its willingness to continue working together for the well-being of its people 
and all those aiming at achieving justice.  
</p><p>379. Algeria noted the positive response of Bolivia (Plurinational State of) to almost all 
recommendations, reflecting the importance that the State attached to the universal periodic 
review. Algeria expressed its appreciation for the State&#8217;s acceptance of the 
recommendations made by Algeria, and its satisfaction that they either had already been 
implemented or were being implemented. Algeria welcomed the additional voluntary 
commitments made by the State, particularly those related to the further implementation of 
the national human rights plan of action. Algeria wished Bolivia (Plurinational State of) 
success in the implementation of the recommendations.  
</p>
<p>380. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) referred to the historic roots that united both 
countries. Venezuela noted Bolivia&#8217;s presentation of the profound social changes with 
absolute respect for human rights. Venezuela reiterated its satisfaction with Bolivia&#8217;s 
openness and availability to dialogue. It also highlighted the acceptance by Bolivia of 
almost all recommendations, most of which have been already implemented. In conclusion, 
it encouraged Bolivia (Plurinational State of) to continue to consolidate the process of 
change in favour of its noble people, and reassured it of Venezuela&#8217;s committed and 
fraternal support for this endeavour.  
</p>
<p>381. Malaysia noted with appreciation that 78 of 79 recommendations had been accepted 
by Bolivia (Plurinational State of), which had started implementing a number of them. It </p>


<p><b>106</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>noted the openness and flexibility of Bolivia&#8217;s approach to the universal periodic review as 
testimony to its commitment to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights by its people. 
Malaysia referred to the significant challenges faced by the State as it strove to ensure that 
its people continued to reap the benefits from globalization and development.  
</p>
<p>382. Pakistan expressed its deep appreciation for the constructive role played by Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of) during its term as a member of the Council. It highlighted the 
State&#8217;s strong commitment by accepting almost all recommendations, and noted with 
appreciation that 67 of 78 recommendations either had already been implemented or were 
in the process of implementation. Pakistan also referred to the voluntary pledges and 
commitments made by the State, testimony to its genuine efforts to promote and protect the 
human rights of its citizens. It hoped that Bolivia (Plurinational State of) would continue its 
efforts and share its good practices to ensure economic, social and cultural rights with the 
international community.  
</p>
<p>383. Nicaragua thanked Bolivia (Plurinational State of) for its presentation on the work 
being carried out for the implementation of the universal periodic review recommendations. 
It referred to the State&#8217;s frank acknowledgement of all the work that needed to be done, as 
well as to its cooperation with the Council during its membership. Nicaragua referred to the 
common victories and challenges that it shared with Bolivia (Plurinational State of), which 
was an example of good practices for Nicaragua. It expressed its wish to continue to work 
hand in hand with the State to continue to promote and protect the rights of all.  
</p>
<p>384. The United States of America welcomed the State&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations 
on the independence of judiciary, the support for the rule of law and the more effective 
enforcement of the criminal prohibition of official corruption. The United States inquired 
about the specific measures that Bolivia (Plurinational State of) would take to ensure the 
full implementation of all these recommendations. It welcomed the State&#8217;s decision to 
invite OHCHR to establish an office with a broad mandate in the country. It was pleased to 
see that the State was implementing its national plan for the progressive elimination of 
child labour, and that the Ministry of Labour had been conducting verification inspections 
which were critical steps to address the problem of child labour. The United States 
requested more specific information on implementation measures. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>385. The representative of the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions in Geneva, speaking on behalf of the Defensoria del Pueblo of Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of), a full Committee member, noted that the assessment of the human 
rights situation in the country had enabled a broad process of dialogue between the 
Government and civil society, in compliance with Council guidelines for the preparation of 
the national report, which took into account the period 2006&#8211;2009 and the broad catalogue 
of rights as enshrined in the Constitution. Significant changes had been seen in social, 
political and economical policies, and the measures to recognize and guarantee the rights of 
indigenous peoples was a major achievement. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) was the first 
State to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a 
law and to incorporate it in its Constitution. It also had a national human rights plan of 
action elaborated in a participatory manner, involving civil society, and the work done with 
women, children and other vulnerable groups had also seen progress. 
</p>
<p>386. Amnesty International welcomed the focus of many States on Bolivia&#8217;s justice 
system, and that the reforms were currently being discussed at the national level. In order to 
ensure that these reforms addressed the pervasive culture of impunity and the widespread 
lack of trust in the justice system, Amnesty International encouraged Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of) to ensure that all new measures were underpinned by the principles of 
independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers, and in line with international </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>107 
</b></p>
<p>standards for fair trial. Amnesty International reiterated its call for increased transparency 
in the reform process, noting that this should include, for example, measures to ensure the 
participation of civil society, including indigenous peoples in consultations on proposals for 
a parallel indigenous jurisdiction. While acknowledging the measures highlighted in the 
national report regarding the exhumation of victims of enforced disappearances, Amnesty 
International encouraged the Government to make archives dating back to the period of 
military and authoritarian rule available. Lastly, it urged the Government to ensure that 
free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples was sought in relation to reforms 
that affected them. 
</p>
<p>387. Mouvement contre le racisme et l&#8217;amiti&#233; entre les peuples, in a joint statement with 
France Libert&#233;s and International Educational Development, noted that the first universal 
periodic review of Bolivia (Plurinational State of) had allowed them to become acquainted 
with the internal and external difficulties that the Government faced. With the adoption of 
the new Constitution, the national plan of action for human rights and the national 
development plan, Bolivia had entered a small group of countries which had put human 
rights at the heart of policy and Government action. Mouvement contre le racisme et 
l&#8217;amiti&#233; entre les peuples highlighted the organization of the Cochabamba conference 
following the failure of the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen, 
and noted that successes already achieved in several areas, such as the integration of 
indigenous peoples, minorities, women, education, health, nutrition, justice and the 
distribution of income from the national resources exploitation must encourage Bolivia to 
pursue these efforts. These successes should also encourage neighbouring countries to 
accompany these efforts rather than to undermine them. 
</p>
<p>388. The Indian Movement Tupaj Amaru noted that, following the taking of office by a 
party headed by a president of indigenous origin, the working class and the indigenous 
peoples had placed too many hopes in national liberation. In the period 2006&#8211;2008, GNP 
exceeded the 5 per cent per annual average, but the result of this economic growth had not 
been seen in everyday life. According to some non-governmental organizations, the 
extremely poor still account for 61 per cent of the rural population. In urban centres, 
poverty and begging were constantly on the rise. According to the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, more than 600 indigenous families from the Guarani people 
still lived and worked in slavery conditions, and were subjected to servitude relationships, 
which showed that the first indigenous president did not have enough power to end the 
slave enclaves in place in territories controlled by the political opposition elite, which 
governs in the regions. 
</p>
<p>389. Conectas Direitos Humanos and Coalicion de Mujeres de Bolivia welcomed the 
acceptance of recommendations relating to the rights of women and expressed appreciation 
for the progress made. With regard to the Bono Juana Azurduy concerning the reduction of 
maternal mortality, these measures should be accompanied by education and information 
policies in decision-making on reproduction. Concerning political participation, knowing 
that the National Assembly was dealing with the electoral regime, it was important to 
guarantee the effective participation of women. With regard to access to justice, there was 
concern that the rights of women in the regular legal system and in rural justice were not 
respected. Compliance with all rights of women and recommendations made during the 
universal periodic review would not be possible without drawing up budgets that are 
gender-based to assign more resources at the local, departmental and national levels to 
respond to demands from women&#8217;s organizations and urgent and effective attention to cases 
of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>390. Action Canada for Population and Development conveyed the comments of a 
coalition of 67 national human rights organizations. It stated that the accepted 
recommendations, as well as the voluntary pledges and commitments made by the State, </p>


<p><b>108</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>were very important. It noted as positive the recent extension of the mandate of OHCHR in 
the country. The recommendations should be implemented within the framework of the 
national human rights plan of action, and sufficient resources should be made available. In 
the area of economic and social rights, as recommendations were expressed in general 
terms, the State would have to set targets and goals. The organizations shared the view of 
the recommendations calling for the harmonization of national legislation with international 
human rights standards. It agreed with the importance of promptly restructuring the 
judiciary within the framework of the Constitution and guaranteeing its independence, and 
also that of other institutions dealing with the protection of human rights. The organization 
highlighted the disagreement about the means to ensure the eradication of child labour, an 
inadmissible exploitation, which would require providing employment to parents. There 
was also a need to comprehensively address the situation of street children. It regretted that 
the needs of specific groups, such as older persons and Afro-Bolivians, had not been 
specifically addressed. It also noted that human rights organizations would monitor the 
compliance with the recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>391. In concluding, Bolivia (Plurinational State of) thanked all delegations civil society 
representatives who had taken the floor on this occasion.  
</p>
<p>392. The national human rights council, with the participation of civil society, was the 
coordinating body responsible for the follow-up to all commitments made in the context of 
the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>393. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) was undergoing a process of transition with a view 
of constructing a plurinational State and building its own national identities. Although it 
acknowledged that much could still be done, Bolivia (Plurinational State of) was working 
towards an inclusive society without discrimination of any form and was implementing all 
necessary measures to improve the enjoyment of all human rights.  
</p><p>394. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) was a colonized country which was now working for 
the decolonization and the elimination of patriarchal structures, to include indigenous and 
women in political decision-making processes. The Government was pursuing efforts to 
ensure that women were represented in 50 per cent of all decision-making positions of 
Government. 
</p>
<p>395. Lastly, the delegation referred to the interconnection between human rights and 
those of mother earth, affirming that it was not possible to defend human rights without 
considering the environmental crimes of which all are victims. Changing the development 
model from unbridled capitalism to one in harmony with mother earth was a human rights 
obligation, as international law required States to take all necessary measures to protect the 
right to life. 
</p>
<p>396. Bolivia (Plurinational Sate of) reaffirmed its commitment to the defence of the rights 
of mother earth in the same way it was committed to the defence of human rights, and 
asked for the support of the international community in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>  Fiji 
</b>397. The review of Fiji was held on 11 February 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Fiji in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/FIJ/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/FIJ/2);  </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>109 
</b></p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/FIJ/3). 
</p><p>398. At its 23rd meeting, on 10 June 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Fiji (see section C below). 
399. The outcome of the review on Fiji comprises the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/8), the views of Fiji concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/14/8/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations  
and/or conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>400. The delegation of Fiji reported that, given the gravity of the recommendations 
received, a national consultation had been convened to ascertain the views of non-
governmental organizations and civil societies, to obtain an alternative view of how they 
perceive the recommendations, and to state how they would or could assist the Government 
in implementing some of the suggested recommendations. A further consultation was 
convened with all the relevant Government ministries and agencies that would be 
responsible for implementing the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>401. Special mention was made of the cooperative participation of two of Fiji&#8217;s 
prominent women advocacy groups, the Fiji Women&#8217;s Rights Movement and the Fiji 
Women&#8217;s Crisis Centre. The delegation recalled that Fiji, during the Universal Periodic 
Review Working Group session, singled out these two organizations, highlighting their 
refusal to participate in the consultations leading up to and during the drafting of Fiji&#8217;s 
national report.  
</p>
<p>402. Out of a total of 103 recommendations, Fiji had accepted 97 (94 per cent), and had 
rejected 6.  
</p><p>403. In relation to recommendations 1 to 7 on ratification, and recommendation 9 on the 
alignment of national laws, certain pertinent factors must be assessed before ratification to 
ensure that Fiji could meaningfully participate and fulfil all obligations. Hence, Fiji had set 
for itself a time frame of 10 years within which it would endeavour to implement all core 
human rights conventions. 
</p>
<p>404. With regard to recommendation 8 on the abolition of the death penalty in the 
Military Code, Fiji had removed the death penalty from its Criminal Code. The abolition of 
the death penalty from the Military Code was a matter currently under consideration. The 
death penalty under the Military Code had never been exercised in the past. 
</p>
<p>405. On recommendation 11, on the restoration of constitutional rule, Fiji had set for 
itself a time frame for the return to parliamentary rule. In accordance with the road map for 
democracy and sustainable economic development framework, Fiji would hold elections in 
</p><p>2014. There would be no negotiations on the time frame, and the Government was 
committed to fulfil all its reform agenda leading up to 2014. Fiji requested the cooperation 
of the international community towards this end.  
</p>
<p>406. On recommendation 12, Fiji was endeavouring to uphold and respect the rule of law, 
confirming that Fiji was not considering restoring the 1997 Constitution. 
</p><p>407. The Fiji Parliament was scheduled to be reconvened following the general elections 
in 2014. A call for elections in 2010 was impractical. Fiji had a legitimate authority in the 
Government under a new legal order, and the Government had total and effective control </p>


<p><b>110</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>over the country and continued to guarantee and protect the rights of its citizens; it would 
not reinstate the abrogated authority. 
</p>
<p>408. The delegation reiterated that the Government, through the enactments of various 
decrees, had endeavoured to ensure the protection of human rights in domestic laws. 
However, Fiji would not be restoring the 1997 Constitution, nor would it reinstate the 
judges and other judicial officers that were removed by the President in April 2009. 
</p><p>409. In February 2010, Fiji had announced that it would lift the public emergency 
regulation as soon as the Fiji media decree was promulgated. Consultations on the new 
media decree had been completed, and a new text, which had taken into account the 
suggestions received, had been drafted, and the new law was awaiting the cabinet&#8217;s 
endorsement. 
</p>
<p>410. Fiji would not revoke the Fiji human rights decree, as it was the only legislation 
ensuring the continued existence of the Fiji Human Rights Commission. The Government 
was committed to implementing the decree and to filling vacancies that continued to exist, 
mainly owing to travel restrictions currently imposed by a few of Fiji&#8217;s neighbours. 
</p><p>411. The delegation stated that Fiji would cooperate fully with any special procedures 
mandate holder wishing to visit the country, but stressed that Fiji preferred to receive 
requests prior to such visits. 
</p>
<p>412. The delegation added that any investigation could not proceed unless an official 
complaint had been received by the relevant authority.  
</p>
<p>413. Fiji had an independent and well-functioning judiciary; the reinstatement of judges, 
magistrates and other judicial officers removed in April 2009 would not be necessary.  
</p><p>414. The delegation stated that Fiji considered recommendation 90 not acceptable for 
political, administrative and security reasons.  
</p>
<p>415. Fiji saw the usefulness of the Human Rights Council processes, which included 
providing an opportunity for all States to declare what actions they had taken to improve 
the human rights situation, in their countries, identifying and addressing the challenges to 
the enjoyment of human rights and sharing information and good practices on how to 
overcome violations wherever they occur. The delegation also stressed that, from such an 
approach and perspective, the sovereignty of a State under review should be respected, that 
the culture and idiosyncrasies of the people of the State should be respected, that the stage 
of socioeconomic and political development, and constraints of the State under review 
should be recognized and understood.  
</p>
<p>416. Fiji was a very young nation undergoing a period of political transition. A better 
appreciation of Fiji and its history could certainly be an effective vehicle for marshalling 
wider support to address more urgent and pressing social human rights issues, which in 
many instances tended to be placed on the backburner, or completely ignored when 
discussing human rights issues of a Member State. In this connection, the delegation 
referred to such rights as the right of a child to have access to quality education, proper 
medical-care services and proper infrastructure. The delegation added that effectively 
addressing these social human rights issues would go a long way to creating a lasting, 
stable and healthy democratic environment. 
</p>
<p>417. The delegation reiterated that the political landscape in Fiji had significantly 
changed since April 2009, after the abrogation of the Constitution, and Fiji was now being 
governed under a new legal order. The Government had total and effective control over the 
country. The reality of the situation in Fiji needed to be understood to assist the 
Government in its efforts to put in place necessary legal instruments and vital processes to 
hold fair and truly democratic elections by 2014.  </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>418. The United States of America invited Fiji to provide further clarification as to why 
the recommendations, particularly recommendation 17, that Fiji considered impractical had 
been were rejected. It urged Fiji to reconsider its rejection of the recommendation of the 
United States, to ensure that human rights are explicitly protected in domestic law, 
including the restoration of the 1997 Constitution and the immediate reinstatement of a 
transparent and independent judiciary. It looked forward to information on the progress 
made to ensure that human rights are protected in domestic law, with specific regard to the 
recommendation that Fiji take immediate steps towards holding democratic elections. It 
welcomed the acceptance of ending media censorship and the repeal of the 2009 public 
emergency regulation. It asked for feedback on the progress of the repeal. It reiterated 
support for the creation of an environment conducive to allowing civil society to develop. 
</p>
<p>419. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged Fiji to 
implement the recommendations promptly. It welcomed the fact that some stakeholders had 
been consulted for the preparation of the review and hoped to see continued engagement 
with civil society in the follow-up to the review. It was pleased that its recommendations 
had been accepted, particularly those requesting that the interim Government instigate an 
open national dialogue leading to credible elections; that the public emergency regulation 
and any policy restricting freedom of media or the rights of freedom of association or 
movement be lifted; and that the administration should allow visits by special procedures 
mandate holders. It reiterated the need to revoke the Fiji human rights decree in order that 
the National Human Rights Commission could be allowed to conduct investigations 
properly.  
</p>
<p>420. Algeria stated that the cooperation and friendship between Fiji and Algeria would be 
enhanced by their recent agreement to establish diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial 
level. Algeria appreciated Fiji&#8217;s acceptance of most of the recommendations, including four 
of the five recommendations formulated by the delegation of Algeria. Algeria 
acknowledged the challenges faced by Fiji and reiterated the importance of the restoration 
of the rule of law for the promotion and protection of human rights in the country. It also 
highlighted that enhanced efforts aimed at tackling poverty would be needed for ensuring 
better living conditions for the Fijian population. 
</p><p>421. Morocco recalled that the objectives of the universal period review included 
cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights and strengthening the 
capacities of States, and called upon the international community to demonstrate 
understanding during this period of political transition and to help Fiji carry out the 
necessary reforms. Morocco reiterated its appeal to States to respond to Fiji&#8217;s request for 
support to implement the road map for democracy and sustainable economic development. 
It stressed that the assistance of the international community, together with the efforts of the 
authorities and the people of Fiji, would make it possible to tackle the underlying causes of 
political instability.  
</p>
<p>422. Canada was concerned by the overthrowing of the democratically-elected 
Government in 2006. It deplored the abrogation of the Constitution and the subsequent 
decisions by the interim Government to dismiss the judiciary, as well as the lack of 
legitimacy of the presidential decree. It welcomed the intention to commence a national 
dialogue process to return to democracy and constitutional rule, recommending that it be 
broad-based with political parties and civil society. Canada welcomed the acceptance of Fiji 
to repeal the public emergency regulations, and encouraged the establishment of the 
conditions to allow for freedom of expression, assembly and democratic dialogue. It was 
concerned by the plan to introduce a media decree.  </p>


<p><b>112</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>423. Amnesty International considered that the human rights situation in Fiji had not 
improved since the review in the Working Group session. It was concerned by the draft 
measures establishing a media tribunal empowered to impose hefty fines on journalists and 
editors and to imprison them for up to 5 years. It welcomed the announcement of the 
revoking of the public emergency regulations and the acceptance of the recommendations 
concerning discrimination and violence against women. It was concerned about the arrest, 
detention and charging of ministers and officials of the Methodist Church under the public 
emergency regulations. Amnesty International was concerned about the ongoing 
prosecution of human rights defenders, particularly Imrana Jalal, whose case it believed to 
be linked to politically motivated charges. 
</p>
<p>424. The Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom reiterated the need to 
restore democracy and constitutional rule and to put an end to media censorship and the 
intimidation and persecution of critics of the interim Government. While noting the efforts 
made to reduce violence against women, it stressed that such reforms must be made within 
a democratic process. In this context, it called upon Fiji to take immediate steps towards an 
inclusive national dialogue leading to early and credible elections and the return to 
democracy. It also called upon Governments to maintain their targeted sanctions against 
individuals responsible for the human right abuses in Fiji and deter progress in the 
implementation of the universal period review recommendations, particularly the 
restoration of the rule of law. Further, it called for the removal of the public emergency 
regulations and the restoration of the bill of rights.  
</p>
<p>425. The World Association for the School as an Instrument of Peace echoed many States 
in encouraging Fiji to ratify the core human rights conventions and to issue a standing 
invitation to special procedures mandate holders. It also stressed the importance of the Fiji 
Human Rights Commission&#8217;s conforming to the Paris Principles. It reiterated the need to 
end the public emergency regulations, the harassment of human rights defenders and the 
interference with the judiciary. It also highlighted the need to restore the Constitution and to 
repeal the media decree, and to hold an early election. It expressed support for integrating 
human rights education into the curriculum, and for Fiji&#8217;s participation in a future regional 
human rights body for the Pacific. It also encouraged Fiji to continue to participate in the 
Polynesian Talanoa process.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>426. Upon the request of the President of the Council, the delegation clarified that Fiji 
noted recommendations 13, 14 and 24. The delegation also stated that Fiji had accepted the 
first part of recommendation 17, but found it difficult to accept the second part. The 
delegation reiterated that a new media decree would be promulgated as law in the near 
future, and the Government was firm in its proposal for general elections by 2014. The 
delegation also stated that it could not comment on the case of Ms. Jalal, as the case was 
currently before the court. 
</p>
<p><b>  San Marino 
</b></p>
<p>427. The review of San Marino was held on 15 February 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by San Marino in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/SMR/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/SMR/2);  </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>113 
</b></p>
<p> (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/SMR/3). 
</p><p>428. At its 23rd meeting, on 10 June 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on San Marino (see section C below). 
429. The outcome of the review on San Marino comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/9), the views of San Marino 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/14/9/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>430. The delegation of San Marino indicated that, in February 2010, San Marino had 
accepted 11 recommendations and rejected 13 others, while 32 pending recommendations 
had been examined over the past three months. The relevant responses were contained in 
the addendum to the report (A/HRC/14/9/Add.1). 
</p><p>431. The Government of San Marino had examined all pending recommendations in the 
light of their applicability to the San Marinese context. In this regard, recommendations 
relating to accession to international instruments involved the acceptance of shared values 
but also the monitoring of their implementation and reporting to monitoring bodies. The 
last aspect presented difficulties owing to the extremely limited human resources in San 
Marino. 
</p>
<p>432. As a consequence, San Marino did not accept the recommendations relating to the 
accession to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance and to some ILO conventions. San Marino did not accept to 
accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families as it seemed to be incompatible with the features 
and legal order of San Marino. 
</p>
<p>433. San Marino accepted, however, to undertake to accede to the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict 
and to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and 
would notably include the crime of genocide in its criminal code. 
</p>
<p>434. San Marino also accepted to address the issue of timely reporting to human rights 
monitoring bodies, and would do its utmost to submit one report a year. The delegation 
added that San Marino was updating its legislation with particular attention to vocational 
training of all persons who dealt with health, social and educational services for ill and 
disabled persons, the elderly and children. 
</p>
<p>435. San Marino accepted all recommendations relating to children and was committed to 
introduce a new legislation to eliminate the concepts of &#8220;natural&#8221; and &#8220;legitimate&#8221; children, 
although no substantial discrimination was made in legislation between these two 
categories of children. San Marino agreed to amend its criminal code to abolish corporal 
punishment in all settings and to raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 12 
to 14 years. 
</p>
<p>436. There were some recommendations that San Marino was not in a position to accept, 
as further discussion was needed in the years to come. This was notably the case of the 
establishment of a national independent institution for the promotion and protection of </p>


<p><b>114</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>human rights, and of legislation on citizenship and naturalization. Regarding the latter 
issue, a draft law would be submitted to the Parliament in 2010. 
</p>
<p>437. The delegation of San Marino thanked all those who had taken the floor for their 
recommendations and comments, including those that would be made thereafter and would 
be reported to the authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>438. The United States of America commended San Marino for the conscientious manner 
with which it had addressed the 56 recommendations made during the Working Group 
session and for the detailed explanation provided on them, all of which were the reflection 
of the Government&#8217;s commitment to human rights. It especially appreciated the response of 
San Marino to the recommendations that the country should strengthen its protection for 
persons with disabilities, and increase efforts to combat violence against women. 
</p>
<p>439. Algeria commended San Marino for its commitment to the universal periodic 
review. It appreciated the fact that San Marino, in spite of the lack of human resources, had 
endorsed the recommendations by Algeria relating to the issue of overdue reports, which 
reflected its willingness to collaborate with human rights monitoring bodies. While noting 
the rejection of the recommendation to ratify the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, Algeria encouraged 
San Marino to ensure full protection to migrant workers by complying with 
recommendation 1737 of 2007 adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe. Algeria stated that it would have appreciated it if San Marino had accepted its 
recommendation on a national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p>440. Italy noted that San Marino&#8217;s commitment to the universal periodic review was 
further proof that the review was a fundamental instrument of the Council, since it provided 
a framework in which all States, large and small, could establish a dialogue with their 
peers. Italy noted with appreciation that San Marino had accepted many of the 
recommendations made during the review in the Working Group and that detailed 
explanation had been provided regarding all recommendations. Italy looked forward to the 
implementation of the accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>441. Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van Homoseksualiteit noted 
that San Marino was not able to accept recommendations 20 and 21, and called on San 
Marino to ensure equal rights and access to the same level of protection to people belonging 
to sexual minorities. It referred to the contradicting statements made by San Marino with 
regard to whether sexual orientation and gender identity were grounds of discrimination in 
domestic law. It asked San Marino to clarify whether and how discrimination against 
LGBT people was explicitly reflected in existing awareness-raising activities, education 
and training programmes. It recommended that the Yogyakarta Principles on the 
Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and 
Gender Identity be applied as a guide to assist in policymaking. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>442. The delegation of San Marino recalled that it would report to the Government on the 
debate. The universal periodic review was an occasion for a comprehensive assessment of 
the human rights protection and promotion, as (a) the State under review was called to 
critically consider the progress made, (b) Members and observer States of the Council 
mutually examined what had been done and what still needed to be done to improve the </p>

</b></p>
<p>national system; and (c) civil society had the privilege to observe the behaviour of the State 
under review, make its own assessment and suggest the interventions it deemed necessary. 
</p>
<p><b>  El Salvador  
</b></p>
<p>443. The review of El Salvador was held on 9 February 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by El Salvador in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/SLV/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/SLV/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/SLV/3). 
</p><p>444. At its 23rd meeting, on 10 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of El Salvador (see section C below). 
445. The outcome of the review of El Salvador comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/5), the views of El Salvador 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/14/5/Add.1).  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>446. The delegation of El Salvador recalled that of the 118 recommendations made 
during the Working Group session, 78 were immediately accepted, while 40 had been left 
for further consideration and internal consultation. The Government of El Salvador 
submitted a written response with its position regarding these recommendations (see 
A/HRC/14/5/Add.1). 
</p><p>447. The delegation indicated that El Salvador had accepted recommendations 1 to 19, 23 
to 26 and 39.  
</p>
<p>448. Regarding the ratification of several human rights instruments, El Salvador would 
abide by the constitutional provisions and competencies and proceed with a process of 
internal consultations, also involving civil society. Regarding the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Protocol was signed 
on 2001 and had been under consideration of the Legislative Assembly since.  Nevertheless, 
it noted that there had been an intense debate and opposition from some sectors to the 
Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p>449. The Government was taking steps to allocate the necessary funds to address the  
recommendations relating to children and adolescents (recommendations 20, 32 and 33).  
</p><p>450. The delegation also expressed its support for recommendation 22, on discrimination 
based on several grounds, since the Government had the intention of incorporating 
populations that had been historically marginalized. It also accepted recommendation 21 on 
the universal provision of identity documents.  
</p>
<p>451. Recommendations 28, 30 and 31, on the duration of preventive detention and prison 
conditions, were also supported by El Salvador. </p>


<p><b>116</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>452. El Salvador also provided comments in relation to the recommendations on the right 
to health (34, 35 and 36), and described the steps taken for their implementation. .  
</p><p>453. Support was expressed for recommendation 29, on criminal investigations and 
corruption, and recommendation 40, on migration legislation and recommendation 38, 
requesting the adoption of a national plan for land management.  
</p>
<p>454. The delegation explained that the Government would promote a wide national 
dialogue with all stakeholders regarding women&#8217;s reproductive health and the implications 
of the restrictive legislation on abortion (recommendation 37). 
</p><p>455. The Government had publicly acknowledged that there had been enforced 
disappearances during the armed conflict, with the direct or indirect participation of State 
officials. Furthermore, a national commission for reparations to victims of human rights 
violations in the context of the armed conflict had been set up. In this context, the 
Government would take into account the recommendations of the working group on 
enforced disappearances (recommendation 27).  
456. Lastly, the delegation reported that the Government was studying and consulting 
with relevant stakeholders the recommendations of the Committee against Torture 
regarding the prevention and punishment of torture and ill-treatment (recommendation 28).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>457. The United States of America appreciated the conscientious manner with which El 
Salvador had approached the universal periodic review recommendations and the detailed 
explanations it provided. It welcomed El Salvador&#8217;s support for several of its 
recommendations, including the enactment and enforcement of laws; the implementation of 
programmes directed at combating discrimination and promoting the rights of indigenous 
people; the development of concrete plans to control abuses perpetrated by gang inmates 
against other prisoners and to address the corrupt practices of prison officials; and reforms 
facilitating credible and responsible criminal investigations that respect human rights and 
for eliminating judicial corruption. It commended El Salvador for supporting the 
recommendations to ensure the establishment and full operation of a national commission 
to search for children who had disappeared during the internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>458. Algeria commended the Government of El Salvador for the quality of its national 
report, which had involved the participation of a number of stakeholders. It appreciated El 
Salvador&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and encouraged it 
to continue its efforts to consolidate peace, promote human rights and ensure that the events 
of the past would not be repeated. Algeria noted that two of its recommendations had been 
accepted and wished to hear again the position of El Salvador to a third recommendation 
relating to areas exposed to natural disasters (recommendation 38).

<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>459. The representative of the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions in Geneva, speaking on behalf of the Procuradur&#237;a para la Defensa de los 
Derechos Humanos of El Salvador, a full member of the Committee, indicated that El 
Salvador had made important commitments to the promotion and protection of human 
rights. He urged it to follow up on all recommendations exhaustively. One major problem 
in El Salvador was public insecurity. The representative urged the State to adopt adequate 
criminal policies and plans of action in this regard, and encouraged it to intensify its efforts 
to promote a culture of human rights, incorporating human rights in the educational 
curricula at all levels. The representative also noted that, during the presentation of its 
report, El Salvador had reported on the establishment of a national commission for </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>117 
</b></p>
<p>reparation to the victims of armed conflict. He congratulated the Government on this 
measure and recalled the recent recommendation made by the Committee against Torture 
on the urgent need to bring to justice those responsible for grave violations during the 
armed conflict, as well as to establish a special fund to compensate the victims. The 
Procuradur&#237;a encouraged El Salvador to conduct broad internal consultation processes, 
including civil society and the Procuradur&#237;a, with a view to the possible ratification of the 
international human rights instruments. The Procuradur&#237;a noted with satisfaction the 
voluntary pledges and commitments made by El Salvador with regard to the rights of 
women, and urged the State to comply with those commitments. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>460. In response to Algeria, the delegation of El Salvador stated that recommendation 38 
had been accepted.  
</p>
<p>461. In conclusion, the Government of El Salvador wanted to avoid any ambiguity 
regarding recommendations that, without being rejected, were subject to a process of 
consultation in accordance with its legal and constitutional framework. The delegation 
would have been pleased to say that those recommendations that are in the process of being 
considered or implemented had been accepted. In fact, this was the political will of El 
Salvador and the delegation hoped that the Council would consider this position as a valid 
explanation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Angola 
</b></p>
<p>462. The review of Angola was held on 12 February 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Angola in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/AGO/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/AGO/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/AGO/3). 
</p><p>463. At its 24th meeting, on 10 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Angola (see section C below). 
464. The outcome of the review of Angola comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/11), the views of Angola concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>465. The delegation stated that 166 recommendations were made during the review of 
Angola, which could be divided into three categories. The first category of 
recommendations related to international conventions. In this regard, Angola was pleased to 
accede to various international instruments for the promotion and protection of human 
rights. The second category related to special procedures and the request to issue them a 
standing invitation. The third category related to the Millennium Development Goals 
regarding gender, and the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  </p>


<p><b>118</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>466. Angola had lived through difficult periods in its history. The experience acquired 
from these periods had enabled Angola to begin a new cycle of which it was particularly 
proud. This was characterized by the adoption of a new Constitution, which marked the end 
of the period of transition and established definitively the idea of a democratic State that 
regards human rights as a factor for structuring growth and development.  
</p>
<p>467. The delegation stated that many of the concerns raised during the interactive 
dialogue and expressed through the recommendations were not only covered by the 
Constitution and the wide range of existing national legal instruments, but were also being 
implemented in the context of the various Government programmes, including the national 
strategy for combating poverty.  
</p>
<p>468. Although Angola had accepted most of the recommendations, it expressed 
reservations with regard to recommendations 36&#8211;39, 43, 44, 98 and 99. In relation to 
recommendations 36 to 39, all of which related to a standing invitation for special 
procedures, the delegation indicated that collaboration with the Council&#8217;s procedures 
mechanism and also with the working groups and treaty bodies stemmed from the 
undertakings already made, based on the idea that cooperation was needed if dialogue was 
to be deepened within the context of the Council itself. Angola had reaffirmed its 
cooperation at its re-election to the Council; however, this cooperation could not be 
established outside the limits inherent to the principles established by the Charter of the 
United Nations. This being the case, invitations to the special procedures mechanism of the 
Council should only be initiated when the related missions were designed to deepen 
cooperation and strengthen institutional capacity, when the special procedures mandate 
holders undertook their activities within the strict limits of their mandates, and when the 
visits were organized with the consent of Angola and the programme and timetables 
approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  
</p>
<p>469. In relation to recommendations 43 and 44, referring to cooperation with OHCHR, 
Angola had excellent relations with the Office of the Resident Coordinator in Angola. The 
delegation stressed that cooperation must be strengthened within the context of the 
undertaking made by Angola when it was elected to the Council, relating to the accession 
of international instruments, cooperation with procedural mechanisms and the submission 
of reports to treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>470. In relation to recommendations 98 and 99, the delegation stated that it was important 
to bear in mind that Angola&#8217;s legislation only recognized heterosexual and monogamous 
marriages. Additionally, the Constitution only makes reference to heterosexual and 
monogamous marriages. Moreover, there was no reference in Angola&#8217;s national law to the 
criminalization of homosexuality and therefore recommendations 98 and 99 could not be 
implemented.    
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>471. The United States of America expressed appreciation for the explanations given by 
Angola for its acceptance or rejection of the recommendations that had been made, and 
urged Angola to reconsider its rejection of the recommendation to decriminalize consensual 
same-sex activities between adults. It welcomed Angola&#8217;s willingness to strengthen the 
protection of journalists against harassment, attacks and arbitrary detention, and to establish 
fair and transparent media licensing procedures. It also welcomed Angola&#8217;s acceptance of 
the recommendation to consider a partnership in the Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative and appreciated Angola&#8217;s willingness to consider ratifying the Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol thereto. </p>

</b></p>
<p>472. Algeria congratulated Angola on its re-election to the Council, and welcomed the 
commitment of the Government to the promotion and protection of human rights, as 
demonstrated by the progress in the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. 
Algeria called on the international community to continue to support Angola in 
strengthening its achievements.  
</p>
<p>473. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea noted that, in spite of the difficulties 
and challenges following the devastating war which had caused tremendous damage, 
Angola had successfully carried out plans for reconstruction and stability while attaching 
greater importance to the promotion and protection of human rights. It noted that a series of 
strategies and measures taken by Angola in many areas had been recognized by the 
Working Group, and appreciated the commitment and positive efforts made in the area of 
the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>474. Cuba noted that, during the review of Angola, light had been shed on efforts made 
by Angola to fight discrimination, protect the rights of women, children, disabled persons 
and the elderly, and ensure the rights to health, education and work while reducing poverty. 
Cuba referred to the considerable progress achieved by Angola in promoting the full 
enjoyment of human rights by all persons. The activities undertaken were evidence of the 
commitment by Angola to implement the recommendations and develop plans and 
programmes to increase the well-being of its people. Cuba referred to its strong links of 
friendship and solidarity with Angola, and congratulated it on its achievements.  
</p>
<p>475. The Sudan noted that Angola&#8217;s commitment to promote and protect human rights of 
its people was reflected by the adoption of many human rights instruments. The Sudan 
underlined the efforts made to combat crime and trafficking in persons, consolidate peace, 
improve health, improve living standards, eliminate poverty and provide drinking water. 
The Sudan called upon the international community to cooperate with Angola to help it to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to reduce poverty. 
</p>
<p>476. Morocco noted the progress made by Angola in protecting and promoting human 
rights in the context of its human development strategy. Angola had accepted a significant 
number of recommendations, including those made by Morocco, on fighting poverty, on the 
reform of the legal and penitentiary systems and on human rights training. Morocco paid 
tribute to Angola for its courage and the efforts made to confront the political and economic 
factors that had a negative impact on human rights. It noted that Angola had accorded 
priority to economic, social and cultural rights, as demonstrated by its 2003 strategy to fight 
poverty. Morocco encouraged Angola to continue on this path, and called on the 
international community to provide support in this regard.  
</p>
<p>477. Mozambique noted that Angola had in the recent past, endured long years of war 
and, after the dawning of peace, had taken basic steps to ensure the creation of a political 
and social environment based on democratic values and principles that advanced and 
upheld respect for human rights. Angola had abolished the death penalty and eradicated 
arbitrary detentions. Mozambique also noted the introduction of a national strategy to 
prevent and reduce violence against children, and commended Angola for the relatively 
high percentage of women in political positions, one of the highest in Africa. It also praised 
Angola for its progress in the field of education, social housing and for its policy to commit 
the revenues from oil exploration to economic and social development. 
</p>
<p>478. Belgium noted the voluntary pledges that Angola had made in 2007, including one 
to accelerate the process of ratification of the Convention against Torture, which, 
unfortunately, had yet to be ratified. Belgium, which had welcomed the abolition by Angola 
of the death penalty in 1992, also expressed its hope that Angola would soon ratify the 
Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
Belgium thanked Angola for the information provided on abuses committed by the security </p>

</p>
<p>forces in connection with the expulsion of immigrants, noting that this issue was addressed 
bilaterally with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the participation of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It invited Angola to implement all 
recommendations as soon as possible and to provide an interim report before the second 
cycle of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>479. Nigeria noted that Angola had accepted most of the recommendations made during 
its review, and emphasized that this reflected Angola&#8217;s willingness to continue to engage 
with the United Nations system in the area of the promotion and protection of human rights, 
regardless of the numerous challenges encountered. Nigeria expressed its confidence that 
Angola would make every effort to implement its national plans and strategies in all areas 
of human rights in cooperation with the relevant bodies and mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>480. South Africa congratulated Angola on its achievements since the restoration of 
peace, noting in particular the initiatives aimed at reforming the judiciary and improving 
access to justice. It noted that Angola had adopted a Constitution earlier in 2010 and stated 
that the approach taken by Angola, which was rooted in the objective of consolidating 
democracy and the rule of law, would progressively enable the Government to fulfil its 
international human rights obligations. South Africa also highlighted the adoption of 
nationality laws, which ensured that no child born in Angola would be deprived of Angolan 
citizenship. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>481. Human Rights Watch expressed concern about the continuation of restrictions on the 
right to freedom of expression and on the rights to freedom of assembly and association. It 
was particularly concerned about the arbitrary and politically-motivated arrest of prominent 
human rights defenders, civic activists and Government critics in the enclave province of 
Cabinda. It urged Angola to urgently ratify the Convention against Torture, and encouraged 
the Parliament and Constitutional Court of Angola to immediately revise abusive national 
security laws. It was also concerned about an increasing wave of mass, forced evictions, 
without adequate compensation or alternative housing, and the Government&#8217;s practice of 
obstruction or unlawfully banning of public demonstrations against such evictions.  
</p>
<p>482. Amnesty International welcomed the acceptance by Angola of recommendations 
aimed at ending forced evictions, but noted that no investigation had taken place following 
the eviction of more than 3,000 families from their homes in March 2010, as a result of 
which 7 people had reportedly died. Amnesty International also called on Angola to ratify 
the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the Convention against Torture and the Optional Protocol thereto, the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It 
welcomed the fact that Angola had accepted the recommendations to ensure respect for 
freedom of expression and freedom of association, as well as respect for the work of human 
rights defenders, noting that this was particularly pertinent in the light of the Government&#8217;s 
refusal to allow two peaceful demonstrations in 2010, against forced evictions and alleged 
arbitrary detentions, respectively.  
</p>
<p>483. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme congratulated Angola on 
its efforts to consolidate peace and security since the signing of the Lusaka Agreement in 
1994 between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). It remained concerned by 
the violence, ill-treatment, torture and forced eviction of African migrants in a country 
which had received the support of all African countries for its independence. It noted that 
the 1993 law in relation to the press restricted the freedom and independence of the media. 
It called upon Angola to take appropriate measures to put an end to the stigmatization of </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>121 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;witch&#8221; children, to promote human rights education for law enforcement officers, and to 
create a code of ethics for the police forces concerning the treatment of detainees. 
</p>
<p>484. Organisation pour la communication en Afrique et de promotion de la cooperation 
&#233;conomique internationale (OCAPROCE) and partner organizations referred to 
recommendations and observations with regard to primary school education, and noted that 
the access of girls to school education was still constrained by social prejudice. 
OCAPROCE called on the Government to strengthen the promotion and protection of the 
rights of women and children, while congratulating Angola on its achievements in this 
regard. It also encouraged the Government to further pursue its efforts to ratify the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the 
Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>485. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, referring to recommendations 98 and 99, 
called for an amendment of the Penal Code and all discriminatory laws that may affect 
LGBT, as well as the decriminalization of consensual same-sex activities. It stated that the 
Human Rights Committee had noted that laws criminalizing homosexuality obstructed the 
implementation of effective education programmes in respect of HIV/AIDS prevention. It 
urged Angola to immediately repeal discriminatory laws, address stereotypes through 
education and promote media training. 
</p>
<p>486. Conectas Direitos Humanos, in partnership with 15 Angolan human rights 
organizations, highlighted the recommendations in the report concerning civil society 
organizations, and invited Angola to create a free working environment for human rights 
defenders. It recommended the protection of victims of forced evictions, the protection of 
the rights of the most vulnerable groups, the ratification of international instruments and the 
enactment of a law on human rights defenders. It stressed that special attention should be 
paid to poverty reduction, education and health care. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>487. The delegation emphasized that there was no law in Angola that criminalized 
homosexuality and there could not be a crime without the law. Since homosexuality was 
not a crime, Angola could not decriminalize it. 
</p>
<p>488. On the issue of transnational crimes, the Parliament of Angola had already approved 
the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and ratification was 
in progress. 
</p>
<p>489. The delegation confirmed that Angola did not accept recommendations 36 to 39, 43, 
44, 98 and 99. 
</p>
<p>490. The delegation stated that it had learned a lot from the universal periodic review 
process. The enhancing of Angola&#8217;s cooperation with OHCHR and civil society continued 
to be a vital factor in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>491. The delegation recalled that Angola had been recently re-elected for another term to 
the Council. Angola was a party to the main international human rights conventions and, in 
the near future, would be submitting its reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
the Human Rights Committee and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
Angola strove to live up to its commitments and was always guided by the principle that 
human rights were an important component of its economic and social development. 
</p>
<p>492. The delegation expressed its appreciation to Member States, the secretariat and all 
those who had contributed to a successful session. </p>

<p><b>  Iran (Islamic Republic of) 
</b>493. The review of the Islamic Republic of Iran was held on 15 February 2010 in 
conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by the Islamic Republic of Iran in accordance 
with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/IRN/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/IRN/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/IRN/3). 
</p><p>494. At its 24th meeting, on 10 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the Islamic Republic of Iran (see section C below). 
495. The outcome of the review of Iran comprises the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/12), the views of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/14/12/Add.1 and A/HRC/14/12/Add.1/Corr.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>496. The delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran acknowledged that the universal 
periodic review had provided a unique opportunity to review its country&#8217;s achievements, 
raise awareness about Iran&#8217;s practices and experience in the promotion of human rights, and 
listen to the viewpoints of States and civil society. Iran&#8217;s genuine intention in this process 
was to enhance national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>497. During the review, the delegation answered as many questions as time allowed. 
Some of them remained unanswered. The delegation pledged to carefully assess all 
contributions, and would respond appropriately where important issues remained 
unaddressed. 
</p>
<p>498. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran reviewed all the recommendations 
made during at the seventh session of the Working Group, and had submitted an addendum 
with reflections and comments on both the rejected recommendations and those that were 
pending. 
</p>
<p>499. The delegation recalled that, of the 188 recommendations made during the Working 
Group session, Iran had accepted 123, did not support 45 and left 20 for further consultation 
at the national level. The delegation referred to the addendum (A/HRC/14/12/Add.1) for 
further information. 
</p>
<p>500. The Islamic Republic of Iran made specific comments with regard to some key 
issues. The accession to international human rights instruments entailed certain legal 
processes requiring the participation of Parliament. In fact, Parliament constantly reviewed 
and evaluated accession to international conventions in the light of domestic laws; hence, 
the Government was not in a position to make any prejudgement or predictions concerning 
the outcome of debates by Parliament. This was also true when it came to amendments to or 
revisions of legislation. 
</p>
<p>501. Regarding cooperation with the mechanisms of the Council, the delegation stated 
that six visits had been made, within the framework of a standing invitation, demonstrating </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>123 
</b></p>
<p>Iran&#8217;s intention to promote cooperation with international human rights mechanisms. Iran 
had further consolidated relations by planning and conducting meetings and direct contacts 
with OHCHR. The Islamic Republic of Iran would accordingly prepare and draw up 
relevant mechanisms for interaction with special procedures. 
</p>
<p>502. The Islamic Republic of Iran viewed the universal periodic review as a forum for 
dialogue, cooperation and positive-minded engagement characterized by impartiality, 
constructiveness and accountability. A number of recommendations could not enjoy Iranian 
support owing to their contradiction with these principles. 
</p>
<p>503. The delegation concluded by emphasizing the significance of an interactive and 
cooperative approach in the promotion and protection of human rights as provided for by 
the Charter of the United Nations. In this sense, it looked forward to continuing close 
cooperation with the Council to realize the shared objectives of attaining greater global 
justice, equity, security and development through human rights for all. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>504. The United States of America stressed that the arrest of religious minorities had 
increased and seven Baha'i leaders were on trial for crimes against the State. It noted that 
Iran had rejected the recommendations to end discrimination against the Baha'i, and that no 
visits by special procedures had been made since 2006. It acknowledged Iran&#8217;s acceptance 
of many recommendation and called for their implementation. It recalled that 12 June 
would mark the anniversary of Iran&#8217;s contested presidential election and regretted the 
violent response against thousands of Iranians who had exercised their right to peaceful free 
expression. It urged the Islamic Republic of Iran to uphold its international commitments. 
</p>
<p>505. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland expressed surprise that 
the Islamic Republic of Iran had rejected its recommendation to ensure that allegations of 
abuse, including those following the June 2009 protests, were fully investigated. It stated 
that, given Iran&#8217;s confidence in its judiciary process and its rejection of torture, there could 
be no reason for rejecting recommendations to facilitate outstanding visit requests of the 
special rapporteurs on torture and on the independence of judges and lawyers. It noted the 
ongoing reports of discriminatory practices in Iran, notably against the Baha'i. The United 
Kingdom urged Iran to end juvenile executions, beginning by an immediate stay of them. 
</p><p>506. Norway noted that, if it had been able to speak during the review of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran at the Working Group session, it would have expressed concerns over 
freedom of expression, association and assembly, harassment against human rights 
defenders, and excessive use of force after the 2009 elections. Norway welcomed Iran&#8217;s 
acceptance of a number of recommendations, but disagreed that those rejected were 
inconsistent with Council resolution 5/1 and/or internationally recognized human rights. 
Norway could not accept the refusal to invite the Special Rapporteur on torture, since the 
prohibition against torture was absolute and Iran had issued a standing invitation. It called 
on Iran to implement its human rights commitments and obligations. 
</p>
<p>507. Kuwait noted that human rights were an area constantly being strengthened in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. Kuwait also noted the progress made as part of the universal 
periodic review process and the cooperation with human rights mechanisms with a view to 
meeting all the challenges facing Iran in economic, social and cultural rights, as well as in 
civil and political rights. Iran&#8217;s standing invitation to special rapporteurs to visit the country 
was a good initiative. Kuwait welcomed Iran&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations, 
particularly those concerning pursuing its efforts to improve policies and programmes in 
favour of the rights of women and young girls and protection of the rights of children, 
including disabled children. </p>


<p><b>124</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>508. China noted the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s acceptance of many recommendations 
and the measures being taken to implement them. China welcomed the many measures 
taken by Iran to promote economic, social and cultural rights, cultural diversity and 
intercultural dialogue. China noted Iran&#8217;s campaign against illiteracy, and the work in the 
areas of health, education and protection of social rights, and the significant progress being 
made. China fully understood Iran&#8217;s difficulties as a developing country, particularly the 
challenges concerning the promotion and protection of human rights. China was convinced 
that, thanks to the joint efforts of the Government and the people of Iran, and with the 
support of the international community, Iran would scrupulously implement the 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>509. Pakistan welcomed the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s resolve to accelerate its efforts to 
further promote and protect the human rights of its citizens. Iran had accepted 123 
recommendations during the Working Group session, which confirmed the importance that 
Iran attached to the universal periodic review process. Pakistan also noted that Iran had 
expressed its readiness to establish a national human rights institution in full compliance 
with the Paris Principles, stating that an early operationalization of such an institution could 
help Iran to improve its human rights system. Pakistan was confident that Iran would take 
all the steps necessary to ensure the protection of the rights of its citizens in accordance 
with its laws. 
</p>
<p>510. Algeria noted that the Islamic Republic of Iran had received 188 recommendations, 
of which 123 were immediately accepted, including three made by Algeria. In the spirit of 
the fraternity, dialogue and mutual respect that prevailed in the Council, Algeria understood 
Iran&#8217;s attitude with regard to the recommendations not accepted. It noted that, despite the 
difficulties faced by Iran in this transitional period, like in other emerging democracies, and 
despite the racial, religious and cultural diversity, Iranian society had managed to live in 
peace and social harmony. It highlighted Iran&#8217;s progress and encouraged it to continue 
along those lines. 
</p>
<p>511. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea noted with appreciation the policies and 
efforts of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran aimed at improving living 
conditions and at developing the sociopolitical and judicial system, which would enhance 
the promotion and protection of human rights of all people. It also noted that Iran had 
accepted a large number of recommendations, and had been taking a series of measures to 
implement them. Iran had been making progress in the promotion and protection of human 
rights in spite of all forms of difficulties and challenges, including the political pressure and 
sanctions imposed by foreign forces. 
</p>
<p>512. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) was pleased by the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s 
cooperation with the universal periodic review, highlighting the broad consultation 
undertaken for its national report. It noted Iran&#8217;s success in the review process, despite the 
difficulties it faced. Iran had been subjected to a siege by the most hostile imperial foreign 
power to repeated and unfair sanctions for political motives, under constant threat of 
aggression, and demanded respect for sovereignty and self-determination. It welcomed 
Iran&#8217;s replies and its support for most recommendations, highlighting its achievements in 
health, medical attention and social policies. 
</p>
<p>513. Cuba welcomed the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s engagement with the universal 
periodic review and the positive actions taken. It highlighted the strategic plan for 
development that addressed job creation, education, health, social security and the right to 
adequate housing and cultural rights. It highlighted the space allocated for culture and sport, 
as well as the access to primary medical assistance by more than 95 per cent of the 
population. It noted all achievements, despite the impact of unilateral coercive measures 
imposed on the country, and that its actions rejected its commitment to human rights for all. </p>

<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>514. The Baha'i International Community was deeply disturbed by the Islamic Republic 
of Iran&#8217;s rejection of the recommendations relating to ending injustice, persecution and 
discrimination. It noted the rejected recommendations 15 and 39 to 41, which called on Iran 
to stop discrimination, incitement to hatred and acts of repression against the Baha'i 
community. It expressed its regret that Iran had attempted to mislead the Council about the 
treatment of the Baha'i community. It also expressed concerns about the fact that Iran 
continued to have a partial reading of the right to freedom of religion, and to refuse to 
commit to measures that would put a stop to discrimination and persecution. 
</p>
<p>515. Human Rights Watch was of the view that the Islamic Republic of Iran had misled 
the Council by stating that it was implementing recommendations to investigate the post-
electoral violence of 2009. It noted that even if claims that members of the Iranian security 
forces were being tried in a military court for their abuses were true, the trials were being 
held behind closed doors. The security forces continued to arrest and convict individuals 
who allegedly participated in the post-election unrest, hundreds remained in prison and at 
least six individuals were at risk since their death sentences had been confirmed. It noted 
that Iran had rejected some recommendations by alleging that they were inconsistent with 
internationally recognized human rights, existing laws and Council resolution 5/1. Given 
Iran&#8217;s rejection of the visit of special procedures, it recommended that the Council remove 
Iran from the list of countries having issued standing invitations. 
</p>
<p>516. Amnesty International noted the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s rejection of no less than 
seven recommendations calling for it to facilitate visits by specific special procedures. 
Amnesty International also noted the continued imposition of severe restrictions on the 
rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly, which targeted students, 
journalists, political activists, trade unionists, human rights defenders and members of 
ethnic and religious minorities. It noted the reports of many people being subjected to long 
prison terms, flogging or death in grossly unfair trials, and executions carried out for 
politically-motivated reasons, and that these violations appeared to be committed by State 
officials in virtually total impunity. Amnesty International requested that, acting pursuant to 
paragraph 37 of Council resolution 5/1, an Iran-specific special procedure be re-established 
to address the compelling evidence of gross and systematic human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>517. CIVICUS &#8211; World Alliance for Citizen Participation and the Cairo Institute for 
Human Rights Studies considered the situation of human rights defenders in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran as one of the worst in the world. They listed five executed political 
prisoners and human rights defenders in jail. They noted that freedom of expression was 
severely limited. Since the 2009 elections, more than 170 journalists had been arrested, 
including two prominent female reporters. There were substantial restrictions on the 
freedom of association, with civil society organizations often experiencing pressure and 
restrictions that rendered them illegal. They called upon the Council to take decisive action. 
</p>
<p>518. Sudwind Entwicklungspolitik acknowledged that 123 recommendations had enjoyed 
the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s support. It noted that a national plan for human rights had 
been promised, and should be binding. The Parliament of Iran had ratified the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights before the Islamic Revolution, yet Iran had never implemented them. It 
noted Iran&#8217;s record in juvenile executions, and called on Iran to ratify the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Discrimination against Women. It highlighted the fact 
that Iran had accepted to establish a national human rights institution in compliance with 
the Paris Principles. Noting that segregated banks and universities were announced, it 
qualified &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; treatment of women as &#8220;gender apartheid&#8221; even worse than 
the current discrimination upheld in law and practice. </p>


<p><b>126</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>519. The Democracy Coalition Project noted the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8217;s rejection of 
the recommendation to grant access to special procedures mandate holders. It also remarked 
on Iran&#8217;s refusal to abolish juvenile executions, in compliance with the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, and its refusal to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Hundreds of individuals remained in 
prison on the basis of their opinions and beliefs, continued to suffer from torture, and were 
denied a fair trial. It stated that human rights violations, like those that occurred after the 
2009 elections, could not be condoned on the pretext of culture. It insisted that the Council 
establish a specific follow-up mechanism guided by paragraph 37 of resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p>520. The International Federation for Human Rights Leagues and the Iranian League for 
Human Rights highlighted the fact that the universal periodic review had reflected the 
appalling situation of human rights in Iran. They noted the harsh repression of peaceful 
protests, and supported recommendations to ensure an independent investigation into the 
aftermath of the elections, release persons detained for peaceful demonstrations, and ensure 
that those responsible were held accountable. Seven special procedures mandate holders 
were awaiting an invitation or facilitation of their visit. They regretted that Iran had denied 
human rights violations during its review. They expressed concern over Iran&#8217;s rejection of 
28 recommendations as being &#8220;inconsistent&#8221; with Council resolution 5/1 and/or &#8220;not 
internationally recognized human rights&#8221;. The recommendation referred to special 
procedures visits and protection of minorities, which were based on Iran&#8217;s pledges and 
international obligations. 
</p>
<p>521. Interfaith International, in a joint statement with Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense 
des droits de l&#8217;homme and the Al-Hakim Foundation, noted the considerable achievements 
made in the Millennium Development Goals and the positive developments in child 
custody, increased inheritance rights, the promotion of reproductive rights and the 
proportional increase in the literacy of girls. It also noted the mandatory and free education 
for children up to secondary school, and increased access for rural and urban dwellers to 
living necessities. The death penalty continued to be applied in political cases and 
disproportionately affected religious minorities. Interfaith thus urged the Islamic Republic 
of Iran to ensure that all minorities could exercise their rights free from discrimination and 
persecution, and to promote freedom of association, freedom of the media and increased 
political participation, particularly of minority groups. 
</p>
<p>522. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims stated that the promotion of 
human rights was a gradual process, and that there were areas where the Islamic Republic 
of Iran must work hard. Nevertheless, progress should not be ignored. In recent years, 
important developments had been seen in child custody, increased inheritance rights and the 
equality of women. An increase in literacy and higher education of girls was reflected in the 
fact that 68 per cent of the university population were girls, the increasing presence of 
women in politics and a change in society&#8217;s view of women&#8217;s capacities. It viewed cultural, 
ethnic and religious diversity in Iran as an example of tolerance. It also pointed out that 
talking about prisoners&#8217; statistics without context was not logical. 
</p>
<p>523. The Child Foundation, in a joint statement with the Organization for Defending 
Victims of Violence, noted that the sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran prevented 
business transactions with the country and had led to a complete ban on the sales of planes 
to Iranian airliners. It also noted that, in the past seven years, almost 23 per cent of the 
victims of air disasters were Iranians. It also considered that the Iranian pharmaceutical 
industry was indirectly subjected to the exposure of international sanctions against the 
country. It called upon the United Nations to take measures to remove the sanctions and to 
use negotiation and diplomacy, since sanctions against countries can have a negative impact 
on basic human rights. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>524. The delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated that recommendations that 
were partially accepted referred to legislation amendments that had to follow an ongoing 
internal process, the outcome of which could not be known in advance. 
</p>
<p>525. The delegation objected to some interventions during the interactive dialogue that 
were considered politically motivated. It recalled that, without being liberal or secular, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran remained a democracy that should be accepted by the international 
community. Iranian democracy was only 30 years old, but had achieved many 
accomplishments, which the Government wanted to further improve. 
</p>
<p>526. The delegation welcomed the engagement of civil society and mentioned that, since 
the revolution, more than 7,000 non-governmental organizations had sprouted in the 
country. It found some harmony between certain non-governmental organization statements 
and the positions of the Governments hosting them, and that this did not seem a mere 
accident. 
</p>
<p>527. On the issue of torture, article 38 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
explicitly banned this practice and regarded it as a criminal act. Furthermore, Iran had no 
objection to joining the Convention against Torture, with only one caveat, which was the 
fact that the Convention considered torture a legal punishment established by Iran&#8217;s 
legislation. The Government was nevertheless studying the issue. 
</p>
<p>528. The delegation concluded its statement by reiterating the standing invitation to 
special procedures, and announced that it was organizing new missions, including the visit 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, scheduled for 2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  Madagascar 
</b></p>
<p>529. The review of Madagascar was held on 15 February 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Madagascar in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/MDG/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/MDG/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/MDG/3). 
</p><p>530. At its 24th meeting, on 10 June 2010, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review of Madagascar (see section C below). 
531. The outcome of the review of Madagascar comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/13), the views of Madagascar 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group 
(see also A/HRC/14/13/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>532. The head of the delegation thanked the 24 countries that had expressed interest in 
the protection and the promotion of human rights in Madagascar during the seventh session 
of the Working Group in February 2010, when 84 recommendations were made. </p>


<p><b>128</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>Madagascar had expressed its support for 65 recommendations, rejected 2 and reserved its 
position on 17. 
</p>
<p>533. The above-mentioned 17 recommendations concerned the process of the solution of 
the crisis; the opening of an independent inquiry into the events linked to the crisis; the 
release of political prisoners; the abolition of the death penalty; the ratification of the 
Optional Protocols of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; eradication of the 
discrimination against slave descents and of the caste system; the introduction of a 
mechanism for the prevention of arbitrary detention; and the dissolution of special 
intervention units dealing with criminal investigations and detention. 
</p>
<p>534. Madagascar was aware of the dangers linked to the ongoing deadlock in the 
political, economic and social situation, and believed that the best way to proceed was the 
holding of free and transparent elections. Along these lines, a road map had been drawn up, 
setting up institutions for the organization of the elections and their schedule. 
</p>
<p>535. The electoral rounds would be prepared, organized and supervised by the 
Independent National Electoral Commission, an independent body composed by 19 
members chosen from representatives of civil society, the order of journalists, the Bar 
association, and trade unions of judges, civil administrators and political parties. 
</p><p>536. With regard to the recommendations on the establishment of an independent inquiry 
into the events linked to the crisis, the creation of mechanisms for the prevention of 
arbitrary detention and the dissolution of special intervention units, Madagascar provided a 
number of clarifications. 
</p>
<p>537. The procedures followed by the national judicial authorities had led to the 
identification of the alleged culprits of the crimes perpetrated during the events of the crisis. 
They were put on trial before competent correctional courts, and victims would have the 
opportunity to claim reparation for the damage caused. Bearing in mind that these 
procedures were well advanced, the setting-up of another inquiry under the supervision of 
the United Nations and the African Union, supported by international human rights 
organizations, seemed inappropriate. 
</p>
<p>538. Concerning arbitrary detention, Madagascar&#8217;s judicial system included a preventive 
detention chamber competent to decide on cases of arbitrary detention. On the dissolution 
of special intervention units, the delegation explained that arrest, detention and 
investigation were, according to the Penal Code, measures taken by various authorities, 
including judicial police officers and investigatory judges competent to decide on detention 
measures and on information acts in criminal cases. Preliminary investigations and 
hearings, detention and judgement respected the rules set by the law. The special 
intervention units had no authority to decide on detention measures or prosecution. They 
intervened, in a timely manner, when persons suspected of having carried out acts qualified 
as crimes or offences were arrested. 
</p>
<p>539. Since the conditions for the abolition of the death penalty and the ratification of the 
optional protocols to the covenants were not yet present, Madagascar would endeavour to 
take measures to achieve them. 
</p>
<p>540. With regard to the eradication of discrimination against descendents of slaves and 
the caste system, Madagascar noted that, historically, the country had not been a destination 
for slave trade. Therefore, it was currently impossible to identify those descents. Moreover, 
article 8 of the Constitution forbade discrimination based on origin and, as a result, all 
Malagasies were protected against all discrimination. </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>129 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>541. The United States of America welcomed Madagascar&#8217;s acceptance of its 
recommendation to define torture in its domestic legislation and to make it an offence with 
specific sanctions, consistent with its obligations under the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It also welcomed the 
acceptance of its recommendation to enforce the law on human trafficking. It encouraged 
Madagascar to accept the recommendations to restart the four-party Maputo process talks, 
with the goal of establishing an inclusive transitional Government that would prepare the 
country for free and fair elections and a return to democratic and constitutional rule; to put 
in place the transitional institutions described in the Maputo agreement and hold credible 
elections leading to the restoration of democracy and the rule of law; and to open a credible 
and independent process for investigating the deaths and the events surrounding the March 
2009 military coup. 
</p>
<p>542. Norway repeated its call for the establishment of the transitional institutions 
described in the Maputo agreement and the holding of credible elections, leading to the 
restoration of democracy. Norway would continue to follow the status of freedom of speech 
and freedom of the media, stressing that the media were crucial for ensuring freedom of 
expression. It regretted the fact that a number of journalists had been jailed the previous 
month, recalling that Norway&#8217;s recommendation regarding the freedom of the media had 
been accepted by Madagascar in February 2010. It considered these arrests to be 
inconsistent with that acceptance. While acknowledging the action taken to reinstate a ban 
on rosewood logging, Norway remained concerned about the lack of a practical impact on 
the ongoing unchecked plunder of the biological treasures of Madagascar. It considered that 
the universal periodic review recommendations, if implemented, would pave the way for 
progress, peace and security in Madagascar. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>543. Amnesty International welcomed Madagascar&#8217;s support for the recommendation to 
release political detainees, to cease arbitrary detention and to ensure a fair trial for those 
who were detained, and urged the Government to ensure its prompt implementation. It was 
essential that Madagascar give effect to the important recommendation to open an 
independent inquiry into the deaths and the excessive use of force during the peaceful 
demonstrations held in 2009. Journalists and media outlets had been targeted both under 
President Ravalomanana and since the High Transitional Authority came to power in 
March 2009. It therefore called on Madagascar to swiftly implement the recommendations 
to guarantee freedom of expression and assembly and to ensure that no one was arrested for 
exercising those rights. Since Madagascar had not yet abolished the death penalty in law or 
ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, despite their de facto moratorium on executions, it also called on Madagascar to 
introduce a de jure moratorium on executions and to abolish the death penalty. 
</p><p>544. The Indian Movement &#8220;Tupaj Amaru&#8221; stated that Madagascar was experiencing a 
political crisis, which was having unprecedented and dramatic consequences for its people. 
Approximately 500,000 people had become unemployed since the beginning of the crisis. 
Unfortunately, the de facto authority was defying the international community and focusing 
on a unilateral agenda. Since 26 January 2009, several hundred people had been killed, 
disappeared or been victims of arbitrary arrest. Recently, FIS, the political police of the de 
facto authority, which has no legal status, had stepped up arbitrary arrests, persecution of 
political personalities, religious figures, soldiers and journalists. It called on the States 
Members of the United Nations to support solutions and to align themselves with the 
resolutions of the African Union. It called for the unconditional release of political </p>


<p><b>130</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>prisoners and independent inquiries into all of the crimes committed since the beginning of 
the crisis, particularly those of 26 January and 7 February 2009. 
</p>
<p>545. The Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom expressed concern at the 
absence of a response from Madagascar to the recommendation to release all political 
prisoners, as well as its refusal to open a credible and independent process to investigate the 
deaths and events of the 2009 military coup. It also expressed concern at the lack of 
attention given to the events of January and February 2009, when reportedly up to 130 
people had died. Additionally, it expressed deep concern at the testimony of torture by a 
number of victims, whose accounts had been widely documented. The situation in 
Madagascar had not changed since the Working Group session in February 2010, and 
numerous serious abuses continued to be reported. Lastly, it expressed deep concern at the 
failure of Madagascar to comply with international human rights conventions, to recognize 
the Rome Statute and to implement the Maputo agreement. 
</p>
<p>546. The International Federation of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture 
noted with satisfaction the commitments made by Madagascar during the Working Group 
session. It congratulated Madagascar on having accepted the recommendation to take 
effective measures and to allocate adequate resources to ensure the respect of international 
standards in prisons, in particular regarding food, health and hygiene. It recalled that the 
conditions of detention in the country continued to raise concerns and could be considered 
to be equivalent to ill-treatment. Although the situation had improved in 2005 and 2007, it 
had seriously deteriorated since, in particular after the political crisis of 2009. 
Malnourishment was still the main cause of death in prisons. It encouraged Madagascar to 
take effective measures to prevent torture and ill-treatment and to limit the length of police 
custody. Lastly, it regretted the fact that Madagascar had rejected recommendations to 
abolish the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>547. The delegation of Madagascar stated that all recommendations and remarks made by 
States and non-governmental organizations had been taken into account. They allowed the 
identification of the country&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses regarding the promotion and 
protection of human rights. Madagascar reiterated its readiness to meet the challenge to 
continually improve its policies and programmes related to human rights, especially 
through the implementation of the observations of treaty bodies and the recommendations 
made by the Council at the universal periodic review. Madagascar acknowledged that 
shortcomings had been ascertained and, in order to find a remedy, it emphasized the 
importance of technical cooperation with international bodies, working in the field of 
human rights, understood as universal and interdependent. 
</p>
<p><b>  Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>548. The review of Iraq was held on 16 February 2010 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the 
following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Iraq in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/IRQ/1); 
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/IRQ/2); 
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/IRQ/3). </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>131 
</b></p>
<p>549. At its 25th meeting, on 11 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Iraq (see section C below). 
</p><p>550. The outcome of the review of Iraq comprises the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/14), the views of Iraq concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/14/14/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>551. The Government of Iraq expressed its highest appreciation to all the delegations that 
contributed to enriching the interactive dialogue when discussing Iraq&#8217;s national report. The 
recommendations and questions that arose during the interactive dialogue had permitted it 
to develop awareness for the universality and indivisibility of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>552. Iraq had taken measures to establish a national committee to follow up and 
implement the universal periodic review recommendations. The committee was composed 
of representatives of legislative, judicial and executive authorities, non-governmental 
organizations and the media. Iraq highlighted that it had agreed, in cooperation with the 
United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), to hold a national conference in 
September 2010 to discuss a draft road map for the implementation of the accepted 
recommendations. Iraq wanted the national plan to coincide with the national development 
plan adopted by the Ministry of Planning and Developmental Cooperation for the next five 
years. The projects included a wide scope for human rights in all Government institutions 
according to their activities and various tasks relating to human rights. 
</p>
<p>553. The delegation noted that the period covered by the universal periodic review report 
coincided with important legislative elections. On 7 March 2010, more than 12 million 
Iraqis had voted, that is, 62.40 per cent of eligible voters. They had elected 325 
representatives of 6,281 nominees, including 1,813 women across 12 large coalitions and 
167 politically affiliated groups. Of these seats, 310 were distributed among the 18 
provinces, in addition to the 8 seats for minorities: 5 for Christians, 1 for the Sabaii, the 
Eizidi and the Shabak, and 7 compensatory seats for the list that obtained most votes. The 
delegation also highlighted the representation of women in parliament as having reached 25 
per cent. 
</p>
<p>554. The delegation called on the President of the Council to delay the review of Iraq&#8217;s 
next report, to ensure that it would not coincide with the Iraqi election cycle, which took 
place at the same time as the review, since this could affect efforts to make a clear decision 
on its position to the recommendations that may arise from the next interactive dialogue.  
</p>
<p>555. Iraq emphasized that, despite the complexity of the situation and the challenges it 
was facing, especially while encountering terrorism, the Government was progressing 
towards enforcing the principles of rule of law and the respect and protection of human 
rights, which had been agreed upon and incorporated into the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>556. The delegation stated that the focus of the governmental system on monitoring the 
human rights situation had become stronger, and was part of a national active system to 
protect people from torture and involuntary disappearances. The system was supported by 
political will and an effective judicial system ready to bring wrongdoers and violators to 
justice. The delegation stressed that individual acts did not reflect Government policy.  
</p><p>557. Iraq referred to the adoption of procedural reforms concerning an electronic database 
of prisoners and detainees that would be published online on the websites of prisons and </p>


<p><b>132</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>detention centres. This was a procedure that the Government of Iraq intended to promote 
through transparent means. 
</p>
<p>558. After the universal periodic review discussion in February 2010, the Ministry of 
Human Rights and the Commission on Public Integrity, one of the independent bodies in 
Iraq, had signed a document of cooperation and partnership to enforce the United Nations 
Convention against corruption and the direct implementation of the national strategy to 
combat corruption in Iraq through a national plan, which would continue through 2014.  
</p>
<p>559. Iraq emphasized that its approval of most recommendations confirmed its positive 
approach to dealing with the various aspects of human rights. Some of the rejected or 
adjourned recommendations conflicted with the present political and legal circumstances in 
Iraq, thus the delegation suggested putting those recommendations on hold, even though it 
would continue to make considerable efforts to provide suitable grounds for their 
acceptance and implementation at the earliest time. 
</p>
<p>560. The delegation reported that the committee involved in writing the report for the 
universal periodic review had lost two of its members while performing their duties. The 
first one was lost in a terrorist bombing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the second 
after the Working Group session, on the return of the delegation. Dr. Thamer Kamel was 
assassinated on the second day of his return. 
</p>
<p>561. The delegation emphasized that, despite the delay in installing the new parliament, 
the relevant institutions continued to review legislations and regulations to make them 
compatible with human rights. Many existing draft laws are also to be proposed to the new 
parliament, as they are ready to be passed.  
</p>
<p>562. The delegation noted that the Iraqi reporting committees on treaty obligations 
continued to compile information to finalize their reports on time. The finalization of the 
reports would follow the same procedure as the one for the universal periodic review report. 
Drafts would be posted on the website of the Ministry of Human Rights for relevant 
stakeholders to make their comments. Reports would be finalized in the light of the 
comments received.  
</p>
<p>563. The delegation concluded by thanking national, regional and international non-
governmental organizations for their contributions, as they had had a significant and 
positive impact on the final report. The delegation thanked UNAMI and the United Nations 
working in Iraq and Jordan for their strong support for the Government, and the non-
governmental organizations for building greater capacity for the preparation of human 
rights reports.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>564. Algeria welcomed the importance given by Iraq to the universal periodic review 
recommendations and the consideration of the report, and highlighted Iraq&#8217;s achievements, 
despite the difficulties it faced. It noted that the majority of recommendations had been 
accepted by Iraq, which demonstrated its commitment to protect human rights. Algeria 
appreciated the acceptance of its five recommendations as part of its contribution to the 
interactive dialogue. It emphasized again the importance of national reconciliation and the 
support for national unity, and highlighted the importance of stability of the security 
situation, to allow its people to end the difficulties faced in recent history. 
</p>
<p>565. Saudi Arabia noted with interest that Iraq had accepted most of the 
recommendations and engaged in a positive manner with the Council mechanisms. Iraq&#8217;s 
cooperation with all human rights mechanisms and its readiness to pursue its international 
cooperation and positive dialogue on human rights issues clearly demonstrated its </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>133 
</b></p>
<p>commitment, despite its difficulties and challenges. The universal periodic review provided 
an opportunity to all to be acquainted with the efforts to develop human rights legislation 
and institutions.  
</p>
<p>566. Bahrain commended the positive measures taken by Iraq to implement all 
recommendations and its efforts to promote and protect human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and to spread a culture of human rights, despite the challenges, difficulties and 
security problems it faced. Bahrain valued Iraq&#8217;s commitment to take the necessary 
measures to empower women, enhance their role and participation in public life and allow 
them to occupy leading positions. The numerous measures taken by Iraq to promote and 
protect human rights reflected the political will of the Government to implement its human 
rights commitments.  
</p>
<p>567. The United States of America commended Iraq&#8217;s efforts to strengthen national 
human rights institutions, to promote a human rights culture and to incorporate its 
international human rights obligations within national legislation. It encouraged Iraq to 
establish and implement national human rights strategies and to complete the establishment 
of the higher human rights commission. It appreciated Iraq&#8217;s commitment to end 
intimidation and abuse of journalists, ensure accountability and respect and protect the 
freedom of expression. It was concerned about continued violence against women and 
minorities and welcomed Iraq&#8217;s commitment to protect them. The efforts made to empower 
judicial and other authorities to monitor prison conditions and investigate allegations of 
torture and abuse were welcomed. 
</p>
<p>568. Belgium was shocked to learn about the assassination of two members of the 
delegation of Iraq who had participated in the review, and the attempted murder of a third, 
and encouraged Iraq to investigate these events. Belgium was satisfied with the acceptance 
of 135 of 176 recommendations made at the Working Group session, including 2 
recommendations made by Belgium on the prosecution of abuses against minorities and the 
respect for minimum standards in the imposition of the death penalty. It regretted that its 
recommendation to introduce a moratorium to the death penalty had not been accepted, but 
congratulated Iraq for making voluntary commitments, and particularly for agreeing to re-
examine reservations to human rights treaties and to cooperate with special procedures. It 
invited Iraq to implement recommendations and to submit an interim report thereon.  
</p>
<p>569. Kuwait noted Iraq&#8217;s continued efforts to protect human rights despite the recent 
challenges. Iraq had suffered from a period marked by violations by the former dictatorial 
regime, which had also affected Kuwait. These included violence, imprisonment, torture 
and summary executions. Iraq had made efforts to promote and protect human rights by 
disseminating a culture of human rights and combating the scourge of terrorism. Kuwait 
was confident of Iraq&#8217;s capacity to establish democracy, good governance and equality, and 
welcomed its acceptance of many recommendations. 
</p>
<p>570. Morocco commended Iraq&#8217;s efforts to protect human rights and cooperate in the 
universal periodic review. This reflected Iraq&#8217;s commitment to ensure social cohesion, 
political stability and economic development and would allow the people of Iraq, within the 
framework of the country&#8217;s territorial integrity and political stability, to enjoy fundamental 
rights and overcome any challenges to the democratic process. Iraq had accepted most of 
the recommendations, including those made by Morocco in the areas of health, education 
and the return of refugees. Morocco encouraged Iraq to implement the accepted 
recommendations and, to that end, to seek the necessary assistance from the international 
community.  
</p>
<p>571. The United Arab Emirates stated that the acceptance of a great number of 
recommendations demonstrated Iraq&#8217;s commitment to dialogue with international human 
rights institutions. It mentioned Iraq&#8217;s important reforms, such as its willingness to apply </p>


<p><b>134</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>human rights principles and good governance. It noted the challenges faced by Iraq and 
praised it for the efforts made to consolidate development and enforce human rights. 
</p>
<p>572. Egypt noted with interest Iraq&#8217;s cooperation, openness and constructive dialogue 
with the Council. It commended the responses and comments made during the universal 
periodic review, which reflected Iraq&#8217;s political will to promote and protect human rights 
further, despite the challenges and difficulties it faced. Egypt commended the acceptance of 
most of the recommendations and the constructive dialogue between the Government and 
civil society concerning them. It also welcomed the voluntary commitments made by Iraq. 
Egypt called on the international community, and in particular the Council, to support 
Iraq&#8217;s efforts to achieve security and stability in accordance with the Iraqi people&#8217;s national 
priorities. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>573. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies welcomed the acceptance of 135 of 
176 recommendations, but noted the lack of improvement in the situation of Iraqi refugees, 
especially in neighbouring countries. Freedom of expression was increasingly repressed, 
and Iraq was one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. Moreover, 60 
per cent of Iraqis still lacked sufficient access to drinking water, and this situation, as well 
as other human rights concerns such as corruption, secret detention and torture, required 
urgent attention.  
</p>
<p>574. Mouvement contre le racisme et pour l&#8217;amiti&#233; entre les peuples stated that the first 
universal periodic review of Iraq had certainly not been fully objective, to the extent that 
established rules did not allow the taking into consideration of the human rights violations 
committed by the occupying Power, which was a violation of international law. It noted 
that Iraq had gained sovereignty at a high price; it was now a torn country in the grip of 
ethnic and religious conflicts. It referred to the broad margin that the Government of Iraq 
had to cover to improve human rights: ratification of conventions, cooperation with the 
Council, technical cooperation from OHCHR, and the establishment of a national human 
rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. It also expressed a positive 
projection with regard to the next four years. In this connection, it called on the United 
States of America, in the light of the inability of the Government to protect the residents of 
Camp Ashraf, to do so, in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
</p>
<p>575. Human Rights Watch commended Iraq for supporting most recommendations, but 
noted that the real test would be their implementation. It asked the Government to ratify the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of 
Punishment and the Convention on Enforced Disappearance promptly, particularly in 
promptly in the light of evidence and reports of widespread torture and abuse of detainees. 
Human Rights Watch called on the Government to fully implement the Convention on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Violence against women remained a serious 
problem and prosecutions were rare. Honour killings remained a serious threat to women. It 
regretted that the recommendations to investigate allegations of persecution based on sexual 
orientation and prosecute the perpetrators had not been supported. 
</p>
<p>576. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network commended Iraq for accepting the 
recommendation to end extrajudicial killings of persons based on their sexual orientation. It 
referred to reports of assassinations, extrajudicial killings, torture, threats and forced exile 
suffered by persons on account of their sexual orientation. It recommended that Iraq should 
adopt legislation to protect people from crimes on grounds including sexual orientation, to 
prosecute those responsible, assist victims, and conduct public education and awareness-
raising campaigns. It regretted Iraq&#8217;s rejection of recommendations to prosecute allegations 
of persecution based on sexual orientation.  </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>135 
</b></p>
<p>577. The Charitable Institute for Social Victims noted that the human rights situation had 
clearly improved in recent years. The Iraqi people, however, still suffered from insecurity, 
chaos and poor economic and social conditions as a result of terrorist attacks, internal 
conflicts, international sanctions and occupation. It asked the Government to pay greater 
attention to the most vulnerable and to improve the economic situation in order to reduce 
poverty and inequality. 
</p>
<p>578. Organisation pour la communication en Afrique et la promotion de la cooperation 
&#233;conomique internationale welcomed Iraq&#8217;s commitments to the universal periodic review 
and encouraged it to implement the recommendations. It noted those related to the fight 
against school dropout rates and illiteracy. It welcomed Iraq&#8217;s achievements in the 
promotion of human rights, particularly the rights of women and children. It encouraged 
Iraq to ratify the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. It welcomed the progress 
achieved in the promotion of gender equality, and encouraged Iraq to implement women&#8217;s 
economic, social and cultural rights effectively.  
</p>
<p>579. The Al-Hakim Foundation indicated that the human rights situation in Iraq had 
clearly improved in recent years, especially when compared with the situation before 2003, 
which was marked by systematic human rights violations. It noted that Iraq had accepted 
most of the recommendations, and hoped that it would reconsider those that had not been 
accepted. It invited the Government of Iraq to pay greater attention to women and children, 
especially widows and orphans, and to implement economic development plans to combat 
poverty. 
</p>
<p>580. France Libert&#233;s : Fondation Danielle Mitterrand stated that Iraq continued to suffer 
violations of human rights. It referred to the humanitarian urgency of Camp Ashraf, and 
recalled the recommendation accepted by Iraq to ensure that abuses against minorities were 
duly investigated and prosecuted. It noted the deadly attack of July 2009 on Camp Ashraf. 
It regretted that the Iraqi authorities had not only failed to curtail threats, but also appeared 
to encourage them. It urged Iraq to lift restrictions on the camp and respect the human 
rights of its residents. It also reminded the United States of its obligations under the Fourth 
Geneva Convention.  
</p>
<p>581. The Institute for Women&#8217;s Studies and Research referred to the situation of Iraqi 
refugees and asylum seekers who, since 2003, had fled to neighbouring countries, where 
many of them had become homeless, had no legal residency rights and or proper jobs. It 
recommended that the United States of America should implement a comprehensive plan 
and a coordinated strategy to solve the crisis of Iraqi refugees, which should include the 
option of return.  
</p>
<p>582. Verein Sudwin Entwiklungspolitik encouraged Iraq to strengthen the protection of 
minorities, journalists and human rights defenders, ensure free participation in a fair and 
transparent election, and improve the situation of Iranian refugees. It called on Iraq to adopt 
an effective and inclusive process to follow up on the universal periodic review, which in 
itself would enhance the protection of the population. It regretted that Iraq did not favour 
the abolition or reintroduction of a de facto moratorium on the death penalty. It encouraged 
Iraq to establish a national human rights institution and to ratify the Optional Protocols to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>583. In a joint statement, the Arab Lawyers Union, the Union of Arab Jurists, the General 
Federation of Iraqi Women, the Indian Movement Tupaj Amaru and the Educational 
Development and International Association of Democratic Lawyers indicated that major 
substantive recommendations had been ignored by Iraq, while the situation on the ground </p>


<p><b>136</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>continued to deteriorate. They were concerned about the number of death sentences 
following trials that did not meet international standards, the admission of confessions 
extracted under torture and the lack of independence of the judiciary. They urged Iraq to 
declare a moratorium on the death penalty, recalling that, in May 2010, 62 people were 
collectively sentenced to death. They raised other issues, such as the long delays in 
charging detainees, the denial of the right of effective defence, the widespread and 
systematic use of torture in secrete and known centres, and the lack of response to requests 
for visits by special procedures mandate holders.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>584. Given that the delegation was not in a position to provide a clear answer to a number 
of pending recommendations, the President of the Council, in accordance with Council 
resolution 5/1, invited the delegation to either support or note the recommendations. The 
delegation confirmed its inability to take a clear position on a number of recommendations 
and thus took note of them.  
</p>
<p>585. The delegation of Iraq expressed its gratitude to all delegations and non-
governmental organizations that had made statements. It confirmed that there was 
determination supported by an objective vision to make substantive progress in the next 
four years, especially once the independent commission for human rights had been formed. 
It pledged that its work would be independent and professional, and have an integrated 
approach. It promised that the recommendations would be taken seriously, and that 
effective policies would be drawn up to implement all accepted recommendations. It 
thanked the President of the Council and all Member States for the great efforts made to 
hold this dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b>  Gambia 
</b></p>
<p>586. The review of the Gambia was held on 10 February 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Gambia in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/GMB/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/GMB/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/GMB/3). 
</p><p>587. At its 25th meeting, on 11 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of the Gambia (see section C below). 
588. The outcome of the review of the Gambia comprises the report of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/6), the views of the Gambia 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and 
replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues 
that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>589. The head of the delegation stated that the Gambia had been given the opportunity to 
provide an update on the follow-up measures taken after a successful interactive session 
with the Working Group in February 2010. The Gambia was presented with 141 
recommendations, 61 of which were accepted, 30 rejected and 50 deferred for a response </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>137 
</b></p>
<p>during the current session of the Council. The 50 recommendations that were deferred had 
been considered at the national level, and the delegation wished to report to the Council 
thereon. 
</p>
<p>590. Recommendations 1 to 8 under paragraph 99 of the report (A/HRC/14/6) called on 
the Gambia to ratify or accede to the main human rights instruments, namely the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International 
Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>591. The delegation stated that the ratification process of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities was far advanced, as this treaty was in line with the constitutional 
protection provided to persons with disabilities in the Gambia. The Gambia was also 
considering the list of human rights instruments and would endeavour to ratify or accede to 
them. It therefore hoped to engage the international community and the treaty bodies for 
technical assistance in this area. With regard to the two Optional Protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, as reported in February 2010, the protocols had been 
ratified in April 2008 by the National Assembly and the instruments of ratification had been 
sent to the United Nations Headquarters to be deposited. 
</p>
<p>592. Recommendations 9 to 14, 40 and 43 dealt with the need to enact legislation and to 
set up mechanisms and structures to promote and protect women&#8217;s rights in line with the 
Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and other international 
legal instruments, especially the protection against all forms of violence. To demonstrate 
the Gambia&#8217;s commitment to women&#8217;s rights, the Women&#8217;s Bill 2009 was enacted in April 
2010, incorporating the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights on 
the rights of women in Africa. In addition, several other measures were being taken to 
promote women&#8217;s rights and children. They included the validation of the national gender 
and women empowerment policy in May 2010, which had an entire section dealing with 
measures and strategies to eradicate violence against women and gender-based violence. 
The strategies of the policy included a national study on the gender-based violence, to be 
conducted in 2010 and supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 
After the study, a national programme would be developed and supported by UNDP. Key 
institutions would be strengthened to keep proper records on gender-based violence, and 
supported by UNDP. The laws of the Gambia would also be reviewed, with a view to 
formulate a separate and comprehensive bill on gender-based violence. Women leaders 
would be trained on their roles and responsibilities, leadership and conflict resolution. The 
strategy further involved a review of laws, with a view to fully harmonize all international, 
regional and national commitments on the promotion, protection and empowerment of 
women. 
</p>
<p>593. The recommendations on female genital mutilation (28&#8211;30, 40&#8211;42 and 44) were 
discussed with key stakeholders, such as National Assembly members, religious leaders and 
women&#8217;s leaders. The outcome of the consultations revealed that legislation was not the 
answer now, although there was an urgent need for continued public education on the 
dangers of this practice and for a national study. Subsequently, a national steering 
committee had been set-up to review the WSU Kafo study to determine if it could be used </p>


<p><b>138</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>as evidence or whether there is a need for a new clinical and empirical study. A social study 
on female genital mutilation was also being conducted and supported by UNICEF; an 
education programme on gender and religion would also be launched soon.  
</p>
<p>594. With respect to recommendation 15, the Gambia reported that there were laws 
already in place to protect children against violence and abuse of all forms. Efforts were 
also being made through the Department of Social Welfare to sensitize communities and 
institutions on child protection and the use of alternative disciplinary measures for children, 
with a view to involve them in promoting these alternative measures. Similarly, a training 
manual on alternative disciplinary measures had been developed and introduced in teacher 
training college curriculum. The Child Protection Alliance, a locally-based civil society 
organization, was also working in partnership with the Government and communities to 
sensitize them on the promotion of alternative disciplinary measures for children.  
</p>
<p>595. On the issue of juvenile justice, the Government of the Gambia was concerned, as 
the Children&#8217;s Act 2005 clearly provided for the adequate protection of children in conflict 
with the law. The Government, through the Ministry of the Interior, had identified sites 
where new corrective centres for child offenders would be built. Currently, there was a 
separate juvenile wing in one of the prisons, completely isolated from the main prison 
camp, and some basic structures had been put in place to make it child-friendly. Social 
workers at the Department of Social Welfare conducted regular visits to the wing to provide 
counselling and other services, to bring parents into contact with their children, and ensured 
a sustained and well-defined reintegration programme. Children had access to basic 
education and skills training. Training manuals on juvenile justice had been developed by 
the police and prison training schools. The after-arrest procedures, developed for the police, 
were being reviewed, and the special rules of procedure for the Children&#8217;s Court had been 
validated in April 2010.  
</p>
<p>596. There were recommendations for the establishment of a national human rights 
commission (16&#8211;19). The possibility of having a separate body, or of expanding the 
mandate of the Office of the Ombudsman, was being looked into. The Gambia looked 
forward to working with international and regional bodies for technical assistance in this 
area.  
</p>
<p>597. The National Council for Civic Education was an institution established under the 
Constitution. It enjoyed its independence, but owing to its limited financial resources, the 
Gambia had approached UNDP and other international donors to assist in this regard. 
</p>
<p>598.  Regarding the timelines for submitting overdue reports, as highlighted in 
recommendations 21 and 22, the delegation reported that in view of the serious capacity 
and financial constraints, the Gambia would endeavour, in the next years (subject to the 
technical and financial assistance of United Nations human rights bodies and the 
international community) to submit all pending reports. 
</p><p>599. The Gambia was also committed to cooperating with the special procedures mandate 
holders and would therefore treat with utmost urgency any request for invitations by them. 
Such cooperation had been established with the African Union and with many international 
and civil society organizations (recommendations 22&#8211;27). 
600. Recommendations 33 to 35 called for the establishment of a moratorium on the 
death penalty, ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, a review of the Constitution and the abolition of death penalty. 
There was already a moratorium on the death penalty since 1995, when it was reintroduced; 
all prisoners sentenced to death were serving life imprisonment terms and none had been 
executed. However, it does not intend to abolish the death penalty, now or any time soon. It 
was a punishment meant for very serious crimes only, with adequate guarantees for the 
application of due process. </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>139 
</b></p>
<p>601. With respect to recommendations 36 to 38, the delegation stated that the 1997 
Constitution clearly guaranteed the right not to be tortured and protection against unlawful 
arrests and detention. The challenge was how to implement these laws effectively. The 
Gambia was therefore committed to the protection of these rights, and efforts were being 
made to overcome this challenge. A human rights unit had been established to register 
complaints of such violations by security agents. Any complaints were investigated and the 
culprits dealt with accordingly. A human rights training component had also been 
introduced into the police training curriculum. The Ministry of the Interior and the Office of 
the Inspector-General of Police also worked in collaboration with other stakeholders to 
strengthen the capacity of the police with a view to improve the level of professionalism in 
the execution of their duties. 
</p>
<p>602. Concerning recommendation 47, an investigation was ongoing. However, the 
challenge faced by the investigators was that the two key witnesses were outside 
jurisdiction and all efforts to reach them had proved futile. The Gambia welcomed the 
assistance of the international community to enable it to close the investigation as soon as 
possible. The findings of the investigation would be made public once it had been 
concluded. 
</p>
<p>603. The independence of the judiciary was guaranteed by the Constitution, as indicated 
in paragraph 61 of the report of the Working Group, and paragraphs 36 to 38 of the national 
report. To ensure that those guarantees were strengthened, a code of conduct had been 
enacted for judicial officers for the first time, in 2009. The conditions of service and 
remuneration had also been improved tremendously during the 2008/2009 budget year. 
Thus, recommendations 44 and 45 were already being implemented.  
</p>
<p>604. Similarly, the rights and activities of human rights defenders were recognized and 
protected by law. This was manifested by the uninterrupted operations of the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, for more than two decades, the African Centre 
for Democracy and Human Rights Studies, and the Institute for Human Rights and 
Democracy in Africa, to name a few. Thus recommendations 48 and 49 were already being 
implemented; the allegation of lack of protection of human rights defenders was unfounded.  
</p>
<p>605. Recommendation 50 was also being implemented. Under the Education for All and 
the Fast Track initiatives, the Gambia was one of the leading African countries to lead in 
the Millennium Development Goals with respect to free primary school enrolment and 
gender parity. However, providing access to free education to all at all levels of education 
was a long-term process that could only be achieved progressively, on the basis of the 
availability of resources, and would need the intervention and assistance of the international 
community. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>606. Senegal recalled that, in February 2010, it had expressed its appreciation for the will 
of the Gambia to continue efforts to protect and promote human rights. In the light of the 
numbers of recommendations accepted by the Gambia, Senegal renewed its appreciation 
and encouraged the State to spare no effort to implement these recommendations. Senegal 
expressed its will to support the Gambia in this regard. 
</p>
<p>607. Algeria very much appreciated the acceptance by the Gambia in February 2010 of 
three of its recommendations, as well as the acceptance of the fourth recommendation it had 
made relating to the strengthening of the institutional human rights framework. Algeria 
welcomed the remarkable progress achieved by the Gambia in considering the 50 
recommendations pending. Algeria commended the Gambia for its participation in the 
universal periodic review despite the lack of financial and material resources; this was a </p>


<p><b>140</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>clear signal of its commitment to human rights. Assistance from the international 
community was crucial for the Gambia. 
</p>
<p>608. The United States of America thanked the Gambia for having accepted 61 
recommendations, including that made by the United States regarding trafficking in 
persons. The United States however urged the Gambia to reconsider its decision not to 
support other recommendations, including the one relating to the fight against violence 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and to decriminalize sexual activity 
between consenting adults. 
</p>
<p>609. Nigeria congratulated the Government of the Gambia for its active participation in 
the universal periodic review process, an indication of its readiness to continue to engage 
with the United Nations human rights system. Nigeria commended the fact that the Gambia 
was completing arrangements for the establishment of a national human rights institution. It 
recognized the challenges faced by the country and encouraged the Government not to 
relent in its efforts, but see to the implementation of the recommendations accepted as a 
means of improving the enjoyment of human rights by its people. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>610. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network referred to the criminalization of 
consensual same-sex conduct in domestic law, punishable to up to 14 years of prison. The 
organization was concerned by the Gambia&#8217;s rejection of recommendations regarding this 
issue. It mentioned reports of arbitrary arrest on these grounds, and that stakeholders had 
been distressed by the public statements of high-level officials threatening homosexuals 
with expulsion from the country or beheading. The Human Rights Committee had also 
confirmed that the provisions criminalizing consensual same-sex conducts violated the 
rights to privacy and non-discrimination established in the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. Thus, it urged the Gambia to reconsider its position and accept the 
recommendations that it had previously rejected. Lastly, it recommended that violence 
directed against any person, including because of sexual orientation or gender identity, be 
vigorously prosecuted, and that incitement to violence on these grounds be condemned. 
</p>
<p>611. Amnesty International welcomed the Government&#8217;s stated commitment to ensure 
inclusive follow-up to the universal periodic review. It acknowledged the Gambia&#8217;s support 
for the recommendations relating to women&#8217;s rights and further cooperation with special 
procedures. It emphasized the importance of urgently implementing recommendation 24, 
on the need to investigate and punish human rights violations committed by security forces. 
The Gambia should support a number of pending recommendations concerning the 
enforcement of ratified human rights instruments, the establishment of a national human 
rights institution, cooperation with special procedures, the death penalty, unlawful arrest 
and detention, torture and enforced disappearances, the independence of the judiciary and 
the protection of human rights defenders. Lastly, Amnesty International mentioned that the 
rejected recommendations on freedom of expression mirrored the Gambia&#8217;s obligations 
under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. It therefore urged the Government to honour them. 
</p>
<p>612. Verein Sudwind Entwicklungspolitik recalled that the right to freedom of expression 
was recognized by the constitution of the Gambia. Gambian law banned any harassment 
and intimidation of media institutions, and hence all such acts should cease, irrespective of 
the Gambia&#8217;s position with regard to recommendations 15 to 30. It acknowledged the 
ongoing, positive institution-building process, in particular the setting-up of an independent 
national human rights institution. It also referred to the recommendations relating to 
additional visits by special procedures and to the accession to the Convention against 
Torture and the Optional Protocol thereto. It raised concerns over female mutilation, which 
it considered a form of torture. </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>141 
</b></p>
<p>613. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme stated that the rejection of 
half of the recommendations by the Gambia showed how reluctant it was in cooperating 
with the Council. It was inconceivable that the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights was hosted by the Gambia, whose President continued to issue death 
threats against human rights defenders and journalists. It was high time that the 
Commission sought another country to host its institutions and to ensure its integrity. It 
invited the Gambia to review its legislation on the freeing of drug traffickers on bail 
because of corrupt officials in the police and the judiciary, to combat early marriage and 
trafficking in women. The Gambia should also ensure the safety of human rights defenders 
and journalists and the independence of political parties. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review

<p>614. The delegation renewed the Gambia&#8217;s commitment to the universal periodic review 
process and thanked the Working Group, the Council and the troika.  
</p>
<p><b>  Egypt  
</b></p>
<p>615. The review of Egypt was held on 17 February 2010 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was based on 
the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Egypt in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/EGY/1);

</p><p>616. At its 25th meeting, on 11 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Egypt (see section C below). 
617. The outcome of the review of Egypt comprises the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/17), the views of Egypt concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/14/17/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>618. The delegation stated that the review session in February 2010 had been constructive 
and fruitful, and that Egypt had reflected on the recommendations made, started to 
implement some of them and expected to conclude the implementation of the accepted 
recommendations in the course of the next four years. Egypt highly valued the universal 
periodic review mechanism and benefitted from it. The universal periodic review also 
opened up better communication with partners, namely civil society. Egypt had witnessed 
unprecedented political movement in recent months, with societal dialogue on numerous 
human rights issues also thanks to the mechanism. Egyptian mass media dealt extensively 
with the review. 
</p>
<p>619. The governmental committee on the universal periodic review had notified the 
relevant ministries and authorities of the content of recommendations accepted in February 
</p><p>2010. Egypt had accepted 119 recommendations in order to raise perception at the national 
level. The committee had studied the 25 pending recommendations, including during two </p>


<p><b>142</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>consultative meetings with the participation of the National Council for Human Rights and 
civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>620. The delegation referred to several developments at the internal level. In May 2010, 
the Government had submitted to parliament a decision to extend the state of emergency 
because the antiterrorism law had not been completed. This time, the application of the law 
was exclusively limited to cases relating to terrorism, its funding and drug trafficking. The 
powers of the police were limited accordingly to fight these threats. This was a very 
important step before issuing the new antiterrorism bill. 
</p>
<p>621. To set the stage for the legislative elections, the Supreme Committee, an 
independent electoral committee, had taken all necessary measures to ensure the integrity of 
the elections. Measures had been taken to facilitate the monitoring of the elections by civil 
society. The elections of the Shura Council had also taken place in accordance with the 
regulations set out. 
</p>
<p>622. Numerous legislative initiatives relating to human rights had been undertaken, such 
as the law to combat trafficking in persons, enacted in April 2010. A law on the rights of 
persons with disabilities was also submitted to parliament. These initiatives were the 
implementation of voluntary pledges made by Egypt. 
</p>
<p>623. Regarding cooperation with human rights mechanisms, the delegation recalled the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in 
April 2010. In addition, Egypt had submitted its periodic report to the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>624. The National Council for Human Rights submitted its sixth annual report, and the 
cabinet of Ministers had held a session to study all the recommendations made, asking each 
ministry to respond to the report. 
</p>
<p>625. Regarding the 25 pending recommendations, Egypt had accepted 21 of them, either 
partially or entirely. In reply to some queries it received from some delegations and from 
civil society organizations relating to recommendations 10, 11, 18, 19 and 22, Egypt partly 
accepted these recommendations, that is to say that it accepted part of them and rejected 
other parts, or it may have accepted the objective of the recommendation but could not 
abide by a specific form of implementation, as explained in the addendum to the report. 
</p>
<p>626. The recommendations that Egypt did not accept were not rejected in principle, but 
the way they were drafted had led to their rejection or non-acceptance in their entirety. This 
was the case of the recommendation calling on Egypt to accede to several human rights 
conventions at once, while Egypt was considering each convention on its own merits. 
Although Egypt agreed in principle, it was not in a position to accept that recommendation. 
Egypt could not accept a few recommendations that were not compatible with domestic law 
and the rejection of which did not contradict Egyptian international human rights 
obligations, such as the abolition of the death sentence, in accordance with the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>627. Egypt included detailed information in its addendum for all accepted or rejected 
recommendations. It accepted recommendations on numerous crucial issues, such as 
freedom of religion, freedom of expression, the withdrawal of reservations or enhancing 
cooperation with special procedures. 
</p>
<p>628. Egypt reiterated that the process of examining pending recommendations was a 
useful exercise. It valued the interactive dialogue and was keen to continue it with Member 
States, civil society organizations and national human rights institutions. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>629. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed Egypt&#8217;s 
acceptance of 119 recommendations in February 2010. It noted that Egypt had accepted 
three recommendations on ending the state of emergency, which was extended in May 
2010, and called for their implementation. It also called for an amendment of the penal code 
to ensure freedom of expression for journalists, publishers and bloggers. It welcomed the 
efforts to promote cultural and religious tolerance and encouraged the implementation of 
Austria&#8217;s recommendation to increase these efforts. The delegation thanked Egypt for 
providing advance information on the 25 outstanding recommendations, and asked which 
parts of the recommendations that had been partially accepted did enjoy Egypt&#8217;s support. 
</p><p>630. Qatar noted that Egypt had accepted a large number of recommendations, which was 
a sign of its sincere and positive interaction with the universal periodic review and the 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, with a view to further promoting human rights 
in the country. While appreciating the achievements made in the area of human rights, 
Qatar hoped that Egypt would continue to make further progress.  
631. The United Arab Emirates welcomed the acceptance by Egypt of most 
recommendations, which showed its readiness to cooperate with the Council with a view to 
promoting human rights. It highlighted Egypt&#8217;s achievements in promoting human rights 
principles, including with regard to eradicating illiteracy and the empowerment of women, 
the strengthening of systems to combat crimes against children and human trafficking and 
the protection of persons with disabilities. Lastly, it commended the measures taken by 
Egypt to promote human rights principles in conjunction with its efforts to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>632. Bahrain expressed its appreciation for the positive measures that Egypt had taken to 
implement a number of recommendations, its efforts to promote and protect human rights 
and its role in the work of the Council. Bahrain also appreciated the openness demonstrated 
by Egypt in describing the challenges that it faced in complying with its international 
obligations. Bahrain highlighted the importance of strengthening the right to health and the 
provision of health care throughout the country, and of increased efforts to ensure education 
for all and to spread a culture of human rights. 
</p>
<p>633. Saudi Arabia noted that the acceptance by Egypt of most recommendations 
demonstrated its commitment to human rights promotion and protection. The holistic 
approach taken towards the situation of women had resulted in a number of social support 
initiatives, such as the design of a strategy aimed at fighting violence against women and 
the withdrawal of a reservation to article 9 (2) of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms Discrimination against Women. Noting that the provision of social services, such as 
education and health care, were considered human rights priorities, Saudi Arabia expressed 
its appreciation for the measures taken in that regard. 
</p>
<p>634. Algeria commended the efforts promote and protecting human rights and expressed 
its particular support for Egypt&#8217;s efforts to focus on certain specific issues urgently. Algeria 
noted that Egypt had adopted 119 recommendations in February 2010, and underscored its 
active role in the Council. Algeria expressed its full agreement with Egypt&#8217;s position 
regarding certain recommendations that had not yet been accepted, and encouraged Egypt 
to redouble its efforts to fulfil human rights. 
</p>
<p>635. Indonesia acknowledged Egypt&#8217;s immediate acceptance of 119 recommendations in 
February 2010 as proof of its commitment to the work of the Council and human rights 
promotion and protection. It welcomed the progress made in the empowerment of women 
and the protection of children&#8217;s rights, and commended Egypt&#8217;s efforts to initiate new 
legislation to combat and sanction human trafficking. Indonesia welcomed Egypt&#8217;s </p>


<p><b>144</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>withdrawal of its reservation to article 9 (2) of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, and expressed its confidence that Egypt would 
adopt a similar approach to other human rights instruments and pursue human rights 
promotion and the protection of all people. 
</p>
<p>636. Oman noted that the interactive, frank and open dialogue held at the Working Group 
session in February 2010 clearly showed the cooperative approach taken by Egypt. Oman 
appreciated the acceptance by Egypt of most recommendations, as well as its commitment 
to their implementation, which demonstrated the importance accorded by Egypt to 
strengthening its human rights mechanisms and concepts. Oman expressed the hope that the 
adoption of the final report would contribute to the strengthening of Egypt&#8217;s continuous 
efforts to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>637. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) highlighted Egypt&#8217;s social policies, in particular 
the progress made in the promotion and protection of cultural rights through concrete 
measures aimed at empowering traditionally excluded sectors of the population. It noted 
that Egypt&#8217;s widespread consultations for the preparation of the national report, due to 
continue after the current review, and its acceptance of most recommendations 
demonstrated its commitment to the universal periodic review mechanism and its strong 
will to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>638. The United States of America congratulated Egypt on having passed anti-trafficking 
legislation and commended its support for the recommendation that it revise relevant laws 
and practices to ensure compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, including for bloggers and access to the Internet. The delegation expressed concern 
about the continued killings of migrants on the border with Israel, the reasons provided by 
Egypt for the imprisonment of bloggers, and the renewal of the state of emergency in May 
</p><p>2010. It welcomed the subsequent release of prisoners held under the emergency law, and 
called for additional releases. The delegation regarded the recommendations partially 
accepted by Egypt as noted, and regretted its decision not to support a significant number of 
recommendations regarding religion and political freedom. It also expressed concern about 
reports of fraud during the Shura election on 1 June.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>639. The Egyptian National Council for Human Rights commended Egypt for accepting 
119 recommendations and its total or partial acceptance of 21 of the 25 pending 
recommendations. It called upon Egypt to end the state of emergency and to release all 
persons detained under the emergency law beyond the scope of the new limitations; to 
expedite the implementation of the principle of citizenship by promulgating the unified law 
for places of worship and the law on equal opportunities and the eradication of 
discrimination; and to ensure the participation of the Council and other non-governmental 
organizations in preparing amendments to guarantee freedom of association. It underscored 
the importance of proper and prompt implementation of the recommendations accepted by 
the Government and stated its intention to monitor the process with the participation of civil 
society. 
</p>
<p>640. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies questioned the sincerity of Egypt in 
complying with the recommendations it had accepted, in particular concerning freedom of 
opinion and expression, and cited the example of two bloggers and an Internet activist still 
held in detention under the emergency law without having been charged and without a trial. 
Although the President of Egypt had promised more than five years previously to eliminate 
imprisonment in press cases, there were still 23 different provisions in the penal code 
leading to the imprisonment of journalists and writers, which cast doubt on the seriousness 
of the Government. </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>145 
</b></p>
<p>641. In their joint statement, Human Rights Watch and the International Federation for 
Human Rights highlighted the deterioration of the human rights situation in Egypt since 
February 2010. They deplored the recent renewal of the state of emergency and stressed 
that administrative detainees, numbering between 5,000 and 10,000, should be either 
immediately charged or released. The organizations expressed concern about impunity for 
human rights violations, the continued crackdown on independent political activists and the 
violation of freedom of assembly, noting the quashing of a demonstration and the arrest of 
102 peaceful protestors on 6 April in Cairo. They highlighted that the Shura elections of 1 
June had been marred by reports of fraud and incidents of violence, and that since February, 
Egyptian border guards had shot dead at least 12 migrants attempting to cross into Israel. 
</p>
<p>642. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed the acceptance by Egypt of 
many recommendations in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, although it 
regretted that some of those recommendations were of a very general nature, without 
indication of measures of implementation or indicators of achievement. It also regretted the 
rejection by Egypt of the recommendation to allow the free establishment of trade unions 
without the obligation for such unions to join the Egyptian Trade Union Federation. 
</p><p>643. Organisation pour la communication en Afrique et de promotion de la cooperation 
&#233;conomique internationale noted that Egypt had accepted more than 80 per cent of the 
recommendations made by other States. It highlighted Egypt&#8217;s progress with regard to 
women&#8217;s rights, as well as its constructive approach to the universal periodic review. It 
welcomed Egypt&#8217;s withdrawal of its reservations to articles 9, 16 and 29 of the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and asked the 
Government to consider the possibility of ratifying the Optional Protocol thereto. It also 
requested that Egypt expedite the adoption of the law criminalizing all forms of violence 
against women, and to formulate a global policy to address this issue. 
</p>
<p>644. The Al-Hakim Foundation thanked Egypt for its comprehensive report on its human 
rights situation and praised the constructive participation of Egypt in the universal periodic 
review. It commended Egypt&#8217;s decision to open the Rafah border to allow humanitarian 
assistance to enter Gaza, while allowing the passage of Palestinians for health treatment 
abroad. It also commended the decision by parliament to limit the application of the 
emergency law to combating terrorism and drug trafficking. While noting the efforts made 
to fight female genital mutilation, it stated that additional measures needed to be taken in 
this regard. Finally, it referred to the necessity to find a solution to legal problems faced by 
Egyptian nationals married to Palestinians of Israeli nationality and their children. 
</p>
<p>645. The Democracy Coalition Project highlighted the fact that Egypt had not taken any 
serious measures to implement the vast majority of the universal periodic review 
recommendations. Although the Government had accepted that non-governmental 
organizations could monitor elections, civil society groups were denied permission to 
monitor electoral proceedings, and 300 supporters of various candidates had been arrested 
during the recent Shura Council elections. In addition, notwithstanding the acceptance of 
several recommendations regarding freedom of religion and belief, Egypt had not made 
significant efforts to stop discriminatory incidents targeting Coptic Christians. The 
organization stressed the need for an official plan with concrete and time-bound 
benchmarks to evaluate the implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>646. Amnesty International stressed that civil and political rights were restricted under 
the state of emergency, which was renewed on 11 May 2010, despite recommendations that 
it be lifted. It referred to the violent dispersal by security forces of several recent 
demonstrations, such as the one on 6 April 2010 in Cairo. Concerning Egypt&#8217;s description 
of a recommendation to &#8220;cease arrests and detentions of political activists&#8221; as inaccurate, 
Amnesty International attested to the use of emergency powers to arrest and detain political 
activists, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood. It highlighted the fact that the </p>


<p><b>146</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>peaceful exercise of freedom of expression remained severely constrained, and referred to 
the case of four bloggers, two of whom had been held in administrative detention since 
</p><p>2008. 
</p>
<p>647. The Human Rights Information and Training Centre expressed the hope that the 
definition of torture in Egyptian law would be brought into line with the Convention against 
Torture, that Egypt would sign the Optional Protocol to the Convention and allow a visit by 
the Special Rapporteur on torture. It also hoped that the state of emergency would be lifted 
without delay and that no counter-terrorist law would be enacted, in spite of some 
recommendations to that effect, since the Penal Code was sufficient to fight terrorism. It 
further hoped that the application of the death sentence would be limited to the most serious 
crimes, with additional guarantees for a fair trial. With regard to freedom of religion, it 
urged the Government to issue a unified law as soon as possible and, with regard to 
freedom of opinion and expression, to repeal provisions concerning the imprisonment of 
journalists. 
</p><p>648. Verein S&#252;dwind Entwicklungspolitik, referring to the forthcoming election in Egypt, 
urged the Government to invite national and international independent observers. It also 
urged the adoption of a moratorium on the death penalty and consideration of its eventual 
abolition. It further urged that all reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women be withdrawn, that efforts to provide education 
and employment for women be intensified, and that the prevention of female genital 
mutilation be included in health planning. Finally, it recommended that Egypt release 
persons detained or imprisoned solely for exercising their freedom of expression on the 
Internet. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>649. The delegation welcomed the criticisms made and recognized that, although 
mistakes may have been committed, Egypt was working on reforms, whenever needed. The 
delegation noted inaccuracies in some statements made. 
</p>
<p>650. To reply to the query from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland, the delegation stated that partly accepted recommendations were accepted by 
Egypt, as explained in the clarification included in the addendum to the report. 
</p>
<p>651. In February 2010, Egypt had promised to put an end to the state of emergency as 
soon as the antiterrorism law was enacted, since it was impossible to prevent terrorism 
through normal laws. Exceptional rules that would be included in a state of emergency or in 
a special counter-terrorism law were needed, as was the case in the vast majority of 
countries. Egypt was committed to ending the state of emergency, but recognized that it had 
faced delays in enacting the antiterrorism law. 
</p>
<p>652. Egypt recalled the limitation of the scope of the new law of emergency, and 
reasserted that the state of emergency was temporary. 
</p>
<p>653. Regarding allegations of detention of persons based on the practice of their 
legitimate freedom of opinion on the Internet, Egypt stated that the names, which had been 
mentioned by delegations, referred to persons detained as a result of having committed 
crimes under the penal code. More than 30,000 blogs dealt with human rights in Egypt on a 
daily basis, without restrictions or consequences. 
</p>
<p>654. While being grateful to those who appreciated the achievements of Egypt, the 
delegation replied to those who alleged that Egypt had not done anything since February 
2010 by providing examples. It recalled that Egypt had recently held a number of 
consultative meetings with civil society organizations. An ad hoc legal committee had been 
set up to review the definition of torture in line with that of the Convention against Torture. </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>147 
</b></p>
<p>A new draft law on sexual harassment was due to be enacted at the next parliamentary 
session. A committee had been set up to review the penal code in order to look into 
repealing a number of press offences that may warrant imprisonment. Concerning civil 
society law, there was a committee in the general federation of civil society organizations 
that was reconsidering a number of texts governing the establishment of associations in 
order to grant them greater independence and autonomy. 
</p>
<p>655. Egypt had started to work on the establishment of an institutional mechanism to 
implement the 140 recommendations it had accepted, in consultation with the ministerial 
committee, the National Council for Human Rights and civil society organizations. More 
efforts would be made to better evaluate the human rights situation in Egypt. Egypt would 
continue its consultations with all relevant regional and international human rights 
organizations, more campaigns would be conducted by the mass media in order to keep the 
momentum of human rights culture in Egypt. The delegation thanked the Council and its 
President, and saluted the universal periodic review mechanism, which offered a chance to 
review achievements and to listen to advice in an atmosphere of serious dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b>  Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p>656. The review of Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 17 February 2010 in conformity 
with all the relevant provisions contained in Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, and was 
based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (a) The national report submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with 
the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/7/BIH/1);  
 (b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/BIH/2);  
 (c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/7/BIH/3). 
</p><p>657. At its 26th meeting, on 11 June 2010, the Human Rights Council considered and 
adopted the outcome of the review of Bosnia and Herzegovina (see section C below). 
658. The outcome of the review of Bosnia and Herzegovina comprises the report of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/14/16), the views of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in 
the Working Group (see also A/HRC/14/16/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions, its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>659. Bosnia and Herzegovina stated that, of the recommendations made, 26 had been 
fully accepted, 58 partially accepted and 46 rejected. 
</p><p>660. The 26 fully accepted recommendations concern capacity-building for cooperation 
with associations of peoples with disabilities, the establishment of a council of persons with 
disabilities, enhancement of the protection of children, capacity-building of the Children&#8217;s 
Council and improvement of children&#8217;s education, and continuation of the mine-disposal 
campaign in the areas contaminated by mines. 
</p>
<p>661. The recommendations made with a view to more efficiently fight discrimination, 
including racial discrimination, to build the capacity of human rights institutions and to 
harmonize laws had also been accepted. Bosnia and Herzegovina had the intention to set up </p>


<p><b>148</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>a suitable national preventive mechanism against torture and to expedite the 
implementation of the anti-discrimination law. 
</p>
<p>662. Other accepted recommendations concerned the removal of the death penalty from 
the legislation of one entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Republika Srpska), targeted 
courses in human rights law, building capacities for prison services, the need to establish 
and improve capacities for the prevention of hate speech, support for women victims of war 
and wartime rape, and support for victims and witnesses in cases of war crimes. 
Recommendations regarding freedom of speech with a view to furthering activities for the 
prevention of hate speech and the dissemination of religious and ethnic intolerance in all 
media, and major recommendations relating to the harmonization of the Constitution and 
the election law had also been accepted. 
</p>
<p>663. The 58 partially accepted recommendations concerned more efficient 
implementation of the ratified Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and 
the Optional Protocol thereto, initial activities for the ratification of the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the fight 
against the exploitation of children, begging, poverty reduction, concluding activities to 
design a strategy for social inclusion and the eradication of any form of discrimination in 
the education of children.  
</p>
<p>664. The delegation noted that over recent years, Bosnia and Herzegovina had been 
intensely fighting discrimination and building its human rights institutional capacity, and 
that it would continue fulfilling its obligations. The recommendations concerning gender 
equality, domestic violence and sexual orientation had been partially accepted, as the 
country had already developed relevant strategies and plans and established appropriate 
legal mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>665. Bosnia and Herzegovina had been continuously working for the implementation and 
monitoring of the war crimes prosecution strategy. A supervisory body and a system of 
regular reporting had been established. The number of cases and persons who had 
committed war crimes and the structure of these cases had been identified. The 
development of a transitional justice strategy was under way. 
</p><p>666. The delegation reported that Bosnia and Herzegovina was aware of the problem of 
inadequate support for and protection of witnesses, in particular in cases relating to war 
crimes. The country had designed a network of support for witnesses, and the Ministry of 
Justice was involved in implementing its activities. The justice reform strategy for the 
period 2008&#8211;2012 and plan of action for the implementation of the strategy included a plan 
to adopt medium-term plans for the training of judges and prosecutors, although it was 
necessary to upgrade and improve them. 
</p>
<p>667. In order to ensure high standards in law enforcement, Bosnia and Herzegovina was 
in the process of developing a curriculum for the ongoing training of judges and 
prosecutors. It had passed a law on the agency for the prevention of corruption and adopted 
the anti-corruption strategy for the period 2009&#8211;2014. The agency, which would report to 
the Parliamentary Assembly, was being established. Since April 2007, one entity of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina (Republika Srpska) had been implementing its own anti-corruption 
project. 
</p><p>668. Activities on the freedom of expression and associations of journalists and other 
civil society organizations would continue. Authorities and the competent agency 
advocated for the right to freedom of expression, which implied that the media and 
journalists could carry out research, publish information and inform the public. The agency 
had a regular practice of publicly condemning any attempt to exert pressure and threats 
against journalists performing their professional activities. </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>149 
</b></p>
<p>669. A recommendation regarding attacks against human rights defenders had been 
partially accepted, as national institutions denounced attacks against human rights 
defenders and generally supported freedom of speech and expression. A recommendation 
concerning the rights of national minorities had been partially accepted because, through an 
institutional and legal framework, Bosnia and Herzegovina allowed national minorities, 
especially Roma, to initiate and implement their own initiatives within the legal framework 
and in accordance with the capabilities of individual communities. In practice, there had not 
been any major problems in the implementation of laws relating to the protection of 
minority rights. Moreover, after the inclusion in the Decade of Roma and adoption of the 
plan of action to address the issue of housing, employment, health care and education for 
Roma, and the appropriation of funds within the State budget, the country had initiated the 
necessary actions to prevent discrimination against Roma by involving local communities.  
</p>
<p>670. The delegation stated that, in recent years, in cooperation with UNHCR, UNICEF 
and social work centres, Bosnia and Herzegovina had continued to fight against the absence 
of birth registration of Roma children. The country had prepared a plan of action on the 
educational needs of Roma and other ethnic minorities with a view to voluntarily including 
Roma children into the regular education system in both entities, while there had been a 
significant increase in the number of Roma children in primary schools. Concerning the 
recommendation on the creation of conditions for the return of displaced persons and 
refugees, the adoption of the revised strategy for the implementation of annex VII to the 
Dayton Peace Agreement was under way. 
</p>
<p>671. The delegation also stated that, during the reporting period, Bosnia and Herzegovina 
had implemented activities that related to recommendations it had not accepted; for 
example, it had ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, and completed the procedure for the ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The 
country continued activities to curb trafficking in children, child prostitution and child 
pornography. Legal regulations were continually being harmonized and efforts had been 
made to gradually implement the recommendations of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. Activities on the harmonization of laws and fundraising for better implementing the 
rights of the child and projects for the improvement of the position of children had also 
continued. 
</p>
<p>672. In order to ensure equality for women, appropriate legislation had been adopted. The 
country was implementing strategies related to the protection of children: the strategy to 
combat violence against children; the plan of action for children; and the strategy against 
juvenile delinquency. In recent years, efforts had been focused on strengthening the 
capacity of governments, communities and activists to address issues of social exclusion 
and its impact on children, the youth and women. Authorities at all levels had implemented 
institutional capacity-building programmes to establish minimum national standards for the 
rights and welfare of children, as well as mechanisms for quality assurance, monitoring and 
reporting. There was a system of reporting violence against children, which operated on the 
basis of laws and was being continuously improved. 
</p>
<p>673. The delegation emphasized that human rights education was present in the curricula 
and educational standards in all primary and secondary schools and higher education 
institutions, and noted that Bosnia and Herzegovina had extended a standing invitation to 
special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>674. Gynaecological services at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of health care 
during pregnancy, childbirth and after childbirth and other health services were available to

<p><b>150</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>675. With regard to the judiciary, the entity-level judicial and prosecutorial training 
centres and the judicial commission of Brcko District had the capacity to regularly organize 
training sessions and seminars on the implementation of international standards. 
</p>
<p>676. The Constitution and laws ensured the principle of the use of language and alphabet, 
a guarantee for parties and participants in proceedings who did not know the language of 
proceedings to follow them through an interpreter (translator); this principle was rarely 
violated in practice. Judges and prosecutors were appointed by and subject to disciplinary 
proceedings before an independent authority (High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council). 
However, the funding system of justice was still problematic. 
</p><p>677. The Communications Regulatory Agency complied with the competencies defined 
by the law on communications as well as by rules and regulations of the Agency. Equal 
access to all media was ensured for all religious communities. 
</p>
<p>678. The recommendation concerning violence against human rights defenders in the 
Republika Srpska had not been accepted, because the Republika Srpska police had not 
recorded any cases of violence against human rights defenders during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>679. Bosnia and Herzegovina stated that it considered the universal periodic review 
process extremely useful, and indicated that recommendation 80, which was not included in 
the addendum, had been accepted since it was partially implemented. 
</p>
<p>680. Lastly, Bosnia and Herzegovina explained that partially accepted recommendations 
were considered accepted, since they had already been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review 
outcome 
</b></p>
<p>681. Qatar thanked Bosnia and Herzegovina for its statements, replies and comments to 
the recommendations. It was satisfied by Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8217;s political will to 
promote and protect human rights in the legislative area and in reality. It welcomed the 
enforcement of the rule of law and its support for human rights, and encouraged Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to make further efforts to come to grips with the difficulties encountered by 
refugees and persons displaced by the war, to favour their return and their economic and 
social reintegration.  
</p>
<p>682. Algeria made three recommendations during the review of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
and was pleased to learn that they had been accepted. Algeria took note of the statement 
that the question of six Algerian nationals was on the verge of being resolved or partially 
resolved, and asked how Bosnia and Herzegovina was considering resolving the remaining 
pending aspects. Algeria was encouraged by the State&#8217;s intention to continue to promote 
and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>683. The United States of America welcomed Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8217;s acceptance of a 
number of recommendations made during its review. It appreciated the acceptance of the 
recommendation regarding freedom of the press in the country. In 2009, 40 cases of alleged 
violations of journalists&#8217; rights and freedom were registered, and this trend seemed to 
continue in 2010. The United States also underlined its support for the recommendations 
made to strengthen the Communications Regulatory Agency. It noted that efforts to 
undermine the independence of the Agency continued, and that its authority was regularly 
challenged on political grounds. 
</p>
<p>684. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia stressed its appreciation for the 
dialogue during Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8217;s review process and for the appropriate and 
sincere responses to the recommendations and questions addressed during this dialogue. 
Children&#8217;s health and education, as well as children victims of anti-personnel mines, were 
and should remain one of the most delicate and important concerns of the authorities. It </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>151 
</b></p>
<p>urged the authorities at all levels to continue to follow these issues with the necessary 
attention.  
</p>
<p>685. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was pleased that Bosnia 
and Herzegovina had accepted a number of recommendations, including its 
recommendations to expedite the establishment of a national preventive mechanism for 
torture, to repeal the death penalty from the Constitution of Republika Srpska, and to 
amend the country&#8217;s Constitution to prevent discrimination against minorities. It repeated 
its call for the full implementation of another of its recommendations, which had been 
partially accepted, to improve the effectiveness of the State-level Ombudsman to ensure 
adherence to the Paris Principles. It also emphasized the ongoing needs of assistance for 
117,000 displaced persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>686. Amnesty International welcomed Bosnia and Herzegovina&#8217;s commitment to women 
victims of sexual violence war crimes during the 1992&#8211;1995 war. It called on the 
Government to ensure that both the draft State law and the national programme for the 
reparation for all civilian victims of war crimes, were adopted without further delay and in 
consultation with survivors. Survivors should be guaranteed access to justice and 
reparation, and provided with affordable health services, including psychosocial support 
centres, as well as housing and employment. It welcomed the commencement of several 
trials relating to sexual violence war crimes before the State Court, while other cases had 
reached the trial chamber stage or final judgement. It emphasized the importance of the 
recommendation to establish a comprehensive witness protection scheme. It urged the 
Government to amend the criminal code to include the definition of sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>687. Verein Sudwind Entwicklungspolitik stressed the urgent need to improve the safety 
of refugees returning to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and stated that international aid and 
know-how should be sought, as referred to in recommendations 117 to 122. Human rights 
defenders must be properly protected and impunity must end. A new State should rest on 
the trust of the people in the justice of the basic institutions of State and society, as accepted 
in recommendations 88 to 97. With regard to human trafficking, it advised Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to implement recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination to eliminate discrimination against women, as accepted in recommendations 
34 to 37. 
</p>
<p>688. In a joint statement, the European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay 
Federation, and Federatie van Nederlandse Verenigingen tot Integratie Van 
Homoseksualiteit &#8211; COC Nederland welcomed the positive response of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to recommendations to guarantee effective protection against all 
discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and asked what specific plans 
the Government had to give effect to those commitments. Noting concerns at ongoing 
discrimination faced by marginalized groups, they urged Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
implement increased measures to combat hate crimes. They also requested that the 
Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to 
Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity be applied as a guide to assist in policy 
development.  
</p>
<p>689. The International Save the Children Alliance, on behalf of the Bosnia and 
Herzegovina Working Group on Child Protection, urged the Government to sign and ratify 
the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Abuse and 
Sexual Exploitation, to introduce the prohibition of corporal punishment of children into 
national laws and to promote alternatives to traditional disciplining of children. It called on 
the Government to implement the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the </p>


<p><b>152</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>Child relating to the administration of juvenile justice. It also urged the adoption of the 
programme of juvenile criminal prevention, the bill on juvenile criminal offenders and the 
criminal law protection of children and juveniles, and undertaking legal reform at all levels 
to comply with international standards. It reiterated the recommendations of the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child to develop quality standards for foster care, decrease the time 
children spend in institutions and ensure sufficient resources for care institutions and foster 
care. 
</p>
<p>690. The Association for Democratic Initiatives stated that the fragmented legal system 
caused by the different levels of the Government implied that criminal justice policies were 
not harmonized. Consequently, citizens were not treated equally, and their standing before 
judicial bodies was determined by their place of residence. It invited the Government to 
harmonize criminal legislation at all levels and to establish a single national financial 
source for the entire judiciary in order to ensure its independence. It also requested the 
Government to ensure equal access of citizens to justice, regardless of their ethnic or 
religious origin or language.  
</p>
<p>691. Interfaith International noted that, after the Second World War, international 
consciousness had been marked by the memory of religious and inter-ethnic conflicts in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The signature of the Dayton Peace Agreement had brought peace 
among different ethnic and religious entities living in that region. Interfaith International 
noted that there had been a delay in the implementation of annex VII of the Agreement 
linked to the return of refugees and displaced persons. It encouraged Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to maintain cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia, adopt appropriate legislative measures to eliminate all forms of racial 
discrimination and promote a culture of tolerance, indispensable for social cohesion. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>692. The delegation stated that the country was working for the implementation of all 
recommendations that had been fully and partially accepted during the review, and noted 
that the universal periodic review process allowed countries to focus on the effective 
implementation of human rights. The process had helped Bosnia and Herzegovina to gain 
access to the progress achieved in various segments of the implementation of human rights. 
The process had been a huge challenge for the country, which had undertaken it as an 
opportunity to review its achievements and the challenges ahead. 
</p>
<p>693. Bosnia and Herzegovina thanked all participants, especially the members of the 
troika, Belgium, Nigeria and Slovenia. It renewed its commitment to improve human rights 
and praised the role played by non-governmental organizations.

racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 2 of draft resolution A/HRC/14/L.3, the Human Rights Council 
decided to convene a high-level meeting at its sixteenth session through a panel discussion 
that would focus on the realization of the rights of peoples of African descent, and 
primarily to use the occasion as a preparatory process for the celebration of 2011 as the 
International Year for Peoples of African Descent. 
</p>
<p>2. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total of $29,800 would be 
required under section 23 (Human Rights) to cover the travel costs of five panel members. 
</p><p>3. The estimated requirements to implement the activities called for under the draft 
resolution have not been included under section 23 of the programme budget for the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011. The Secretariat will, to the extent possible, seek to identify areas 
from where the anticipated additional requirements of $29,800 may be redeployed within 
the provisions approved for section 23 for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. The additional 
requirements of $29,800 to implement the activities called for in the draft resolution will be 
presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session in a revised estimates report 
resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council, in the context of its 
consideration on the absorption capacity within the approved appropriations for the 
biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>4. Accordingly, no additional appropriations would be required as a result of the 
adoption of the draft resolution at the present time.

</p>
<p> (a) Decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief for a further period of three years; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the Special Rapporteur 
received the necessary resources to enable her/him to discharge her/his mandate fully; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested the Special Rapporteur to submit her/his reports to the Council in 
accordance with its annual programme of work and the next annual report in 2011. 
</p>
<p>6. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, it is estimated that $70,300 
per annum or $140,600 per biennium would be required in response to its terms. </p>

2010&#8211;2011. Since the period of the terms of the draft resolution extends into the biennium 
2012&#8211;2013, the requirements for that period will be considered in the context of the 
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012&#8211;2013. No additional appropriations 
would be required as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>8. With regard to paragraph 4, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>  14/8 
Regional cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights 
in the Asia-Pacific Region 
</b></p>
<p>9. In paragraph 2 of draft resolution A/HRC/14/L.8, the Council decided to convene 
the next session of the Workshop on Regional Cooperation for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights in the Asia-Pacific Region in Maldives in 2012. 
</p>
<p>10. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total amount of $283,100 
would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) to cover the travel costs of participants 
and experts and staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) to attend and service the Workshop, respectively.  
</p><p>11. Since the period of the terms of the draft resolution relates to the biennium 2012&#8211;
2013, the requirements will be considered in the context of the proposed programme budget 
for the biennium 2012&#8211;2013. 
</p>
<p>12. Conference servicing costs, including translation and documentation, are expected to 
arise during the Workshop, which will be held for a duration of three days in Maldives in 
</p><p>2012. Although a summary report will be prepared by the Secretariat after the meeting, the 
associated costs will be met within the entitlements for document processing for the 
Council that would be considered within the context of the proposed programme budget for 
the biennium 2012&#8211;2013. 
</p>
<p><b>  14/5 
The role of prevention in the promotion and protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>13. In paragraphs 5 and 6 of draft resolution A/HRC/14/L.15, the Council requested 
OHCHR: 
</p>
<p> (a) To consult States, treaty bodies, special procedures, national human rights 
institutions, civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders on the role of 
prevention in the promotion and protection of human rights, and to compile and publish the 
result of these consultations on the OHCHR website; 
</p>
<p> (b) To convene a workshop, within existing resources, based on the above-
mentioned consultations, on the role of prevention in the promotion and protection of 
human rights, with a view to contribute to further discussion on the issue, and to submit the 
outcome of the workshop to the Council at its sixteenth session. </p>


<p>GE.12-17781 <b>171 
</b></p>
<p>14. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, a total of $163,500 would be 
required to hold a one-day workshop (a) to cover travel costs of 10 experts (two from each 
regional group) ($64,500); (b) consultant services for two months ($14,900); and (c) 
conference servicing costs ($84,100), as follows: 
<i> United States dollars  
</i></p>
<p>Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs 
and Conference Management 83 400 
Section 23, Human Rights 79 400 
Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva 700 
</p>
<p><b>Total $163 500 
</b></p>
<p>15. Although provision has not been made in the programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011 to provide for the total associated costs of $163,500 for the event outlined in 
paragraph 14 above, the Secretariat will, to the extent possible, seek to identify areas from 
where the anticipated additional requirements of $163,500 may be redeployed within the 
provisions approved for sections 2, 23 and 28 E for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. The 
additional requirements of $163,500 to implement the activities called for in the draft 
resolution will be presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session in a revised 
estimates report resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council, in the 
context of its consideration on the absorption capacity within the approved appropriations 
for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>16. Additional appropriations would therefore not be required as a result of the adoption 
of the draft resolution at this point. 
</p>
<p><b>  14/6 
Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>17. In paragraphs 11, 12 (h), 16 and 17 of draft resolution A/HRC/14/L.18, the Human 
Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to extend the mandate of the special procedure on the human rights 
of internally displaced persons as a Special Rapporteur for a period of three years; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons to further strengthen the cooperation established between the Representative of the 
Secretary-General and the United Nations, including in the framework of the Peacebuilding 
Commission, as well as other international and regional organizations, in particular his/her 
participation in the work of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and its subsidiary 
bodies; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested the Secretary-General and OHCHR to provide the Special 
Rapporteur with all the assistance and adequate staffing necessary to carry out his/her 
mandate effectively and to ensure that the mechanism worked in close cooperation with the 
Emergency Relief Coordinator, with the continued support of the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees; 
</p>
<p> (d) Invited the Special Rapporteur to continue to submit annual reports on the 
implementation of his/her mandate to the Council and the General Assembly. </p>


<p><b>172</b> GE.12-17781 
</p>
<p>18. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, it is estimated that $70,300 
per annum or $140,600 per biennium would be required in response to its terms. 
</p><p>19. The estimated requirements of $70,300 per annum or $140,600 per biennium have 
been included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 
2010&#8211;2011 with regard to the special procedure on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons. Since the period of the terms of the draft resolution extends into the biennium 
2012&#8211;2013, the requirements for that period will be considered in the context of the 
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012&#8211;2013. No additional appropriations 
would be required as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to paragraph 16, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, 
the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the 
role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>  14/10 
Enforced or involuntary disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>21. In paragraphs 6 and 9 of draft resolution A/HRC/14/L.19, the Council requested: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Secretary-General to ensure that the Working Group on Enforced or 
Voluntary Disappearances received all the assistance and resources it required to perform 
its mandate; 
</p>
<p> (b) OHCHR to organize, within existing resources, a one-day event to 
commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>22. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, it is estimated that $31,300 
would be required to hold the one-day event, for the travel of five participants to Geneva 
and conference servicing costs. 
</p>
<p>23. Requirements in support of the activities of the Working Group have been included 
under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. 
With regard to the additional requirements of $31,300 for the event, the estimated 
extrabudgetary resources to be made available under section 23 during the biennium 2010&#8211;
2011 included provision for the event. No additional appropriations would be therefore 
required as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution. 
</p>
<p>24. With regard to the terms of paragraphs 6 and 9, attention is drawn to the provisions 
of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and 
subsequent resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, 
in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main 
Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary 
matters and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and

mandate of the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Burundi, in 
accordance with Council resolution 9/19. 
</p>
<p>26. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Council, it is estimated that $55,800 
per annum would be required to implement the resolution. 
</p>
<p>27. The requirements in support of the independent expert have been provided for under 
the programme budget for the biennium 2010&#8211;2011. No additional appropriation would
