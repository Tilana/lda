<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance

Vice-Chair of the National Human Rights Committee of Cambodia. At its 10th meeting 
held on 31 January 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Cambodia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Cambodia: Italy, Morocco and the 
Philippines. 
</p>

</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America was transmitted to 
Cambodia through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Cambodia highlighted the importance of the universal periodic 
review mechanism as a process that gives each State the opportunity to carry out measures 
to improve the situation of human rights on its territory.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation recalled that the fulfilment by Cambodia of its human rights 
obligations had been reviewed by the Working Group in December 2009 and that the 91 
recommendations formulated by the delegations at that time were in line with the policy of 
the Government.  
</p>
<p>7. The delegation explained that after the 91 recommendations had been received, the 
Cambodian authorities appointed a working group chaired by Mr. Mak Sambath and 
comprised of 21 members from relevant ministries and institutions. The working group 
cooperated with OHCHR to organize two workshops with the participation of experts from 
OHCHR, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. It also organized five meetings with 
relevant ministries and institutions and two consultations with civil society organizations. 
In October 2013, the Council of Ministers, under the auspices of the Prime Minister, 
adopted the report. </p>


<p>8. The delegation noted the positive achievements, challenges and future goals in seven 
major areas: ratification of treaties, land rights, rule of law, detention and issues related to 
torture and ill-treatment, economic, social and cultural rights, women&#8217;s rights and 
children&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>9. The delegation emphasized that Cambodia had ratified nine international 
conventions. Regarding the two Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the Cambodian Human Rights 
Committee, with the assistance of OHCHR, had organized two seminars and meetings with 
relevant ministries and institutions. 
</p>
<p>10. Regarding invitations to the special procedures mandate holders, the delegation 
stated that there was no need for them to be invited, since they could visit Cambodia at any 
time. It indicated that there were many organizations working on human rights issues in the 
country, including the Human Rights and Complaints Commission of the National 
Assembly, the Human Rights and Complaints Commission of the Senate, the Committee 
itself, hundreds of national and international organizations, including OHCHR, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia. 
</p>
<p>11. In regard to the issue of land, the delegation noted that the Cambodian authorities 
continue to register all types of land with the aim of strengthening the security of land 
ownership. The campaign for the implementation of &#8220;old policy, new actions&#8221; in the land 
sector had been launched to carry out the measurement programme for the distribution of 
land, and residential and rice-field titles had been issued. The authorities had registered 
2,845,282 land titles for 500,000 families. Regarding evictions from the land, the delegation 
stated that certain people were not well informed and that the Government had had to take 
into consideration the interests and safety of the people and could not let the interests of the 
majority become a hostage to the interests of a minority. 
</p><p>12. The delegation noted that the Government recognized illegal land ownership, on a 
temporary basis, for people looking for a legal location in which to reside. It added that 
representatives had been designated to protect the interests of poor communities. The 
delegation also explained that in general, notification that a location was going to be 
developed was sent at least one year in advance.  
</p>
<p>13. Regarding the lands of indigenous peoples, the delegation emphasized that the 
Government had policies, regulations and laws to protect and recognize their rights. A sub-
decree had been drafted, based on pilot projects of land registration for three indigenous 
communities. Furthermore, consultations had been carried out with national and 
international legal experts, the relevant ministries and institutions, development partners, 
civil society organizations and especially with the indigenous peoples themselves.  
</p>
<p>14. On the rule of law, the delegation stated that the Government had continued to carry 
out profound reforms on legal and judiciary issues. To date, 416 laws had been adopted to 
enhance the legal framework and strengthen the capacity, independence and impartiality of 
the judiciary institutions. The authorities would continue to work harder to reform the laws 
by encouraging the drafting of new laws; establishing programmes to increase the 
awareness of laws; and conducting training for law enforcement officials at all levels. The 
delegation added that the Government had also pushed to enact the laws related to the 
judiciary. 
</p><p>15. Noting that elections to the National Assembly took place on 28 July 2013, the 
delegation stated that all political parties had had access to the media. The National 
Election Committee had facilitated freedom of expression and public assembly for all. It 
had also encouraged national and international organizations to get involved in the 
dissemination of information related to the elections. The delegation noted that the electoral </p>


<p>campaign, the vote and the vote counting had been conducted smoothly and that almost all 
the national and international observers had assessed the electoral process positively.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation indicated that, having received recommendations from various 
sources, such as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, the 
Government tasked the Ministry of the Interior with organizing, in the first semester of 
2014, a national workshop with representatives of the legislative and executive branches, 
registered political parties, the National Election Committee, civil society and international 
organizations, development partners and other relevant stakeholders. The aim of this 
workshop would be to collect opinions, comments and recommendations to assist with 
drafting electoral reforms. 
</p>
<p>17. The delegation stated that the authorities had underlined the important role of civil 
society organizations as an effective partner of the Government. In this regard, it had 
offered encouragement to associations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 
welcomed their participation in the socioeconomic development of the country and the 
promotion of democracy and human rights.  
</p>
<p>18. Regarding the right to association, the delegation mentioned the draft law on 
associations and NGOs, aimed at providing standards and conditions of registration which 
would facilitate the activities of associations and local and international NGOs in 
Cambodia. After discussions with associations, national and international organizations and 
representatives of other States, the draft law had been submitted to the Council of 
Ministers, which had unanimously approved it.  
</p>
<p>19. In regard to freedom of expression, the delegation noted that under article 41of the 
Constitution, any individual could express his or her opinion and had the right to freedom 
of expression. The delegation emphasized that the Government had encouraged discussion 
in public forums and permitted civil society organizations to express their opinions freely. 
In fact, there were NGOs, such as the Cambodian Human Rights Centre, the Cambodian 
Human Rights and Development Association, the Cambodian League for the Promotion 
and Defence of Human Rights, the National Democratic Institute and the International 
Republican Institute, which disseminated information on human rights and provided 
training on human rights throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>20. The delegation explained that in Cambodia there were 721 publishing media, 139 
radio stations, 108 TV stations, 127 cable TV channels and countless social media networks 
which disseminated information without censorship. It further explained that citizens had 
the right to create their own website and disseminate their opinions freely. 
</p>
<p>21. Regarding the establishment of a national human rights institution, the delegation 
noted that a committee had been appointed to draft a law but that it had not worked out. In 
2006, the Prime Minister had asked civil society organizations to draft a law based on the 
Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (Paris Principles). A Working 
Group had then carried out a plan of action for drafting the law. Recently, the Prime 
Minister had proposed holding more discussions on this issue with civil society 
organizations. Once these consultations have taken place, a national workshop will be 
organized to collect inputs and recommendations from legal experts and other relevant 
stakeholders to improve the draft law and then it will be submitted to the Council of 
Minister for further legal action. 
</p>
<p>22. In relation to a national preventive mechanism on torture, the delegation stated that, 
in order to be in line with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT), in 2009 the 
Government had issued a sub-decree on the establishment of the mechanism. </p>


<p>23. The delegation noted that in December 2009, members of the Subcommittee on 
Prevention of Torture had visited Cambodia for the first time and in December 2013, a 
second visit had been undertaken. Members of the Committee had visited prisons and 
police stations and conducted a seminar on the establishment of the national preventive 
mechanism. The Ministry of the Interior and OHCHR would be holding discussions on the 
draft law to ensure that it was in line with OP-CAT. 
</p>

salaries of the national staff. 
</p>
<p>116. On land issues, the delegation explained that the land law and other relevant 
regulations, as well as the necessary mechanisms for implementation, were in place to 
protect the rights of the people. Once the land was titled, it was for the courts to settle 
disputes. Individuals who lived on State-owned land were usually provided with two
