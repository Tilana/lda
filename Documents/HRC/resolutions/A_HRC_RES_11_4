</p>
<p> <i>Determined</i> to foster strict respect for the Purposes and Principles enshrined in the Charter

</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international

all without distinction of race, sex, language or religion,  
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i>, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, its full 
and active support for the Organization and the enhancement of its role and effectiveness in 
strengthening international peace, security and justice and in promoting the solution of 
international problems, and the development of friendly relations and cooperation among States,  
</p>

means in such a manner that international peace, security, human rights and justice are not 
endangered,  
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> its objective of promoting better relations among all States and contributing 
to creating conditions in which their people can live in true and lasting peace, free from any 
threat to or attack against their security,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the obligation of all States to refrain, in their international relations, from the 
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or 
from acting in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> its commitment to peace, security and justice, respect for human rights

Charter and international law, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and political 
independence of States,

Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that peace and security, development and human rights are mutually 
interlinked and reinforcing,  
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that human rights include social, economic and cultural rights and the right to 
peace, a healthy environment and development, and that development is, in fact, the realization 
of these rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> that the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and 
exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental rights, is contrary to the Charter and an 
impediment to the promotion of world peace and cooperation,

and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized,

<p> 5. <i>Further stresses</i> that peace and security, development and human rights are the

<p> 3
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Emphasizes</i> that ensuring the exercise of the right of peoples to peace and its 
promotion demand that the policies of States be directed towards the elimination of the threat of 
war, particularly nuclear war, the renunciation of the use or threat of use of force in international 
relations and the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means on the basis of the 
Charter of the United Nations;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Affirms</i> that all States should promote the establishment, maintenance and

use peaceful means to settle any dispute to which they are parties and the continuance of which
