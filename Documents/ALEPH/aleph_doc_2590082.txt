FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Thursday, August 4, 2016
HOUSTON - EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) today reported a second quarter 2016 net loss of $292.6
million, or $0.53 per share. This compares to second quarter 2015 net income of $5.3 million, or $0.01
per share.
Adjusted non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter 2016 was $209.7 million, or $0.38 per share,
compared to adjusted non-GAAP net income of $153.1 million, or $0.28 per share, for the same prior
year period. Adjusted non-GAAP net income (loss) is calculated by matching hedge realizations to
settlement months and making certain other adjustments in order to exclude non-recurring items. For a
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.
Lower commodity prices more than offset significant well productivity improvements and cost
reductions, resulting in decreases in adjusted non-GAAP net income, discretionary cash flow and
EBITDAX during the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015. For a reconciliation of
non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.
Operational Highlights
In the second quarter 2016, EOG increased its inventory of net premium drilling locations from 3,200 to
4,300. Premium inventory is defined by a direct after-tax rate of return hurdle rate of at least 30 percent
assuming $40 flat crude oil prices. Total premium net resource potential increased from 2.0 billion
barrels of oil equivalent (BnBoe) to 3.5 BnBoe. These additions were the result of advances in
completion technology, precision targeting, longer laterals and cost reductions.
U.S. crude oil volumes of 265,400 barrels of oil per day (Bopd) in the second quarter 2016 exceeded
the midpoint of the company’s guidance by 2 percent. Compared to the same prior year period, lease
and well expenses decreased 23 percent, and transportation costs decreased 13 percent, both on a
per-unit basis. Total general and administrative expenses decreased 5 percent compared to the second
quarter 2015, excluding expenses related to a voluntary retirement program.
Exploration and development expenditures (excluding property acquisitions) decreased 49 percent,
while total crude oil production declined by only 4 percent, in the second quarter 2016 compared to the
same period last year. Total natural gas production for the second quarter 2016 decreased 5 percent
versus the same prior year period.
“The benefits of EOG’s premium drilling strategy are beginning to show in our operating performance,”
said William R. “Bill” Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We are committed to focusing
capital on our premium assets which we are confident will increasingly lead to break-out performance
as prices improve. This quarter’s addition of 1.5 BnBoe of additional premium net resource potential
further solidifies our ability to deliver premium returns over the long term.”
2016 Capital Plan Update and 2020 Crude Oil Production Outlook
As a result of cost reductions and efficiency improvements, EOG has increased its targeted number of
well completions for 2016 from 270 to 350 net wells. Many of the additional well completions are
scheduled for late 2016. In addition, due to increased drilling productivity, the company expects to drill
250 net wells, 50 more than in its original 2016 plans. This increase in activity will be accomplished
while maintaining 2016 capital expenditure guidance of $2.4 to $2.6 billion, excluding acquisitions.
EOG can achieve significant production growth with balanced cash flow from 2017 through 2020, even
in a moderate commodity price environment. Based on EOG’s long-term plan and assuming a flat $50
West Texas Intermediate crude oil price (WTI), EOG would expect 10 percent compound annual crude
oil production growth through 2020. Assuming flat $60 WTI, EOG would expect 20 percent compound
annual crude oil production growth through 2020.
“EOG’s long-term outlook reflects superior capital efficiency and continued capital discipline, hallmarks
of the company since its founding,” Thomas said. “Our premium drilling strategy is the key to
our future success, and it is underpinned by EOG’s industry-leading asset quality, scale, technology,
well performance and low-cost structure. Most importantly, EOG’s high-performance culture prioritizes
rates of return over other performance metrics.”
South Texas Eagle Ford
The South Texas Eagle Ford, EOG’s largest high-return play, continues to lead the company in activity
and production. In the second quarter, EOG increased its Eagle Ford premium inventory by 390 net
drilling locations to almost 2,000 total. This large inventory of high-quality locations could be expanded
significantly should additional cost reductions or improvements in well productivity be achieved. For
example, EOG estimates that a 10 percent reduction in completed well costs or a 10 percent
improvement in estimated recoverable reserves per well would more than double EOG’s premium
inventory in the Eagle Ford.
In the second quarter, EOG completed 60 wells in the Eagle Ford with an average treated lateral length
of 4,800 feet per well and an average 30-day initial production rate per well of 1,705 barrels of oil
equivalent per day (Boed), or 1,340 Bopd, 175 barrels per day (Bpd) of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and
1.1 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of natural gas.
Delaware Basin
In the second quarter, EOG expanded its premium inventory in all three of its major Delaware Basin
formations - the Wolfcamp, the Second Bone Spring and the Leonard. By organically adding more than
500 net premium drilling locations, EOG is well positioned for years of high-return growth in this world-
class basin. EOG continues to improve well economics in the Delaware Basin through advances in
well and completion designs, including recent breakthroughs that enable higher productivity with longer
laterals.
In the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, EOG completed 16 wells in the second quarter with an average
treated lateral length of 6,500 feet per well, a 44 percent increase in lateral length from the prior quarter.
The average 30-day initial production rate per well was 2,410 Boed, or 1,610 Bopd, 340 Bpd of NGLs
and 2.8 MMcfd of natural gas. In the Delaware Basin Second Bone Spring, EOG completed nine wells
in the second quarter with an average treated lateral length of 4,500 feet per well and an average 30-
day initial production rate per well of 1,500 Boed, or 1,120 Bopd, 155 Bpd of NGLs and 1.4 MMcfd of
natural gas.
Rockies and the Bakken
EOG is continuing to optimize its core Rockies and Bakken plays, adding 200 additional net premium
drilling locations to its inventory in the DJ Basin Codell in Wyoming. The Codell is a liquids-rich
sandstone formation that now has significant premium potential due to cost reductions and efficiencies
along with the application of EOG’s precision targeting and completion technology.
In the DJ Basin Codell in Wyoming, EOG completed the Jubilee 541-3502H well in the second quarter
with average 30-day initial production rates of 1,190 Bopd, 130 Bpd of NGLs and 0.5 MMcfd of natural
gas.
In the Powder River Basin Turner, EOG completed the Arbalest 73-06H, 272-06H and 66-0607H wells
on the same pad during the second quarter with average 30-day initial production rates per well of
1,000 Bopd, 330 Bpd of NGLs and 3.8 MMcfd of natural gas.
In the North Dakota Bakken, EOG completed the Austin 421-2821H, 422-2821H and 423-2821H wells
in a three-well pattern in the second quarter with average 30-day initial production rates per well of
1,100 Bopd, 90 Bpd of NGLs and 0.5 MMcfd of natural gas. Also in the North Dakota Bakken, EOG
completed the West Clark 103-0136H and 104-0136H wells in a two-well pattern with average 30-day
initial production rates per well of 1,210 Bopd, 390 Bpd of NGLs and 1.8 MMcfd of natural gas.
In the Three Forks, EOG completed the West Clark 117-0136H well in the second quarter with average
30-day initial production rates of 1,290 Bopd, 380 Bpd of NGLs and 1.8 MMcfd of natural gas.
Hedging Activity
For the period March 1 through August 31, 2016, EOG had natural gas financial price swap contracts in
place for 60,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day at a weighted average price of $2.49 per
MMBtu.
For the period September 1 through November 30, 2016, EOG sold natural gas call option contracts for
43,750 MMBtu per day at an average strike price of $3.45 per MMBtu. For the period March 1 through
November 30, 2017, EOG sold natural gas call option contracts for 43,750 MMBtu per day at an
average strike price of $3.45 per MMBtu. For the period March 1 through November 30, 2018, EOG sold
natural gas call option contracts for 12,500 MMBtu per day at an average strike price of $3.32 per
MMBtu.
For the period March 1 through November 30, 2017, EOG purchased natural gas put option contracts
for 35,000 MMBtu per day at an average strike price of $2.90 per MMBtu. For the period March 1
through November 30, 2018, EOG purchased natural gas put option contracts for 10,000 MMBtu per
day at an average strike price of $2.90 per MMBtu.
A comprehensive summary of natural gas derivative contracts is provided in the attached tables.
Capital Structure and Asset Sales
At June 30, 2016, EOG’s total debt outstanding was $7.0 billion with a debt-to-total capitalization ratio
of 37 percent. Taking into account cash on the balance sheet of $780 million at the end of the second
quarter, EOG’s net debt was $6.2 billion with a net debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 34 percent. For a
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to the attached tables.
Proceeds from asset sales this year to date total $425 million. This includes proceeds from two
transactions that closed in the third quarter 2016. The assets were divested in more than a dozen
separate transactions of non-core natural gas and liquids-rich properties. Associated production of the
divested assets was 45 MMcfd of natural gas, 3,300 Bopd and 3,700 Bpd of NGLs. Sales of additional
non-core assets are in progress and anticipated to close in 2016.

Quantitative Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (Non-GAAP)
to Net Income (Loss) (GAAP)
(Unaudited; in thousands, except per share data)
 
 
The following chart adjusts the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
reported Net Income (Loss) (GAAP) to reflect actual net cash received from (payments for) settlements
of commodity derivative contracts by eliminating the unrealized mark-to-market (gains) losses from
these transactions, to eliminate the net losses on asset dispositions in 2015 and 2016, to eliminate the
impact of the Texas margin tax rate reduction in 2015, to add back severance costs associated with
EOG's North American operations in 2015, to eliminate the impact of the Trinidad tax settlement in
2016 and to add back certain voluntary retirement expense in 2016. EOG believes this presentation
may be useful to investors who follow the practice of some industry analysts who adjust reported
company earnings to match hedge realizations to production settlement months and make certain other
adjustments to exclude non-recurring items. EOG management uses this information for purposes of
comparing its financial performance with the financial performance of other companies in the industry.

Direct After-Tax Rate of Return (ATROR)
 
The calculation of our direct after-tax rate of return (ATROR) with respect to our capital expenditure
program for a particular play or well is based on the estimated proved reserves ("net" to EOG’s interest)
for all wells in such play or such well (as the case may be), the estimated net present value (NPV) of
the future net cash flows from such reserves (for which we utilize certain assumptions regarding future
commodity prices and operating costs) and our direct net costs incurred in drilling or acquiring (as the
case may be) such wells or well (as the case may be). As such, our direct ATROR with respect to our
capital expenditures for a particular play or well cannot be calculated from our consolidated financial
statements.
 
Direct ATROR
Based on Cash Flow and Time Value of Money
  - Estimated future commodity prices and operating costs
  - Costs incurred to drill, complete and equip a well, including facilities
Excludes Indirect Capital
  - Gathering and Processing and other Midstream
  - Land, Seismic, Geological and Geophysical
 
Payback ~12 Months on 100% Direct ATROR Wells
First Five Years ~1/2 Estimated Ultimate Recovery Produced but ~3/4 of NPV Captured
 
 
Return on Equity / Return on Capital Employed
Based on GAAP Accrual Accounting
Includes All Indirect Capital and Growth Capital for Infrastructure
  - Eagle Ford, Bakken, Permian Facilities

The following chart reconciles Net Interest Expense (GAAP), Net Income (Loss) (GAAP), Current and
Long-Term Debt (GAAP) and Total Capitalization (GAAP) to After-Tax Net Interest Expense (Non-
GAAP), Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), Net Debt (Non-GAAP) and Total Capitalization (Non-
GAAP), respectively, as used in the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and Return on Equity (ROE)
calculations. EOG believes this presentation may be useful to investors who follow the practice of some
industry analysts who utilize After-Tax Net Interest Expense, Adjusted Net Income, Net Debt and Total
Capitalization (Non-GAAP) in their ROCE and ROE calculations. EOG management uses this
information for purposes of comparing its financial performance with the financial performance of other
companies in the industry.
