<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 18 September 2014, the Human Rights Council held, pursuant to its resolution 
</p>
<p>24/16, a panel discussion on the role of prevention in the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights. In decision 24/16, the Council requested the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to organize the panel discussion in 
</p>
<p>consultation with States, relevant United Nations bodies, funds and programmes, treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies, special procedures and regional human rights mechanisms, and civil society, 
</p>
<p>including non-governmental organizations, and national human rights institutions, with a 
</p>
<p>view to ensuring multi-stakeholder participation. The Council also requested OHCHR to 
</p>
<p>prepare a report on the outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary, and to 
</p>
<p>present it to the Council at its twenty-eighth session. The present report was prepared 
</p>
<p>pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 24/16, the panel discussion aimed to 
</p>
<p>contribute to developing further the concept of prevention of human rights violations and 
</p>
<p>raising awareness of prevention in the promotion and protection of human rights among 
</p>
<p>States and other relevant stakeholders in order to encourage its reflection in relevant 
</p>
<p>policies and strategies at the national, regional and international levels.  
</p>
<p>3. The panel discussion was chaired by the President of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>and moderated by the Adviser on Human Rights and Refugees at the Quaker United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office in Geneva, Rachel Brett. The Deputy High Commissioner gave an opening 
</p>
<p>address. The panel comprised the Special Rapporteur on minority issues, Rita Izs&#225;k; the 
</p>
<p>Vice-Chairperson of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the 
</p>
<p>Child and of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, Benyam Dawit Mezmur; the 
</p>
<p>Chairperson of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, Sima Samar; the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General of the Association for the Prevention of Torture, Mark Thomson; and the 
</p>
<p>Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Renato 
</p>
<p>Zerbini Ribeiro Le&#227;o. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening statement by the Deputy High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>4. In her opening remarks, the Deputy High Commissioner stated that all must strive, 
</p>
<p>as a matter of sound policy and moral conscience, to prevent violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>before they escalate into mass atrocities or conflict. She recalled that the duty of States to 
</p>
<p>take legislative, administrative and other appropriate measures to prevent human rights 
</p>
<p>violations was well established in law. She referred to the repeated statements made by the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee that States parties to the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights have an obligation, in responding to human rights violations, to take 
</p>
<p>preventive action to avoid recurrence. The toolbox of preventive measures spanned the 
</p>
<p>entire range of human rights responses. 
</p>
<p>5. Risk factors that may lead to serious violations of human rights included severe 
</p>
<p>discriminatory practices. The construction of identities in terms of &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221;, and the 
</p>
<p>depiction of a targeted group as dangerous, disloyal, inferior or a security or economic 
</p>
<p>threat, were often precursors for an escalation in human rights violations. She referred to a 
</p>
<p>statement made by the Special Rapporteur on minority issues, who had warned that, while 
</p>
<p>there was much discussion about the importance of prevention of mass atrocity crimes, 
</p>
<p>such as ethnic cleansing and genocide, Governments, civil society and the international 
</p>
<p>community must be alert to warning signs much earlier &#8211; when the very first words of hate 
</p>
<p>speech are uttered, or when media start to promote negative stereotypes.  </p>


<p>6. Mechanisms for early warning of human rights violations are already in place. They 
</p>
<p>included the special procedures, who every year conduct some 80 country visits and send 
</p>
<p>about 500 communications on both urgent and chronic human rights situations and cases; 
</p>
<p>and the systematic scrutiny of treaty bodies; and the universal periodic review. The Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council also had a mandate to contribute, through dialogue and cooperation, to the 
</p>
<p>prevention of human rights violations. In addition, non-governmental organizations also 
</p>
<p>played an indispensable role in early warning, for example by collecting and processing 
</p>
<p>data and suggesting options for action.  
</p>
<p>7. The Deputy High Commissioner recalled that the Secretary-General had given top 
</p>
<p>priority to prevention in his five-year action agenda for 2012-2017. His ground-breaking 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Up Front plan of action was founded on a commitment to the more 
</p>
<p>deliberate, thoughtful and coordinated use of the full range of United Nations resources, 
</p>
<p>mandates and skills in order to strengthen the ability of the United Nations system to 
</p>
<p>prevent and respond to serious human rights violations and complex crises effectively. The 
</p>
<p>plan of action recognized that patterns in human rights violations provide clear warning 
</p>
<p>signs of a looming crisis, and reflects a strong commitment to pool and analyse all available 
</p>
<p>information from actors within the United Nations, activating high-level engagement and 
</p>
<p>leadership at Headquarters. The aim of the Human Rights Up Front plan of action was to 
</p>
<p>become more effective at ensuring that the information gathered by human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms were brought to the attention of the relevant actors, and that their 
</p>
<p>recommendations were followed up on and implemented. This effort had to engage not 
</p>
<p>only the States in question and the entities of the United Nations family but also regional 
</p>
<p>actors and the wider international community.  
</p>
<p>8. The post-2015 process provided an opportunity to ensure policy coherence in terms 
</p>
<p>of governance and justice and to encourage the realization of human rights related to 
</p>
<p>personal security, public participation and access to effective justice systems. A number of 
</p>
<p>the sustainable development goals under discussion had great potential for preventing 
</p>
<p>human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>9. The Deputy High Commissioner recalled that preventing human rights violations 
</p>
<p>was at the core of the mandate and activities of OHCHR. The measures at its disposal 
</p>
<p>included public advocacy, education and awareness-raising campaigns, quiet diplomacy 
</p>
<p>and good offices, and also the very practical, hands-on work of capacity-development and 
</p>
<p>technical assistance, which OHCHR undertook through its field presences. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>provided States with advice on the design and implementation of laws, policies, thematic 
</p>
<p>strategies and plans of action, and had developed a variety of specific practical tools, 
</p>
<p>including training materials, guidance notes and comprehensive databases.  
</p>
<p>10. Ultimately, however, States themselves were primarily responsible for preventing 
</p>
<p>human rights violations. OHCHR knew what worked: effective and broadly accessible 
</p>
<p>justice systems, backed by effective, human rights-compliant laws and institutions. The 
</p>
<p>Deputy High Commissioner highlighted the vital role that national human rights institutions 
</p>
<p>could play in prevention. Currently, it was mainly in the area of torture prevention that such 
</p>
<p>institutions exercised a specific preventive mandate, being designated as national 
</p>
<p>preventive mechanisms under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, although this could very 
</p>
<p>usefully be extended to other areas. 
</p>
<p>11. Lastly, the Deputy High Commissioner welcomed the fact that regional 
</p>
<p>organizations were strengthening the preventive dimension of their human rights activities, 
</p>
<p>and recalled that robust national protection systems with a strong emphasis on preventive 
</p>
<p>measures could usefully be complemented by regional and international mechanisms.  </p>


<p><b> III. Contributions of panellists 
</b></p>
<p>12. In her introductory remarks, the Adviser on Human Rights and Refugees at the 
</p>
<p>Quaker United Nations Office in Geneva and panel moderator, Rachel Brett, introduced the 
</p>
<p>panellists, highlighting their extensive experience and contributions to the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights. She outlined various aspects of prevention: firstly, prevention through the creation of 
</p>
<p>a protective and enabling human rights framework, given that, at the national level, it was 
</p>
<p>critical to have human rights provisions that can be invoked in and applied by the courts; 
</p>
<p>secondly, prevention through inclusion, which was more than non-discrimination, but 
</p>
<p>included the positive obligation to bring in different people and groups; and thirdly, 
</p>
<p>prevention through participation.  
</p>
<p>13. Recalling the High Commissioner&#8217;s opening remarks to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>at its twenty-seventh session that minorities were often victims of violence and atrocity 
</p>
<p>crimes, Ms. Brett invited the Special Rapporteur on minority issues, Rita Izs&#225;k, to outline 
</p>
<p>risk factors that constitute early warning signs for preventing and addressing violence and 
</p>
<p>mass atrocity crimes against minorities. The Special Rapporteur gave a rundown of her 
</p>
<p>findings contained in her annual report to the General Assembly,1 in which she listed the 
</p>
<p>risk factors identified during the course of her mandate: exclusion and inequalities; deficits 
</p>
<p>of democracy, good governance and rule of law; hate speech and stigmatization; history of 
</p>
<p>violence with impunity and tensions without reconciliation; denial or deprivation of 
</p>
<p>citizenship; political or regime change; multiple or intersectional discrimination; harmful 
</p>
<p>actions of non-State actors; and armed conflict. She emphasized that, of these, the key risk 
</p>
<p>areas for prevention work were exclusion and inequality, deficits of democracy, good 
</p>
<p>governance and rule of law, and hate speech.  
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur on minority issues stated that the likelihood of unrest and 
</p>
<p>violence grew whenever there were greater horizontal inequalities between different ethnic 
</p>
<p>or cultural groups in terms of political and economic status. For that reason, it was essential 
</p>
<p>that minorities and indigenous peoples be involved fully, including in shaping and 
</p>
<p>implementing development policies. Competition over territory and the distribution of 
</p>
<p>resources and power along ethnic lines could cause tensions. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>emphasized the importance of ensuring that minorities participated in the planning, 
</p>
<p>implementation and development of the post-2015 development agenda, underlining that it 
</p>
<p>was crucial to reach the most vulnerable and marginalized groups in society rather than just 
</p>
<p>those most easily accessible. She reminded the Council that hate speech was a process 
</p>
<p>aimed at dehumanizing and demonizing others and that affects not only the groups targeted 
</p>
<p>but also the majority by desensitizing it. 
</p>
<p>15. In answer to the moderator&#8217;s question on the elements that could play a key role in 
</p>
<p>preventing violence and atrocities against minorities, the Special Rapporteur on minority 
</p>
<p>issues referred to understanding the status and challenges facing different communities; 
</p>
<p>implementing international human rights standards; ensuring institutional attention to 
</p>
<p>minority issues; strengthening security measures and law enforcement bodies; granting 
</p>
<p>space for civil society; and cooperation with regional and international bodies. She 
</p>
<p>emphasized that an important tool for tackling ethnically or culturally biased favoritism in 
</p>
<p>the distribution of power and resources was good governance, which implied inclusion. It 
</p>
<p>was not enough to have good legislation in place; there had to be institutions with the 
</p>
<p>budget and independence to monitor the situation and to address tensions. Prevention work 
</p>
<p>would also be enhanced by the implementation of international human rights standards, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/69/266. </p>


<p>including minority rights. The protection and promotion of cultural identities would lead to 
</p>
<p>fewer conflicts and less tension.  
</p>
<p>16. The moderator asked the Vice-Chairperson of the African Committee of Experts on 
</p>
<p>the Rights and Welfare of the Child, Benyam Dawit Mezmur, what measures needed to be 
</p>
<p>taken to prevent violence against children. Mr. Mezmur replied that both the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child 
</p>
<p>explicitly requested that children grow up in an atmosphere of love, happiness and 
</p>
<p>understanding. Apart from being an obligation flowing from international human rights 
</p>
<p>law, the prevention of violence against children was morally compelling, developmentally 
</p>
<p>sound and cost-effective. He outlined the current global challenges in the implementation of 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights, pointing out that 165 States had set 18 years as the minimum age for 
</p>
<p>marriage, although 150 of them made exceptions. In 28 States that were home to one third 
</p>
<p>of the world&#8217;s children, corporal punishment was allowed in all settings. Furthermore, in 
</p>
<p>three States, it was still legal to execute a person for violations committed as a child. The 
</p>
<p>panellist emphasized that education &#8211; whether formal, non-formal or informal &#8211; was a key 
</p>
<p>factor in the prevention of violence against children, and that there was a need to move 
</p>
<p>from reporting what has happened to reporting before it happens.  
</p>
<p>17.  According to the Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the 
</p>
<p>largest prevention challenge on the ground was what he termed &#8220;one chapter behind&#8221; laws, 
</p>
<p>the use of twentieth century laws to respond to twenty-first century problems. What was 
</p>
<p>needed in all States were explicit and comprehensive bans, supplemented by specific bans 
</p>
<p>of, for example, domestic violence, corporal punishment and honour crimes. The 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of 
</p>
<p>the Child were normative documents that had to be translated into national laws given that 
</p>
<p>situations on the ground differed, depending on whether violence against children, corporal 
</p>
<p>punishment or other forms of violence against children were explicitly prohibited in 
</p>
<p>legislation. Lastly, the panellist highlighted the need for a data-collection system, a birth 
</p>
<p>registration system and a system for assessing and detecting risk factors. When conducting 
</p>
<p>research into risk factors in relation to violence, it was also essential to identify positive 
</p>
<p>factors that could protect children. Prevention required long-term investment and planning 
</p>
<p>by stakeholders and had to focus on the prevention of re-victimization, for instance by 
</p>
<p>means of child-sensitive recovery and social reintegration services. 
</p>
<p>18. In response to the moderator&#8217;s request for examples of effective strategies for 
</p>
<p>preventing violence against children at the regional level, the panellist welcomed the 
</p>
<p>preventive work of regional organizations, which complemented work carried out at the 
</p>
<p>international level, and also filled gaps. Regional organizations had expertise that was more 
</p>
<p>relevant to the regions. Regional organizations in Africa had been able to address the trust 
</p>
<p>deficit, where Governments, civil society or stakeholders felt that the approach was top-
</p>
<p>down rather than bottom-up. Regional organizations had a greater capacity for early 
</p>
<p>detection, and could draw on experience from comparable situations in regional countries. 
</p>
<p>Regional preventive efforts were therefore particularly effective, given that some countries 
</p>
<p>respond best to examples drawn from neighbouring ones.  
</p>
<p>19. The Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the Child also emphasized 
</p>
<p>the importance of working closely with parliamentarians, who were in a key position to 
</p>
<p>influence prevention. He provided concrete examples of regional successes, such as tapping 
</p>
<p>into social and cultural structures on the ground, for example, children who, rather than 
</p>
<p>being put through formal judicial procedures, go through the informal justice sector. He 
</p>
<p>also pointed out that children could play a role in the prevention of violence. According to 
</p>
<p>the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, children can have 
</p>
<p>responsibilities, taking into account their maturity and capacity, without violating the 
</p>
<p>provisions of the Charter itself; for example, when the Child Rights Act was being debated </p>


<p>in Nigeria, there was concern that children were being given too many rights. With the help 
</p>
<p>of regional organizations, however, a provision on the responsibilities of children was 
</p>
<p>included to address such issues as peer-to-peer violence. The panellist underscored the 
</p>
<p>necessity of government budgeting for prevention work. Regional organizations had helped 
</p>
<p>Governments address this issue in Africa; in South Africa, for example, social workers 
</p>
<p>were not only provided for by law, but also had a budget line. As an example of a good 
</p>
<p>practice, he referred to the process and activities surrounding 16 June, the Day of the 
</p>
<p>African Child, addressing harmful practices. Quiet diplomacy had also proved an effective 
</p>
<p>tool in the African region. 
</p>
<p>20. Noting the vital role of national human rights institutions in a strong national human 
</p>
<p>rights prevention system, the moderator invited the Chairperson of the Afghanistan 
</p>
<p>Independent Human Rights Commission, Sima Samar, to share examples of the preventive 
</p>
<p>work conducted by her organization. Ms. Samar provided four recommendations for action 
</p>
<p>based on challenges that the Commission had faced. Firstly, lack of education and of 
</p>
<p>awareness of rights was the greatest obstacle to the enjoyment of all human rights by all 
</p>
<p>persons. The Commission strove to counter this situation by including human rights 
</p>
<p>education in all sectors of the education system, including training and teaching curricula 
</p>
<p>for schools, teachers, police, judges, intelligence services and other civil servants. The 
</p>
<p>second action recommended was human rights monitoring. The Commission monitored 
</p>
<p>detention centres and prisons, hospitals and schools and camps for internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons and refugees. It also monitored the situation of economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>and issued assessment reports. It also worked in the area of transitional justice as a 
</p>
<p>prevention tool. Thirdly, it was important to consider existing laws in each country. The 
</p>
<p>Commission participated in legal reform and publicly criticized human rights violations, 
</p>
<p>working with civil society and the media for advocacy purposes. It also pushed for the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of human rights in legislation. Fourthly, on the issue of protection and promotion, 
</p>
<p>the panellist emphasized the importance of providing practical protection to people in 
</p>
<p>danger, promoting good governance and working on transitional justice to end the culture 
</p>
<p>of impunity.  
</p>
<p>21. The moderator requested the panelist to explain what has worked best at the national 
</p>
<p>level in the prevention of violence against women in Afghanistan. The panellist reiterated 
</p>
<p>her view that lack of awareness of human rights was the largest obstacle. Her organization 
</p>
<p>promoted the universality of human rights, and emphasized that culture and religion could 
</p>
<p>not take priority over these rights. The organization had also conducted research on issues 
</p>
<p>that were considered taboo in the country, such as rape and honour killings. This was the 
</p>
<p>first time that data had been collected on these problems, which made it possible to draw 
</p>
<p>attention to them as crimes that the State had to address. Another goal of the Commission&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>work was to include women in different sectors of society, such as security forces, for 
</p>
<p>example, by striving to assure a environment that meets women&#8217;s needs, thus making it 
</p>
<p>possible for them to train and become police officers. Lastly, the Commission had worked 
</p>
<p>with the media, the United Nations and civil society to advocate for the inclusion of 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights in national legislation. Once this has been achieved, the next challenge will 
</p>
<p>be to ensure that the law is implemented. 
</p>
<p>22. Recalling that the concept of prevention in relation to torture was more developed 
</p>
<p>than those of preventing other human rights violations, the moderator asked the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General of the Association for the Prevention of Torture, Mark Thomson, to explain this 
</p>
<p>concept and how it could be applied to other areas. Mr. Thomson highlighted two key 
</p>
<p>elements for the prevention of torture. The first was direct prevention (or mitigation of 
</p>
<p>violations) by reducing risk factors and possible causes. Direct prevention was forward-
</p>
<p>looking and was aimed at creating an environment where torture was unlikely to occur. The 
</p>
<p>second was indirect prevention (or non-repetition), which was the prevention of the 
</p>
<p>repetition of cases that have already occurred by means of denunciation, litigation, </p>


<p>prosecution and sanctions, aimed at convincing potential torturers that the &#8220;costs&#8221; are 
</p>
<p>greater than the possible &#8220;benefits&#8221;. He underscored the fact that these approaches were 
</p>
<p>applicable across the spectrum of the prevention of human rights violations. He also 
</p>
<p>outlined the tangible aspects of direct prevention, such as assessing root causes rather than 
</p>
<p>focusing on symptoms, identifying and addressing risk factors at different levels, in terms 
</p>
<p>of situations (for example, cases of deprivation of liberty) and persons at risk and their 
</p>
<p>vulnerabilities, environmental factors, gaps in protection, and the institutional culture that 
</p>
<p>created incentives and/or failure to deter. Lastly, prevention required a holistic, 
</p>
<p>multidisciplinary approach, involving multiple actors on many fronts. It also required 
</p>
<p>constructive ongoing dialogue with authorities on ways and means to address risk factors.  
</p>
<p>23. The moderator asked the panellist to elaborate on strategies that were effective in the 
</p>
<p>prevention of torture, how they could be applied in other areas and the role that civil society 
</p>
<p>could play in this process. The panellist underscored the importance of using holistic 
</p>
<p>strategies that included four complementary elements: a strong legal and policy framework 
</p>
<p>that prohibited and prevented torture (ratification of core human rights treaties, legislation, 
</p>
<p>but also regulations); implementation of the said legal framework through prosecution and 
</p>
<p>sentencing, as well as training, capacity-building and procedural safeguards, such as 
</p>
<p>registers in places of detention and video recordings of interrogations; independent 
</p>
<p>oversight, including regular monitoring of places of detention by independent bodies, in 
</p>
<p>particular by national preventive mechanisms under the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture; and communication and contributions to public debates, given 
</p>
<p>the need for strong public opposition to torture. With regard to the third element, the 
</p>
<p>panellist pointed out that, where national preventive mechanisms were compliant with the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol, had a strong legal basis and adequate human and financial resources, and 
</p>
<p>fully implemented their preventive mandate, they could contribute effectively to reducing 
</p>
<p>the risk of torture in places of detention. When independent members of civil society had 
</p>
<p>full access to all areas, they could provide officials with informed recommendations based 
</p>
<p>on their analysis. Again, all of these strategies could be applied across the spectrum of the 
</p>
<p>prevention of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>24. After stating how the work of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights had been instrumental in clarifying the duty to prevent violations of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights, the moderator invited the Vice-Chairperson of the Committee, 
</p>
<p>Renato Zerbini Ribeiro Le&#227;o, to share the Committee&#8217;s observations in this regard. He 
</p>
<p>explained that the prevention work of the Committee was carried out at all stages, including 
</p>
<p>during the preparation of lists of issues, concluding observations, general comments and 
</p>
<p>letters. In the lists of issues addressed by the Committee, States are requested to provide 
</p>
<p>information on measures taken to prevent violations, such as ensuring access to education, 
</p>
<p>the work of civil society and access to economic, social and cultural rights in general. The 
</p>
<p>Committee requested States to make reference to specific actions pursuant to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Social, Cultural and Economic Rights. Concluding observations 
</p>
<p>included specific recommendations for States to take preventing measures in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the Covenant and in the light of the general comments issued by the 
</p>
<p>Committee. Lastly, the Committee could also address letters to States parties on ways in 
</p>
<p>which they should comply with the Covenant, for example by incorporating the Covenant 
</p>
<p>into domestic laws and raising awareness of its provisions. For example, in a letter dated 16 
</p>
<p>May 2012, the Committee expressed its concern surrounding austerity measures taken by 
</p>
<p>States parties and increasing inequality. It emphasized that States should at all times avoid 
</p>
<p>making decisions that result in the denial or infringement of rights. The panellist also 
</p>
<p>highlighted the Committee&#8217;s wish that the provisions of the Covenant be incorporated into 
</p>
<p>State legislation, that States harmonize their legislation with the Covenant, promote the 
</p>
<p>Covenant and use it in legal proceedings. He reminded States that ratifying the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Covenant was also an important preventive action. </p>


<p>25. The moderator asked the panellist to share examples of good practices identified by 
</p>
<p>the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and to highlight areas where 
</p>
<p>progress had been made. The panellist highlighted combating poverty and inclusive 
</p>
<p>education also for girls across different regions and countries around the world. The 
</p>
<p>Committee had also stressed the need for reliable indicators and up-to-date statistics, 
</p>
<p>particularly in relation to populations who had difficult access to rights. Statistics had made 
</p>
<p>it possible to discern which rights were best protected by States. The involvement of States 
</p>
<p>had led to more reliable statistics and indicators. The involvement of civil society should 
</p>
<p>also be promoted. Lastly, treaty bodies helped to identify governmental best practices and 
</p>
<p>to convey them to other Governments.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Summary of the discussion 
</b></p>
<p>26. During the interactive discussion, delegations from Algeria, Angola, Australia (also 
</p>
<p>on behalf of a group of States), Austria, Azerbaijan, Cuba, Estonia, the European Union, 
</p>
<p>Georgia, India, Lithuania, Maldives, Morocco, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, 
</p>
<p>Poland, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation (on behalf 
</p>
<p>of a group of like-minded States), Senegal (on behalf of French-speaking countries), Sierra 
</p>
<p>Leone, Slovenia, Timor-Leste, Ukraine and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) took the 
</p>
<p>floor. The statements of Burkina Faso, Denmark, Ecuador, Indonesia, Ireland, Pakistan, 
</p>
<p>Rwanda, Thailand and the United States of America were not made owing to lack of time. 
</p>
<p>Copies of their statements were, however, posted on the extranet of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council. 
</p>
<p>27. Representatives of non-governmental organizations and observers also took the 
</p>
<p>floor, including the African Technology Development Link, Americans for Democracy and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights in Bahrain, the International Association for Democracy in Africa, the 
</p>
<p>International Committee of the Red Cross and United Schools International.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Concept of prevention and prevention tools 
</b></p>
<p>28. Several delegations emphasized that the adoption of preventive measures was an 
</p>
<p>absolute and urgent necessity, and that there was a vital need to strengthen preventive 
</p>
<p>approaches to human rights violations. Some pointed out that prevention was one of the 
</p>
<p>most effective ways to protect human rights, and expressed the view that the prevention of 
</p>
<p>violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law was not 
</p>
<p>only necessary but achievable. Some delegations considered that the numerous crises 
</p>
<p>around the world leading to human rights violations demonstrated the importance of 
</p>
<p>strengthening prevention and the need to understand the various aspects of prevention 
</p>
<p>better in order to design practical preventive tools. Several delegations pointed out that, at 
</p>
<p>the national and international levels, mechanisms and tools for prevention already existed. 
</p>
<p>It was implementation that needed to be further developed. Several delegations emphasized 
</p>
<p>the fact that the Human Rights Council had a crucial role to play in strengthening national 
</p>
<p>protection mechanisms and contributing to the prevention of human rights violations, and 
</p>
<p>that it has at its disposal all the necessary tools &#8211; the universal periodic review mechanism, 
</p>
<p>the special procedures and the treaty bodies &#8211; to strengthen national protection mechanisms 
</p>
<p>and to help countries to become more resilient in the face of human rights crises.  
</p>
<p>29. Delegations agreed that the discussions held by the Human Rights Council, the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review mechanism, the work of the special procedures and the treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies and the technical assistance given by OHCHR advanced the prevention objective. 
</p>
<p>Support for institution-building, strengthening the rule of law and accountability 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, encouraging equitable and inclusive social structures and economic growth, </p>


<p>sharing best practices and responding to early warning signs, the ratification of international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, human rights-compliant legislation and the dissemination of a 
</p>
<p>human rights culture were some of the prevention tools mentioned by delegations. 
</p>
<p>30. One delegation expressed the hope that the panel discussion would be a stepping 
</p>
<p>stone towards the creation of prevention mechanisms urgently needed in many parts of the 
</p>
<p>world today witnessing grave human rights violations. Another delegation believed that 
</p>
<p>strengthening existing mechanisms was necessary, including to avoid misuse of biased 
</p>
<p>allegations of human rights violations, in particular in the field of the rights of ethnic and 
</p>
<p>national minorities, as a pretext for military intervention. Another supported the call for 
</p>
<p>strengthening existing prevention mechanisms and ensuring that preventing genocide and 
</p>
<p>other massive abuses of human rights was a priority above all other political and economic 
</p>
<p>interests. 
</p>
<p>31. Some delegations stated that the concept of prevention was not clear and needed to 
</p>
<p>be defined in more explicit and measurable terms, and in a more nuanced and consensual 
</p>
<p>manner. There was a need to engage in evidence-based research to understand all aspects of 
</p>
<p>prevention and to develop tools, involving all stakeholders, in particular Member 
</p>
<p>States. They warned that the development of such tools should eschew politicization, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;naming and shaming&#8221; and intrusive approaches by powerful or influential States, and 
</p>
<p>should be based on the principles of universality and non-selectivity. It was stressed that a 
</p>
<p>universal agreement taking into account the suggestions and concerns of all Member States 
</p>
<p>was important, as it would help in the design of an acceptable mechanism for common and 
</p>
<p>quick action and ensure effective implementation. An impartial and transparent assessment 
</p>
<p>of all situations with accountability as the guiding norm for those involved in the analysis 
</p>
<p>and execution was recommended. Mr. Thomson responded to States&#8217; concerns about 
</p>
<p>prevention being used as an international &#8220;naming and shaming&#8221; exercise by explaining 
</p>
<p>that the intention was quite the opposite &#8211; to assess risk factors and causes in order to 
</p>
<p>address them responsibly, and to find solutions with long-term effects on risk reduction. 
</p>
<p>The purpose was also to bring different actors together to find solutions, for which 
</p>
<p>openness was required. 
</p>
<p>32. Some delegations were of the view that there was a need to go beyond the 
</p>
<p>theoretical and conceptual framework of prevention. Others highlighted that specific 
</p>
<p>national contexts should be considered when designing preventive technical assistance; one 
</p>
<p>delegation emphasized the need to ensure that assistance was relevant to local actors, using 
</p>
<p>words, concepts and ideas that resonated locally. Another delegation added that a 
</p>
<p>standardized approach to developing and exporting training packages or assistance had to 
</p>
<p>be avoided. Another emphasized that the concept of prevention had to encompass all 
</p>
<p>human rights, while yet another highlighted the importance of ensuring the protection of 
</p>
<p>minority rights (including through the mainstreaming of minority rights in the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system) with a view to preventing conflicts. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Responsibility to prevent human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>33. Delegations and panellists stressed the fact that the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights and, by extension, the prevention of human rights violations are primarily the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of States. States were able to create an environment conducive to the 
</p>
<p>prevention of human rights violations by, for example, adopting domestic legal and 
</p>
<p>institutional frameworks and strengthening their implementation. Ms. Brett and Mr. Zerbini 
</p>
<p>Ribeiro Le&#227;o pointed out that this national responsibility extended to Governments at all 
</p>
<p>levels, and that interaction and cooperation between State institutions and different levels 
</p>
<p>and branches of the Government were indispensable. Some delegations emphasized that it 
</p>
<p>was imperative that all prevention efforts respect fully the sovereignty, independence and </p>


<p>territorial integrity of all States Members of the United Nations, while one delegation stated 
</p>
<p>that all non-national attempts to be prescriptive in relation to managing human rights should 
</p>
<p>be avoided. Other delegations stated that the responsibility to prevent did not constitute a 
</p>
<p>threat to States&#8217; sovereignty. Several stressed that the responsibility to prevent was closely 
</p>
<p>linked to the responsibility to protect and that the international community should 
</p>
<p>encourage States to meet their responsibility to prevent human rights violations and to 
</p>
<p>protect their populations, and help them in these efforts. Others considered the concept of 
</p>
<p>responsibility to protect to be controversial, and should be decoupled from the 
</p>
<p>responsibility to prevent. One delegation suggested that the human rights situation in a 
</p>
<p>country was more likely to be improved by actions taken by the State and its citizens rather 
</p>
<p>than through an external intervention. This was especially true in the long run, given that 
</p>
<p>external actors could only provide support for a limited period. The answer thus lay in 
</p>
<p>providing State institutions with adequate resources, sensitizing them and making them 
</p>
<p>aware of the language of human rights. 
</p>
<p>34. Mr. Thomson agreed that national responsibility was a key factor in prevention. He 
</p>
<p>emphasized, however, that a preventive framework very useful for States could be 
</p>
<p>developed internationally. National preventive mechanisms that function under the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture respected State sovereignty, while 
</p>
<p>other mechanisms whose purpose would be to assist States parties in implementing their 
</p>
<p>obligation to prevent human rights violations could follow the same model. While it was 
</p>
<p>possible to emphasize national responsibility, it made sense to do this through the lens of 
</p>
<p>international human rights law. The Special Rapporteur added that, whereas most States 
</p>
<p>had ratified relevant human rights instruments, implementation was often lacking. Ms. 
</p>
<p>Samar reaffirmed that it was the State&#8217;s responsibility to prevent, emphasizing at the same 
</p>
<p>time that the universality of human rights could not be negotiated on the pretext of a 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s sovereignty or other local factors. She also underlined the necessity of political 
</p>
<p>commitment of the State&#8217;s leaders to the promotion and protection of human rights to make 
</p>
<p>those values a reality.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Early warning  
</b></p>
<p>35. Both delegations and panellists stressed the importance of early warning in 
</p>
<p>prevention efforts. Some stressed that human rights violations were important early 
</p>
<p>indicators of a potential for atrocity crimes. Several delegations welcomed the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s Human Rights Up Front initiative aimed at strengthening the early warning 
</p>
<p>capacity of the whole United Nations system as an important contribution to the prevention 
</p>
<p>of human rights violations. Some emphasized in this regard that States should be in charge 
</p>
<p>of the implementation of the initiative, and cautioned that prevention work had to be carried 
</p>
<p>out without undermining the fundamental principles of the United Nations and that the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights should not focus on imposing unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures or condemning States. One delegation urged all States to internalize the initiative. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur emphasized the importance of the initiative, early warning 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and the political will to act upon the early warning signs. She stressed the need 
</p>
<p>for cooperation between the United Nations offices in Geneva and New York in this regard, 
</p>
<p>and cautioned that problems observed during visits to countries by special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders should be reported immediately so that early action could be taken 
</p>
<p>promptly. 
</p>
<p>36. One delegation stated that comprehensive early warning capacities and the full use 
</p>
<p>of existing international instruments, mechanisms and procedures were required to translate 
</p>
<p>prevention into practice. Another delegation encouraged States and other stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>strengthen their efforts to identify warning signs. Another pointed out that attention to </p>


<p>violations of minority rights at an early stage would make an invaluable contribution to the 
</p>
<p>culture of prevention within the United Nations, saving lives and promoting stability and 
</p>
<p>development. The incorporation of minority rights indicators into early warning systems 
</p>
<p>would also enable earlier identification of potential conflicts. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>informed those present in this regard that the 2014 Forum on Minority Issues would address 
</p>
<p>the issue of preventing violence and atrocity crimes targeting minorities. 
</p>
<p>37.  One delegation stated that the Human Rights Council had to, through such 
</p>
<p>mechanisms as the universal period review or the special procedures, provide information 
</p>
<p>that could be used for early warning purposes and be incorporated into responses of the 
</p>
<p>entire United Nations system. It was also mentioned that a vibrant civil society and the 
</p>
<p>media could act as early warning agents. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Prevention actors 
</b></p>
<p>38. Delegations and panellists emphasized that, apart from States, other actors play an 
</p>
<p>important role in prevention efforts. In their view, strategic and integrated prevention 
</p>
<p>policies could only be successful when multi-stakeholder participation was ensured. 
</p>
<p>Delegations pointed out that international and regional systems should assist States in the 
</p>
<p>domestic implementation of such policies, and that United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and bodies played a role in supporting States in preventing violations. The 
</p>
<p>prevention of human rights violations was at the heart of the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>Cooperation between States and the United Nations was seen as the key to effective 
</p>
<p>prevention. Some delegations emphasized the need for further development and 
</p>
<p>enhancement of cooperation between regional actors and the United Nations, especially by 
</p>
<p>sharing good practices, jointly identifying gaps and overlap and defining common 
</p>
<p>priorities. 
</p>
<p>39. One delegation stated that the role of the international community, including 
</p>
<p>relevant United Nations agencies, should be to enhance partnerships with States. This 
</p>
<p>should include the allocation of financial, technical and human resources by donors and 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies, and be aligned with national priorities of the States concerned. 
</p>
<p>Some delegations listed support for national mechanisms and institutions though capacity-
</p>
<p>building and technical assistance as one of the main roles of OHCHR in prevention efforts. 
</p>
<p>The important role of civil society, national human rights institutions, researchers and 
</p>
<p>media in preventing human rights violations by monitoring, advocacy, human rights 
</p>
<p>education and awareness-raising was also acknowledged by delegations and panellists. The 
</p>
<p>involvement of civil society in prevention efforts was seen as crucial. The need for States to 
</p>
<p>promote and maintain a safe and enabling environment for civil society was emphasized by 
</p>
<p>several delegations. The issue of preventing reprisals against civil society participating in 
</p>
<p>the work of the Human Rights Council was raised by one non-governmental organization in 
</p>
<p>this regard. At the national level, the role of human rights institutions was seen as 
</p>
<p>fundamental, and several delegations called upon States to strengthen the role and mandate 
</p>
<p>of institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles. Some delegations also emphasized 
</p>
<p>the role of scientific institutions and businesses. 
</p>
<p>40. Mr. Mezmur stated that the preventive role of regional and United Nations bodies 
</p>
<p>was complementary, as were regional instruments and United Nations instruments, and 
</p>
<p>highlighted the importance of research in challenging assumptions. Comprehensive systems 
</p>
<p>had to be established for data collection and accountability. Ms. Samar highlighted the need 
</p>
<p>for a united approach to prevention for United Nations agencies, and emphasized that 
</p>
<p>women, minorities, vulnerable groups and victims of violations had to be included in 
</p>
<p>prevention strategizing and policymaking if the policies were to be practical and 
</p>
<p>implementable. Mr. Thomson emphasized that various actors should be involved in </p>


<p>different ways to assist States, and that effective prevention was not possible without 
</p>
<p>dialogue with the public. The Special Rapporteur stated that there was a need to manage 
</p>
<p>diversity in societies constructively, and to return to the principle of inclusivity. She also 
</p>
<p>pointed out that, in post-violence situations, minorities whose rights had been violated had 
</p>
<p>to be part of the peacebuilding process, and that ensuring their right to truth was essential to 
</p>
<p>preventing a recurrence of violations. 
</p>
<p>41. Reiterating that that inclusion of victims of human rights violations in prevention 
</p>
<p>discussions and efforts was crucial, Ms. Brett pointed out that, while regional organizations 
</p>
<p>and the United Nations were not and should not be primary actors in prevention, they had a 
</p>
<p>very important role in identifying and sharing best practices and identifying risk factors that 
</p>
<p>could otherwise pass unnoticed until it was too late. Awareness-raising was needed not just 
</p>
<p>among Governments, people and State institutions, but also at the national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international levels.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Human rights education and culture 
</b></p>
<p>42. Delegations and panellists agreed that human rights education was a key factor to 
</p>
<p>prevention. According to one delegation, the prevention of human rights violations could be 
</p>
<p>best achieved in cultures where everyone&#8217;s human rights and dignity were respected. 
</p>
<p>Another delegation emphasized that professionals had to be trained in order to create a 
</p>
<p>wider understanding of human rights, equality and non-discrimination, with a view to 
</p>
<p>combating stereotypes and violence, fostering respect for diversity, promoting tolerance 
</p>
<p>and intercultural dialogue, and raising awareness of the universality, indivisibility and 
</p>
<p>interrelatedness of all human rights. Another delegation pointed out that, in order to build a 
</p>
<p>human rights culture in all countries, informal preventative structures had to be cultivated 
</p>
<p>alongside formal institutions. Emphasis should be placed on cultivating values, norms and 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights, especially in emerging democracies. The delegation requested that 
</p>
<p>this aspect be highlighted in future discussions on the role of prevention in the promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of human rights, which should, inter alia, explore ways of strengthening 
</p>
<p>relevant formal and informal structures within communities.  
</p>
<p>43. Another delegation advocated for fostering familiarity with international human 
</p>
<p>rights laws, treaties, conventions and agencies as the most sustainable method for sovereign 
</p>
<p>Governments to discharge their responsibility to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>According to another, awareness-raising was an important preventive measure given that 
</p>
<p>some human rights abuses are committed inadvertently owing to a lack of awareness. The 
</p>
<p>delegation cited the example of female genital mutilation, the harmful effects of which are 
</p>
<p>at times not known to or appreciated by the perpetrators. One observer stated that States 
</p>
<p>had the responsibility to integrate international norms in national law and to disseminate 
</p>
<p>knowledge of the rules.  
</p>
<p>44. Mr. Mezmur agreed that violations could be unintentional and be due to neglect, and 
</p>
<p>explained that this was why a criminal law-based approach was not always the best way to 
</p>
<p>deal with human rights issues. He also highlighted the importance of seeing children as 
</p>
<p>agents of change and of starting human rights education early, and identifying and 
</p>
<p>promoting positive values, such as respect and inclusion. He cited a national example where 
</p>
<p>intergenerational values promoting respect for others' differences were fostered. Children 
</p>
<p>had to learn that they could disagree without being disagreeable, and be perceived as human 
</p>
<p>beings in their own right. Mr. Zerbini Ribeiro Le&#227;o pointed out that the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights had seen how important it was to provide 
</p>
<p>information on the rights contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights to the general public and various State actors, in particular members of the 
</p>
<p>executive branch of government. Ms. Brett pointed out that human rights education was not </p>


<p>only about teaching about human rights instruments, but also how they were taught. It was 
</p>
<p>a process, not just an event, and should permeate all levels of the educational system. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur emphasized that education was the key to challenging dangerous 
</p>
<p>ideologies. She added that it was necessary to learn how to manage diversity in society 
</p>
<p>constructively. It was of utmost importance to return to the principle of inclusivity not only 
</p>
<p>in government but also in primary education, where learning about diversity should be 
</p>
<p>included in curricula.  
</p>
<p><b> F. International solidarity and cooperation, and the question of resources 
</b></p>
<p>45. According to some delegations, preventive efforts should concentrate on 
</p>
<p>international solidarity, capacity-building and financial aid instead of public denunciations 
</p>
<p>and sanctions. The Human Rights Council would be more successful if existing guidance 
</p>
<p>were used to enable countries rather than condemn them. Concern was expressed about 
</p>
<p>powerful States using the United Nations to impose their beliefs on others; more emphasis 
</p>
<p>had to be placed on a spirit of cooperation. Mr. Thomson provided an example of 
</p>
<p>cooperation: the prevention of torture, while a sensitive topic, was an area in which over the 
</p>
<p>past 10 years an increasing number of States had begun to work together, recognizing that 
</p>
<p>they faced the same problems and that they could learn from each other, for example by 
</p>
<p>joint visits to national preventive mechanisms. He considered that this approach could be 
</p>
<p>followed in other areas. 
</p>
<p>46. Some delegations expressed concern that political will, legislation and plans were 
</p>
<p>not sufficient to prevent human rights abuses, given that resources were necessary for 
</p>
<p>serious preventive efforts, and they were not always readily available. The point was made 
</p>
<p>that ensuring the right to development is a form of prevention; developing countries 
</p>
<p>therefore needed resources to raise their development level in order to address all aspects of 
</p>
<p>prevention. One delegation argued that fulfilling the right to development would also 
</p>
<p>alleviate poverty, which had been seen to be a contributing factor to human rights abuses, 
</p>
<p>such as child, early and forced marriage.  
</p>
<p>47. Mr. Mezmur suggested that lack of money was not always the &#8220;root of all evil&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Compliance with human rights did not necessarily correlate with countries with high levels 
</p>
<p>of resources. Many of the countries making progress at the regional level did not have 
</p>
<p>extensive resources. He argued that the prevention of violence against children was cost-
</p>
<p>effective, and budget provisions needed to be made for prevention. The first step, however, 
</p>
<p>was birth registration so that children could be counted and progress measured. According 
</p>
<p>to Mr. Zerbini Ribeiro Le&#227;o, States were required to provide in the reports that they 
</p>
<p>submitted to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights information on 
</p>
<p>resources allocated to the protection of economic, social and cultural rights and their 
</p>
<p>effectiveness, outcomes and expected results. They were to indicate financial, educational 
</p>
<p>and social matters that had an impact on policies for prevention. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>pointed out that sometimes it was creativity rather than resources that was needed for 
</p>
<p>prevention. Mr. Thomson also addressed the issue of prevention in the absence of 
</p>
<p>resources, proposing the idea of using codes of conduct to give people incentives to follow 
</p>
<p>different modes of behaviour, ultimately a cost-free way of changing organizational 
</p>
<p>cultures to more human rights-based ways than the application of sanctions.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Combating impunity, and other conditions facilitating prevention</b> 
</p>
<p>48. Several delegations and panellists highlighted the importance of accountability and 
</p>
<p>actions to combat impunity and ensure the rule of law in order to prevent violations, 
</p>
<p>including the importance of criminalization and prosecution and the preventive role of the </p>


<p>International Criminal Court. One delegation called upon all States that had not yet acceded 
</p>
<p>to the Rome Statute to do so. Another argued that there was a need to build a framework 
</p>
<p>where human rights violations were transparently exposed and sanctioned without 
</p>
<p>exception. According to one observer, consequences for violations were the only way to 
</p>
<p>ensure that they did not take place in the first place.  
</p>
<p>49. The delegations and panellists also highlighted other conditions necessary for the 
</p>
<p>effective prevention of human rights violations, such as tackling risk factors, including 
</p>
<p>inequality, poverty, marginalization, lack of awareness and education, and assuring good 
</p>
<p>governance, a democratic system and the rule of law, including a legal system of equal and 
</p>
<p>fair access to justice for all. Some delegations argued that preventive action should 
</p>
<p>concentrate on eradicating poverty, formulating inclusive policies and strengthening 
</p>
<p>education, in quantity as much as in quality.  
</p>
<p>50. Mr. Zerbini Ribeiro Le&#227;o stressed the fact that the Committee on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights had recognized that a robust legislative framework was indispensable 
</p>
<p>for the preventive action involved in combating discrimination. He argued that measures 
</p>
<p>should be taken to strengthen prevention by protecting social, cultural and economic rights. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mezmur stressed that unless laws were participatory, took public opinion into account 
</p>
<p>or there were resources for their implementation, they would not be effective. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> Participants in the panel discussion agreed that, while there were mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>and tools for prevention at the national and international levels, their implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>was patchy and needed to be improved. They acknowledged that the discussions held 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Human Rights Council, the sessions of the universal periodic review, the work 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the special procedures and the treaty bodies and the technical assistance provided 
</b></p>
<p><b>by OHCHR all advanced the prevention objective. There was general support for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>idea to further develop the concept of prevention through evidence-based research. 
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> Participants stressed that the promotion and protection of human rights and, 
</b></p>
<p><b>by extension, the prevention of human rights violations were the primarily 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities of States, while other actors too played an important role in 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention efforts. They acknowledged the important role of civil society, national 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights institutions, researchers and the media in preventing human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations by monitoring, advocacy, human rights education and awareness-raising. 
</b></p>
<p><b>International and regional systems had an important role in assisting States with 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic implementation. United Nations human rights mechanisms and bodies were 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential in helping States to prevent violations. The prevention of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations was at the heart of the United Nations system, and early warnings were 
</b></p>
<p><b>critical to successful prevention efforts. Human rights education was also a key factor 
</b></p>
<p><b>in prevention. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> The importance of accountability and action to combat impunity and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement the rule of law and thus prevent violations, including the importance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminalization and prosecution and the preventive role of the International Criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Court, was acknowledged. The other conditions necessary for the effective prevention 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights violations highlighted by participants included tackling risk factors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including inequality, poverty, marginalization, lack of awareness and education, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing good governance, a democratic system and the rule of law.
