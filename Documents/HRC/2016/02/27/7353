<p><b>I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 27/22, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit to it at its twenty-ninth session a 
</p>
<p>compilation of good practices and major challenges in preventing and eliminating female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>2. The present compilation was prepared in consultation with States, United Nations 
</p>
<p>entities, civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders. All of the submissions 
</p>
<p>for the report can be found on the website Office of the of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).1  
</p>
<p><b> II. Definition and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>3. According to United Nations entities, female genital mutilation includes procedures 
</p>
<p>involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitals or other injury to the 
</p>
<p>female genital organs for non-therapeutic reasons.2 According to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), in the 29 countries for which data was available, more than 
</p>
<p>130 million girls and women had been subjected to the practice. In half of those countries, 
</p>
<p>the majority of procedures had been completed before the girls had reached the age of five. 
</p>
<p>The practice can be found in some countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia and in 
</p>
<p>some communities in Latin America. It is also present in Europe, Australia and North 
</p>
<p>America among communities originating from countries where female genital mutilation is 
</p>
<p>practised.  
</p>
<p>4. The underlying reasons for the practice vary across cultures, between and within 
</p>
<p>communities; however, under the cultural, religious and social surface, it becomes clear that 
</p>
<p>they are all rooted in gender-based discrimination and harmful gender stereotypes about the 
</p>
<p>role of women and girls in society. Female genital mutilation appears to be used as a means 
</p>
<p>to control women&#8217;s sexuality and is linked to other violations based on patriarchy and 
</p>
<p>gendered norms, such as child and forced marriage, marital rape and intimate partner 
</p>
<p>violence. In many communities, it is seen as an important rite of passage into womanhood 
</p>
<p>and indicates a girl&#8217;s readiness for marriage. Among female refugees and migrants and 
</p>
<p>women with immigrant background, the practice can serve as marker of cultural identity 
</p>
<p>and is often perceived as a source of personal and collective identity.  
</p>
<p>5. The practice often compromises the natural functions of girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s bodies 
</p>
<p>and has a profoundly detrimental impact on the health of women and girls, including their 
</p>
<p>psychological and sexual and reproductive health. The short-term consequences of female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation can include death from hemorrhaging and severe pain, trauma and 
</p>
<p>infections that may result from the procedure.3 Long-term consequences can include

</p>
<p> 3 Immediate complications can include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage (bleeding), tetanus or sepsis 
</p>
<p>(bacterial infection), urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital 
</p>
<p>tissue. Long-term consequence can include recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections, cysts, 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>chronic pain, infections, decreased sexual enjoyment and psychological consequences, such 
</p>
<p>as post-traumatic stress disorder. The practice is also associated with increased risks of 
</p>
<p>birth by caesarean section, postpartum haemorrhage, episiotomy, extended maternal 
</p>
<p>hospital stay, resuscitation of the infant, low birth weight in infants and inpatient perinatal 
</p>
<p>death.4 
</p>
<p>6. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have identified female genital mutilation as practices 
</p>
<p>that directly affect women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; abilities to enjoy their human rights on an equal 
</p>
<p>footing with men, and which therefore violate their rights to non-discrimination and 
</p>
<p>equality. Joint general recommendation/general comment No. 31 of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women and No. 18 of the Committee on the rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child 18 (CEDAW/C/GC/31-CRC/C/GC/18) identifies female genital mutilation as a 
</p>
<p>harmful practice and notes that the harm that these practices cause to the victims often has 
</p>
<p>the purpose or effect of impairing the recognition, enjoyment and exercise of the human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms of women and children. 
</p>
<p>7. The joint general recommendation/general comment also notes that, overall, harmful 
</p>
<p>practices are often associated with serious forms of violence or are themselves a form of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and children. States have a due diligence obligation to prevent, 
</p>
<p>investigate and punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated 
</p>
<p>by the State or occur in private.5  
</p>
<p>8. In her report (E/CN.4/2002/83), the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, 
</p>
<p>its causes and consequences described female genital mutilation as the result of the 
</p>
<p>patriarchal power structures that legitimize the need to control women&#8217;s lives, arising from 
</p>
<p>the stereotypical perception of women as the principal guardians of sexual morality, but 
</p>
<p>with uncontrolled sexual urges. Both the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the Child have underlined that harmful 
</p>
<p>practices such as female genital mutilation are deeply rooted in societal attitudes that regard 
</p>
<p>women and girls as inferior to men and boys and expressed concerns about the use of these 
</p>
<p>practices to justify gender-based violence as a form of &#8220;protection&#8221; or control of women 
</p>
<p>and children. In this regard, States are required, under article 5 of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, to take all appropriate 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>infertility, an increased risk of childbirth complications and new-born deaths, and the need for later 
</p>
<p>surgeries. See WHO fact sheet No. 241, on female genital mutilation, available from 
</p>
<p>www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/. 
</p>
<p> 4 J. Abdulcadir, M.I. Rodriguez and L. Say, &#8220;Research gaps in the care of women with female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation: an analysis&#8221;. <i>BJOG, an International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology</i>, vol. 122, 
</p>
<p>issue 3 (February 2015).  
 5 The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 31 (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add. 13), obligates 
</p>
<p>States to protect individuals from acts committed by private persons or entities. In its general 
</p>
<p>recommendation No. 19 (see HRI/GEN/1/Rev.6), the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women sets out the responsibilities of States to exercise due diligence, not 
</p>
<p>only in preventing violations, but also in investigating and punishing such acts. Article 19 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States parties to protect children from physical, sexual 
</p>
<p>and mental violence through legislation and other social and educational measures. That obligation 
</p>
<p>includes protection from acts perpetrated by parents or other caregivers. Article 2 of the Declaration 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of Violence against Women (General Assembly resolution 48/104) explicitly 
</p>
<p>defines female genital mutilation as a form of violence against women and calls upon States to protect 
</p>
<p>women against any form of violence that occurs within the family household or in other 
</p>
<p>environments. The Declaration urges States to condemn violence against women and to refrain from 
</p>
<p>invoking tradition or religion to evade their obligations under international human rights law. </p>


<p>measures to modify social and cultural patterns of conduct, with a view to achieving the 
</p>
<p>elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea 
</p>
<p>of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and 
</p>
<p>women.  
</p>
<p>9. The above-mentioned joint general recommendation/general comment also notes 
</p>
<p>that sex and gender-based discrimination intersect with other factors that affect women and 
</p>
<p>girls, in particular those who belong to or are perceived as belonging to disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>groups and who are therefore at a higher risk of becoming victims of harmful practices. 
</p>
<p>10. Human rights mechanisms have indicated that female genital mutilation may amount 
</p>
<p>to torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as set forth in articles 1 
</p>
<p>and 16 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment6 and violates the right to life when it results in death. 
</p>
<p>11. The practice also violates the right to health.7 The Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee have all expressed concern about the medicalization8 of female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation and have urged States not to limit criminalization of the practice only to those 
</p>
<p>who perform the practice outside of hospitals and without medical qualifications. The 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has raised concerns about 
</p>
<p>the conflation and description of the practice as female circumcision. There are 
</p>
<p>fundamental differences both in the harmful effect, intent, purpose and consequences 
</p>
<p>associated with female genital mutilation and &#8220;circumcision&#8221; performed on boys and men. 
</p>
<p>For example, female genital mutilation is often used to primarily control women&#8217;s and 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; sexual desires, while male circumcision does not have this intent or result.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 In its general comment 2 (CAT/C/GC/2), the Committee against Torture explained that States have an 
</p>
<p>obligations regarding the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment to address the activities, such as 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation, of private persons or entities. The Committee noted that female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation violates the physical integrity and human dignity of women and girls and has called on 
</p>
<p>Governments to enact legislation prohibiting the practice, to punish perpetrators and to adopt 
</p>
<p>necessary measures to eradicate it (see, for example, CAT/C/CR/31/6, CAT/C/KEN/CO/1, 
</p>
<p>CAT/C/TGO/CO/1, CAT/C/TCD/CO/1and CAT/C/MRT/CO/1). In his 2008 report (A/HRC/7/3), the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</p>
<p>recognized that, like torture, female genital mutilation involved the deliberate infliction of severe pain 
</p>
<p>and suffering, and considered that it constituted a violation falling within his mandate.  
</p>
<p> 7 According to article 24, paragraph 3, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, States are obliged 
</p>
<p>to take all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices 
</p>
<p>prejudicial to the health of children. 
</p>
<p> 8 Medicalization refers to any act of female genital mutilation that is condoned by a State and 
</p>
<p>performed in both public and private hospitals by trained medical personnel. This includes the 
</p>
<p>performance of excisions by health workers and the use of modern medication to relieve pain and 
</p>
<p>fight infection. Trained health professionals who perform female genital mutilation violate the human 
</p>
<p>rights of women and girls. They also violate the fundamental medical ethic to do no harm. See WHO 
</p>
<p>and others, <i>Eliminating female genital mutilation: an interagency statement</i>. In his 2008 report 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/7/3), the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment made it clear that, even if a law authorizes the practice, any act of female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation would amount to torture and the existence of the law by itself would constitute consent or 
</p>
<p>acquiescence by the State. Also, in cases where acts of female genital mutilation are performed in 
</p>
<p>private clinics and the physicians who carry out the procedure are not prosecuted, the State de facto 
</p>
<p>consents to the practice and is therefore accountable. Art. 5 (b) of the Protocol to the African Charter 
</p>
<p>on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol) prohibits, 
</p>
<p>through legislative measures backed by sanctions, all forms of female genital mutilation, scarification, 
</p>
<p>medicalization and para-medicalization of female genital mutilation and all other practices, in order to 
</p>
<p>eradicate them. </p>


<p><b> III. Good practices to eliminate female genital mutilation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislative measures 
</b></p>
<p>12. At the time of writing, more than 40 countries have enacted legislation against 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation. In Mauritania, ordinance 2005&#8211;2015 prohibits medical 
</p>
<p>practitioners and government health facilities from carrying out the procedure. Egypt and 
</p>
<p>Kenya prohibit parents and guardians from pressurizing their children to undergo the 
</p>
<p>practice. Ugandan and Kenyan laws on female genital mutilation make its performance and 
</p>
<p>the discrimination against a woman who has not undergone the practice a crime. In Nigeria, 
</p>
<p>while there is no federal law prohibiting the practice, states can enact specific legislation 
</p>
<p>prohibiting the practice, as several already have.  
</p>
<p>13. Research by the Demographic and Health Surveys Programme 
</p>
<p>(http://dhsprogram.com) indicates significant reductions in prevalence where States have 
</p>
<p>enacted and enforced comprehensive criminal sanctions against female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>In Kenya, where the prevalence rate has fallen from more than 50 per cent of girls in 1980 
</p>
<p>to 20 per cent in 2010, 71 cases related to the practice have gone to court and 16 of these 
</p>
<p>cases have resulted in convictions. Burkina Faso has witnessed a reduction in the practice 
</p>
<p>among young women and has recorded at least seven convictions for practising or abetting 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation. In 2014, two public mobile tribunal hearings in two separate 
</p>
<p>provinces involving the mutilation of 14 girls resulted in six-month sentences for the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators. Eritrea has convicted and fined at least 155 female genital mutilation 
</p>
<p>practitioners, as well as parents of girls who underwent the practice, while Ethiopia has 
</p>
<p>undertaken 13 prosecutions and, in Guinea-Bissau, at least 14 cases have gone to court and 
</p>
<p>one perpetrator has been sentenced since 2012. In Uganda, following the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Female Genital Mutilations Act in 2010, 15 cases were brought before courts and, in 
</p>
<p>November 2014, five people were convicted for performing the practice. Since 1983, when 
</p>
<p>it introduced a special act prohibiting female genital mutilation, France has jailed about 100 
</p>
<p>persons for involvement in the practice. French police claims that the number of mutilations 
</p>
<p>has decreased as a result of the trials and other prevention initiatives.9 On 26 January 2015, 
</p>
<p>in the first case since the adoption of a 2008 law against female genital mutilation, a court 
</p>
<p>in Egypt convicted a medical doctor following the death of a 13 year old girl after he had 
</p>
<p>performed the practice on her in a private clinic. 
</p>
<p>14. Cross-border female genital mutilation is increasingly documented, partly owing to 
</p>
<p>the criminalization of the practice and to strict enforcement of legislation prohibiting it in 
</p>
<p>countries with large practicing communities. In accordance with article 44, paragraph 3, of 
</p>
<p>the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women 
</p>
<p>and domestic violence, States parties must ensure that the practice is punishable if 
</p>
<p>committed in a third country by or against one of their nationals or residents, even if the 
</p>
<p>practice is not considered a criminal offence in that country. Similarly, States parties must 
</p>
<p>take the measures necessary to establish jurisdiction over a female genital mutilation 
</p>
<p>offence when an alleged perpetrator is present on their territory. This principle of 
</p>
<p>extraterritoriality has been introduced into many European laws. Sections 1 and 4 of the 
</p>
<p>Female Genital Mutilation Act (2003) of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland make it a criminal offence for any person, regardless of their nationality or 
</p>
<p>residence status, to carry out or be involved in carrying out female genital mutilation. In 
</p>
<p>2006, Italy introduced a specific criminal law provision on the practice (Law No. 7/2006), 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 European Institute for Gender Equality, Good <i>practices in combating female genital mutilation 
</i></p>
<p>(Luxembourg, 2013).  </p>


<p>making it punishable even if it is committed outside the country. Denmark, Norway, Spain, 
</p>
<p>Sweden and Switzerland have criminalized practicing or assisting or abetting the practice of 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation, both inside and outside the countries. In 2011, Kenya added an 
</p>
<p>extraterritoriality clause in its law, making performing female genital mutilation outside its 
</p>
<p>border a criminal offence for Kenyans. In 2012, Ireland adopted the Criminal Justice 
</p>
<p>(Female Genital Mutilation) Act, which prohibits the practice of or attempts to practice 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation.  
</p>
<p>15. In addition to enforcing legislation and policies on female genital mutilation, some 
</p>
<p>countries have also established mechanisms to monitor progress in elimination efforts and 
</p>
<p>have allocated resources for implementation, including equipping relevant officials with the 
</p>
<p>requisite personnel, financial, technical and other resources. For instance, Kenya&#8217;s law 
</p>
<p>prohibiting the practice mandates the establishment of an anti-female genital mutilation 
</p>
<p>board, which has both an operational and advisory role, including for securing adequate 
</p>
<p>resources for combatting female genital mutilations.  
</p>
<p>16. Enforcement of national legislation should include special considerations for victim 
</p>
<p>and witness confidentiality and the provision of services, including protection for parents 
</p>
<p>and girls who reject the practice. As the perpetrators of female genital mutilation tend to be 
</p>
<p>family members, victims are often unwilling to support prosecution, and in some instances 
</p>
<p>may refuse to provide police investigations with a statement. Family pressure to accept the 
</p>
<p>practice can be immense; there are documented cases of threats to parents who have refused 
</p>
<p>that their daughters undergo the practice and also of girls who claimed to have mutilated 
</p>
<p>themselves in order to protect their parents. A number of countries have addressed witness 
</p>
<p>and victim protection needs in their legislation on the practice. For instance, United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom legislation grants automatic anonymity to victims of the practice who report the 
</p>
<p>incident to the police. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Comprehensive action plans 
</b></p>
<p>17. In addition to legislation, the elimination of female genital mutilation requires 
</p>
<p>complex multisectoral strategies involving all sectors of government and the wider public, 
</p>
<p>including the media, civil society groups, community leaders, medical professionals and 
</p>
<p>teachers. It also requires addressing and engaging with beliefs and social attitudes and 
</p>
<p>norms within the communities where it is practised.  
</p>
<p>18. The following States have implemented comprehensive and coordinated action plans 
</p>
<p>against female genital mutilation:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Burkina Faso&#8217;s action plan establishes an intersectoral group comprising 13 
</p>
<p>ministries, as well as women&#8217;s groups, religious and community leaders, law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials and the judiciary, to oversee the implementation of its law on 
</p>
<p>the practice  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In 2013, the Ethiopian Ministry of Women, Children and Youth Affairs launched a 
</p>
<p>two-year national strategy on harmful traditional practices that involves the health 
</p>
<p>and social care sectors; in addition, the Government, with the assistance of United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations, has designed child protection 
</p>

<p>&#8226; Senegal&#8217;s national action plan for the period 2010&#8211;2015 involves the creation of 
</p>
<p>regional committees, departmental and rural communities for the abandonment of 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation; as a result of this multi-dimensional approach, thousands 
</p>
<p>of villages in Senegal have reportedly publicly abandoned the practice and other 
</p>
<p>harmful practices </p>


<p>&#8226; Cameroon&#8217;s national action plan, in partnership with civil society such as the 
</p>
<p>Council of Imams and Muslim Dignitaries of Cameroon includes support for the 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic reconversion of practitioners 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Egypt, Cameroon, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and the United 
</p>
<p>Republic of Tanzania have developed multisectoral strategic action plans that 
</p>
<p>involve different government institutions and emphasize awareness-raising, while, in 
</p>
<p>2004, Mauritania adopted a five-year national action plan against gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence and the Government has pledged to adopt in 2015 a law against gender-
</p>
<p>based violence, including female genital mutilation.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Education and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>19. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNICEF Joint 
</p>
<p>Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change,10 comprehensive 
</p>
<p>formal, non-formal and informal education linked with awareness-raising programmes can 
</p>
<p>contribute greatly to preventing female genital mutilation.  
</p>
<p>20. Evidence shows that the incidence of harmful practices such as female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation decreases with gains in female literacy. A survey by UNICEF in Egypt found 
</p>
<p>that 72 per cent of women with no education wanted the practice to continue compared with 
</p>
<p>44 per cent of women with higher levels of education. Furthermore, 15 per cent of women 
</p>
<p>with no education wanted to abandon the practice, compared with 47 per cent of women 
</p>
<p>with higher education.11 In another survey conducted by the organization Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Watch in Yemen, mothers who had no education or only primary school education were 
</p>
<p>more likely to subject their daughters to the practice, and mothers with more children were 
</p>
<p>more likely to have at least one daughter undergo the practice.12 
</p>
<p>21. A number of civil society organizations provide scholarships for girls to enable them 
</p>
<p>to remain in school as a means of preventing female genital mutilation. In the United 
</p>
<p>Republic of Tanzania, for instance, the Maasai Women Development Organization has 
</p>
<p>given scholarships to enable girls who otherwise would have been mutilated and forced into 
</p>
<p>marriage to remain in school.13 The Pastoralist Child Foundation is working in Samburu 
</p>
<p>and Maasai Mara, Kenya, to eliminate the practice through educational sponsorships for 
</p>
<p>girls.14 In 2014, the county of Pokot in Kenya committed to spending over $1 million on 
</p>
<p>eliminating female genital mutilation, with much of the funding to be used to provide 
</p>
<p>scholarships for girls.15 
</p>
<p>22. Information and awareness-raising on the harmful impact of female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation and its legal prohibition are critical to eliminating the practice. The 
</p>
<p>abovementioned UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme supports community-based 
</p>
<p>educational dialogues in 17 countries. The dialogues are often led by a community health 
</p>
<p>worker and involve sharing information on human rights, health and gender norms. Under 
</p>
<p>the programme, workshops on the harmful impact of the practice were held in Mauritania

<p>and assistance provided for the development of a road map to strengthen the ability of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Endowment of Yemen to encourage public leaders, including religious leaders, 
</p>
<p>to oppose it.  
</p>
<p>23. The organization Equality Now offers support to the Government of Kenya to 
</p>
<p>translate the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act into a language that can be 
</p>
<p>understood by the public, and is supporting its translation into Kiswahili to expand its reach 
</p>
<p>among the populations in areas where the practice is prevalent. It has also issued 1,000 
</p>
<p>copies of the Act to Kenyan primary school head teachers to encourage teachers to play a 
</p>
<p>role in ending the practice. 
</p>
<p>24. Examples of programmes that work with young people, including on outreach 
</p>
<p>programmes in schools and the wider community, were highlighted. For instance, Senegal 
</p>
<p>has introduced &#8220;Tostan&#8221;, a participatory education programme that works at the village 
</p>
<p>level to incorporate literacy and essential health education, including information about 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation, into the learning experiences of the entire community. Senegal 
</p>
<p>has also incorporated prevention of the practice into elementary and junior high schools 
</p>
<p>curricula. In Burkina Faso, the National Committee has piloted training for teachers and 
</p>
<p>incorporated female genital mutilation into the natural sciences curriculum within schools. 
</p>
<p>25. In 2014, a youth summit in the Gambia brought together 100 Gambians aged 17&#8211;25 
</p>
<p>years to build their campaigning and social media skills and equip them with the legal and 
</p>
<p>medical knowledge to raise awareness on the practice among young people. In Djibouti, the 
</p>
<p>UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme assisted in mobilizing 500 young people to become 
</p>
<p>engaged in the global campaign to end female genital mutilation and 30 young girls were 
</p>
<p>trained to become youth peer educators for the abandonment of the practice in their 
</p>
<p>respective communities. 
</p>
<p>26. The Ministry of Health of Egypt and the national council for childhood and 
</p>
<p>motherhood hold regular workshops on female genital mutilation and open days in youth 
</p>
<p>centres across the country to raise awareness on the harmful impact of the practice. In 
</p>
<p>eastern Ethiopia, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
</p>
<p>(UNHCR) in partnership with a community-based non-governmental organization, the 
</p>
<p>Mother and Child Development Organization, conducted awareness-raising campaigns and 
</p>
<p>weekly group discussions, referred to as &#8220;coffee ceremonies&#8221;, and mobilized youth clubs 
</p>
<p>against the practice in three Somali refugee camps.  
</p>
<p>27. From 1998 to 2006, the female genital mutilation prevalence rate in the Niger was 
</p>
<p>halved as a result of the work of civil society groups, in particular the Nigerien committee 
</p>
<p>on traditional practices, which carried out studies, awareness-raising interventions, training, 
</p>
<p>advocacy and retraining for practitioners, to stimulate behavioural change in concerned 
</p>
<p>communities. It also assisted in setting up monitoring committees to track activities in 
</p>
<p>remote villages. 
</p>
<p>28. In Mauritania, the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme collaborated with the 
</p>
<p>National Theatre and organized a sensitization tour on female genital mutilation in five 
</p>
<p>high-prevalence regions of the country. A large number of other sensitization activities 
</p>
<p>were also carried out in collaboration with partner non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>Following the tours, 76,850 people made public declarations against the practice. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Engaging religious and community leaders 
</b></p>
<p>29. In Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Evangelical Church and the 
</p>
<p>Ethiopian Islamic Supreme Council officially and formally stressed that female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation is not a religious requirement, and originates in practices that precede religion. 
</p>
<p>They also pledged to integrate relevant messages into their religious teachings.  </p>


<p>30. In 2013, the OHCHR office in Guinea Bissau supported and provided technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to the national non-governmental organization Djinopi in the organization of an 
</p>
<p>Islamic conference on combating female genital mutilation, involving Islamic professors 
</p>
<p>from Egypt, Mali and Senegal. The conference resulted in a declaration on the 
</p>
<p>abandonment of the practice by the imams of Guinea Bissau. To reinforce the outcome of 
</p>
<p>the conference and the declaration, Djinopi published a &#8220;golden booklet&#8221; with short Islamic 
</p>
<p>statements against female genital mutilation, which has been disseminated to neighbouring 
</p>
<p>countries and countries with high prevalence rates. 
</p>
<p>31. In Mauritania, dialogues with religious leaders have led to the development of a 
</p>
<p>model sermon and a collection of arguments against female genital mutilation based on 
</p>
<p>religious documents, which was launched in February 2013 and distributed to 500 imams. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Other initiatives to address societal attitudes and support for female 
</b></p>
<p><b>genital mutilation 
</b></p>
<p>32. In 2008, the Government of Colombia, with technical assistance from the 
</p>
<p>International Organization for Migration and UNFPA, initiated a project called &#8220;Ember&#225; 
</p>
<p>Wera&#8221; aimed at changing discriminatory social and cultural patterns of violence against 
</p>
<p>women. The project resulted in a public rejection by Ember&#225; women and community 
</p>
<p>leaders of female genital mutilation as harmful to women and having no basis in culture. 
</p>
<p>The project has enabled women, both in Ember&#225; and among other indigenous communities, 
</p>
<p>to be agents of change. 
</p>
<p>33. The involvement of older women who may themselves have undergone female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation in programmes to eliminate the practice has proved successful. German 
</p>
<p>development cooperation has created intergenerational dialogues designed to empower 
</p>
<p>target groups to change behaviour. The dialogues have been used in several countries. 
</p>
<p>34. In Mali, the &#8220;child-to-child and &#8220;child-to-parents&#8221; approach adopted by the 
</p>
<p>organization Plan International has allowed girls to promote their rights with their parents 
</p>
<p>and communities, through acting, drawing, poetry and songs. The &#8220;child-to-child&#8221; approach 
</p>
<p>recognizes children as effective agents of change, since they communicate more effectively 
</p>
<p>than adults, are often more literate than their parents and look after younger siblings. This 
</p>
<p>has helped many girls to express themselves in public and share their experiences without 
</p>
<p>fear and embarrassment.16 
</p>
<p>35. As fathers, brothers, husbands, community and religious leaders and politicians, men 
</p>
<p>hold many of the decision-making roles that allow the practice to continue and can play a 
</p>
<p>role in ending female genital mutilation and other harmful practices. Challenging dominant 
</p>
<p>norms of masculinity is an important step towards ensuring that men and boys are strong 
</p>
<p>advocates for tackling the practice and for changing attitudes and behaviours in 
</p>
<p>communities and society at large. In Egypt, Plan International has used an innovative non-
</p>
<p>formal education programme called &#8220;New Visions&#8221; that encourages the development of life 
</p>
<p>skills and increases gender sensitivity and reproductive health knowledge among groups of 
</p>
<p>boys and young men aged 12&#8211;20. The same concept has been used for girls through a 
</p>
<p>similar programme called &#8220;New Horizons&#8221;, to increase self-confidence and demystify and 
</p>
<p>communicate essential information on basic life skills and reproductive health. These 
</p>
<p>groups have helped to break the silence, promote attitudinal and behavioural changes 
</p>
<p>among men and women, as well as reduce the social pressure that gives rise to the practice. 
</p>

<p>Plan International has found that community dialogue and discussion is crucial for greater 
</p>
<p>ownership of the project by the community.17  
</p>
<p>36. UNHCR has established an advocacy group called &#8220;Men against female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation&#8221; comprising 300 men in the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya. The group 
</p>
<p>members undertake peer education activities, acts as role models and work in close 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the police and other agencies.  
</p>
<p>37. In the Sudan, and later in Somalia and Egypt, the &#8220;Saleema&#8221; initiative promoted the 
</p>
<p>association of positive values with women who have not undergone female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation. Saleema is an Arabic word that means, inter alia, &#8220;unharmed&#8221;. One of the key 
</p>
<p>objectives of the initiative was to model and popularize the use of the world Saleema itself 
</p>
<p>as a positive terminology for describing women and girls who have not undergone the 
</p>
<p>practice. In 2014 alone, over 340 communities in the Sudan participated in community 
</p>
<p>dialogue activities as part of the Saleema initiative, and approximately 95 communities 
</p>
<p>organized public declarations for the abolishment of the practice using the initiative 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Saleema Al Taga&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Political leadership 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of 
</p>
<p>Women and Children has identified political will as &#8220;the centre of achieving zero tolerance 
</p>
<p>to female genital mutilation.&#8221; Evidence shows that statements by politicians condemning 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation are essential to challenging support for the practice and that, in 
</p>
<p>many countries, they have led to greater engagement of religious, tribal and community 
</p>
<p>leaders against it, as well as an increase in human and financial resources allocated for this 
</p>
<p>purpose.18 Throughout 2014, Guinea-Bissau saw strong statements of support for the 
</p>
<p>abandonment of the practice by political parties, the Government and influential leaders. In 
</p>
<p>addition, the country has appointed a national ambassador for the abandonment of female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation, and has mobilized key national musicians and media figures to 
</p>
<p>participate in cultural events to advocate for its abandonment. Senegal&#8217;s national action 
</p>
<p>plan provides for an active role for parliamentarians, in particular female parliamentarians, 
</p>
<p>in terms of speaking out against the practice in their constituencies and working with 
</p>
<p>religious leaders.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Promoting alternative rites of passage 
</b></p>
<p>39. Women who undergo female genital mutilation have reported feelings of 
</p>
<p>empowerment and social acceptance and those who have refused report feelings of 
</p>
<p>exclusion, shame, stigmatization and loss of honour and social position.19 Alternative rites 
</p>
<p>of passage are important to address these feelings and perceptions. 
</p>
<p>40. In Kenya, the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme supported alternative rites of 
</p>
<p>passage among practicing communities, who viewed the new practice as culturally 
</p>
<p>acceptable and marking a girl&#8217;s entry into adulthood. The alternative rites of passage 
</p>
<p>involved community participatory education on local culture, life skills, communication

<p>transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS and gender-based violence. The Young Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Christian Association of Kenya implements an alternative rites of passage seminar for girls 
</p>
<p>at risk. Teachers and parents identify girls, who are taught a series of modules based on a 
</p>
<p>training manual covering sexual and reproductive health education, female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation awareness, myths around the practice, legal implications and children&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>and protection from it.  
</p>
<p>41. In the United Republic of Tanzania, OHCHR supported a UNFPA-led special event 
</p>
<p>where over 1,000 children chose an alternative rite of passage over mutilation. The 
</p>
<p>alternative rite of passage involved a one-month training course on human rights, 
</p>
<p>reproductive health and the culture of their local community, which concluded with a 
</p>
<p>graduation ceremony. Similar alternative rites of passage activities have been conducted in 
</p>
<p>the Gambia. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Cross-border, regional and international cooperation initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>42. Efforts at the regional and international levels aim at promoting awareness and 
</p>
<p>information-sharing on female genital mutilation. Countries of origin and migrant 
</p>
<p>communities in destination countries are increasingly forming partnerships and engaging in 
</p>
<p>coordinated approaches to prevent the practice. 
</p>
<p>43. Togo is currently developing cross-border programmes to combat female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation with neighbouring countries. Similarly, since 2011, Burkina Faso and Mali have 
</p>
<p>collaborated in a joint project on preventing its cross-border practise. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Protection and support services 
</b></p>
<p>44. Girls and women who have undergone female genital mutilation need quality health 
</p>
<p>care and psychosocial and sexual care. Eritrea, Mauritania, Kenya, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, 
</p>
<p>Mali, Somalia and Uganda have all strengthened the capacity of health personnel to address 
</p>
<p>the practice and its consequences. In Ethiopia, health workers are operating outside the 
</p>
<p>clinical setting and offering support to schools, women&#8217;s groups and faith networks. 
</p>
<p>45. In Finland, the National Institute of Health and Welfare raises awareness and 
</p>
<p>provides information on female genital mutilation in maternity and child health clinics, 
</p>
<p>hospitals and health centres; and schools and student health centres. In September 2014, 
</p>
<p>University College Hospital in London opened its first specialist clinic for child victims of 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation, offering medical treatment and psychological help to girls up to 
</p>
<p>18 years of age who have suffered or may be at risk of the practice. Somalia has integrated 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation-related issues in its midwifery training curriculum in its South 
</p>
<p>Central, Puntland and Somaliland regions, including in antenatal care, neonatal care and 
</p>
<p>immunization services. Similarly, Burkina Faso has integrated the practice into 
</p>
<p>reproductive health programmes and set up a specialist clinic to address the complications 
</p>
<p>of female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>46. The World Health Organization is updating clinical guidelines for health providers 
</p>
<p>to support evidence-based care. In Ethiopia, the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital is dedicated 
</p>
<p>exclusively to providing free obstetric fistula repair surgery to women, and a community 
</p>
<p>called Desda Mender is dedicated to the lifelong support of women whose fistulae are 
</p>
<p>irreparable.20 Specialized clinics for victims of female genital mutilation have also been 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 20 Project Hannah Africa submission. </p>


<p>opened in Germany. In Switzerland, the University Hospital of Geneva operates specialized 
</p>
<p>consultations led by female doctors on female genital mutilation. The programme offers 
</p>
<p>various services, including a personalized prevention information review and deinfibulation 
</p>
<p>for cases of type III female genital mutilation.  
</p>
<p>47. In addition to health services, several civil society organizations are engaged in 
</p>
<p>providing protection services to girls at risk. In Kenya, the Tasaru Ntomonok Initiative 
</p>
<p>provides shelter for girls trying to escape female genital mutilation, including with a view 
</p>
<p>to ensuring they remain in school and supporting their integration into their communities.21 
</p>
<p>Burkina Faso has established a free child line for the public to report suspected cases and 
</p>
<p>for survivors or other affected parties to receive counselling. In Ethiopia, child protection 
</p>
<p>networks provide support to girls who have been mutilated and have established links 
</p>
<p>between child protection officers, the police, schools, community groups and faith 
</p>
<p>organizations to share information to identify proactively those girls at risk of the practice.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Addressing female genital mutilation in minority communities 
</b></p>
<p>48. Specific issues may arise in addressing female genital mutilation when it is practised 
</p>
<p>only by minority communities, such as refugee women and women migrants. Measures to 
</p>
<p>address the practice in this context have focused on legislation, strengthening the capacity 
</p>
<p>of the relevant professionals to effectively address the practice through training and 
</p>
<p>guidelines, as well as awareness-raising among targeted communities.  
</p>
<p>49. In addition to information campaigns, a growing number of countries have 
</p>
<p>developed action plans that contain practical guidance on targeted interventions, including 
</p>
<p>on how front-line professionals can challenge the social norms that drive the practice, as 
</p>
<p>well as how individuals and communities can themselves contribute to changing the social 
</p>
<p>norms that underpin the practice. Finland&#8217;s action plan on the prevention of female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation for the period 2012&#8211;2014 requires local authorities to provide sufficient training 
</p>
<p>on the practice for employees and to carry out self-monitoring. 
</p>
<p>50. Since 2000, Norway has implemented four successive action plans to prevent and 
</p>
<p>combat female genital mutilation. The current action plan for the period 2013&#8211;2016 against 
</p>
<p>forced marriage, female genital mutilation and severe restrictions on young people&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>freedom contains 22 measures, including on the roles of schools and the foreign service 
</p>
<p>missions, the need for safe housing and improved cooperation and expertise in the public 
</p>
<p>sector.  
</p>
<p>51. Similarly, in Portugal, the Government has implemented two action plans involving 
</p>
<p>actors from several sectors and with different expertise, so as to address the different 
</p>
<p>perspectives on female genital mutilation, including health, reproductive and sexual rights, 
</p>
<p>justice, immigration, gender equality, development cooperation and education. Members of 
</p>
<p>the group come from public administration bodies, international organizations and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations. The Government produced various materials on the practice 
</p>
<p>for health-care professionals, patients and police officers, as well as a post-graduate course 
</p>
<p>on female genital mutilation for health-care professionals who intend to work in high 
</p>
<p>prevalence areas and who are expected to act as focal points in their community&#8217;s health 
</p>
<p>centres and hospitals upon graduation. Under the action plan, Portugal has created a 
</p>
<p>biannual award, entitled &#8220;Against female genital mutilation &#8211; change the future, now&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>which offers immigrant associations support to develop awareness and prevention projects 
</p>

<p>about the practice in the communities at risk, especially those associations that are very 
</p>
<p>effective in their communities but do not have access to national or European Union funds. 
</p>
<p>52. In an attempt to reach out to affected communities, the Danish Ministry of Children, 
</p>
<p>Gender Equality, Integration and Social Affairs has developed a mobile application on how 
</p>
<p>to tackle &#8220;honour-related&#8221; conflicts, including in relation to female genital mutilation. The 
</p>
<p>application targets ethnic minority young people, as well as professionals, informing them 
</p>
<p>that the practice is illegal, and that persons conducting or contributing to it (also outside of 
</p>
<p>Denmark) risk prison sentences. 
</p>
<p>53. In March 2014, the United Kingdom adopted a national action plan based on a 
</p>
<p>multi-agency approach to providing support and care services for women and girls living 
</p>
<p>with female genital mutilation or for women and girls at risk of the practice. It also 
</p>
<p>established a female genital mutilation unit to coordinate cross-government policy, to 
</p>
<p>collect and disseminate best practices and to provide outreach support on the practice. It 
</p>
<p>published multi-agency guidelines on female genital mutilation to support and assist front-
</p>
<p>line professionals, such as teachers, health professionals, police officers and social workers. 
</p>
<p>In April 2014, it became mandatory for any health-care professional to collate and submit 
</p>
<p>basic anonymized details about the number of patients treated who have undergone the 
</p>
<p>practice.  
</p>
<p>54. The Government of Spain has created a national strategy to eradicate violence 
</p>
<p>against women for the period 2013&#8211;2016, which describes female genital mutilation as a 
</p>
<p>form of violence against women, and has developed a protocol on medical action against 
</p>
<p>the practice.  
</p>
<p>55. In 2011, the Government of the Netherlands developed an official document to help 
</p>
<p>parents withstand pressure from their families. The document, entitled &#8220;Statement opposing 
</p>
<p>female circumcision&#8221;, outlines the health consequences of female genital mutilation and 
</p>
<p>relevant Dutch legislation. It has been translated into several languages and is handed out to 
</p>
<p>parents who attend children&#8217;s health-care centres and also to school doctors. 
</p>
<p>56. In March 2013, partner organizations of the European End Female Genital 
</p>
<p>Mutilation campaign &#8211; including the Mediterranean Institute of Gender Studies, the Family 
</p>
<p>Planning Association of Portugal, the Italian Association for Women in Development and 
</p>
<p>AkiDwa of Ireland &#8211; launched an e-learning tool, offering information and practical advice 
</p>
<p>on female genital mutilation in Europe. The campaign&#700;s e-learning course aims to raise 
</p>
<p>awareness and enhance the skills of health professionals and asylum officers and social 
</p>
<p>welfare officers. The training is supported and endorsed by UNHCR and is available in 
</p>
<p>English, Portuguese and Italian.  
</p>
<p>57. A number of countries, including Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom, have implemented cross-country programmes to address female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation. In 2010, the European Parliament launched a campaign against the practice, and 
</p>
<p>in 2014 the Council of Europe, with Amnesty International, produced a guide for member 
</p>
<p>States on how to design policies and measures to better address the practice, based on the 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and 
</p>
<p>domestic violence. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges in addressing female genital mutilation 
</b></p>
<p>58. Submissions received reveal a number of constraints and challenges that States face 
</p>
<p>in their efforts to meet their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of women 
</p>
<p>and children to live free from female genital mutilation.  </p>


<p>59. Legislation in most countries provides for large fines and prison sentences for those 
</p>
<p>who engage in the practice. However, effective enforcement is often inadequate, 
</p>
<p>particularly in States with plural legal systems and even more so where customary, 
</p>
<p>traditional or religious norms may appear to support female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, prosecutions remain rare. This is partly due to the nature of the practice, 
</p>
<p>which poses particular investigation challenges to law enforcement officials. The ceremony 
</p>
<p>is often deeply taboo, usually performed in the privacy of the family or community and 
</p>
<p>shrouded in secrecy. It is also not immediately obvious that a woman or a girl has been 
</p>
<p>subjected to female genital mutilation, and law enforcement officials often lack 
</p>
<p>accessibility to rural areas where it is carried out. In a number of places, the enforcement of 
</p>
<p>laws against female genital mutilation and the punitive legal approach has driven the 
</p>
<p>practice underground. 
</p>
<p>60. There is also a gap in the protection afforded by existing legal frameworks. Most 
</p>
<p>States have criminalized female genital mutilation when it takes place on national territory 
</p>
<p>or when a girl is taken abroad for mutilation if she is a citizen or permanent resident of the 
</p>
<p>State. This fails to recognize the obligation of States to protect all children within their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction and does not take into consideration the mobile, transnational character of 
</p>
<p>practicing communities. A further challenge is insufficient collaboration among 
</p>
<p>Governments across borders. Girls living near border areas are most vulnerable, particularly 
</p>
<p>if they are living next to countries with weaker legislation against the practice than their 
</p>
<p>own.  
</p>
<p>61. There is evidence that the medicalization of female genital mutilation has risen. 
</p>
<p>However, reliable data on medicalization is difficult to obtain. Allowing medical 
</p>
<p>professionals to perform the practice is often the logical response of parents who are under 
</p>
<p>social pressure to have their daughter undergo female genital mutilation, but who want to 
</p>
<p>minimize harm. Medicalization can also act as an additional source of income for health-
</p>
<p>care workers and can undermine efforts to eliminate the practice.22  
</p>
<p>62. United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms have raised concerns with 
</p>
<p>regard to genital surgeries on intersex infants and children for non-medical reasons.23 The 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child has called upon States to ensure that no one is 
</p>
<p>subjected to unnecessary medical or surgical treatment during infancy or childhood, to 
</p>
<p>guarantee bodily integrity, autonomy and self-determination to children concerned and to 
</p>
<p>provide families with intersex children with adequate counselling and support.24  
</p>
<p>63. The collection of reliable data on female genital mutilation in countries where 
</p>
<p>minority communities perform the practice remains a major challenge, as do the lack of 
</p>
<p>capacity of relevant officials and the absence of standard guidelines. Many front-line 
</p>
<p>professionals, such as teachers, medical professionals and child protection officers, are not 
</p>
<p>trained in or may not understand the law, or may be unfamiliar with the issue and fail to 
</p>
<p>record cases. Similarly, while there is empirical evidence showing that female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation can result in deaths, many Governments do not collect or maintain official data 
</p>
<p>on deaths associated with the practice, and hospitals do not have policies of recording 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation-related deaths.

<p>64. Despite the commitment of Governments to address the practice, in many instances 
</p>
<p>support in the form of shelters and other services for victims and girls at risk are 
</p>
<p>inadequate. Very few countries make provisions in law or policy to offer protection 
</p>
<p>following allegations of female genital mutilation. The practice does not fit easily into 
</p>
<p>systems to prevent violence against women or child protection systems. For instance, in 
</p>
<p>several European countries, agencies that typically report on suspected child abuse cases do 
</p>
<p>not report female genital mutilation as they are often unaware of its occurrence. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, most domestic violence shelters do not accommodate children, constraining 
</p>
<p>many girls to take refuge in schools or in the home of community leaders, at times with 
</p>
<p>limited access to food or sanitation and exposure to further risks. 
</p>
<p>65. In the area of service provision, a key challenge is the lack of evidence on effective 
</p>
<p>interventions and strategies to mitigate the health consequences of female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation. This includes a need to improve the knowledge base about obstetrical and 
</p>
<p>gynaecological consequences.25  
</p>
<p>66. The persistence of social norms that perpetuate female genital mutilation, 
</p>
<p>differences in the underlying reasons for the practice and cultural environments where it 
</p>
<p>takes place make it particularly challenging to eliminate the practice. However, the positive 
</p>
<p>results of programmes to prevent female genital mutilation demonstrate that attitudes in 
</p>
<p>support of the practice can be successfully addressed. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right of women and 
</b></p>
<p><b>girls to live free from female genital mutilation. Good practices in a number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries should be supported, increased in scale and replicated. They include: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The establishment of comprehensive policies, such as action plans, 
</b></p>
<p><b>involving all relevant ministries and other stakeholders, including religious and 
</b></p>
<p><b>community leaders, teachers, health providers and the media; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The adoption and implementation of legislation that prohibits female 
</b></p>
<p><b>genital mutilation, in accordance with international human rights laws; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Comprehensive education and awareness-raising programmes targeting 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and men at all levels of society, including religious and community leaders, on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the harm and root causes of female genital mutilation and responses; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Campaigns to change societal norms that drive the practice, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>creation of an enabling and supportive environment for the human rights of women; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Campaigns that delink the practice from religion, and the debunking of 
</b></p>
<p><b>social norms, harmful stereotypes and cultural beliefs that perpetuate discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the basis of sex, gender, age and other intersecting factors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The incorporation of guidelines on female genital mutilation into medical 
</b></p>
<p><b>education and training curricula; 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25 WHO has identified four thematic areas where research is needed to improve clinical management on 
</p>
<p>the basis of significant gaps in the evidence and controversy regarding optimal management: 
</p>
<p>(a) obstetric outcome and post-partum perineal re-education; (b) defibulation outside of pregnancy or 
</p>
<p>labour; (c) clitoral reconstruction; and (d) training, skills and confidence of health care providers. See 
</p>
<p>J. Abdulcadir, M.I. Rodriguez and L. Say, &#8220;Research gaps&#8221; (see para. 5, footnote 4). </p>


<p><b>(g) </b>Measures to ensure girls&#8217; access to <b>high-quality education, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive sexuality education; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Accessible protection mechanisms and services to safeguard girls at risk, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including services such as emergency help lines, health care, legal services, counselling 
</b></p>
<p><b>and shelter for girls who run away in order to avoid female genital mutilation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Adequate social and medical services for women and girls and women 
</b></p>
<p><b>who are living with female genital mutilation. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>States should strengthen efforts to share experiences and good practices, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including concerning data-collection tools, methodologies and expertise. Furthermore, 
</b></p>
<p><b>States should take the necessary measures to ensure the coherent and consistent 
</b></p>
<p><b>harmonization of all relevant legislation and to ensure its primacy over customary, 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional or religious law. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>States should incorporate evidence-based training on female genital mutilation 
</b></p>
<p><b>into medical, midwifery and nursing curricula so as to improve the diagnosis and 
</b></p>
<p><b>management of the practice and to prevent its medicalization. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>States should allocate sufficient resources to civil society groups and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>partners so as to effectively carry out programmes at the community level to eliminate 
</b></p>
<p><b>the practice. This should include the creation of safe spaces in schools and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities where girls and young women can gather and discuss the issues that 
</b></p>
<p><b>affect them. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>States should ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent cross-
</b></p>
<p><b>border female genital mutilation. States should also make it a criminal offense to 
</b></p>
<p><b>perform of or be involved in carrying out the practice abroad, regardless of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>nationality or residence status of the perpetrator and even where the victim is not a 
</b></p>
<p><b>national or does not have permanent or similar habitual residence of the country, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with the Convention on the Right of the Child.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Political leadership is crucial to address female genital mutilation. Political, 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious and community leaders play an important role in speaking out against the 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice.
