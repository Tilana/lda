                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (Unaudited)
NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
As used in these financial statements, the terms "Company" and "Isramco" refer
to Isramco, Inc. and subsidiaries.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments)
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results
presented for the interim periods ended June 30, 2005, are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31,
2005. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements
and footnotes thereto included in Isramco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
We account for employee stock-based compensation granted under our long-term
incentive plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations. Isramco did not have any stock-based compensation
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, as there were no
options granted in either of the periods and options historically granted were
fully vested on the date of grant.
NOTE 2 - VESSEL LEASE
In March 2005, Magic 1 Cruise Line Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, entered into a bareboat lease with a European-based tour operator
pursuant to which it leased its cruise liner Magic 1 for $8,000 per day during
the period from April 14, 2005 to October 31, 2005. Under such agreement all
maintenance and operating costs associated with the vessel were borne by the
operator.
NOTE 3 - SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company's operations involve two industry segments - the exploration,
development and production of oil and natural gas and holding and leasing its
cruise line vessel. Its current oil and gas activities are concentrated in the
United States and Israel.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
THE FOLLOWING COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT ON
FORM 10-Q. THE DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS
AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE STATEMENTS RELATE TO FUTURE EVENTS OR OUR FUTURE
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN SOME CASES, YOU CAN IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS BY TERMINOLOGY SUCH AS "MAY," "WILL," "SHOULD," "EXPECT," "PLAN,"
"ANTICIPATE," "BELIEVE," "ESTIMATE," "PREDICT," "POTENTIAL," "INTEND," OR
"CONTINUE," AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS. OUR
ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS.
OVERVIEW
Isramco, Inc., a Delaware company, is active in the exploration of oil and gas
in Israel and the United States. The Company acts as an operator of certain
leases and licenses and also holds participation interests in certain other
interests. The Company also holds certain non-oil and gas properties.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
In response to the Release No. 33-8040 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure And Critical Accounting
Policies," the Company identified the accounting principles which it believes
are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting
policies that involve the most complex of subjective decisions or assessments.
The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. If the
financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment
of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
The Company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an
investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than is temporary.
Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of
underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the
carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in an investment's
current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the
future.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to
the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has
considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that
the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax
assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination
was made.
The Company does not participate in, nor has it created, any off-balance sheet
special purpose entities or other off-balance sheet financing. In addition, the
Company does not enter into any derivative financial instruments.
The Company records a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in
the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying
amount of the related long live assets.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company finances its operations primarily from cash generated by operations.
The decrease in the Company's consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $478,000
from $2,087,000 at December 31, 2004 to $1,609,000 at September 30, 2005, is
primarily attributable to investments in oil and gas wells in Texas and in the
cruise line Vessel.
Net cash provided from investing activities for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2005 was $ 269,000 compared to $8,086,000 used during the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2004. The cash used in 2004 was primarily
for the purchase of the Magic 1 cruise liner.
-7-
<PAGE>
Capital expenditures for property and equipment during the nine months ended
September 30, 2005 were $2,021,000 compared to $702,000 for the same period in
2004. Capital expenditures are primarily attributable to investments in the
Magic 1 cruise liner and in drilling of oil and gas wells in Texas.
The Company believes that existing cash balances and cash flows from activities
will be sufficient to meet its financing needs. The Company intends to finance
its ongoing oil and gas exploration activities from working capital.
On November 1, 2005, Jay Petroleum, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary purchased a
15% working interest in certain oil and gas acreage in North Central Texas, for
a purchase price of $2.1 million. The purchase, which is discussed further below
in "Summary of Exploration Efforts in the United States," was made from internal
cash resources generated from sale of marketable securities held by the Company.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 (THE "2005 PERIOD") COMPARED TO THE NINE
MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 (THE "2004 PERIOD") AND THE THREE MONTHS ENDED
SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004.
The Company reported a net profit of $701,000 ($0.26 per share) for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 compared to net income of $250,000
($0.09 per share) for the same period in 2004. The increase in the net income
for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2004 is attributable to the following:
i)      increase in equity in net income of Investee from $926,000 in
                2004 Period to $1,574,000 in 2005 Period;
        ii)     decrease in income taxes from $1,526,000 in 2004 Period to
                $160,000 in 2005 period;
        iii)    increase in the net loss of the Vessel from $526,000 in 2004
                period to $760,000 in 2005 Period; and
        iv)     decrease in oil and gas sales in 2005 compared to 2004 due to
                decline of the gas production of the Company wells.
Set forth below is a break-down of these results:

SUMMARY OF EXPLORATION EFFORTS IN ISRAEL
MED YAVNE LEASE
The Med Yavne Lease covers approximately 53 square kilometers (approximately
12,000 acres). The Company's participation share of the Med Yavne Lease is
0.4585%.
MED ASHDOD LEASE
The Med Ashdod Lease covers approximately 250 square kilometers (approximately
62,000 acres). The Company serves as the operator of the Med Ashdod Lease and
holds a 0.3625% interest therein.
On February 28, 2005, the Company, on behalf of Isramco Negev 2 LP ("Negev 2"),
a lease participant and an affiliate of the Company, issued a Sole Risk notice
to the other partners in the lease to drill a gas well ("Gad 1" well) to a total
depth of 2,600 meter (8,350 feet) at a total budget of $13 million. As a result
of the Sole Risk notice, the rights of partners who did not respond to the
notice were transferred to Negev 2 such that its rights in the Gad 1 well
increased to 85.103%.
In August and September 2005, Negev 2 transferred 40% working interests in the
Gad 1 well to -third Parties. On September 25, 2005 the Gad 1 well was spudded.
The updated total Budget of the well is $ 19.5 million (including production
tests, If performed)
SUMMARY OF EXPLORATION EFFORTS IN THE UNITED STATES
The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Jay Petroleum LLC ("Jay
Petroleum") and Jay Management LLC ("Jay Management"), is involved in oil and
gas exploration and production in the United States. Jay Petroleum owns varying
working interests in oil and gas wells in Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and
Wyoming. Independent estimates of the reserves held by Jay Petroleum as of
December 31, 2004 are approximately 140,000 net barrels of proved developed
producing oil and 2,011 MMCFs of proved developed producing natural gas. Jay
Management acts as the operator of certain of the producing oil and gas wells
owned by Jay Petroleum.
During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 the Company participated
in the drilling of two wells (Vaquero #1 and Vaquero #2) on the Welder Ranch
property in Victoria Country, Texas. The Company holds 5% working interests in
each of the two wells. The Company invested $ 801,000 in the drilling of Vaquero
1 and 2. Both of the wells start to produce gas.
On November 2, 2005 Jay Petroleum purchased 15% working Interests in 12,000
Barnett shale acreages in Parker County in north central Texas, for a purchase
price of $2.1 million. About 80 locations, for new development well, have been
identified in the Barnett shale acreage, based on 3D seismic survey. In
addition, Jay Petroleum has the right to participate for up to 40% working
Interests in any well that will be drilled in formations shallower than the
Barnett shale.
OPERATOR'S FEES
During the 2005 Period, the Company earned $54,000 in operator fees compared to
$108,000 for the 2004 Period and $18,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2005 compared to $36,000 for the corresponding periods in 2004. The decrease
in 2005 Period and for the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared to the
same periods in 2004 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the activity in
the Israeli offshore licenses.
OIL & GAS REVENUES
During the 2005 Period, the Company had oil and gas revenues of $2,292,000
compared to $2,448,000 for the 2004 Period and $775,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2004 compared to $836,000 for the comparable period in 2004.
The decrease in the 2005 Period and for the three months ended June 2005
compared to the same period in 2004 is primarily attributable to the decline in
the gas production of the Company's wells.
LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES AND SEVERANCE TAXES
Lease operating expenses and severance taxes were primarily in connection with
oil and gas fields in the United States. Oil and gas lease operating expenses
and severance taxes for the 2005 Period were $1,124,000 compared to $806,000 for
the 2004 Period and $499,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2005
compared to $374,000 for the comparable period in 2004. The increase in the 2005
Period and for the three months ended September 30, 2005 is primarily
attributable to a work over on two of the wells in Texas.

<PAGE>
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION COSTS
During the 2005 Period the Company incurred expenses for exploration costs in
the amount of $160,000. These costs were related to a participation of 15%
working interests in two dry-holes in Texas.
INTEREST INCOME
Interest income in respect of the 2005 Period was $320,000 compared to $572,000
for the 2004 Period and $164,000 in respect of the three months ended September
