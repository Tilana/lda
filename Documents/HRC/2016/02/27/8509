<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 7/28 on missing persons, the Human Rights Council decided to hold 
a panel discussion on the question of missing persons at its ninth session, and requested the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a summary of the panel&#8217;s 
deliberations with a view to subsequently charging the Human Rights Council Advisory 
Committee, at the same session, with the preparation of a study on best practices in the 
matter. 
</p>
<p>2.  Pursuant to resolution 7/28, the Human Rights Council held a panel discussion on 
the question of missing persons at its ninth session, with the participation of experts of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and delegates of Governments and non-
governmental organizations, national human rights institutions and international 
organizations. The Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) prepared a summary of the 
panel&#8217;s deliberations (A/HRC/10/10). 
</p>
<p>3.  The Human Rights Council subsequently adopted decision 9/101, in which it 
renewed its request to the Advisory Committee to prepare the study and to submit it to the 
Council at its twelfth session. 
</p>
<p>4.  The Advisory Committee, at its second session, held from 26 to 30 January 2009, set 
up a drafting group with the task of preparing a study on best practices in the matter of 
missing persons, and designated the following as its members: Ansar Burney, Chinsung 
Chung, Wolfgang Stefan Heinz (Chairperson), Latif H&#252;seynov (Rapporteur), Miguel 
Alfonso Mart&#237;nez and Bernards Andrews Nyamwaya Mudho. The drafting group was also 
requested to submit the results of its work on the study to the Advisory Committee at its 
third session with a view to submitting them to the Council at its twelfth session. 
</p>
<p>5.  The Advisory Committee, at its third session, held from 3 to 7 August 2009, 
continued its deliberations on the issue of missing persons. As a result of those 
deliberations, it adopted recommendation 3/2 entitled &#8220;Missing persons&#8221;, in which the 
Committee noted that considerable difficulties had been encountered by the drafting group 
in finding the necessary information and research resources, and requested the latter to 
submit the results of its work on the study to the Advisory Committee at its fourth session, 
with a view to submitting them to the Council at its fourteenth session. 
</p>
<p>6.  In its decision 12/117, the Human Rights Council took note of recommendation 3/2 
and requested the Advisory Committee to submit the study to the Council at its fourteenth 
session. 
</p>
<p>7.  In order to continue its work on the above-mentioned study, the drafting group of the 
Advisory Committee elaborated a questionnaire addressed to Governments, which was 
transmitted by note verbale dated 2 November 2009 by the secretariat. A total of 22 replies 
were received from States. 
</p>
<p>8.  The Advisory Committee, at its fourth session, held from 25 to 29 January 2010, 
continued its deliberations on the issue of missing persons and held an exchange of views 
with a representative of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. 
The Committee endorsed the progress report prepared on the issue by its drafting group 
(A/HRC/14/42), which was transmitted to the Council for its consideration at its fourteenth 
session. 
</p>
<p>9.  In its decision 14/118, the Human Rights Council took note of the above-mentioned 
progress report and requested the Advisory Committee to finalize the study on the best 
practices in the matter of missing persons and to submit it to the Council at its sixteenth 
session. At its sixth session, the Advisory Committee considered the finalized version of </p>


<p>the study prepared by the drafting group, to be transmitted to the Council for its 
consideration at its sixteenth session. 
</p>
<p>10.  The Advisory Committee expresses its gratitude to OHCHR for the support in the 
process of collection of information, as well as to other partners, including ICRC, non-
governmental organizations and Governments. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Scope of the study 
</b></p>
<p>11.  The scope of the study is determined by Human Rights Council resolution 7/28. 
Accordingly, for the purposes of the present study, &#8220;missing persons&#8221; are to be construed as 
those whose families are without news of them, as well as those who are reported, on the 
basis of reliable information, as unaccounted for as a result of an international or non-
international armed conflict. The report does not cover cases when people go missing as a 
result of other situations, for example, natural disasters or internal violence or disturbances. 
On the other hand, the term &#8220;missing persons&#8221; as used in the study is different from and 
broader in scope than &#8220;enforced or involuntary disappearance&#8221; as defined in the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.1 
</p>
<p>12.  It is of great concern that armed conflicts continue to occur in various parts of the 
world, often resulting in serious violations of international humanitarian law and human 
rights law and, in particular, generating more and more persons reported missing. There are 
many reasons for people going missing. They may be forcibly displaced; they may be 
captured, arrested or abducted and denied contact with family or friends; they may be 
members of armed forces or armed groups whose fate is unknown (&#8220;missing in action&#8221;); or 
they be victims of massacres.  
</p>
<p>13.  The issue of persons reported missing in connection with armed conflicts is today a 
harsh reality for countless families throughout the world, causing them tremendous 
suffering. The families of missing people face a whole range of problems arising from their 
situation of vulnerability. Very often, these families are unable to overcome their pain and 
rebuild their lives and communities, even many years after the events, a situation that can 
undermine relationships between communities for generations. Missing persons should 
therefore not be considered the only victims; all the members of their families, in the 
broadest possible sense, are victims too.2  
</p>
<p>14.  The issue of missing persons also seriously hampers efforts to achieve peace and 
reconciliation in areas affected by armed conflicts. On the other hand, efforts to solve the 
issue of the missing can contribute to solving the conflicts and reducing hostility, mistrust 
and intolerance. 
</p>
<p>15.  To illustrate the seriousness of the problem, some figures are adduced below. 
According to ICRC, more than 17,000 people are still registered as missing from the 
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia that broke out in the 1990s. In Croatia, more than 2,500 
people remain unaccounted for following the armed conflicts between 1991 and 1995. In 
</p>
<p>  
 1 For the purposes of the Convention, &#8220;enforced disappearance&#8221; is considered to be the arrest, 
</p>
<p>detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or 
groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a 
refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law&#8221; (art. 2). 
</p>
<p> 2 &#8220;The missing and their families: Summary of the conclusions arising from the events held prior to the 
International Conference of Governments and Non-Government Experts (19-21 February 2003)&#8221;, 
ICRC, p. 11. </p>


<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina, more than 10 years after the end of the war, the fate of more than 
14,000 people had still not been clarified, 5,500 of whom went missing in Srebrenica. In 
Kosovo, more than 2,000 people from all the communities have been reported missing by 
their families. Since the war in Iraq in 2003, tens of thousands of people have been seeking 
family members.3 Thousands of families do not know the fate of their missing relatives in 
Nepal (1996-2006),4 East Timor (1975-1999), Eritrea/Ethiopia (1998-2000), in the Chechen 
Republic of the Russian Federation (since 1994) and in Sri Lanka (since 1983).5 &#8220;A total of 
7,643 persons remain missing, including 4,604 Azerbaijanis and 947 Armenians, from the 
conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region,&#8221; and &#8220;1,763 Georgians and 197 Abkhaz from 
the conflict over the Abkhazia region&#8221;.6 
</p>
<p>16.  The problem of missing causes particular suffering to women and children. Armed 
conflicts often result in them being displaced and separated from family members. Women 
and children go missing for different reasons, one of them being sexual exploitation. In its 
resolution 7/28, the Human Rights Council requested States to pay the utmost attention to 
cases of children and women reported missing in connection with armed conflicts and to 
take appropriate measures to search for and identify those children and women. 
</p>
<p>17.  Frequently, the majority of those missing in relation to armed conflict are men. The 
very fact that many women survive conflicts in which their menfolk have died or gone 
missing has enormous implications. Women in such situations desperately try to ascertain 
the fate of their loved ones and have to cope as head of the household. Women whose 
husbands are missing experience many of the same problems as widows, albeit without 
official recognition of their status. In most contexts, there is no official acknowledgement 
of the status of &#8220;missing person&#8221;, which jeopardizes women&#8217;s rights with respect to 
property administration, inheritance, guardianship of children, entitlement to benefits and 
the prospect of remarriage. 
</p>
<p>18.  The issue of missing persons is a humanitarian problem with human rights and 
international humanitarian law implications. It should be depoliticized and consequently 
should not be dependent on the political settlements of the conflicts concerned. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Respect for and implementation of international law 
</b></p>
<p>19. International obligations to prevent and resolve situations of missing persons in 
connection with armed conflict are based on both international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law. Whereas international humanitarian law is specifically 
designed for armed conflicts, human rights treaties apply at all times and in all 
circumstances to all persons within the jurisdiction of a State party. Strict observance of 
such fundamental rights as the right to life, the right not to be subjected to torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the right to liberty and security, the 
right to fair trial, and the right to respect for private and family life could, to a great extent, 
prevent persons from going missing as a result of armed conflict. On the other hand, if, in

<p>armed conflict, protected persons were treated in conformity with the rules of international 
humanitarian law, there would be fewer missing persons and fewer families without 
information about the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. In this context, the general 
obligation of States parties to the 1949 Geneva Conventions7 to respect and to ensure 
respect for the rules of international humanitarian law should be specifically mentioned. 
</p>
<p>20.  International rules regarding missing persons apply in both international and non-
international armed conflicts. 
</p>
<p>21.  Obligations relating to the issue of missing persons are incumbent not only on States 
but also on the parties to an armed conflict. It should be emphasized that both States and 
parties to an armed conflict continue to be bound by certain obligations of international 
humanitarian law even if the conflict has ended; for instance, it is obvious that searches for 
missing persons should continue without any time limit until all feasible measures to 
account for the missing persons have been taken.  
</p>
<p>22. The rules of international humanitarian law, including those to prevent persons from 
going missing, cannot be respected if they are not known. Dissemination of international 
humanitarian law is therefore the responsibility of States and of the parties to armed 
conflicts. Thus, each party to a conflict must ensure that the forces, persons or groups under 
its command or control are aware of their obligations under international humanitarian law 
and of their responsibility for any failure to comply with the relevant provisions. The 
civilian population, including civil servants, should receive the necessary education in 
international humanitarian law. Likewise, members of the armed forces and the civilian 
population should receive the necessary education in international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>23. International humanitarian law must be duly incorporated into domestic legislation. 
Enacting domestic legislation is highly important when dealing with the issue of missing 
persons, preventing people from going missing, ascertaining the fate of missing persons, 
ensuring the proper management of information and supporting the families of missing 
persons. There may be good reasons for bringing together, into a single law, relevant 
provisions relating to missing persons.8 In this respect, a specific law on missing persons 
that was adopted in Bosnia and Herzegovina9 is noteworthy. National legislation 
concerning the punishment of grave breaches of international humanitarian law, the 
treatment of prisoners of war and the protection of civilians is also pertinent. Specifically, 
the adoption and effective implementation of legal rules aimed at combating, at both the 
domestic and international levels, all forms of sexual exploitation of women and girls must 
be a primary consideration. 
</p>
<p>24.  ICRC has prepared a draft model law on missing persons10 containing the main 
elements to be taken into account by States when drafting legislation on the issue. The 
model law offers a framework legislation aiming to help national authorities to bring 
legislation into conformity with the requirements of international law.

</p>
<p>declared that national policies should entail the passage and enactment of a national law on missing 
persons, accompanied by the necessary regulatory and administrative measures.

<p><b> IV.  Measures to prevent persons from going missing 
</b></p>
<p>25.  Under both international humanitarian law and human rights law, States are obliged 
to take measures to prevent persons from going missing. In its resolution 61/155, the 
General Assembly called upon States that are parties to an armed conflict to take all 
appropriate measures to prevent persons from going missing in connection with armed 
conflicts and account for persons reported missing as a result of such a situation. Such 
measures, especially those of a legislative and institutional nature, must preferably be 
adopted in peacetime. 
</p>
<p>26.  National authorities should establish strict lines of command within armed forces, 
security forces and armed groups so as to ensure effective supervision. 
</p>
<p>27.  Proper identification of members of armed forces or armed groups is a key means of 
preventing people from going missing in armed conflict. Personal records, identity cards 
and identity discs are the only secure means of identification.11 Measures should be taken to 
ensure that these means of identification are mandatory and properly used since they (in 
particular identity discs) can help to establish the status of the persons who fall into the 
hands of the adverse party and the identity of those who have been seriously wounded or 
killed. The issue of identification also involves other populations at risk, such as isolated 
populations, civilians in conflict zones, displaced persons, the elderly and children.12 
Furthermore, the personal data of members of armed forces or armed groups, and of 
persons at risk, including in particular unaccompanied children, elderly and disabled 
persons, should be properly registered; this may assist in a later identification of mortal 
remains. 
</p>
<p>28.  National authorities should register deaths and issue the appropriate certificates. 
Moreover, an information bureau and graves registration service, as provided for under the 
Geneva Conventions,13 should be set up. More particularly, national information bureaux 
should be tasked to collect and forward information (documents and objects) on individuals 
protected by international humanitarian law (principally prisoners of war and civilian 
internees) who have fallen into enemy hands. The registration of such persons is fully in 
keeping with the objectives of humanitarian law, one of which is to protect persons not or 
no longer taking part in hostilities. By setting up an information bureau in accordance with 
the provisions of the Geneva Conventions, a party to an armed conflict provides itself with 
a means of obtaining information about individuals who have gone missing either on the 
battlefield or in enemy-controlled territory, and hence of easing the anguish of their 
families and relatives.  
</p>
<p>29.  Administrative rules and regulations in keeping with internationally recognized 
norms regarding such matters as arrest, detention, imprisonment and captivity should be 
adopted. The security and physical integrity of all those who are not or are no longer taking 
part in hostilities, in particular of persons deprived of their liberty, should be ensured. For 
this to function effectively, clear responsibilities should be established at all levels of 
</p>

</p>
<p>Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Serbia and Spain.

<p>military, police and other relevant State agencies, with a clear information and reporting 
system established before armed conflict starts. 
</p>
<p>30.  National authorities should grant unhindered access to national and international 
bodies working in the area of human rights and humanitarian law, including ICRC, to any 
place where people are being deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p><b> V.  Missing persons and the restoration of family links 
</b></p>
<p>31.  Families have the right to communicate with their family members and to know the 
fate of their relatives. Respect for the right to exchange family news is essential to prevent 
individuals from becoming unaccounted for. 
</p>
<p>32.  The population groups most at risk of losing contact with their relatives are members 
of the armed forces and armed groups, isolated civilians in conflict areas, displaced people 
and refugees, persons deprived of their liberty, and vulnerable persons, such as women, 
children, the elderly and persons with disabilities. In armed conflicts, when the usual means 
of communication are disrupted, ICRC together with national Red Cross and Red Crescent 
societies help to maintain and restore contact between family members through the 
worldwide Red Cross and Red Crescent Family Links Network. The Network facilitates the 
exchange of personal news between family members everywhere in the world, using all 
available means, subject to agreements with the authorities. Red Cross messages are 
collected and distributed, satellite or mobile phones are provided to those who have the 
telephone number of their relatives, and the Internet is used to trace people via the Family 
Links website. With the consent of those concerned, lists of people either providing news or 
looking for news from relatives are published on paper (in newspapers or ad hoc print) and 
on the ICRC website, and broadcast on radio or television. 
</p>
<p>33.  In order to facilitate searches, the parties to an international armed conflict must 
transmit all relevant information concerning people reported missing by an adverse party 
and their requests concerning their own missing persons. This information must be 
transmitted directly to the Central Tracing Agency established by ICRC under the Geneva 
Conventions.  
</p>
<p>34.  During an armed conflict, ICRC and national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies 
collect tracing requests and all available information on people unaccounted for and the 
circumstances under which they disappeared from their families, direct witnesses, the 
authorities and any other reliable source. Using this information, ICRC tries to locate the 
person in, inter alia, places of detention, hospitals, camps for internally displaced persons or 
refugees, morgues and remote villages. Tracing activities also include supplying the 
authorities with lists of people unaccounted for together with information on the 
circumstances in which they went missing, requesting information on the location of 
graves, asking authorities to allow the recovery and identification of human remains. ICRC 
lists on missing persons are often published, widely distributed among authorities and the 
public at large, and used by all those engaged in the process of tracing missing persons. 
This allows for constant dialogue with and making confidential representations to the 
authorities or armed groups in order to clarify the fate of missing persons.  
</p>
<p>35.  There are other humanitarian organizations involved in activities linked to restoring 
family links. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the 
International Organization for Migration are regular partners of ICRC and interested 
national societies. Other agencies, such as the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, and non-
governmental organizations, like the Save the Children Fund, cooperate with ICRC and 
interested national societies in specific cases, for example in assisting unaccompanied 
children. </p>


<p><b> VI.  Mechanisms established to clarify the fate of missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>36.  The efficient treatment of missing persons requires the establishment of competent 
mechanisms at various levels. When such mechanisms are set up, particular attention 
should be given to their mandate, which should focus on their humanitarian objectives, 
namely, to trace persons unaccounted for as a result of an armed conflict, and to inform 
their families accordingly. They should be granted sufficient capacity and powers in order 
to be able to carry out their mandate effectively. For instance, the constitutive documents 
should ensure that they are granted the cooperation and assistance of all authorities, within 
their respective competences, and other organizations in order to receive all relevant 
information in their possession that can help tracing, recovering and identifying missing 
persons. They also need to have access to gravesites and human remains in order to be able 
to proceed to exhumation and identification. Sufficient attention should be paid to creating 
an environment that is conducive to information-sharing, including the possibility of 
working in a confidential manner. Confidentiality is essential for the said institutions to 
function. While searches are ongoing, resorting to judiciary and penal alternatives could 
prevent witnesses to cases of missing persons from disclosing what they know. 
</p>
<p>37.  It might be necessary to put into place mechanisms ensuring coordination and an 
information-sharing process between the parties concerned. They are usually set up in the 
period following the end of the conflict and might be included in documents aiming at 
settling the situation, such as ceasefire and peace agreements. For example, in Cyprus, the 
Committee on Missing Persons was established in April 1981 by agreement between the 
communities concerned under the auspices of the United Nations. The Committee, one of 
the only institutionalized, bicommunal committees in Cyprus, comprises a member 
appointed by each of the two communities; the third member is selected by ICRC and 
appointed by the Secretary-General. The Committee&#8217;s mandate is to establish the fate of 
missing persons. It does not attempt to establish the cause of death or attribute 
responsibility for the death of missing persons. An agreement signed in July 1997 by the 
leaders of both communities provides for the exchange of information regarding known 
burial sites and the return of remains of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot missing 
persons. The primary objective of this project is to allow relatives of missing persons to 
recover the remains of their loved ones, to arrange for a proper burial and to close a long 
period of anguish and uncertainty. To date, the remains of 850 individuals have been 
exhumed from different burial sites located across the island. More than 290 burial sites 
have been visited and opened by the Committee. The remains of 196 individuals have been 
identified<b> </b>and returned to their families. In the Middle East, the Tripartite Commission was 
put in place in 1991 to resolve the fate of missing persons in connection with the Gulf War 
of 1990/91. The Commission, which is composed of Iraq, Kuwait and four members of the 
1991 coalition (France, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland and the United States of America), meets regularly (the whole Committee or its 
subtechnical committee) and works on gravesites and the identification of human remains. 
Since 2003, it has resolved 304 cases of missing persons. Furthermore, ICRC chairs the 
Working Group on Missing Persons in Kosovo in accordance with its mandate and in its 
capacity as a neutral and independent intermediary accepted by all the parties<i>. </i>The primary 
objective of the Working Group, established in March 2004 as part of the Vienna Dialogue 
under the auspices of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, is to clarify the 
fate of the persons who are unaccounted for as a result of the events in Kosovo, and to 
inform their families accordingly. Through their delegations to the Working Group, the 
authorities in Belgrade and Pristina have pledged to search for and provide information on 
alleged gravesite locations and determine the identity of human remains exhumed. They 
have also made a commitment to address the legal and administrative needs of the families 
of the missing. At the time of the establishment of the Working Group, there were more </p>


<p>than 3,000 persons missing from the Kosovo conflict; at the end of 2009, the total number 
of missing persons stood at 1,869.  
</p>
<p>38.  The above-mentioned mechanisms should benefit from all relevant information, and 
the cooperation of their constitutive members should be ensured in this regard. Moreover, 
they should explore the possibility of access to archives of the national, regional and 
international bodies that have collected relevant information (such as international 
tribunals, regional organizations, international and national military contingents). In 2005, 
ICRC, as chair of the Working Group on Missing Persons, negotiated access to the archives 
of the international organizations that had worked and/or were still working in Kosovo, 
particularly those that might possess documentation related to gravesite locations and 
exhumations carried out in Kosovo immediately after the conflict. Formal requests have 
also been forwarded to the Governments of countries whose military contingents operated 
in Kosovo within the Kosovo Force. All retrieved information is being carefully processed 
and analysed in full respect of its working modalities based on confidentiality, and in close 
cooperation with the relevant national entities, in the hope that it might lead to the 
identification of more human remains and potential gravesites. 
</p>
<p>39.  An independent and impartial national institution could play a crucial role in 
clarifying the fate of missing persons. States should ensure the establishment and day-to-
day functioning of such an institution (commission or committee for missing persons) 
through adequate structures, such as working groups or other appropriate mechanisms. The 
commission (or committee) for missing persons should have a clear humanitarian mandate 
established by law, focusing on the tracing of persons that are unaccountable for as a result 
of an armed conflict, and the resources and powers necessary to fulfil that mandate. It 
should, inter alia, (a) receive tracing requests and, on the basis of them, request, collect, 
check and provide to the applicant and State authorities available information and facts on 
persons reported missing, as well as any information on the whereabouts and fate of such 
persons in accordance with the national legislation and with standards pertaining to the 
protection and management of personal data; (b) be responsible for the operation of a 
registry of data, and adopt necessary regulations to that end; (c) take appropriate measures 
to ensure the right of persons deprived of liberty to inform their relatives of their condition, 
whereabouts and circumstances of their detention/imprisonment; (d) take measures to 
ensure the enjoyment of rights by the relatives of missing persons; and (e) perform any 
other tasks required for the performance of its duties. The said body should provide 
mechanisms such as telephone hotlines and web pages for relatives and witnesses to 
register missing persons and trace potential burial sites.  
</p>
<p>40.  In the light of the information available, including the replies given by States to the 
questionnaire, such bodies have been established in a number of situations.14 Their 
mandates, level of activities and resources vary widely. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the 
Missing Persons Institute was established in 2004 on the basis of the Law on Missing 
Persons. Its purpose is to provide Bosnia and Herzegovina with a sustainable national 
mechanism to address all aspects relating to the issue of missing persons as a result of the 
conflict in Bosnia. It also ensures that mass gravesites are protected, catalogued and 
properly excavated and that relatives of the missing are able to participate in the search 
process. In Colombia, two mechanisms are in charge of coordinating efforts to provide 
answers to the families of missing persons on the fate and whereabouts of their relatives, as 
well as to repair them for their loss: the Commission for the Search of Missing Persons and 
the National Commission on Reparation and Reconciliation. The law establishing the 
</p>
<p>  
 14 In, inter alia, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, 
</p>
<p>Greece, Guatemala, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Kosovo, Peru and Serbia. </p>


<p>Commission for the Search of Missing Persons provides for the representation of human 
rights non-governmental organizations through the Colombian Commission of Jurists and 
the Family Association of Missing Detainees.  
</p>
<p>41.  It should be borne in mind that the longer it takes to establish functioning 
mechanisms to deal with the issue of the missing, the less likely it will be that the missing 
will be identified and returned to their families. 
</p>
<p>42.  The institution for missing persons should work closely with the judiciary and other 
governmental and non-governmental entities, employing a strong coordinating mechanism. 
Furthermore, it should cooperate closely with a team of forensic specialists for the recovery 
and identification of missing persons, both alive15 and dead. 
</p>
<p>43.  The said institutions need to be as depoliticized as far as possible, work in a 
transparent manner and include, alongside members of Government bodies, representatives 
of civil society and also of the families of missing persons. 
</p>
<p>44.  It is essential that the above-mentioned institutions deal with the issue of missing 
persons on both sides of the conflict and not condition their work on the results achieved by 
any other side. Their mandates should make it clear that they also have responsibility &#8211; 
insofar as they have information or control over the relevant territory &#8211; for clarifying the 
fate of the missing on the other side or sides as well. In addition, the institutions need to 
cooperate with their counterparts. 
</p>
<p>45.  When there is no cooperation between respective institutions of the parties to the 
armed conflict, they should consider establishing an international institution for looking 
into the issue of the missing, with persons on the institution acting in an individual capacity 
but coming from the region and chosen by the different parties to the conflict. 
</p>
<p>46.  Apart from institutions for missing persons, other instruments and mechanisms 
could be explored when dealing with the issue of missing persons. For example, bodies 
such as human rights commissions and ombudsmen may be useful. Both usually have a 
broad mandate to address human rights violations and should therefore include missing 
persons within their authorities.  
</p>
<p>47.  Furthermore, all justice and rule of law mechanisms, including the judiciary, 
parliamentary commissions or truth-finding mechanisms, are of key importance for solving 
the issue. Judicial process might, for instance, permit victims&#8217; families to intervene at 
various stages of proceedings and exercise their right to know. Also, when tribunals are 
investigating the deaths of missing persons, it should be ensured that their work is 
conducted in a manner that serves the best interest of the families, in that the latter are 
provided with answers, including the identification of the deceased, and brings the persons 
responsible for those crimes to justice. 
</p>
<p>48.  Lastly, truth and reconciliation exercises may have a role to play in clarifying events 
and helping communities move forward. Such exercises would undoubtedly benefit 
families of the missing persons waiting for answers about the fate of the missing. In its 
resolution 12/11, the Human Rights Council emphasized that truth-seeking processes, such 
as truth and reconciliation commissions, that investigate patterns of past human rights 
violations and their causes and consequences are important tools that can complement 
judicial processes and, when established, such mechanisms have to be designed within a 
specific societal context and to be founded on broad national consultations with the 
inclusion of victims and civil society, including non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Forensic science has proved essential for the identification and restitution of missing children to their 
</p>
<p>legitimate families in Argentina. </p>


<p>49.  In Peru, for instance, in a common effort of the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, the Human Rights National Coordination Entity 
and ICRC, a list of missing persons who disappeared as a consequence of the violence in 
Peru between 1980 and 2000 was drawn up. In its final report in 2003, the Commission 
made a series of recommendations focusing on four main domains: institutional reforms; 
the establishment of a comprehensive reparations programme; the establishment of a 
national plan of forensic anthropological intervention; and the institution of follow-up 
mechanisms.16 
</p>
<p><b> VII.  The right to know 
</b></p>
<p>50.  The right to know is the pillar of the protection that ought to be afforded to missing 
persons and their families.  
</p>
<p>51. The right of family members to know the fate of missing relatives as a result of 
armed conflict, including their whereabouts or, if dead, the circumstances and cause of their 
deaths and the correlative obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the 
circumstances surrounding a disappearance, is provided by both international human rights 
law and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>52.  The right of the relatives to know the fate of their family member is explicitly laid 
down in article 32 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. Article 33 of the Protocol 
further provides that &#8220;[a]s soon as circumstances permit&#8230;, each party to the conflict shall 
search for the person who had been reported missing by an adverse Party&#8221;. The same was 
recognized to apply in non-international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>53.  The right to know also includes the right to information about the place of burial of a 
missing relative, if known. 
</p>
<p>54.  In addition to international instruments that lay down obligations in relation to 
missing persons, there is also a wealth of relevant case law that has been built up by 
regional supervisory bodies over the past 20 years. Thus, it has been generally recognized 
that a person&#8217;s becoming unaccounted for can cause grievous suffering not only for the 
person who has gone missing but also for that person&#8217;s family, and that this suffering can 
amount to inhuman treatment. Relevant examples from case law of the Inter-American 
Court of Human Rights include the cases relating to Vel&#225;squez Rodr&#237;guez (1988) and Blake (1998). The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights took a similar line in the 
case of <i>Amnesty International and others v. Sudan </i>(1999). Reference should also be made 
to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights: in a number of its decisions, the 
Court has emphasized the obligation of States to take adequate measures to trace missing 
persons and satisfy families&#8217; right to know.17  
</p>
<p>55.  The Human Rights Council has discussed on various occasions the right to the truth, 
although in a broader context. In its resolution 12/12, the Council reaffirmed the importance 
of respecting and ensuring the right to the truth so as to contribute to ending impunity and 
to promote and protect human rights. The Council noted that the right to the truth may be 
characterized differently in some legal systems as the right to know or the right to be 
informed or freedom of information. 
</p>
<p>  
 16 See the website of the Truth and Conciliation Commission at 
</p>
<p>www.cverdad.org.pe/ingles/ifinal/index.php. 
 17 For example, <i>see</i> <i>Aziyev and Aziyeva v.</i> <i>Russia </i>(2008). </p>


<p>56.  The right to know must be clearly recognized in domestic law and regulations. 
States and parties to an armed conflict are under an obligation to take the necessary 
measures to clarify the fate of missing persons and to inform the family thereof. Family 
members must be regularly informed about the progress and results of investigation 
concerning the fate or whereabouts of a missing relative. Effective remedies, including 
adequate compensation, should be provided for any violation of this obligation. The 
systematic and deliberate denial of the right to know the fate of one&#8217;s relative should be 
punished as a criminal offence under domestic law. Moreover, any available information 
must be provided not only to the families but also to relevant institutions tracing missing 
persons. 
</p>
<p>57.  In armed conflicts, protected persons must be allowed to inform, or require the 
competent authorities to notify, their families (or any other person of their choice) of their 
capture or arrest, address and state of health. The systematic and deliberate denial of this 
right should be criminalized under domestic law. The right of protected persons to 
correspond with the members of their family must also be ensured. 
</p>
<p>58.  In armed conflicts, regular access and visits to all protected persons deprived of their 
liberty for reasons related to the conflict must be granted to ICRC immediately after their 
capture or arrest and until their release.  
</p>
<p>59.  No punishment should be imposed for maintaining private or personal contact with 
relatives or for seeking information regarding the fate or whereabouts of a relative who is 
detained or interned. The right must be upheld no matter the nature of the act the person is 
suspected of having committed, including criminal acts and against State security.18 
</p>
<p><b> VIII.  Criminal investigation and prosecution of human rights 
violations linked to missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>60.  While focusing on the humanitarian dimension of missing persons in armed conflict, 
it is also necessary to bear in mind the fact that cases of missing persons may also constitute 
criminal offences sometimes amounting to war crimes or crimes against humanity. States 
should ensure effective investigation and prosecution of all serious human rights violations 
linked to missing persons. 
</p>
<p>61.  Comprehensive national policies on missing persons to be adopted and duly 
implemented by States should entail, inter alia, criminalization under national criminal 
legislation of violations of international humanitarian norms and international human rights 
standards applicable to the issue of missing persons, and the establishment of a mechanism 
for investigation and prosecution to guarantee the enforcement of the said legislation. 
</p>
<p>62.  It should be possible for a criminal investigation into a case of missing persons to be 
conducted for as long as the fate and whereabouts of the missing persons have not been 
clarified. This obligation also includes the duty to provide full protection to witnesses, 
relatives, judges and other participants in any relevant proceedings. 
</p>
<p>63.  Domestic legislation should provide for the possibility of conducting independent 
forensic investigations in cases of persons unaccounted for during an armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>64.  The findings of criminal investigations into cases of missing persons should be made 
available upon request to all interested persons, unless doing so would jeopardize an 
</p>
<p>  
 18 See Guiding Principles / Model Law on the Missing, available from the ICRC website 
</p>
<p>(www.icrc.org). </p>


<p>ongoing criminal investigation. The relatives of the victims should be closely associated 
with an investigation into a case of missing persons. 
</p>
<p>65.  National authorities should immediately hand over any official documentation in 
their possession containing information on the activities of their own armed forces or those 
affiliated with them that may be relevant to investigations and prosecutions for crimes 
under international law. Legal provisions relating to State secrets or national security 
should not be invoked to obstruct the handing over of such documentation. In particular, 
military officials should provide unconditional cooperation in investigations on missing 
persons, including full details of events relating to missing persons, and the whereabouts of 
military officers, whether in active service or retired, who are suspected of involvement in 
missing persons or who may possess information on individual cases. 
</p>
<p>66.  In cases where there is a suspicion or prima facie evidence that a deceased person 
may have been victim of an extrajudicial execution or other human rights violations, a 
prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigation should be conducted on the 
circumstances surrounding the death of the person, in accordance with international 
standards, including the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-
legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions.19 
</p>
<p>67.  As a general principle, there should be no recourse to pardon, amnesty or similar 
political measures to terminate the criminal prosecution or punishment of crimes linked to 
missing persons. Pardon or amnesty should not, however, be excluded for the purposes of 
finding the truth and facilitating the peace process. In any case, blanket amnesty laws must 
not be enacted and the above-mentioned measures must be applied in accordance with 
international law. 
</p>
<p>68.  The progress achieved in recent years in combating impunity for crimes against 
humanity and war crimes is important insofar as it increases respect for international 
humanitarian law and therefore helps to reduce the number of missing persons. However, 
this might also lead to difficulties in obtaining information about the fate of missing 
persons through the mechanisms provided for by international humanitarian law, since the 
responsible authorities would fear criminal prosecution. In this regard, effective means to 
collect relevant information on missing persons should &#8220;generate greater incentives for 
those with information on the fate of the missing to speak out, rather than to remain silent 
and be an obstacle to the fight against impunity&#8221;.20 In such a way, the right of the families 
to know the fate of their relatives and criminal prosecution work together towards the 
achievement of justice. 
</p>
<p><b> IX.  Legal status of missing persons and support for families of 
persons unaccounted for 
</b></p>
<p>69.  The question of missing persons entails consequences not only for the victims 
themselves, but also for their families, especially dependent women, elderly persons and 
children, who are more directly affected owing to social and cultural constraints. In certain 
cases, family members even hesitate to obtain information of their missing wives or 
daughters; in others, women who have been able to return are rejected by their families. 
States must ensure that families do not suffer from any stigmatization related to the

<p>disappearance of their relative. The specificity of their situation should be publicly 
recognized. 
</p>
<p>70.  States are obliged to take measures to respond to the material, financial, 
psychological and legal needs faced by families of persons unaccounted for. In this context, 
a mechanism for needs assessment and the processing of requests for assistance should be 
established to which the persons concerned would have ready access. 
</p>
<p>71.  First and foremost, the legal situation of persons reported missing as a result of 
armed conflict and of their relatives should be established in domestic legislation. 
Specifically, the law should envisage the circumstances and the procedure by which a 
person can be declared absent or missing. Furthermore, the legal consequences of a 
declaration of absence and a declaration of death, including in terms of property 
administration, guardianship and parental authority, should be clearly prescribed by law. 
</p>
<p>72.  The main principle is that the rights and interests of missing persons, including their 
civil status, property and assets, must be protected at all times until their fate has been 
ascertained or their death recognized. 
</p>
<p>73.  Missing persons should be presumed to be alive until their fate has been ascertained. 
The foremost right of a missing person is that of search and recovery. A person should not 
be declared dead without sufficient supporting evidence. The death of a missing person 
may be determined through the identification of his or her remains or presumed as a result 
of other evidence, events or certain defined situations, or may be presumed after a period of 
time. The issuance of a death certificate should have all of the effects to a missing person as 
it does with regard to any other person. 
</p>
<p>74.  With regard to the assistance to be provided to the families of persons unaccounted 
for, it is essential that steps be taken to ensure that the dependents of such persons are 
entitled to the same social or financial benefits provided for other victims. States should 
adopt a gender-sensitive approach to ensuring the rights of relatives. Such matters as the 
custody of the children of the missing person, inheritance rights, the right to remarriage, 
pension rights and entitlements to public assistance should be properly addressed in 
domestic legislation. In this regard, recommendation CM/REC(2009)12 on principles 
concerning missing persons and the presumption of death, adopted by the Committee of 
Ministers of the Council of Europe on 9 December 2009, is noteworthy. In its 
recommendation, the Committee of Ministers states that a fair balance must be struck 
between the interests of missing persons and of the beneficiaries as well as others with a 
legitimate interest, particularly with regard to property and inheritance rights, pension and 
life insurance rights, the right to enter into a new union (marriage, registered partnership or 
similar union), legal affiliation and parental rights. 
</p>
<p>75.  If needed, material and financial assistance should be provided to the dependents of 
missing persons. States should ensure that the families can benefit from support 
programmes aiming to improve their situation and helping them to deal with the ongoing 
psychological suffering related to the disappearance of their relatives. The interests of 
children and women and the situation of single heads of families should be given special 
attention. In particular, measures should be taken to reunite unaccompanied children with 
their families or to prevent them from being separated from their direct relatives (parents or 
siblings). Community and psychological support, including therapeutic when necessary, 
should also be provided to all those in need. Moreover, families should be supported in 
their will to commemorate and restore the memory of their missing relatives within society 
or in their community of belonging. Assistance should be provided to relatives of missing 
persons in order to reintegrate them into social life. </p>


<p>76.  States should consider recognizing missing civilians as war victims and including 
their families in the system of social benefits, as provided for families of missing 
servicemen. 
</p>
<p>77.  The right of relatives of missing persons to be granted reparation should be ensured. 
</p>
<p>78.  States should provide support for civil society initiatives in favour of the families of 
missing persons and those linked with solving the issue of missing persons.21 Furthermore, 
they should facilitate contacts, including cross-border contacts, between families of missing 
persons. 
</p>
<p>79.  The international community and national authorities could play a more proactive 
role in assisting the families of missing persons to organize themselves, including through 
the provision of funding, the provision of premises and equipment for communication. It is 
important that this support be not politicized and that the families of missing persons be 
allowed to run their own independent organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> X.  Management of the dead and identification of human 
remains 
</b></p>
<p>80.  National legislation should contain provisions governing the situation of the dead 
and human remains.22 All suspicious deaths should be investigated and the deceased 
identified. 
</p>
<p>81.  The main principle is that the dead should be searched for, recovered and identified 
without distinction. Proper recovery, management, examination, identification, storage or 
burial, and repatriation of human remains and corpses should be ensured. The dead should 
be treated with respect and dignity throughout. They should be buried in clearly marked 
graves in sites that are identified and registered and which allow for the tracing and 
recovery of the individual remains when required. Parties to an armed conflict must 
endeavour to facilitate the return of the remains, upon request of the party to which they 
belong or of the next of kin. Missing persons&#8217; relatives have the right to demand that places 
of burial of their loved ones be marked and protected. Adequate training and information on 
the management of the dead and their identification should be provided to members of the 
armed forces as well as relevant services involved in the collection and management of the 
dead. 
</p>
<p>82.  The identification, mapping and preservation of burial sites are an important step. As 
time passes and those with information move away or die, it becomes increasingly 
important that this aspect of the issue of missing persons be addressed. Information needs to 
be collected from different sources, including high-ranking officers, combatants and 
civilians, who may have information concerning burial sites. Cross-border agreements 
should be established with neighbouring countries where there is reasonable suspicion that 
gravesites may exist. The discovery of burial sites can be important not only in tracing 
missing persons but also in the identification of the commission of crimes and their possible 
subsequent prosecution. 
</p>
<p>  
 21 Information on civil society organizations, family organizations and relevant networks were provided 
</p>
<p>in the replies to the questionnaire submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico 
and Serbia. 
</p>
<p> 22 Information on forensic capacities, the management of the dead and the identification of human 
remains was given in the replies to the questionnaire submitted by Argentina, Armenia, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Guatemala, Mexico, Serbia and Spain. </p>


<p>83.  International humanitarian law prohibits the despoliation and mutilation of the dead. 
All acts of mutilation and despoliation must be criminalized. The fact that intentional 
mutilation may also be an element of concealing separate criminal offences that resulted in 
the deaths must be borne in mind. Moreover, the act of mutilating or despoiling the dead 
may constitute the war crime of committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular 
humiliating or degrading treatment, as identified in articles 8(2)(b)(xxi) and 8(2)(c)(ii) of 
the Statute of the International Criminal Court for both types of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>84.  Criminal sanctions should also be established for the non-respect of burial sites and 
the desecration of graves. 
</p>
<p>85.  For a family of missing persons, the return of the body for burial is essential for the 
mourning process and an important step towards obtaining justice. If it is not possible for 
the remains to be returned (for example, when they are unidentified or are unclaimed), they 
should be buried properly, as specified above. Also, all necessary measures should be taken 
to ensure proper handling of the personal effects of the deceased. 
</p>
<p>86.  The main responsibility for the proper handling of the dead and for providing 
information to the families lies with the authorities and armed groups. 
</p>
<p>87.  The forensic recovery of human remains constitutes part of the right to know the 
truth and contributes to the knowledge of the whereabouts of the missing person. It also 
dignifies the victims whose remains are thus recovered, and helps to ensure the right to 
bury the dead and to carry out ceremonies for them in accordance with each culture, which 
is inherent in all human beings. 
</p>
<p>88.  Ensuring adequate standards of forensic practice for investigations into missing 
persons serves several important purposes: (a) the recovery of remains for physical 
examination and analysis for their identification and determination of cause and manner of 
death, including the documentation of injuries and other evidence for legal proceedings and 
to uncover human rights abuses; (b) the release of remains to relatives, thereby facilitating 
funeral arrangements and emotional healing; (c) the search for clues, which may assist in 
the historical reconstruction of events and revelations to create awareness; and (d) 
acknowledgement that is necessary for healing and to draw lessons for the future of the 
community. Forensic investigations should be performed only with proper authorization, 
adequate standards of quality assurance and control, and in accordance with the conditions 
specified by law. 
</p>
<p>89.  Forensic human identification of human remains is based on the comparison and 
matching of information obtained from the deceased (post-mortem data) with equivalent 
information from the missing person (ante-mortem data). The main methods of 
identification are fingerprints, dental traits and unique medical, radiological or 
anthropological features and genetics &#8211; typically, forensic DNA analysis.  
</p>
<p>90.  While there is a trend to use forensic DNA analysis for the identification of human 
remains, there are, however, certain difficulties associated with this process, including the 
costs involved, the facilities used and the expertise required for the analysis, interpretation 
and reliability of results. Laboratories performing such analysis should work to accredited 
standards of quality control and assurance. In some cases, there may be no DNA 
recoverable from the remains or suitable family members may not be available for 
comparisons. Therefore, identification should not be based solely on DNA analysis (or on 
any other primary method alone), but should take into account all available ante-mortem 
and post-mortem data. 
</p>
<p>91.  Authorities must ensure that the examination of human remains and their 
identification are undertaken by qualified and competent professionals. An authority 
competent to issue and deliver death certificates must be designated. </p>


<p>92.  According to ICRC, the procedures of forensic recovery and post-mortem 
examination of human remains should respect the following principles: (a) at all times, the 
dignity, honour, reputation and privacy of the deceased must be respected; (b) the known 
religious beliefs and opinions of the deceased and his or her relatives should be taken into 
consideration; (c) families should be kept informed of decisions in relation to recovery and 
post-mortem examinations, and of the results of any such examination; (d) after post-
mortem examination, the remains should be released to the family at the earliest time 
possible; (e) it is essential that all information required for the search for and identification 
of the remains, including ante-mortem and post-mortem data, be adequately collected and 
properly managed, including with the necessary professional advice, legal and ethical 
provisions, and with the support of appropriate databases and software where necessary.23 
</p>
<p>93.  Any forensic work on missing persons should be based on standards of forensic best 
practice (legal, ethical, scientific and technical) and conducted with the primary aim of 
identifying victims and returning their remains to their families. Direct contacts should be 
established between forensic teams and the relatives of the missing persons. 
</p>
<p>94.  The case of Cyprus, where ICRC offered advice and support in establishing a 
sustainable all-Cypriot team of forensic scientists, may be regarded as a model of best 
practice. The Cypriot forensic team, comprising Greek and Turkish Cypriot forensic 
practitioners, works with the families of missing persons and integrates different 
disciplines, including archaeology, anthropology and genetics.24 
</p>
<p>95.  The International Commission on Missing Persons, an independent and impartial 
organization established in 1996 to support the Dayton Peace Agreement, and 
headquartered in Sarajevo, pioneered the use of DNA technology to identify large numbers 
of missing persons. By matching DNA from blood and bone samples, the Commission has 
helped identify 18,000 missing persons; today, its database houses 150,000 genetic samples 
relative to missing persons in more than 20 countries. Techniques developed by the 
Commission in the Western Balkans have revolutionized the search for missing persons in 
other countries, and Commission experts are now assisting the Governments of Chile, 
Colombia, Iraq and the Philippines, and provide assistance to Kuwait, Norway, South 
Africa and Thailand. The effective use of DNA as a means of mass identification has 
transformed the Commission from a small organization operating on an essentially political 
level into the world&#8217;s largest identification programme that currently operates the world&#8217;s 
biggest high-throughput DNA human identification facility.25 
</p>
<p>96.  Competent authorities must adopt adequate procedures for providing information on 
the identity, location and cause of death to the appropriate authorities and to families. In 
particular, information on deceased persons and the location of human remains and graves 
should be centralized and transmitted to the other party to the conflict. 
</p>
<p>97.  The authorities must ensure that the dead, including burials, are recorded, as well as 
information on graves and the persons interred in them. This task might be entrusted to the 
State&#8217;s official graves registration service; if not, it would require the establishment and 
functioning of a complementary system to record the details of death and internment of 
protected persons.

<p><b> XI.  Information management and legal protection of personal 
data 
</b></p>
<p>98.  The main purpose of collecting data on missing persons is to establish the identity, 
location and fate of persons unaccounted for (both living and deceased) and to give 
information to the families on the whereabouts and fate of their missing relatives. 
</p>
<p>99.  Coordination of the activities of all those involved and the sharing of information 
would increase the effectiveness of any action taken to ascertain the fate of persons 
unaccounted for. States should ensure that information collected on persons unaccounted 
for is as comprehensive as possible. Information should be collected and processed fairly 
and lawfully. States should ensure respect for the relevant standards and principles with 
regard to the protection of personal data whenever information, including medical and 
genetic information, is managed and processed. Exchange of the information among those 
involved should take place without endangering victims, the persons collecting the 
information or the sources of information.26 
</p>
<p>100.  Locating missing persons and/or finding information about them requires searches 
of all possible records. The records of local government units, such as the police, are 
important, as is information that can be derived from cemetery and morgue records. 
</p>
<p>101.  The issue of data management is also relevant to exhumation projects in the search 
for missing persons. While oral reports may provide information about possible burial sites 
or mass graves, records of military or other government personnel who, for example, may 
have been assigned to digging graves or who were involved in transportation to or from the 
site, may also provide or corroborate information. 
</p>
<p>102.  State authorities should allow access to pre-war health and dental records to 
facilitate the identification process of mortal remains. 
</p>
<p>103.  States should provide for adequate sanctions for destroying or unlawfully 
withholding information on missing persons. 
</p>
<p><b> XII.  Cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>104.  States should cooperate at the international level in order to effectively solve cases 
of missing persons by providing mutual assistance in terms of information-sharing, victim 
assistance, locating and identifying missing persons, and in exhuming, identifying and 
returning human remains. 
</p>
<p>105.  International humanitarian law can only work in practice if belligerents, or former 
belligerents, cooperate with each other. Accordingly, the issue of missing persons cannot be 
settled unilaterally by one side to the conflict, and close cooperation and coordination are 
necessary between the different sides. Parties to an armed conflict should refrain from 
acting on the basis of reciprocity in dealing with the issue of missing persons. The sharing 
of information or the taking of steps, for example, should not be conditional on the other 
side also providing information or taking steps; in other words, cooperation should be 
unconditional. Humanitarian law is not subject to any principle of reciprocity. 
</p>
<p>  
 26 Information on information management regarding missing persons was included in the replies to the 
</p>
<p>questionnaire submitted by Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, 
Guatemala, Jamaica, Mauritania, Mexico, Paraguay and Serbia. </p>


<p>106.  Following an armed conflict, bilateral and multilateral cooperation among States in 
conjunction with humanitarian organizations can lead to more effective assistance to 
families. States should endeavour to address the humanitarian nature of the problem 
independently of other inter-State issues so as to avoid causing further distress to the 
families of missing persons pending the resolution of political issues. 
</p>
<p>107.  Intergovernmental organizations and ICRC, acting in conformity with their 
respective mandates, should be available to support Government authorities and armed 
groups in fulfilling their responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>108.  International and regional organizations should encourage inter-State cooperation. 
They may also have an important role to play on their own. 
</p>
<p>109.  International and regional organizations involved in solving the problem of missing 
persons should develop cooperation further within their respective mandates while ensuring 
synergy and avoiding duplication. 
</p>
<p>110.  There is a pressing need to develop cooperation agreements and partnerships not 
only at the intergovernmental level, but also with national Red Cross and Red Crescent 
societies, civil society structures and, in particular, with the associations of families of 
missing persons. 
</p>
<p>111.  Civil society organizations play an important role in addressing different issues such 
as tracing missing persons and in providing material, social and psychological rehabilitation 
for affected family members. They should be provided with adequate financial and 
technical assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> XIII.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b> International obligations to prevent and resolve situations of missing persons as 
a result of an armed conflict are based on both international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b> Enacting national legislation is highly important when dealing with the issue of 
missing persons, preventing people from going missing, ascertaining the fate of 
missing persons, protecting their rights, ensuring the proper management of 
information and supporting the families of missing persons. In this respect, a draft 
model law on missing persons prepared by ICRC is of great importance. 
</b></p>
<p>114.<b>  States and parties to an armed conflict are obliged to take all appropriate 
measures to prevent persons from going missing. In particular, members of armed 
forces or armed groups, as well as other populations at risk, such as isolated 
populations, civilians in conflict zone, displaced persons, the elderly, women and 
children, must be properly identified. An information bureau and graves registration 
service, as provided for under the Geneva Conventions, should be set up. In armed 
conflicts, ICRC must be granted access to all persons deprived of their liberty for 
reasons relating to the armed conflict as well as to all particularly vulnerable 
individuals. 
</b></p>
<p>115.<b>  All parties to an armed conflict have an obligation to search for the persons 
reported missing. They should also facilitate enquiries made by members of families, 
encourage the work of organizations engaged in this task and provide lists showing 
the exact location and markings of graves, together with data on the deceased interred 
therein. 
</b></p>
<p>116.<b>  The right to exchange family news in all circumstances should be recognized. In 
armed conflicts, when the usual means of communication are disrupted, ICRC </b></p>


<p><b>together with national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies help to maintain and 
restore contact between family members through the worldwide Red Cross and Red 
Crescent Family Links Network. In order to facilitate searches, the parties to an 
international armed conflict must transmit all relevant information concerning people 
reported missing by an adverse party and their requests concerning their own missing 
persons. This information must be transmitted directly to the Central Tracing Agency 
established by ICRC under the Geneva Conventions.  
</b></p>
<p>117.<b>  States and parties to an armed conflict should ensure the establishment and 
day-to-day functioning of an independent and impartial national institution, which 
could play a crucial role in clarifying the fate of missing persons. Such institutions 
(commissions or committees on missing persons) should deal with the issue of missing 
on both sides to the conflict and not condition their work on the results achieved by 
any other side. They should work closely with governmental and non-governmental 
entities, family associations and the families of the missing. 
</b></p>
<p>118.<b>  The right of family members to know the fate of missing relatives as a result of 
armed conflict, including their whereabouts or, if dead, the circumstances and cause 
of their deaths, is provided for under both international humanitarian law and human 
rights law. States and parties to an armed conflict are under an obligation to take the 
measures necessary to clarify the fate of missing persons and to inform families 
thereof. Family members must be regularly informed about the progress and results 
of investigation concerning the fate or whereabouts of missing relatives. 
</b></p>
<p>119.<b>  While focusing on the humanitarian dimension of missing persons in armed 
conflict, it is also necessary to bear in mind that cases of missing persons can 
sometimes constitute criminal offences, including war crimes or crimes against 
humanity. States should ensure effective investigation and prosecution of all serious 
human rights violations linked to missing persons.  
</b></p>
<p>120. <b> The legal situation of persons reported missing as a result of armed conflict and 
of their relatives should be clearly established in domestic legislation. The rights and 
interests of missing persons, including their civil status, property and assets, must be 
protected at all times until their fate has been ascertained or their death recognized.  
</b></p>
<p>121.<b>  States are obliged to take measures to respond to the material, financial, 
psychological and legal needs faced by the families of persons unaccounted for. States 
should adopt a gender-sensitive approach to ensuring the rights of relatives. They 
should support initiatives from key actors and organizations in civil society involved 
in providing support for families of missing persons. The right of relatives of missing 
persons to be granted reparation should be ensured. 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b> The dead should be searched for, collected and identified without distinction. 
They must be identified and buried in properly marked graves in sites that are 
identified and registered. All acts of mutilation and despoliation of the dead must be 
criminalized. 
</b></p>
<p>123.<b>  The competent State authorities are obliged to take all necessary measures to 
recover human remains, which must be returned to the family as soon as possible. If it 
is not possible for the remains to be returned, a proper burial should be ensured. 
</b></p>
<p>124.<b>  The forensic recovery and identification of human remains help to ensure the 
right to know the truth and contribute to the knowledge of the whereabouts of missing 
persons. Forensic investigations should be conducted only with proper authorization, 
following standards of best practice, and in accordance with the conditions specified 
by law.  </b></p>


<p>125.<b>  Information on persons unaccounted for, including ante-mortem data, should 
be collected and processed fairly and lawfully. States should ensure respect for the 
relevant standards and principles with regard to the protection of personal data 
whenever information, including medical and genetic information, is managed and 
processed.  
</b></p>
<p>126.<b>  States should cooperate at the international level to effectively solve cases of 
missing persons by providing mutual assistance in terms of information-sharing, 
victim assistance, locating and identifying missing persons, and in exhuming, 
identifying and returning human remains. Parties to an armed conflict should refrain 
from acting on the basis of reciprocity when addressing the issue of missing persons.  
</b></p>
<p>127.<b>  States that are parties to an armed conflict should fully cooperate with ICRC in 
order to establish the fate and whereabouts of missing persons. 
</b></p>
<p>128.<b>  Financial and technical assistance should be provided to the countries and/or 
official bodies concerned for exhumation and identification processes. 
</b></p>
<p>129.<b>  International and regional organizations involved in solving the problem of 
missing persons should develop cooperation further within their respective mandates 
while ensuring synergy and avoiding duplication. Cooperation agreements and 
partnerships should be developed not only at the intergovernmental level, but also 
with national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, civil society structures and 
associations of families of missing persons. 
</b></p>
<p>130.<b>  States should raise public awareness of the problem of missing persons as a 
fundamental concern of international humanitarian law and human rights law, and 
encourage the mass media to draw the public&#8217;s attention to this problem and to the 
needs of families of missing persons. 
</b></p>
<p>131.<b>  The establishment of a special rapporteur on missing persons with a relevant 
mandate would significantly enhance the existing international mechanisms protecting 
the rights of missing persons and their families.</b>
