</p>
<p><b>Introduction to the guiding principles 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 34 of its resolution 13/14, the Human Rights Council encouraged the 
Special Rapporteur to explore, in consultation with Member States and relevant 
stakeholders, ways and means of raising the capacity of countries, particularly developing 
countries, including least developed and net food-importing countries, to ensure the 
realization and protection of the right to adequate food for their populations, and to report 
his findings to the Council. The guiding principles on human rights impact assessments of 
trade and investment agreements (see appendix) are one contribution in the fulfilment of 
this part of the mandate. The guiding principles are intended to provide States with 
guidance on how best to ensure that the trade and investment agreements they conclude are 
consistent with their obligations under international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>2. Human rights treaty bodies and special procedures of the Human Rights Council 
have regularly called upon States to prepare human rights impact assessments of the trade 
and investment agreements that they conclude.1 Human rights impact assessments can be an 
important tool for States in negotiating trade and investment agreements, particularly to 
ensure that they will not make demands or concessions that will make it more difficult for 
them, or for the other party or parties, to comply with their human rights obligations. Yet, 
States have been provided with little guidance as to how such human rights impact 
assessments should be prepared, what is specific to a human rights impact assessment (as 
distinct, for instance, from sustainability impact assessments or social impact assessments), 
and how the conduct of human rights assessments relates to the undertakings of States 
under human rights treaties.  
</p>
<p>3. The guiding principles are intended to provide such advice. They are also intended 
as an operational tool that may be useful for human rights treaty bodies and the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council, to the extent that their mandate includes 
assessing the consistency of trade and investment agreements with the human rights 
undertakings of States. In addition, these guiding principles could serve as a source of 
inspiration for companies carrying out human rights due diligence, in order to identify, 
prevent, mitigate and account for the human rights impacts of their activities, particularly in 
the negotiation and conclusion of investment agreements with the host States in which they 
invest.2 Since the preparation of human rights impact assessments is a way for the State to 
discharge its human rights obligations, by ensuring that it does not conclude agreements 
that make it more difficult or impossible for the State to comply with such obligations, it is 
recommended that the process of preparing human rights impact assessments be stipulated 
in legislation, rather than left to the ad hoc choices of the Executive.  
</p>
<p>4. The guiding principles are also a response to a key recommendation of an 
international expert seminar held under the auspices of the mandate in Geneva on 23 and 24 
June 2010. The seminar, at which a variety of stakeholders from all regions were 
represented, underlined the need for a set of principles for conducting human rights impact 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>regarding Ecuador (E/C.12/1/Add.100), para. 56; Committee on the Rights of the Child, concluding 
observations regarding El Salvador (CRC/C/15/Add.232), para. 48; Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, concluding observations regarding Colombia 
(CEDAW/C/COL/CO/6), para. 29, regarding the Philippines (CEDAW/C/PHI/CO/6), para. 26, and 
regarding Guatemala (CEDAW/C/GUA/CO/6), para. 32; report of the Special Rapporteur on the right 
to food on his mission to the World Trade Organization (A/HRC/10/5/Add.2), paras. 37-38.

</p>
<p>assessments of trade and investment agreements.3 This set of principles is intended to 
provide a methodology. It is also aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of such 
assessments and ensuring that they are not undermined by actors who misappropriate the 
term &#8220;human rights impact assessment.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>5. The guiding principles have been prepared in consultation with the experts who 
participated in the June 2010 seminar, as well as other special procedures mandate holders, 
the human rights treaty bodies and the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee. The 
Special Rapporteur also launched a public consultation on the guiding principles, inviting 
comments from States, United Nations departments and agencies, national human rights 
institutions, civil society and other relevant stakeholders. Thus, the guiding principles are 
informed by extensive consultations with a variety of stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>6. The guiding principles&#8217; normative contribution lies not in the creation of new 
international legal obligations, but in elaborating the implications of pre-existing 
international human rights norms and standards for States when negotiating trade and 
investment agreements. Broadly speaking, the guiding principles constitute a tool to help 
States fulfil their human rights obligations, avoid unintended consequences of trade and 
investment agreements, and achieve nationally established human development goals. Each 
Principle is accompanied by commentary, further clarifying its meaning and implications. 
</p>
<p>7. The guiding principles are not intended as a one-size-fits-all solution. While the 
principles themselves are applicable universally, the means by which they are implemented 
will reflect national contexts and capacities (human, financial, technical and political).

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Guiding principles on human rights impact assessments of 
trade and investment agreements 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. The duty to prepare human rights impact assessments of trade and 
</b></p>
<p><b>investment agreements 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. All States should prepare human rights impact assessments prior to the conclusion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trade and investment agreements. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Commentary  
</i></p>
<p>1.1 By preparing human rights impact assessments prior to the conclusion of trade and 
investment agreements, States are addressing their obligations under the human rights 
treaties. First, since States are bound by these pre-existing treaty obligations, they are 
prohibited from concluding any agreements that would impose on them inconsistent 
obligations. Therefore, there is a duty to identify any potential inconsistency between pre-
existing human rights treaties and subsequent trade or investment agreements, and to refrain 
from entering into such agreements where such inconsistencies are found to exist.4 Human 
rights impact assessments are a tool to ensure consistency and coherence between the 
obligations of States under international law and other international agreements to which 
they are parties, and thus to overcome, or at least mitigate, the problems resulting from the 
fragmentation of international law<i>.</i>5  
</p>
<p>1.2 Second, the right of every citizen to take part in the conduct of public affairs, 
recognized under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 25 (a)), 
implies that no trade or investment agreement should be concluded in the absence of a 
public debate, which in principle should be conducted by freely elected parliamentary 
assemblies for approval to ensure that the free expression of the will of the electors shall be 
fully respected (art. 25 (b) of the Covenant).6 Human rights impact assessments serve to 
inform such public debate.  
</p>
<p>1.3 Third, since compliance with the obligations imposed under trade and investment 
agreements typically is ensured by the threat of economic sanctions or reparations 
authorized or awarded by an agreement-specific dispute settlement mechanism or 
international arbitral tribunals, it is important that any inconsistency with pre-existing 
human rights obligations imposed on the State are identified beforehand, to the fullest 
extent possible. Where an inconsistency between the human rights obligations of a State 
and its obligations under a trade or investment agreement becomes apparent only after the 
entry into force of the said agreement, the pre-existing human rights obligations must 
prevail. This follows both from the duty of all States to cooperate towards the full 
realization of human rights under the Charter of the United Nations,7 and from the specific 
</p>
<p>

 5 See the report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission on the fragmentation of 
</p>
<p>international law<i>: </i>difficulties arising from the diversification and expansion of international law 
(A/CN.4/L.682). 
</p>
<p> 6 This is also in line with article 2, paragraph 3, of the Declaration on the Right to Development. 
 7 Article 103 of the Charter provides that: &#8220;In the event of a conflict between the obligations of the 
</p>
<p>Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other 
international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>nature of human rights treaties that generate rights for individual human beings and do not 
depend entirely on reciprocity among States.8 It also follows from the fact that human rights 
are <i>jus cogens</i> norms, accepted and recognized by the international community of States as 
a whole as norms from which no derogation is permitted, so that treaties or provisions 
within these treaties inconsistent with human rights should be considered void and 
terminated.9  
</p>
<p><b> II. The purpose of preparing human rights impact assessments of trade 
</b></p>
<p><b>and investment agreements 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. States must ensure that the conclusion of any trade or investment agreement does not 
</b></p>
<p><b>impose obligations inconsistent with their pre-existing international treaty obligations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including those to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Commentary 
</i></p>
<p>2.1 States cannot ignore their human rights obligations in the conclusion of trade or 
investment agreements, whether at the multilateral or bilateral level.10 The specific purpose 
of human rights impact assessments, which distinguishes them from other impact 
assessments (such as social, environmental or sustainability impact assessments), is to 
ensure that States will not be facing inconsistent obligations, imposed respectively under 
human rights treaties and under trade or investment agreements, and that they will not face 
obstacles in the realization of human rights they have committed to guarantee as a result of 
having entered into such agreements. In other words, the human rights impact assessment 
should measure the potential impact of the trade or investment agreement on human rights 
outcomes and on the capacity of States (and non-State actors, where relevant) to meet their 
human rights obligations, as well as on the capacity of individuals to enjoy their rights. This 
is in conformity with the expectation that States<b> </b>shall &#8220;maintain adequate domestic policy 
space to meet their human rights obligations when pursuing business-related policy 
objectives with other States or business enterprises, for instance through investment treaties 
or contracts.&#8221;11 
</p>
<p>2.2 Human rights impose on States three levels of obligations. First, States must <i>respect 
</i>human rights. They are thus precluded from entering into trade or investment agreements

relevant, ensure that the right to adequate food is given due attention&#8221;); No. 14 (2000) on the right to 
the highest attainable standard of health, para. 39 (&#8220;In relation to the conclusion of other international 
agreements, States parties should take steps to ensure that these instruments do not adversely impact 
upon the right to health&#8221;); No. 15 (2002) on the right to water, paras. 31 and 35-36 (&#8220;States parties 
should ensure that the right to water is given due attention in international agreements and, to that 
end, should consider the development of further legal instruments. With regard to the conclusion and 
implementation of other international and regional agreements, States parties should take steps to 
ensure that these instruments do not adversely impact upon the right to water. Agreements concerning 
trade liberalization should not curtail or inhibit a country&#8217;s capacity to ensure the full realization of 
the right to water.&#8221;).

</p>
<p>that would require them to adopt certain measures, such as lowering a tariff or 
strengthening intellectual property rights, that would result in an infringement of human 
rights they have agreed to uphold.12  
</p>
<p>2.3 Second, States should <i>protect</i> human rights. They must therefore ensure that they 
will not be precluded from the possibility of controlling private actors whose conduct may 
lead to violating the human rights of others, for example as a result of an excessively high 
level of protection of foreign investors established on their territory or because of a broad 
understanding of the prohibition of imposing performance requirements on such investors.  
</p>
<p>2.4 Third, States should <i>fulfil</i> human rights. This requires that States refrain from 
concluding trade and investment agreements that will render impossible the adoption of 
policies that move towards the full realization of human rights, insofar as it relates to rights 
that are subject to progressive realization by States to the maximum of their available 
resources. While taking into consideration the unique country context, this requires that the 
fiscal and economic sustainability of trade and investment agreements be carefully 
examined. States should refrain from concluding agreements that would affect their public 
budgets or balance of payments in a way that would impede the full realization of human 
rights, making the fulfilment of human rights impossible or delayed.    
</p>
<p>2.5 Each of these obligations must be discharged in ways that are compatible with the 
requirement of non-discrimination.13 In human rights law, discrimination constitutes any 
distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that is based 
on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth or other status, and which has the purpose or effect 
of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by all persons, on an equal 
footing, of all rights and freedoms. It also includes any action or omission that, whether 
intended or not, disproportionately affects members of a particular group, in the absence of 
a reasonable and objective justification, thus constituting de facto discrimination. 
Furthermore, in order to eliminate de facto discrimination, States may be under an 
obligation to adopt special measures to attenuate or suppress conditions that perpetuate 
discrimination. In human rights law, such measures are legitimate to the extent that they 
represent reasonable, objective and proportionate means to redress de facto discrimination 
and are discontinued when substantive equality has been sustainably achieved. 
</p>
<p>2.6 Finally, States owe these obligations both to the individuals on their territory, and to 
individuals on the territory of the State with which they conclude a trade or an investment 
agreement, to the extent that the conclusion of the agreement may affect such individuals&#8217; 
</p>
<p>ability to enjoy human rights.14 Thus, where, using its economic leverage or other means of 
influence at its disposal, one State requires that another State accept the inclusion in a trade 
</p>
<p>  
 12 For instance, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has recently expressed its 
</p>
<p>concern that the &#8220;TRIPs-plus&#8221; provisions concerning accession to the International Convention for the 
Protection of New Varieties of Plants, which are routinely included in free trade agreements, may 
increase food production costs, seriously undermining the realization of the right to food. Concluding 
observations on Switzerland (E/C.12/CHE/CO/2-3), para. 24. 
</p>
<p> 13 Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 18 (1989) on non-discrimination; Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 20 (2009) on non-discrimination in 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p> 14 Thus the obligation to carry out human rights impact assessments may be derived from the 
requirement of States to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. For example, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its concluding observations on Switzerland recommended 
that &#8220;the State party undertake an impact assessment to determine the possible consequences of its 
foreign trade policies and agreements on the enjoyment by the population of the State party&#8217;s partner 
</p>
<p>countries, of their economic, social and cultural rights&#8221; (E/C.12/CHE/CO/2-3), para. 24.  </p>

<p>or investment agreement of a provision that will prohibit that State from complying with its 
human rights obligations towards its own population or that will impede such compliance, 
the former State may be seen as coercing the latter State, which engages its international 
responsibility.15 
</p>
<p><b> III. The link between human rights impact assessments of trade and 
</b></p>
<p><b>investment agreements and the conclusion of such agreements 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Human rights impact assessments of trade and investment agreements should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>prepared prior to the conclusion of the agreements and in time to influence the 
</b></p>
<p><b>outcomes of the negotiations and, if necessary, should be completed by ex post impact 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessments. Based on the results of the human rights impact assessment, a range of 
</b></p>
<p><b>responses exist where an incompatibility is found, including but not limited to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following: 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (a) Termination of the agreement; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (b) Amendment of the agreement; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (c) Insertion of safeguards in the agreement; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (d) Provision of compensation by third-State parties; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (e) Adoption of mitigation measures. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Commentary 
</i></p>
<p>3.1 Even by initiating the human rights impact assessment before negotiations are well 
advanced, the final results of the assessment may only become available when negotiations 
have advanced to a point such that anything more than cosmetic changes may become 
extremely difficult. As such States are encouraged to finalize a feasibility study that 
incorporates a human rights impact assessment prior to entering into the final phase of 
formal negotiations.  
</p>
<p>3.2 Where the impact assessment indicates the possibility of potential human rights 
violations resulting from the draft agreement, the draft may have to be revised to remove 
any incompatibility that has been found with pre-existing human rights obligations of the 
State concerned. Where an incompatibility is found, such incompatibility should be 
removed before the agreement can be signed or ratified by the State. Removing the 
incompatibility can be achieved either by the adoption of measures at the domestic level 
that ensure that the agreement will be consistent with the human rights obligations of the 
State, for example, by the introduction of measures that will ensure an adequate level of 
protection of vulnerable groups that may be harmed by the agreement, such as &#8211; in certain 
cases &#8211; women, or by introducing within the agreement itself clauses, such as flexibilities 
or exceptions, that will allow the State to comply with its human rights obligations. 
Moreover, the precautionary principle should be applied: if a human rights impact 
assessment identifies that there are reasons to believe that the agreement may cause harm, 
even where those potentially harmful effects are not demonstrated or cannot be quantified, 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Under article 18 of the draft articles on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, 
</p>
<p>adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001) (<i>Official Records of the 
General Assembly, Fifty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 10</i> (A/56/10), chap. IV, sect. E, subsect. 1): 
&#8220;A State which coerces another State to commit an act is internationally responsible for that act if:  (a) 
The act would, but for the coercion, be an internationally wrongful act of the coerced State; and (b) 
The coercing State does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the act.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on the Governments negotiating the 
agreement.  
</p>
<p>3.3 Not all the impacts of the entry into force of a trade or investment agreement can be 
anticipated. Therefore, ex ante human rights impact assessments should be complemented 
by human rights impact assessments performed ex post, once the impacts are measurable. A 
human rights impact assessment should be conceived of as an iterative process, taking place 
on a regular basis, for instance, every three or five years. Safeguard clauses should be 
inserted into the trade or investment agreement to ensure that, should such ex post 
assessments lead to the conclusion that the State is unable to comply with its human rights 
obligations within the constraints of the agreement, it should be released from such 
constraints to the extent of the incompatibility. However, even in the absence of such 
safeguard clauses, human rights impact assessments that arrive at the conclusion that the 
obligations imposed under a trade or investment treaty cannot be upheld without violating 
human rights obligations should lead the State to consider the trade or investment treaty, or 
the problematic provisions within the treaty, as void, or to denounce it. While the 
possibility of denunciation or withdrawal should be provided for in any trade or investment 
agreement entered into by the State, a right of denunciation or withdrawal may be implied 
in any trade or investment agreement to the extent necessary for a State to comply with its 
human rights obligations, even in the absence of such an explicit clause. This follows from 
the fact that human rights obligations prevail over other treaty obligations.16 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The methodology of human rights impact assessments of trade and 
</b></p>
<p><b>investment agreements 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Each State should define how to prepare human rights impact assessments of trade 
</b></p>
<p><b>and investment agreements it intends to conclude or has entered into. The procedure, 
</b></p>
<p><b>however, should be guided by a human rights-based approach, and its credibility and 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectiveness depend on the fulfilment of the following minimum conditions: 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (a) Independence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (b) Transparency; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (c) Inclusive participation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (d) Expertise and funding; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (e) Status. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Commentary 
</i></p>
<p>4.1 While the primary purpose of a human rights impact assessment of a trade and 
investment agreement is to ensure that the provisions of such agreement shall not be 
incompatible with the normative content of relevant human rights, it also should include an 
assessment of whether the process of negotiating the impact of the trade or investment 
agreement has affected human rights. Thus, it should be assessed whether the process of 
negotiation was participatory, inclusive and transparent, and whether it was conducted with 
appropriate parliamentary oversight.  
</p>
<p>4.2 Human rights impact assessments can constitute a complex endeavour, and 
challenges may be encountered in developing a robust methodology. A number of factors 
</p>
<p>  
 16 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 56; and see Inter-American Court of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>The Sawhoyamaxa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay</i>, para. 140. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>contribute to this, including: (a) the difficulties of establishing causality between human 
rights outcomes and specific trade/investment reforms or initiatives; (b) the paucity of data, 
especially in least-developed countries; and (c) the limitations of quantitative and 
qualitative methods in capturing dynamic effects of trade/investment reforms. For this 
reason, it is for each State to define the calendar according to which the assessment shall be 
made; which body shall be in charge of the assessment; and on the basis of which data the 
assessment shall be prepared. Nevertheless, in order to avoid too widely inconsistent 
practices that could put human rights impact assessments into disrepute, any human rights 
impact assessment should be guided by a human rights-based approach in the way it is 
conducted. It follows, for instance, that the methodology used should not be discriminatory; 
that it should seek to promote inclusive participation; that it should be conducted with full 
transparency; and that accountability should be ensured in the way the assessment is carried 
out. Other minimum principles are listed below.  
</p>
<p>4.3 <i>Independence</i>.  Whether it is prepared by a national institution for the promotion and 
protection of human rights,17 by experts specifically designated for this task, by a 
parliamentary committee in which opposition political voices are included, or by others, the 
human rights impact assessment should be initially prepared by a body or group of experts 
that is independent from the Executive which is negotiating, or has negotiated, the trade or 
investment agreement. That initial assessment should not necessarily be determinative, 
however: since it is to allow for the meaningful participation of citizens in public affairs 
and for an improved accountability of the Executive to the other branches of Government 
(see commentary following principle 1), the initial assessment should, ideally, be debated in 
Parliament. In most constitutional systems, the Parliament is best positioned to identify 
measures that the State should take in order to remove any incompatibility that has been 
found to exist, and either to adopt such measures, or to hold the Executive accountable for 
their adoption. As the issue is ultimately a legal one, of determining whether a trade or 
investment agreement is compatible with the human rights obligations of the State, courts 
may also have a role to play, for instance in hearing claims, based on the conclusions of the 
human rights impact assessment, as to whether the Executive may sign the agreement or 
should obtain further improvements, or as to whether it should denounce it.  
</p>
<p>4.4 <i>Transparency</i>. The human rights impact assessment should be based on sources of 
information that are made public. It should work on the basis of a clear methodology, 
defined in advance of the process and made public. And it should be open to receiving 
submissions, in order to ensure that its information basis will be as broad as possible.   
</p>
<p>4.5 <i>Inclusive participation</i>. The human rights impact assessment should consider the 
views of the communities directly affected by the trade or investment agreement by 
ensuring participation in the conduct of the assessment. For this participation to be 
meaningful, those consulted should be provided with all the available information on the 
potential impacts, and the assessment should refer explicitly to their concerns and how 
these concerns could be addressed.   
</p>
<p>4.6 <i>Expertise and funding</i>. The body or group tasked with preparing the human rights 
impact assessment should be composed of relevant experts and sufficiently well funded in 
order to prepare a high-quality assessment. This body or group requires the combination of 
different methodologies in which different disciplines are represented (including but not 
limited to human rights and investment/trade), and may also require the commissioning of 
outside expertise. Funding should be sufficient, in particular, to allow for participatory,

</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>inclusive, transparent and meaningful participation in the assessment by, among others, 
civil society and the most affected rights holders directly or through their representatives. 
</p>
<p>4.7 <i>Status</i>. Human rights impact assessments are a tool for States negotiating trade or 
investment agreements to ensure that the conclusion of such agreements will not lead these 
States to violate their human rights obligations or to be unable to fulfil such obligations. 
Therefore, provided the results of the assessments are taken into account, States may be 
said to have acted with all due diligence to minimize the risk of such inconsistencies (see 
commentary following principles 1 and 2). It follows from this very purpose of human 
rights impact assessments that, while such assessments may be prepared by external experts 
commissioned for that purpose, or by a body with a purely advisory role such as a national 
human rights institution for the promotion and protection of human rights, they must then 
feed into the decision-making process that leads to the conclusion and approval of the trade 
or investment treaty concerned (ex ante assessments), or that leads to the decision whether 
or not to denounce such treaty or to withdraw from it (ex post assessments). Ideally, this 
implies that the results of the assessment will be presented to the Parliament, and that the 
conclusions to be drawn will be the subject of a parliamentary debate. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. While each State may decide on the methodology by which human rights impact 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessments of trade and investment agreements will be prepared, a number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>elements should be considered: 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (a) Making explicit reference to the normative content of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations;   
</b></p>
<p><b>   (b) Incorporating human rights indicators into the assessment; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (c) Ensuring that decisions on trade-offs are subject to adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation (through a participatory, inclusive and transparent process), comport 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the principles of equality and non-discrimination, and do not result in 
</b></p>
<p><b>retrogression.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Commentary 
</i></p>
<p>5.1 <i>Explicit reference to the normative content of human rights obligations</i>. Human 
rights impact assessments are distinct in that they examine the intended and unintended 
impacts of trade and investment agreements on the ability of the States parties to these 
agreements to respect, protect and fulfil human rights (see commentary following principle 
2). They therefore should be based explicitly on the normative content of human rights, as 
clarified by the judicial and non-judicial bodies that are tasked with monitoring compliance 
with human rights obligations. References in impact assessments to development goals or 
to poverty, therefore, are not a substitute for a reference to the normative components of 
human rights. Additionally, specific attention should be given to the impact of trade and 
investment agreements on gender equality, as required under the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>5.2 <i>Human rights indicators</i>. Human rights impact assessments should rely on 
indicators that measure the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) Whether the trade or investment agreement will make it more difficult for the 
State concerned to ratify particular human rights instruments, to adapt its regulatory 
framework to the requirements of human rights, or to set up the institutional mechanisms, 
that ensure compliance with its human rights obligations (structural indicators);  
</p>
<p>(b) Whether it creates obstacles to the implementation of the State&#8217;s policy 
measures and programmes, or to the functioning of institutional mechanisms, that ensure </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>effective fulfilment of State&#8217;s human rights obligations, particularly insofar as such 
obligations require budgetary commitments (process indicators); and  
</p>
<p>(c) Whether the trade or investment agreement may make it more difficult for a 
State to make progress in the realization of the human rights it has undertaken to comply 
with, measured from the perspective of full enjoyment of all human rights by all (outcome 
indicators).18 
</p>
<p>5.3 In order to ensure compliance with the human rights requirement of non-
discrimination and that due attention is paid to the situation of the most vulnerable groups, 
particularly women, it is essential that these indicators provide information broken down by 
gender, by disability, by age group, by region and by ethnicity, or on other grounds, based 
on a contextual, country-level appreciation of the groups that are most vulnerable.19 In 
addition, the process itself of negotiating and concluding a trade or investment agreement 
should be assessed as regards its compliance with the principles of participation, 
transparency, and accountability (see commentary following principle 4): certain indicators 
should be adopted that allow the human rights impact assessment to take into account this 
dimension.

<p><b> V. Balancing priorities and human rights impact assessments of trade or 
</b></p>
<p><b>investment agreements 
</b></p>
<p><b> 6. States should use human rights impact assessments, which aid in identifying both the 
</b></p>
<p><b>positive and negative impacts on human rights of the trade or investment agreement, 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure that the agreement contributes to the overall protection of human rights. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Commentary 
</i></p>
<p>6.1 Each State retains the prerogative in setting its priorities, which often requires 
balancing different competing priorities. Trade and investment agreements may benefit 
certain groups, making them better off, while hurting others, whose situation will worsen as 
a result. Delicate choices will have to be made about the priorities that the State seeks to 
pursue, for instance, where trade and investment agreements contribute to economic growth 
and thus may facilitate the ability of the State to realize certain rights by mobilizing 
budgetary resources to finance certain public goods and services in various areas, including 
education, food, health and housing, while at the same time negatively affecting the State&#8217;s 
capacity to protect the rights of certain groups, such as workers in the least efficient sectors 
of the economy. States should prioritize those economic and social benefits that will be 
sustainable in the long term in terms of their contribution to the realization of all human 
rights, including the right to development, over short-term economic and/or political gains 
expected from any trade and investment agreement. Furthermore, complementary policy

and/or disparities in the realization of rights, is an essential part of implementation [of the Convention

<p>measures are indispensable for ensuring that those directly affected by the trade/investment 
agreement and vulnerable groups are protected and, concurrently, that society as a whole 
can benefit equitably from any positive impacts on economic output, competitiveness and 
growth. 
</p>
<p>6.2 Human rights impact assessments seek to clarify the nature of such choices, and to 
ensure that they are made on the basis of the best information available. The question of 
which trade-offs are acceptable is to be decided at the level of each country, through open 
and democratic processes, which the human rights impact assessment seeks to inform. 
However, the process of setting priorities and of managing trade-offs, as well as the 
substance of the outcome, must comply with certain conditions.  
</p>
<p>6.3 First, the process of setting priorities must involve effective, free, active and 
meaningful20 participation of all stakeholders, including the poorest and most vulnerable 
segments of the population and women. As already noted under principle 5, the institutional 
mechanisms through which impact assessments are prepared and feed into political 
decision-making must therefore allow for the views of these stakeholders to be fully taken 
into account, directly or through their legitimate representatives.  
</p>
<p>6.4 Second, the principle of equality and non-discrimination rules out any trade-offs 
which would result in or exacerbate unequal and discriminatory outcomes, for example, 
giving priority to providing health and education services to the more affluent parts of 
society, rather than to the most disadvantaged and marginalized groups, particularly 
women.  
</p>
<p>6.5 Third, trade-offs must never result in a deprivation of the ability of people to enjoy 
the essential content of their human rights. It follows that no provision is acceptable that 
might deprive people of their current income sources unless a credible, realistic and 
sustainable alternative is offered that would allow for the continued enjoyment of human 
rights in full dignity. 
</p>
<p>6.6 Fourth, even where the previous condition is fulfilled, any trade-off that results in a 
retrogressive level of protection of a human right should be treated as highly suspect: trade-
offs whereby one right suffers a marked decline in its level of realization would need to be 
subject to the most careful consideration and to be fully justified by reference to the totality 
of human rights.  
</p>
<p>6.7 Fifth, to the fullest extent possible, solutions should be found under which losses 
and gains are shared across groups, rather than concentrated on one group. This suggests 
the need to identify mechanisms, such as mitigating measures or redistributive measures 
included in taxation schemes, ensuring that those benefiting from the agreement will at 
least in part compensate those who are negatively affected, and that the latter will be 
protected.21

<p><b> VI. Key steps in preparing a human rights impact assessment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 7. To ensure that the process of preparing a human rights impact assessment of a trade 
</b></p>
<p><b>or investment agreement is manageable, the task should be broken down into a 
</b></p>
<p><b>number of key steps that ensure both that the full range of human rights impacts will 
</b></p>
<p><b>be considered, and that the assessment will be detailed enough on the impacts that 
</b></p>
<p><b>seem to matter the most: 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (a) Screening; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (b) Scoping; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (c) Evidence gathering; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (d) Analysis; 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (e) Conclusions and recommendations; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>   (f) Evaluation mechanism. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Commentary 
</i></p>
<p>7.1 First, the human rights impact assessment should include a preliminary analysis of 
which human rights are most likely to be affected, with respect to which population groups, 
as a result of the trade or investment agreement (<i>screening</i>): this should allow the 
determination of which elements of the trade or investment agreement shall be subject to a 
full assessment, and with regard to their impacts on which human rights.  
</p>
<p>7.2 Second, those in charge of the human rights impact assessment should determine the 
set of questions that will have to be addressed and the methodology to be applied, including 
the use of indicators, for the full assessment in the areas identified at the screening stage 
(<i>scoping</i>). The scoping stage becomes more complex in an ex ante assessment, which might 
not have a negotiating text available before it and, thus, might have to examine several 
possible outcomes of a negotiation. Accordingly, the human rights impact assessment might 
have to consider at least two scenarios, and the scoping stage could identify these. 
</p>
<p>7.3 Third, <i>evidence gathering</i> shall include the use of both quantitative (including 
economic modelling and regression analysis) and qualitative research (including 
consultations with rights holders or their representatives, and where feasible using 
participatory research methodologies), in order to determine the impacts as precisely as 
possible. The contribution of human rights impact assessments to improving participation 
and accountability in the process of the negotiation of trade and investment agreements 
should be kept in mind in defining how evidence shall be gathered: the involvement of the 
groups affected, directly or through their legitimate representatives, is both a means to 
inform the process and an end in itself (see commentary following principle 4).  
</p>
<p>7.4 Fourth, the impacts of the trade or investment agreement on the ability of the State 
to respect, protect and fulfil human rights should be assessed, taking into account what has 
been said above about trade-offs (<i>analysis</i>). Such an analysis may include 
recommendations as to how any tension between the trade or investment agreement on the 
one hand, and human rights obligations on the other hand, may be addressed, although the 
identification of the measures that might be adopted in order to address such tensions could 
be left to the parliamentary committee receiving the human rights impact assessment to 
guide its deliberations. The outcome of the human rights impact assessment, in any case, 
should be made public, since it should feed into the public debate about the preparation or 
implementation of the trade or investment agreement considered. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>7.5 Fifth, the impact assessment should lead to the presentation of <i>conclusions and 
recommendations</i>, on the basis of which the bodies in charge of negotiating and concluding 
the impact assessment shall be held accountable. 
</p>
<p>7.6 Sixth, appropriate follow-up should be given to the conclusions and 
recommendations adopted at the final stage of the impact assessment, by organizing a 
<i>monitoring and evaluation mechanism</i> assessing the extent to which these conclusions and 
recommendations were in fact taken into account.
