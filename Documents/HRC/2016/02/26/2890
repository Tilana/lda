<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 13/4 of 24 March 2010, 16/27 of 25 
</p>
<p>March 2011 and 19/7 of 22 March 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Determined</i> to foster strict respect for the purposes and principles enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the imperative need to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 
</p>
<p>2015 in order to contribute to making the right to development a reality for everyone,  
</p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned </i>that hunger, like poverty, is still predominantly a rural problem, 
</p>
<p>and that in the rural population it is those who produce food who suffer disproportionately, 
</p>
<p>and alarmed that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural areas, particularly 
</p>
<p>in developing countries, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, and 
</p>
<p>that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, discrimination and 
</p>
<p>exploitation,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing<b></b></i><b> </b>that livelihoods in rural areas are disproportionately affected by 
</p>
<p>poverty, climate change, lack of development and lack of access to scientific progress,  
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the draft declaration on the rights of peasants and other people 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas prepared by the Advisory Committee and submitted to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council,1 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced<b></b></i><b> </b>of the need to strengthen the protection and realization of the human 
</p>
<p>rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas<b>,
