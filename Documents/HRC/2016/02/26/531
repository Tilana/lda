<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 
</p>
<p>27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of Fiji was held at the 5th meeting, on 29 
</p>
<p>October 2014. The delegation of Fiji was headed by Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney-
</p>
<p>General and Minister of Justice. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 October 2014, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group adopted the report on Fiji. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Fiji: Japan, Namibia and the Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Fiji: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/FJI/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/FJI/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/FJI/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Germany, Liechtenstein, 
</p>
<p>Mexico, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland was transmitted to Fiji through the troika. The questions are available on 
</p>
<p>the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Opening statements by the Fijian delegation were made by the Attorney-General and 
</p>
<p>Minister for Justice, the Chief Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chairman 
</p>
<p>of the Media Industry Development Authority. 
</p>
<p>6. The commitment of Fiji to promoting and protecting the fundamental principles and 
</p>
<p>values of universal human rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>had been affirmed in the Fijian Constitution adopted on 7 September 2013. The first 
</p>
<p>Constitution in Fiji to eliminate the legal enforcement of ethnic voting and to include social 
</p>
<p>and economic rights, as well as civil and political rights, it had created a transformative 
</p>
<p>human rights normative framework for the people of Fiji. Under the Constitution, the State 
</p>
<p>was legally obliged to protect and promote those rights. 
</p>
<p>7. Fiji had held elections under the Constitution on 17 September 2014, with an 84.6 
</p>
<p>per cent participation rate of registered voters, and a record low 0.75 per cent of invalid 
</p>
<p>ballots. In a preliminary statement, the Multinational Observer Group had deemed the 
</p>
<p>elections credible and representative of the will of the Fijian people. 
</p>
<p>8. In addition to the human rights set forth in the core international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, Fiji urged the Human Rights Council to address emerging human rights issues </p>


<p>including trans-border impacts of climate change, asylum policies and consequences of free 
</p>
<p>trade agreements on social and economic rights. 
</p>
<p>9. In response to questions on the ratification of international human rights instruments 
</p>
<p>from Belgium, Mexico and the United Kingdom, Fiji confirmed that it was not a party to 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, or the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Nonetheless, the robust Bill of Rights in 
</p>
<p>the Constitution went beyond obligations under those instruments and placed an obligation 
</p>
<p>on the State to promote and protect those rights for all Fijians. Those rights were applied 
</p>
<p>directly by the Fijian judiciary. Approval of the ratification of those international 
</p>
<p>instruments was the prerogative of Parliament. 
</p>
<p>10. Fiji remained amenable to inviting special procedures mandate holders to visit the 
</p>
<p>country. However, it was operating in an entirely new political, social and legislative 
</p>
<p>environment. Fiji wanted to be in a position to ratify those instruments and have the 
</p>
<p>resources to host and meet the standards of the mandate holders before inviting them. 
</p>
<p>11. Women&#8217;s rights in Fiji were in line with the Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which Fiji had ratified in 1995. In 
</p>
<p>response to questions from ten countries on steps taken to end discrimination and violence 
</p>
<p>against women, Fiji acknowledged the challenges posed by those issues. New initiatives 
</p>
<p>included updated provisions in the Crimes Decree for the offences of rape and sexual 
</p>
<p>assault, the passing and application of the Domestic Violence Decree, judicial training, a 
</p>
<p>new National Gender Policy and gender training for civil servants. Fiji corrected the claim 
</p>
<p>made by the Netherlands that the Constitution did not protect women by listing the newly 
</p>
<p>protected grounds, in addition to sex and gender, in the Bill of Rights, which included 
</p>
<p>gender identity and expression, pregnancy and marital status, and constituted broad 
</p>
<p>protection from discrimination against women, allowing for the legal expression of 
</p>
<p>intersectional discrimination. It was also clarified that the higher levels of reported cases of 
</p>
<p>domestic violence, about which concern had been raised, in fact reflected higher reporting 
</p>
<p>by victims owing to their confidence in the above-mentioned initiatives. 
</p>
<p>12. Those measures would only be meaningful if all stakeholders played their part in 
</p>
<p>shaping society&#8217;s attitudes towards zero tolerance of discrimination and violence against 
</p>
<p>women. Training and participation by the police, civil society, the judiciary and prosecutors 
</p>
<p>was also required. It was important for civil society organizations to familiarize themselves 
</p>
<p>with those laws and initiatives because they were empowered to represent women in the 
</p>
<p>legal system under the Domestic Violence Decree. 
</p>
<p>13. The Domestic Violence Decree did not establish domestic violence as an offence; 
</p>
<p>the charge would remain one of assault under the Crimes Decree. However, there were 
</p>
<p>important provisions in the Domestic Violence Decree that could be used to protect women. 
</p>
<p>14. Responding to questions from Belgium and Estonia on the International Criminal 
</p>
<p>Court, the delegation said that Fiji had been one of the first States to ratify the Rome Statute 
</p>
<p>and it remained steadfastly committed to the International Criminal Court. The country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>domestic legislation is in full complementarity with the provisions of the Rome Statute and 
</p>
<p>domestic legislation through the Crimes Decree. 
</p>
<p>15. Responding to questions from Ethiopia and Switzerland on rights vis-&#224;-vis 
</p>
<p>limitations in the Fijian Constitution, Fiji explained that the burden was on the State to 
</p>
<p>prove that the limitations were necessary. The law must always promote the values that 
</p>
<p>underlay a democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom. In addition, 
</p>
<p>section 7 of the Bill of Rights, underpinning those democratic principles, guided the courts&#8217; 
</p>
<p>interpretations and allowed them to consider international law in their decisions. </p>


<p>16. Responding to questions about the abolition of the death penalty asked by France, 
</p>
<p>Germany and Namibia, Fiji noted that it had abolished the death penalty in 2001. However, 
</p>
<p>it remained in the Military Code indirectly, by virtue of the applicability of the Army Act 
</p>
<p>1955 of the United Kingdom. Fiji announced that in the forthcoming session of Parliament, 
</p>
<p>the Military Code would be amended to remove the reference to the death penalty 
</p>
<p>altogether. 
</p>
<p>17. Responding to questions and recommendations from Germany, New Zealand and 
</p>
<p>the Republic of Korea on human rights abuses, in particular alleged torture and ill-treatment 
</p>
<p>by the police, Fiji explained that, in cases in which complaints were made to the police, and 
</p>
<p>in which the Director of Public Prosecutions determined that there was sufficient evidence 
</p>
<p>for prosecution, the perpetrators had been prosecuted. Indeed, some were currently serving 
</p>
<p>terms of imprisonment for such acts. 
</p>
<p>18. The new legal framework of Fiji under the Constitution allowed steps to be taken to 
</p>
<p>ensure that police procedures were modernized and made more transparent. It was 
</p>
<p>acknowledged that torture during interrogation had been a long-standing problem in Fiji, 
</p>
<p>owing to cultural misconceptions inherited from attitudes prevalent in Europe within living 
</p>
<p>memory. Therefore, in order to avoid lengthy court proceedings to determine whether 
</p>
<p>confessions and statements had been obtained under torture, the judiciary had itself 
</p>
<p>provided budgetary resources to launch a project under which all interviews of suspects in 
</p>
<p>custody would be video recorded, and would provide additional funds and training for the 
</p>
<p>investigators. That had been done in recognition of the fact that institutions must combine 
</p>
<p>their resources in order to eliminate impropriety and violent treatment, and to ensure a more 
</p>
<p>efficient justice system. 
</p>
<p>19. The police had also acknowledged deficiencies in police investigations and aspects 
</p>
<p>of police culture that in the past had excused or ignored police brutality, and that training 
</p>
<p>was needed in the areas of domestic violence and interrogations. Specialized organizations 
</p>
<p>had been invited to cooperate with relevant Fijian agencies in the provision of such training 
</p>
<p>so as to improve the human rights standing of the criminal justice system in Fiji. In further 
</p>
<p>response to concerns raised about assaults and brutality in police custody, the delegation 
</p>
<p>explained that, in cases in which evidence had been obtained by means of assault by the 
</p>
<p>police, the prosecution would not continue and the matter would be referred to the 
</p>
<p>Commissioner of Police for investigation and possible criminal charges against the officers. 
</p>
<p>Such cases had most recently resulted in the prosecution and conviction of three police 
</p>
<p>officers who had been convicted of murder by joint enterprise, and two who had been 
</p>
<p>convicted of being accessories after the fact when a young man had died in police custody. 
</p>
<p>20. The Fijian criminal justice system was explained, with particular emphasis on the 
</p>
<p>processes followed between the lodging of a criminal complaint and the decision on 
</p>
<p>whether or not to proceed with the prosecution. It was emphasized that the police were also 
</p>
<p>independent of the Government and the Director of Public Prosecutions with regard to how 
</p>
<p>police investigations were conducted, and that the police could only act if a formal written 
</p>
<p>complaint was made by a person, including if the complaint was one of unfair treatment by 
</p>
<p>the police.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>22. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) commended efforts on social development, 
</p>
<p>poverty reduction, the health service, decent housing and the risk of natural disasters. The </p>


<p>National Policy on Persons Living with Disabilities and free primary and secondary 
</p>
<p>education were noted. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Algeria welcomed the Constitution establishing universal principles and the 
</p>
<p>strengthened legal framework for human rights, particularly regarding elections and 
</p>
<p>political participation. Policies addressing persons with disabilities and older persons, and 
</p>
<p>efforts to address living standards were appreciated. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Argentina offered its congratulations on the introduction of the National Gender 
</p>
<p>Policy promoting gender equality, social justice and sustainable development. Argentina 
</p>
<p>referred to its work with France and other countries on an international campaign to 
</p>
<p>encourage ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
</p>
<p>from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED) and made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Australia welcomed the 2014 elections and the provisional recognition of their 
</p>
<p>credibility from the Multinational Observer Group. Australia noted the importance of 
</p>
<p>supporting the democratic role of civil society and the media. Australia commended the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization (ILO) direct contacts mission and noted the continued 
</p>
<p>need for close engagement with labour partners. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Bangladesh noted progress, despite the challenges faced and the vulnerability of Fiji 
</p>
<p>to natural disasters, highlighting the Constitution, improvements in women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>health and resources for education. Women&#8217;s involvement in public life and decision-
</p>
<p>making, and gender-based violence were reported areas of concern. Bangladesh made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Belgium welcomed the introduction of electoral legislation and the revocation of the 
</p>
<p>Public Emergency Regulations 2009, while recognizing ongoing human rights challenges. 
</p>
<p>The National Gender Policy was noted, although gender-based violence was prevalent, and 
</p>
<p>the importance of freedom of expression and assembly were emphasized. Belgium made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Brazil commended Fiji for the successful general elections and the appointment of 
</p>
<p>women to ministerial and assistant ministerial positions. It was concerned about restrictions 
</p>
<p>on freedom of opinion and expression and the percentage of the population living below the 
</p>
<p>poverty line. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Canada asked what steps were being taken to ensure full protection of the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression, opinion, association and assembly. It welcomed the news that 
</p>
<p>women accounted for 16 per cent of the new Parliament and the election of a female 
</p>
<p>Speaker of Parliament. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Chile encouraged action to ensure the independence of the judiciary, restrict the 
</p>
<p>scope of emergency legislation, guarantee freedom of expression, and compensate victims 
</p>
<p>of human rights violations. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. China commended Fiji for its commitment to gender equality and social justice, the 
</p>
<p>National Policy on Persons Living with Disabilities and the National Council for Older 
</p>
<p>Persons. It also commended the increase in investment aimed at guaranteeing free primary 
</p>
<p>and secondary education. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>32. Costa Rica encouraged speedier action to ratify core human rights instruments, and 
</p>
<p>urged Fiji to continue cooperating with treaty bodies and special procedures. It welcomed 
</p>
<p>the steps that were being taken to remove the death penalty from all legal instruments. It 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Cuba commended the steps being taken by Fiji to meet the needs of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and to ensure access to free primary and secondary education. Cuba urged the </p>


<p>international community to support national efforts for issues identified as priorities. It 
</p>
<p>made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>34. Denmark welcomed the new Government&#8217;s undertaking to ratify all core human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments. Noting that steps to ratify the Convention against Torture (CAT) were 
</p>
<p>already under way, it encouraged the Government to seek the assistance of the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture Initiative. Denmark made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Estonia noted that the drafting of the Constitution had not been all-inclusive. It 
</p>
<p>urged Fiji to abolish decrees restricting media freedom, put a stop to the intimidation and 
</p>
<p>harassment of persons who criticized the State, and ensure zero tolerance of violence 
</p>
<p>against women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Ethiopia enquired about the impact of legal restrictions applicable to certain 
</p>
<p>constitutional rights on individuals&#8217; enjoyment of the rights concerned. It noted the 
</p>
<p>existence of restrictions on the capacity of law enforcement bodies to interpret the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>37. France welcomed the restoration of parliamentary democracy and the adoption of 
</p>
<p>the new Constitution, which had put an end to major discrimination on ethnic grounds. 
</p>
<p>France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Germany welcomed the Bill of Rights contained in the new Constitution. It 
</p>
<p>commended the abolitionist approach taken towards the death penalty for over two decades. 
</p>
<p>Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Fiji indicated that the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission would 
</p>
<p>now serve as the predominant enforcement body for the Bill of Rights guaranteed under the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. The Constitution provided for the independence of the Commission in its 
</p>
<p>functions and in the exercise of its authority and powers, including administrative 
</p>
<p>autonomy and control over its own budget and finances. In order to fulfil its mandate, 
</p>
<p>which included enforcing and monitoring compliance with the human rights instruments 
</p>
<p>ratified by the Government, including by bringing proceedings before the courts, 
</p>
<p>Parliament had to provide adequate funding and resources for the Commission. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>and development partners were invited to work with the Government to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>capacity of the Commission and ensure compliance with the principles relating to the status 
</p>
<p>of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). 
</p>
<p>40. The meritocracy approach to the Fijian public service had done away with 
</p>
<p>discriminatory policies that had promoted an elite agenda and clique rather than addressing 
</p>
<p>the inequalities they had claimed to address. 
</p>
<p>41. The Chief Justice refuted any insinuations that the Fijian judiciary was not 
</p>
<p>independent and that it was subject to the direction and control of the Government. The 
</p>
<p>appointment of judicial officers was handled by the Judicial Services Commission, and 
</p>
<p>consultation with, not concurrence or approval of, the Attorney-General was required. In 
</p>
<p>the case of disagreement, it was ultimately the Commission&#8217;s final decision. Comments to 
</p>
<p>the effect that the Government controlled the judiciary were therefore erroneous. 
</p>
<p>Representation on the Commission of members and non-members of the Bar, and video 
</p>
<p>recording of its proceedings, were a noticeable improvement from the situation under the 
</p>
<p>1997 Constitution. The appointment process of members to the Commission was 
</p>
<p>considerably less subject to political influence and control. Furthermore, new protections 
</p>
<p>had been introduced into the 2013 Constitution providing for the independence and 
</p>
<p>autonomy of the judiciary, in section 97. 
</p>
<p>42. The only two judicial appointments controlled by the Government were those of the 
</p>
<p>Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal, under procedures that were the same 
</p>
<p>as those contained in the 1997 Constitution, and similar to other jurisdictions. The </p>


<p>arrangements under the current Constitution for judicial appointments were a noticeable 
</p>
<p>improvement from previous constitutions. 
</p>
<p>43. The only interference in the Fijian judiciary had been the travel bans placed by 
</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand on members of the Fijian judiciary appointed after 2009, which 
</p>
<p>had prevented suitably qualified persons who might have served on the judicial bench from 
</p>
<p>doing so. Sri Lankan assistance in allowing the secondment of its judiciary to Fiji had 
</p>
<p>enabled the judiciary in Fiji to continue to function effectively. 
</p>
<p>44. Section 97 of the Fijian Constitution had brought the judiciary into compliance with 
</p>
<p>the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary and the Basic Principles on the </p>
<p>Role of Lawyers. 
</p>
<p>45. The Chief Justice said that a substantial training programme had been put in place 
</p>
<p>for the judiciary in order to enable all its members to be fully cognizant with human rights 
</p>
<p>issues, including awareness of and sensitivity to gender issues and children in court. 
</p>
<p>Training input and assistance from specialist non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
</p>
<p>would be welcomed. However, the judiciary could not discuss individual cases with NGOs, 
</p>
<p>and requests for information and letters seeking intervention with a view to appeal were 
</p>
<p>better addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>46. Other developments in the judicial sector had included the introduction of sittings 
</p>
<p>conducted in open court, except in cases involving children&#8217;s evidence, trade secrets, 
</p>
<p>copyright or national security. Video recording of all court proceedings would also be 
</p>
<p>introduced in the near future. In order to improve access to justice, and in line with the Bill 
</p>
<p>of Rights in the Constitution, new lifts for the disabled, cr&#232;ches, and rooms for vulnerable 
</p>
<p>witnesses had been introduced in courts. 
</p>
<p>47. The Chief Justice had issued a directive indicating that no case in which the 
</p>
<p>applicability of ouster clauses was challenged could be rejected by registry staff on initial 
</p>
<p>filing. All such cases must be listed before a judge for his/her ruling on that jurisdictional 
</p>
<p>matter. Discussions would be ongoing with organizations such as ILO on providing training 
</p>
<p>sessions for judges and lawyers in relevant areas. 
</p>
<p>48. Ghana welcomed the entry into force of the new Constitution, which took into 
</p>
<p>account the rights of children and of persons with disabilities. Ghana made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. India commended the holding of democratic elections, the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, the commitment to ratifying core human rights treaties, the allocation of 
</p>
<p>resources to promote access to justice, the HIV/AIDS Decree, the National Policy on 
</p>
<p>Persons Living with Disabilities and the National Gender Policy. India made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Indonesia welcomed the results of the elections, in which Fijians had freely 
</p>
<p>exercised their right to vote. It recalled the ten-year time frame set by the Government to 
</p>
<p>ratify the core human rights treaties. It commended efforts to combat discrimination against 
</p>
<p>women, particularly through the National Gender Policy. Indonesia made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Ireland urged Fiji to cooperate fully with special procedures. It expressed concern 
</p>
<p>about restrictions on freedom of expression under the Constitution and the Media Decree 
</p>
<p>and the impact of the Public Order Amendment Decree on the exercise of freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Israel commended the holding of free and fair elections and the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, which enshrined non-negotiable principles and values such as a common and 
</p>
<p>equal citizenry, a secular State and social justice. It asked whether concrete measures were </p>


<p>being taken to maintain a judiciary that was independent of the Government and the 
</p>
<p>military. Israel made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>53. Italy appreciated the Government&#8217;s commitment to ratify the outstanding human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments within ten years. It welcomed the steps taken to strengthen women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights and commended the ratification of CEDAW and the adoption of the National Gender 
</p>
<p>Policy. It encouraged the authorities to combat stereotypical attitudes to women and 
</p>
<p>violence against women. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Japan welcomed the positive developments to promote the democratic process, but 
</p>
<p>expressed concern about the broad grounds under the Constitution for restrictions on 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression, opinion, association and assembly. It encouraged Fiji to further 
</p>
<p>promote women&#8217;s status and increase their participation in decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p>Japan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Kenya enquired about progress in ratifying core human rights instruments. It noted 
</p>
<p>that the 2009 Human Rights Commission Decree affected the Commission&#8217;s independence 
</p>
<p>and functionality. Kenya made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>general elections. Lebanon made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>welcomed, alongside the Constitution and free elections. Engagement with the international 
</p>
<p>community was noted. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Maldives welcomed the Constitution and congratulated the Government on 
</p>
<p>successful elections and its commitment to democratic consolidation and the rule of law. It 
</p>
<p>also welcomed the efforts to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate and adapt to climate 
</p>
<p>change. Maldives made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>60. Montenegro asked about progress towards ratification of core human rights treaties, 
</p>
<p>implementation of the National Gender Policy, measures to ensure gender equality in law 
</p>
<p>and practice, and discussions on removing the death penalty from the Military Code. 
</p>
<p>Montenegro made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Morocco welcomed the holding of elections, the implementation of the Roadmap for 
</p>
<p>Democracy, which targeted revitalization of the national economy and the elimination of 
</p>
<p>ethnic discrimination, and the progressive Constitution. It asked for an update on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Domestic Violence Decree. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Namibia commended progress in the sphere of civil and political rights. It noted 
</p>
<p>strengthened human rights institutions and the new Constitution, which provided for an 
</p>
<p>independent judiciary, human rights for all and equal access to the law. Namibia made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. The Netherlands appreciated the return to democracy, the Constitution and the 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Plan of Action. Concerns were raised that gender equality had not been 
</p>
<p>established in the Constitution and that no comprehensive law criminalized all forms of 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence. The Netherlands made recommendations. </p>


<p>64. New Zealand welcomed recent elections, the successful first sitting of Parliament 
</p>
<p>and the ILO direct contacts mission. The situation of human rights defenders was a 
</p>
<p>concern. It noted investigations into violence in custody and the reconvening of the Fiji 
</p>
<p>Law Society. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Norway noted that the Constitution enshrined the principles of equality, non-
</p>
<p>discrimination and an independent judiciary and established the rights of indigenous 
</p>
<p>Fijians. The September elections had been a significant step. An active role for Fiji in the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council would be welcomed. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. The Philippines noted the strengthening of democratic processes and protection for 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups. It asked whether resources for socioeconomic programmes had been 
</p>
<p>allocated and how development partners could help. It also asked what barriers there were 
</p>
<p>to the functioning of the judiciary and how the international community could provide 
</p>
<p>assistance. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>67. In response to the questions pertaining to the media and freedom of speech, of 
</p>
<p>expression and of the press, Fiji stated that it did not accept the premise of the questions 
</p>
<p>asked on the Media Industry Development Decree, since those questions had implied or 
</p>
<p>stated outright that the media framework was restrictive and/or that there was censorship of 
</p>
<p>the media. 
</p>
<p>68. Through its Bill of Rights, the Fijian Constitution unequivocally recognized freedom 
</p>
<p>of the press as pivotal to the realization of freedom of speech, expression, thought, opinion 
</p>
<p>and publication. 
</p>
<p>69. Fiji shared the concerns that had been voiced about the fact that repressive laws 
</p>
<p>could severely restrict press freedom. Fiji had taken significant steps in securing greater 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms. However, no country guaranteed unfettered freedom without 
</p>
<p>responsibility. While guaranteeing freedom of speech, expression, thought, opinion and of 
</p>
<p>the press, the Constitution explicitly prohibited any speech, opinion or expression that was 
</p>
<p>tantamount to war propaganda, incitement to violence or insurrection against the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, or advocated hatred based on any of the prohibited grounds of discrimination, 
</p>
<p>which included race, culture, ethnic or social origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation and 
</p>
<p>gender identity, language, economic, social or health status, disability, age and religion. 
</p>
<p>Those limitations were also in line with general recommendation No. 35 of the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on combating racist hate speech. 
</p>
<p>70. The Fijian Constitution contained a definition of hate speech that was comparable to 
</p>
<p>that in the German legal framework, given the history of religious and racial intolerance. 
</p>
<p>Training to ensure that the media understood where to draw the line between free speech 
</p>
<p>and limitations on free speech in accordance with international law, especially the 
</p>
<p>jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, was of paramount importance. 
</p>
<p>71. The Public Emergency Regulations had been revoked. The Media Industry 
</p>
<p>Development Decree 2010, through a very progressive Media Code of Ethics and the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, guaranteed the freedom of the press and protected the confidentiality of 
</p>
<p>journalistic sources, in line with a decision of the European Court of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It also encouraged robust debate 
</p>
<p>without inciting hatred and was consistent with the law on justifiable limitations to free 
</p>
<p>speech under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the 
</p>
<p>European Convention. It should be noted that the Media Code of Ethics in the Media 
</p>
<p>Industry Development Decree 2010 had been copied verbatim from the Code of Ethics 
</p>
<p>adopted by the previous self-regulated Media Council. </p>


<p>72. The Media Industry Development Authority had called for balanced, accurate and 
</p>
<p>evidence-based reporting, encouraging quality journalism that was ethical and followed 
</p>
<p>internationally recognized protocols of responsible journalism. 
</p>
<p>73. The Media Industry Development Decree 2010 provided for an independent media 
</p>
<p>tribunal, presided over by a High Court judge, which adjudicated in cases of breaches of 
</p>
<p>media codes or matters relating to media disputes. Only one prosecution had taken place 
</p>
<p>under the Media Industry Development Authority, in relation to foreign ownership of a 
</p>
<p>media organization. There had been no prosecution of any media organization for breaches 
</p>
<p>of the Code of Ethics, or regarding media content. 
</p>
<p>74. The Media Industry Development Authority had actively encouraged the 
</p>
<p>mainstream media, both print and broadcast, to report freely and critically on public opinion 
</p>
<p>and views, including those which were critical of the Government. The consistent call from 
</p>
<p>the Media Industry Development Authority for self-regulation and continuous education of 
</p>
<p>the media was consistent with the recent call from the United Nations Educational, 
</p>
<p>Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in its 2014 report, &#8220;World trends in 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression and media development&#8221;, to strengthen national legislative 
</p>
<p>frameworks and the training of journalists in order to build capacity and improve media and 
</p>
<p>information literacy, and to support media independence by promoting professional 
</p>
<p>standards and self-regulation. 
</p>
<p>75. Training for journalists had been conducted on the Media Code of Ethics, the Bill of 
</p>
<p>Rights and on reporting the elections. In addition, there were plans to work with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development Programme on training for the Fijian media on reporting 
</p>
<p>parliamentary debates. The Government welcomed the ILO proposal to provide training for 
</p>
<p>the Fijian media on labour rights. Those collaborative efforts between Fiji and the 
</p>
<p>international community signalled an encouraging, positive step towards constructive 
</p>
<p>engagement in improving the freedom of the press. Civil society organizations were invited 
</p>
<p>to enter into similar collaborative arrangements to further strengthen the media. 
</p>
<p>76. Portugal welcomed the Constitution, emphasized the importance of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council special procedures and noted the participation of women in Parliament. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged Fiji to enhance the participation of women in political and public affairs. It 
</p>
<p>asked for information on measures to ensure gender equality in law and in practice. 
</p>
<p>Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. The Republic of Korea noted the Constitution, the national elections and the lifting 
</p>
<p>of the Public Emergency Regulations. It expressed concern at alleged human rights abuses 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by the police and the military, gender-based violence and reports that decrees 
</p>
<p>could justify curbs of fundamental freedoms. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. The Russian Federation welcomed the new Constitution of Fiji and took positive 
</p>
<p>note of the establishment of the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission. It 
</p>
<p>noted the implementation of the National Policy on Persons Living with Disabilities. The 
</p>
<p>Russian Federation made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. Sierra Leone noted the lifting of the Public Emergency Regulations, the national 
</p>
<p>elections and the new Constitution. It observed that the Bill of Rights contained no 
</p>
<p>provisions on women&#8217;s rights. It asked how children were protected from abuse at home, 
</p>
<p>which challenges hindered the promotion of socioeconomic rights, and what steps were 
</p>
<p>taken to mitigate the effects of climate change on socioeconomic rights. Sierra Leone made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Singapore noted the successful elections, the strengthened legislative framework and 
</p>
<p>efforts to improve access to justice, including for underprivileged communities, through the </p>


<p>Legal Aid Commission. Plans to expand poorer children&#8217;s access to tertiary education and 
</p>
<p>the granting of scholarships were welcomed. Singapore made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. Slovenia asked about the timeline for removing the death penalty from the Military 
</p>
<p>Code and welcomed the Constitution and the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination 
</p>
<p>Commission. It noted that no information had been provided on sexual and reproductive 
</p>
<p>health education in schools. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. Solomon Islands noted the appointment of a female Speaker of Parliament following 
</p>
<p>parliamentary elections and commended action on gender equality, housing and education. 
</p>
<p>It encouraged the involvement of Parliamentarians in the follow-up to the UPR. Interest in 
</p>
<p>inviting the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers was noted. 
</p>
<p>Solomon Islands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Spain commended Fiji for its new Constitution, particularly the provisions on social 
</p>
<p>and economic rights, for its recent elections, progress regarding the right to water and the 
</p>
<p>signing of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Spain was 
</p>
<p>concerned that the Essential National Industries (Employment) Decree was contrary to 
</p>
<p>international labour and human rights standards. It was also concerned about the low 
</p>
<p>reporting rates by women of gender-based violence. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>84. Sri Lanka welcomed the Constitution and commended measures for economic 
</p>
<p>growth. It asked what barriers there were to an effective judiciary and how the international 
</p>
<p>community could help. Sri Lanka encouraged the provision of technical assistance and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building to Fiji. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>85. Swaziland welcomed the parliamentary elections and the appointment of a female 
</p>
<p>Speaker of Parliament. It noted that amendments to the new Constitution required approval 
</p>
<p>by a national referendum. Given the allegations of the lack of consultation prior to the 
</p>
<p>passing of the Constitution, Swaziland asked what the rationale was behind that provision. 
</p>
<p>Swaziland made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>86. Switzerland welcomed the new Constitution and the lifting of the Public Emergency 
</p>
<p>Regulations. Legislation on public order, the media industry and crimes continued to 
</p>
<p>disproportionately restrict the freedoms of expression, assembly and association. The 
</p>
<p>invitation of Fiji to the Human Rights Council special procedures was noted. Switzerland 
</p>
<p>made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>87. Thailand commended Fiji for its recent democratic elections and its enhanced 
</p>
<p>engagement with civil society regarding human rights. Thailand noted that women in Fiji 
</p>
<p>continued to be underrepresented in decision-making and urged it to consider ratifying 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland recognized the crucial 
</p>
<p>democratic steps taken by Fiji. It urged Fiji to engage constructively with NGOs in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure that they could operate freely. It noted the positive increase in the number of female 
</p>
<p>MPs, but remained concerned that women were still underrepresented and faced high levels 
</p>
<p>of violence. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>89. The United Republic of Tanzania commended the Government for its commitment 
</p>
<p>to human rights, the new Constitution, the recent democratic elections and the provision of 
</p>
<p>free education. It encouraged Fiji to continue efforts to attain the right to water, housing and 
</p>
<p>a clean environment. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>90. The United States of America urged the Government to ensure that all stakeholders 
</p>
<p>could make their voices heard and participate in the political process. It also called for 
</p>
<p>further cooperation between the Government and ILO. The United States was concerned at 
</p>
<p>the persistence of gender-based violence, the fact that certain decrees unduly restricted </p>


<p>fundamental freedoms and the low level of respect for internationally recognized labour 
</p>
<p>rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Uruguay encouraged Fiji to redouble its efforts regarding economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, especially concerning commitments to education. It hoped that the death 
</p>
<p>penalty would be removed from the Military Code and urged Fiji to adopt measures 
</p>
<p>consolidating respect for human rights, including for press freedom. Uruguay made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>92. Vanuatu commended the recent elections and the return to democracy. It 
</p>
<p>congratulated Fiji on its reinstatement as a full Commonwealth member. It noted the 
</p>
<p>effective strategies devised to alleviate poverty and the fact that Fiji had signed CRPD and 
</p>
<p>the Optional Protocol thereto, and was considering extending an invitation to some special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders. Vanuatu made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. Mexico recognized the efforts made since the first UPR cycle, particularly the new 
</p>
<p>Constitution and the holding of elections. It commended Fiji for being one of the first 
</p>
<p>Pacific nations to adopt a national policy for older persons and for removing the death 
</p>
<p>penalty from the Criminal Code. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>94. Fiji noted that the Administration of Justice Decree had been repealed in 2013 and 
</p>
<p>that the repeal of any other decrees was the prerogative of Parliament. 
</p>
<p>95. The decision had been taken to hold referendums on amendments to the Constitution 
</p>
<p>as they were a direct form of democracy which did not entail third party intervention. They 
</p>
<p>therefore represented an important and unprecedented consultative means of amending the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. 
</p>
<p>96. Fiji expressed its willingness to cooperate with special procedures mandate holders 
</p>
<p>based on the areas of critical importance and provided that it had the resources to receive 
</p>
<p>such visits. 
</p>
<p>97. Fiji reiterated that the human rights aspects of climate change, such as the 
</p>
<p>sovereignty issues faced by low-lying countries facing flooding, and the human rights of 
</p>
<p>peoples facing displacement as a result of climate change, must be addressed by the 
</p>
<p>Council. As a small island developing State at the forefront of the adverse impacts of 
</p>
<p>climate change, Fiji had adopted an integrated response to climate change and disaster risk 
</p>
<p>management, and a National Green Growth Framework which aimed for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development, economic growth and resilience to the anticipated adverse effects of climate 
</p>
<p>change. 
</p>
<p>98. Fiji thanked the Vice-President of the Human Rights Council for the interactive 
</p>
<p>dialogue and stated that the extensive reforms conducted since the last cycle, which went 
</p>
<p>beyond the requirements of international instruments, showed the long way that Fiji had 
</p>
<p>come. Fiji trusted that its responses to the concerns raised had shown such progress, and 
</p>
<p>that the entire process and its constructive engagement would help provide tangible benefits 
</p>
<p>and a substantive positive impact on the lives of individual Fijians. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Conclusions and/or recommendations</b>**<b>
