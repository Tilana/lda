<p><b>  19</b>/&#8230;<b> Human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions on human rights and unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights Council and the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 15/24 of 1 October 2010 and General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 66/156 of 19 December 2011,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to 
</p>
<p>international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter and the norms and principles 
</p>
<p>governing peaceful relations among States,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of 
</p>
<p>all human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as a universal and 
</p>
<p>inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> at the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on 
</p>
<p>human rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and cooperation,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that unilateral coercive measures in the form of economic sanctions can 
</p>
<p>have far-reaching implications for the human rights of the general population of targeted 
</p>
<p>States, disproportionately affecting the poor and the most vulnerable classes,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that long-term unilateral coercive measures may result in social 
</p>
<p>problems and raise humanitarian concerns in the States targeted,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the final document of the fifteenth summit of the Heads of State and 
</p>
<p>Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in July 2009, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
*
 Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>in which the States members of the Movement decided to oppose unilateralism and 
</p>
<p>unilaterally-imposed measures by certain States, which can lead to the erosion and violation 
</p>
<p>of the Charter and international law, the use and threat of use of force, and pressure and 
</p>
<p>coercive measures, as a means to achieving their national policy objectives, and to support, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with international law, the claim of affected States, including targeted States, 
</p>
<p>to compensation for damage incurred as a consequence of the implementation of 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial or unilateral coercive measures or laws,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 
</p>
<p>to 25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international law and the Charter and that created obstacles to trade 
</p>
<p>relations among States and impeded the full realization of all human rights, and that also 
</p>
<p>severely threatened the freedom of trade,  
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human Rights and at United 
</p>
<p>Nations conferences held in the 1990s and at their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms 
</p>
<p>of international law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be 
</p>
<p>promulgated, implemented and enforced by, inter alia, resorting to war and militarism, with 
</p>
<p>all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and 
</p>
<p>social development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby 
</p>
<p>creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and 
</p>
<p>individuals under the jurisdiction of other States,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p>which provides that, inter alia, in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of 
</p>
<p>subsistence,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations 
</p>
<p>among States, in particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which 
</p>
<p>create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the 
</p>
<p>rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in 
</p>
<p>addition, threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member 
</p>
<p>States neither to recognize these measures nor to apply them, and to take effective 
</p>
<p>administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>application or effects of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain 
</p>
<p>powers of such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, 
</p>
<p>particularly against developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from 
</p>
<p>exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and 
</p>
<p>social systems;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates</i> its call upon Member States that have initiated such measures to 
</p>
<p>abide by the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions, and to commit themselves to their 
</p>
<p>obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to 
</p>
<p>which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such measures;  </p>


<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i>, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by 
</p>
<p>virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their own 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural development;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also reaffirms</i> its opposition to any attempt aimed at the partial or total 
</p>
<p>disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a State, which is incompatible 
</p>
<p>with the Charter;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Recalls</i> that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
</p>
<p>concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations, and to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
</p>
<p>Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, proclaimed by the General Assembly in 
</p>
<p>its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32 thereof, no State 
</p>
<p>may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce 
</p>
<p>another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign 
</p>
<p>rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reaffirms</i> that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be 
</p>
<p>used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be 
</p>
<p>deprived of their own means of subsistence and development;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Underlines</i> the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major 
</p>
<p>obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this 
</p>
<p>regard, calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive 
</p>
<p>measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws that run counter to the 
</p>
<p>principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Rejects </i>all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
</p>
<p>increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial application, which are not in conformity with international law;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes</i> that the Declaration of Principles, adopted at the first phase of the 
</p>
<p>World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly 
</p>
<p>urges States to avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the information 
</p>
<p>society;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Invites </i>all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council in the field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due 
</p>
<p>attention, within the scope of their respective mandates, to the negative impact and 
</p>
<p>consequences of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Decides</i> to give due consideration to the negative impact of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures in its task concerning the implementation of the right to development;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 
</p>
<p>discharging her functions in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights, to 
</p>
<p>pay due attention and give urgent consideration to the present resolution;  
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Takes note</i> of the thematic study prepared by the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner on the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights,1 including recommendations on actions aimed at ending such measures;  
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To organizes, prior to the twenty-first session of the Human Rights Council, a 
</p>
<p>workshop on the various aspects relating to the impact of the application of unilateral 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights by the affected populations in the 
</p>
<p>States targeted, with the participation of States, academic experts, and civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To prepare a summary of the proceedings of the workshop and submit it to 
</p>
<p>the Council at its twenty-first session; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Decides</i> to examine this question in accordance with its annual programme of 
</p>
<p>work under the same agenda item. 
</p>
