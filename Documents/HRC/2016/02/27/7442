<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 25/7, the Human Rights Council reaffirmed its unequivocal 
</p>
<p>condemnation of all acts, methods, practices and financing of terrorism as criminal and 
</p>
<p>unjustifiable. It also expressed its serious concern at the violations of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, as well as of refugee and international humanitarian law, in the 
</p>
<p>context of countering terrorism, and again called upon all States to ensure that any measure 
</p>
<p>taken to counter terrorism complied with international law, in particular international 
</p>
<p>human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. It called upon States and other relevant actors 
</p>
<p>to continue to implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its 
</p>
<p>four pillars, which reaffirms respect for human rights for all and the rule of law as the 
</p>
<p>fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism.  
</p>
<p>2. Also in resolution 25/7, the Human Rights Council encouraged the United Nations 
</p>
<p>bodies, agencies, funds and programmes involved in supporting counter-terrorism efforts to 
</p>
<p>continue to facilitate the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms, as well as due process and the rule of law, while countering terrorism. It 
</p>
<p>requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the 
</p>
<p>Council, bearing in mind the content of resolution 25/7, in accordance with its annual 
</p>
<p>programme of work. The present report is submitted pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p>3. In the present report, the High Commissioner highlights relevant developments since 
</p>
<p>the previous report,1 in particular the recent activities of the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner (OHCHR); developments in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task 
</p>
<p>Force; and cooperation with the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee and its 
</p>
<p>Executive Directorate. He outlines the issues of human rights concern in the context of 
</p>
<p>counter terrorism, in particular in relation to legislative measures taken by States, and 
</p>
<p>addresses human rights issues relating to foreign fighters and measures taken by States to 
</p>
<p>stem their flow. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Activities of the Office of the High Commissioner  
</b></p>
<p>4. In accordance with its thematic strategies for the period 2014-2017, OHCHR has 
</p>
<p>prioritized support for Member States in their efforts to ensure that their security policies, 
</p>
<p>strategies and measures are grounded firmly in respect for human rights and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>This includes assisting in the development and implementation of human rights-compliant 
</p>
<p>security legislation; supporting security sector reform through a review of legal frameworks 
</p>
<p>and support for the establishment of effective procedural safeguards and independent 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for oversight; and supporting the design and delivery of human rights training 
</p>
<p>to justice and security entities.  
</p>
<p>5. In her keynote statement to the International Counter-Terrorism Focal Points 
</p>
<p>Conference on 13 June 2013, the previous High Commissioner urged States to take 
</p>
<p>measures to address the linkages between a lack of respect for human rights and the 
</p>
<p>conditions conducive to terrorism, alongside efforts to ensure effective human rights-
</p>
<p>compliant criminal justice responses to terrorism, and highlighted the critical role of civil 
</p>
<p>society in this regard. In her briefing to the Counter-Terrorism Committee in October 2013, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/HRC/22/26. </p>


<p>she highlighted areas of ongoing concern and urged the Committee to continue its efforts to 
</p>
<p>address all human rights issues relevant to the implementation of Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005), including by promoting such good practices as 
</p>
<p>reviewing counter-terrorism legislation before adoption, time-limited laws, independent 
</p>
<p>oversight bodies for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and periodic review of 
</p>
<p>sanction measures. 
</p>
<p>6. OHCHR has continued to address complex legal and policy challenges relating to 
</p>
<p>new technologies that are of direct relevance to States&#8217; efforts to counter terrorism. From 
</p>
<p>November 2013 to March 2014, the Office partnered with the United Nations University in 
</p>
<p>a research project on the application of international human rights law to national regimes 
</p>
<p>overseeing governmental digital surveillance. It also launched an open consultation in 
</p>
<p>February 2014, inviting the input of stakeholders on the basis of a questionnaire on the right 
</p>
<p>to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance. Also in February, the 
</p>
<p>previous High Commissioner delivered a keynote address to an expert seminar organized 
</p>
<p>by a group of States led by Germany and Brazil, and facilitated by the Geneva Academy on 
</p>
<p>International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, in which she outlined challenges to 
</p>
<p>ensuring the right to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial surveillance. 
</p>
<p>7. Drawing on these and other sources of information, as mandated by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly in its resolution 68/167, OHCHR prepared a report on the right to privacy in the 
</p>
<p>digital age to the Human Rights Council.2 In the report, OHCHR examined the protection 
</p>
<p>afforded by international human rights law regarding privacy, including the meaning of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;interference with privacy&#8221; in online communications, the definition of &#8220;arbitrary and 
</p>
<p>unlawful&#8221; interference in this context, and the question of whose rights are protected, and 
</p>
<p>where. Following consideration of the report by the Human Rights Council at its twenty-
</p>
<p>seventh session and the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, the Assembly adopted 
</p>
<p>resolution A/C.3/69/L.26/Rev.1, which included a number of proposed follow-up measures. 
</p>
<p>8. Issues of relevance in the context of counter-terrorism were also addressed during 
</p>
<p>expert panel discussions organized by the Office, on the right to privacy in the digital age, 
</p>
<p>pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 25/117, held on 12 September 2014, 3and on 
</p>
<p>ensuring the use of armed drones in counter-terrorism and military operations in accordance 
</p>
<p>with international law, pursuant to Council resolution 25/22, held on 22 September 2014.

</p>
<p>9. The Office promoted a greater integration of a gender perspective into the context of 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorism by contributing to a workshop held on 21 and 22 October 2014 on the 
</p>
<p>theme &#8220;Advancing women&#8217;s roles in countering violent extremism and radicalization that 
</p>
<p>lead to terrorism&#8221;, organized in Vienna by the Global Counterterrorism Forum and the 
</p>
<p>Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and a panel discussion on the theme 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The role of women in countering violent extremism&#8221; organized by the United Arab 
</p>
<p>Emirates and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
</p>
<p>Women, held on 27 October 2014 within the framework of the open debate of the Security 
</p>
<p>Council on women, peace and security. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Activities of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force  
</b></p>
<p>10. The Office is an active member of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task 
</p>
<p>Force and promotes the mainstreaming of human rights across the work of the Task Force 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 A/HRC/27/37. 
</p>
<p> 3 See A/HRC/28/38. 
</p>
<p> 4 A/HRC/28/39. </p>


<p>and its working groups. In 2014, following a process of re-structuring of Task Force 
</p>
<p>working groups, OHCHR co-chaired the Task Force Working Group on Promoting and 
</p>
<p>Protecting Human Rights and the Rule of Law While Countering Terrorism, together with 
</p>
<p>the Rule of Law Unit of the Executive Office of the Secretary-General. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>supports the implementation of Pillar IV of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Strategy and the mainstreaming of human rights and the rule of law into the implementation 
</p>
<p>of all pillars of the Global Strategy. 
</p>
<p>11. Since October 2012, the Working Group, with the support of Denmark, Switzerland 
</p>
<p>and the United States of America, has been implementing a long-term global project on 
</p>
<p>human rights capacity-building for law enforcement officials involved in counter-terrorism 
</p>
<p>that will provide States with training and technical assistance, thereby increasing their 
</p>
<p>knowledge, understanding and implementation of the international human rights framework 
</p>
<p>and the rule of law in preventing, responding to and investigating terrorism threats. The 
</p>
<p>project has included needs-assessment workshops, held in Amman in April 2013, and 
</p>
<p>Ouagadougou, in October 2013. Following the workshops, the Working Group has focused 
</p>
<p>on the development of human rights training modules on the international legal and policy 
</p>
<p>framework, special investigation techniques, countering violent extremism, community-
</p>
<p>oriented policing, detention, interviewing techniques and the use of force, all with a specific 
</p>
<p>focus on the context of counter-terrorism.  
</p>
<p>12. The Working Group has progressed with the development of a series of reference 
</p>
<p>guides aimed at providing practical guidance for national action on human rights-compliant 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorism measures. With financial support through the United Nations Counter-
</p>
<p>Terrorism Centre, reference guides on the stopping and searching of persons and on 
</p>
<p>security infrastructure have been updated.5 Other guides, on detention in the context of 
</p>
<p>countering terrorism, conformity of national counter-terrorism legislation with international 
</p>
<p>human rights law and the right to a fair trial and due process in the context of countering 
</p>
<p>terrorism are in process of publication. A guide on the proscription of organizations is also 
</p>
<p>under development. 
</p>
<p>13. In implementing its workplan for 2015, the Working Group will continue to 
</p>
<p>facilitate information exchange on priority human rights and rule of law concerns, including 
</p>
<p>on examples of good practices in the protection of human rights in the context of counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism, drawing on experiences at the national and regional levels. It will also assess the 
</p>
<p>support and assistance currently given to Member States to ensure the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights in the context of counter-terrorism, identify gaps and 
</p>
<p>weaknesses, and develop proposals for strengthening support for Member States in the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights in the context of counter-terrorism at the national level. 
</p>
<p>14. The Office also contributed to the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre 
</p>
<p>workshop on the role of the United Nations in addressing conditions conducive to the 
</p>
<p>spread of terrorism in the context of the post-2015 development agenda debate, held in New 
</p>
<p>York on 7 and 8 April 2014. Chairing the session on United Nations cooperation and 
</p>
<p>assistance in the fields of rule of law, human rights and good governance to address the 
</p>
<p>conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights highlighted the significance of the protection of human rights and the rule of law for 
</p>
<p>sustainable development and of addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of 
</p>
<p>terrorism. At the Global Experts Meeting on Building Capacity for Terrorist Designations 
</p>
<p>and Asset Freezing Regimes, held in New York on 13 and 14 May 2014, under the auspices 
</p>
<p>of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Working Group on Tackling the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 The guides are available from the Task Force website at 
</p>
<p>www.un.org/en/terrorism/ctitf/wg_protectingrights.shtml. </p>


<p>Financing of Terrorism, OHCHR briefed participants on human rights concerns relating to 
</p>
<p>the listing of persons and organizations and the freezing of assets. OHCHR contributed to 
</p>
<p>the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force /European Union dialogues held on 13 
</p>
<p>June 2014 in New York and 20 October in Brussels. OHCHR also contributed to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Victims of Terrorism Support portal, a project of the Task Force Working Group 
</p>
<p>on Supporting and Highlighting Victims of Terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and its Executive 
</b></p>
<p><b>Directorate 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Counter-Terrorism Committee and its Executive Directorate continue to take 
</p>
<p>account of relevant human rights concerns in their work programmes focused on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005). On 24 
</p>
<p>October 2013, the Committee, under the chairmanship of Morocco, was briefed by the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner and discussed the impact of broad and abusive counter-terrorism laws on 
</p>
<p>dissident voices, human rights defenders, journalists, minorities and indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>The Committee also held thematic discussions on several issues relevant to resolutions 
</p>
<p>1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005) all of which had human rights aspects. This included 
</p>
<p>consideration of adoption by Member States of special criminal procedures to investigate 
</p>
<p>and prosecute terrorism-related offences and the human rights safeguards adopted in this 
</p>
<p>regard, such as sunset clauses, the independent review of counter-terrorism legislation and 
</p>
<p>consultations with civil society on draft counter-terrorism legislation. 
</p>
<p>16. Under the chairmanship of Lithuania since January 2014, the Counter-Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Committee has held discussions on the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes and on 
</p>
<p>respect for freedom of expression and the right to privacy, as well as a discussion on the 
</p>
<p>need for counter-terrorism laws and policies not to unduly hinder humanitarian access to 
</p>
<p>populations in need. The Committee also held an open special meeting on kidnapping for 
</p>
<p>ransom and terrorist hostage-taking in which a member of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>Advisory Committee participated. In its revised process for assessing implementation of 
</p>
<p>Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2014), the Committee routinely 
</p>
<p>discusses with Member States a variety of human rights issues. In addition, the Committee 
</p>
<p>recently conducted a preliminary analysis of gaps in the capacity of Member States to 
</p>
<p>implement resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005) that may hinder the ability of States to 
</p>
<p>stem the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, as requested by the Council in its resolution 2178 
</p>
<p>(2014). This included gaps in compliance with human rights obligations and the rule of law, 
</p>
<p>in particular those relating to the lack of clarity or precision in counter-terrorism laws, 
</p>
<p>failure to ensure fair treatment and due process for persons accused of terrorist offences, 
</p>
<p>and issues relating to compliance with international refugee law. 
</p>
<p>17. In accordance with General Assembly resolution 68/178, the Counter-Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Committee Executive Directorate continued to liaise with OHCHR, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism and other 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms and mandate holders, including in relation to the preparation of 
</p>
<p>and follow-up to country visits and the facilitation of technical assistance. The Executive 
</p>
<p>Director of the Executive Directorate met both with my predecessor and me and the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism to 
</p>
<p>discuss issues of mutual interest and concern. In October 2013, OHCHR human rights 
</p>
<p>experts participated in a workshop in Islamabad convened by the Executive Directorate for 
</p>
<p>South Asian police officers, prosecutors and judges on enhancing domestic and 
</p>
<p>international cooperation in counter-terrorism investigations, and in December 2013, a 
</p>
<p>workshop in Tunis convened by the Executive Directorate for prosecutors on the challenges 
</p>
<p>of bringing terrorists acting alone or in small cells to justice. In May 2014, the Office also </p>


<p>contributed to a workshop in Nairobi, held pursuant to Security Council resolution 1624 
</p>
<p>(2005), on countering incitement to terrorism and enhancing cultural dialogue. The 
</p>
<p>Executive Directorate continued its dialogue on relevant human rights issues with regional 
</p>
<p>and subregional organizations, as well as with national and international civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations. It also continued its active contribution to the Counter-Terrorism 
</p>
<p>Implementation Task Force Working Group on Protecting Human Rights and the Rule of 
</p>
<p>Law while Countering Terrorism, including by means of contributions to knowledge 
</p>
<p>products issued by the Working Group, as well as to the design and implementation of 
</p>
<p>capacity-building and technical assistance initiatives undertaken by the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Issues of human rights concern 
</b></p>
<p>18. Events in recent months have highlighted the immense, persistent challenges faced 
</p>
<p>by States in preventing acts of violence and safeguarding the security of individuals within 
</p>
<p>their jurisdiction. At its open debate on terrorism in November 2014, the Security Council 
</p>
<p>emphasized the expanding threat of terrorism due to &#8220;global recruitment networks, the 
</p>
<p>spread of violent extremist ideologies that can be conducive to terrorism, ease of movement 
</p>
<p>of terrorists, including foreign terrorist fighters, and access to significant funding streams.6 
</p>
<p>During the open debate of the Council on international cooperation and violent extremism 
</p>
<p>on 19 November 2014, the Secretary-General highlighted the fact that technology and 
</p>
<p>globalization had made it easier for groups spurred by violent extremist ideologies to cause 
</p>
<p>harm, exploit narratives and profit from illicit financing, while terrorism, drug trafficking 
</p>
<p>and transnational crime grew in intensity and fed off each other. 
</p>
<p>19. The measures taken by a number of States in the wake of recent security threats have 
</p>
<p>continued to raise serious human rights concerns. States have rushed to adopt emergency 
</p>
<p>legislation, modify detention policies, revise criminal justice rules and practices and impose 
</p>
<p>limitations to the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and movement. Broad-
</p>
<p>reaching surveillance practices have continued to infringe on individuals&#8217; human rights, in 
</p>
<p>particular the right to privacy, owing to a lack of adequate national legislation and 
</p>
<p>enforcement, weak procedural safeguards and ineffective oversight that all contribute to a 
</p>
<p>climate of impunity. Reports show that surveillance practices have had a chilling effect on 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression, particularly affecting journalists whose sources are reportedly less 
</p>
<p>willing to be in contact with the press out of fear that any interaction may leave a digital 
</p>
<p>mark that could be used against them.  
</p>
<p>20. While States have a duty to take measures to protect populations from violence and 
</p>
<p>insecurity and to deliver justice, such measures must be anchored in respect for 
</p>
<p>international human rights law. Experience at the national level has demonstrated that 
</p>
<p>protecting human rights and ensuring respect for the rule of law contribute to countering 
</p>
<p>terrorism in particular by creating a climate of trust between the State and those under its 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, and supporting resilience of communities to threats of violent radicalism. From 
</p>
<p>a criminal justice perspective, ensuring that counter-terrorism legislation and policy are 
</p>
<p>grounded in human rights also helps to promote the prosecution and conviction in 
</p>
<p>accordance with legally established procedures of individuals engaged in acts of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>This also encourages legal consistency between national jurisdictions, thereby facilitating 
</p>
<p>international cooperation. Conversely, compromising on human rights has proven corrosive 
</p>
<p>to the rule of law and undermines the effectiveness of any counter-terrorism measure. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 See S/PRST/2014/23. </p>


<p><b> A. Legislative measures taken by States 
</b></p>
<p>21. Some States have enacted broadly formulated national counter-terrorism legislation 
</p>
<p>containing a definition of terrorism that lacks precision and allows for arbitrary or 
</p>
<p>discriminatory enforcement by authorities, or otherwise undermines the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights. An imprecise definition of a crime can lead to the criminalization of innocent 
</p>
<p>conduct and to the broadening of proscribed conduct in judicial interpretation. Legislation 
</p>
<p>of this type has led to the infringement of the rights to liberty and security of the person and 
</p>
<p>the freedom of expression, association and assembly, and to violations of due process-
</p>
<p>related rights, including the right to a fair trial. Legislation also has been misused to curb 
</p>
<p>otherwise legitimate activities and to target journalists, human rights defenders, minority 
</p>
<p>groups, members of the political opposition or other individuals, some of whom have been 
</p>
<p>arbitrarily detained and subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment while in custody.7 These concerns are equally relevant to measures taken by 
</p>
<p>States to curb the flow of foreign fighters (see paras. 49-50 below). 
</p>
<p>22. Legislation in some States has equated legitimate expressions of protest and 
</p>
<p>opposition to the Government with terrorism, thereby effectively criminalizing freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression.8 For example, one jurisdiction has adopted legislation that defines terrorism to 
</p>
<p>include such acts as &#8220;insulting the reputation of the State or its position&#8221;, which could result 
</p>
<p>in the criminalization of any discourse critical of the Government or its policies. In some 
</p>
<p>jurisdictions, authorities have used broadly worded counter-terrorism laws to charge 
</p>
<p>journalists and members of the political opposition with, inter alia, &#8220;encouraging 
</p>
<p>terrorism&#8221;, thereby imposing an unjustified limitation on their right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression. In their efforts to counter incitement to terrorism, States parties to the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights should ensure that counter terrorism 
</p>
<p>measures are compatible with article 19, paragraph 3 of the Covenant. In its general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 34, the Human Rights Committee specified that offences such as the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;encouragement of terrorism&#8221;, and &#8220;extremist activity&#8221; or &#8220;praising&#8221;, &#8220;glorifying&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;justifying&#8221; terrorism should be clearly defined to ensure that they do not lead to 
</p>
<p>unnecessary or disproportionate interference with freedom of expression.9  
</p>
<p>23. States have resorted to<b> </b>detaining persons accused of terrorism without respect for the 
</p>
<p>safeguards that are due under international law to all persons deprived of their liberty. Some 
</p>
<p>have expanded the power of security forces to arrest &#8220;suspected criminals&#8221; without warrant. 
</p>
<p>In some jurisdictions, legislation allows for preventive detention without appropriate 
</p>
<p>safeguards, including by extending the permissible period for pre-charge detention of 
</p>
<p>persons suspected of terrorist activity and the length of time a person may be held without 
</p>
<p>judicial authorization or review of the reasons for detention. As a result, individuals 
</p>
<p>accused of terrorist activity have been held for prolonged periods without charge or trial, in 
</p>
<p>some cases without proper access to legal counsel or recourse to independent judicial 
</p>
<p>review.10 Such practices violate the rights to liberty and to be free from arbitrary detention.

<p>arrests and administrative detention, secret and undisclosed detention and, in certain cases, 
</p>
<p>the non-disclosure of grounds for detention. Not only are such measures inconsistent with 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards, they also significantly increase the risk of torture and 
</p>
<p>other ill-treatment and preclude accountability where such violations are perpetrated. In its 
</p>
<p>general comment No.35, the Human Rights Committee highlighted the absolute nature of 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of arbitrary detention reflected in article 9 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, pointing out that administrative detention raises a severe risk of 
</p>
<p>arbitrary deprivation of liberty and should only be employed in exceptional circumstances, 
</p>
<p>when a present, direct and imperative threat justifies its use, and should be limited in time. 
</p>
<p>Habeas corpus is a non-derogable guarantee that must be complied with in all 
</p>
<p>circumstances.11 
</p>
<p>24. In some States, the powers of intelligence services have been broadened to resemble 
</p>
<p>those of the police, conferring upon them the powers of arrest, detention, search and 
</p>
<p>seizure.12 In certain cases, intelligence services have been afforded powers to make arrests 
</p>
<p>without a warrant and to detain, with no explicit guarantee of basic due process rights, such 
</p>
<p>as the right to counsel.13 Concerns have been raised at legislation governing the functioning 
</p>
<p>of intelligence services that does not provide for sufficient control and oversight, thereby 
</p>
<p>creating an accountability gap.14 The functioning of intelligence services must be subject to 
</p>
<p>adequate safeguards to protect against human rights violations and to ensure accountability 
</p>
<p>when violations do occur. 
</p>
<p>25. The Office has highlighted ongoing concerns regarding the potential for arbitrary or 
</p>
<p>unlawful interference in the right to privacy in the context of domestic and extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>surveillance.15 Concerns were raised in one State where recently adopted legislation has 
</p>
<p>broadened surveillance powers by allowing for surveillance of multiple computers, 
</p>
<p>including whole networks, under a single warrant; established harsher penalties for the 
</p>
<p>disclosure of intelligence material; provided intelligence agents with legal immunity; and 
</p>
<p>allowed for greater sharing of personal information between agencies, without either 
</p>
<p>adequate safeguards or oversight, or recourse for individuals in cases where personal 
</p>
<p>information has been subsequently misused or released without authorization.16 Draft 
</p>
<p>legislation under consideration in another jurisdiction would allow for the outsourcing of 
</p>
<p>surveillance on nationals abroad to allied foreign intelligence services, in spite of a federal 
</p>
<p>court decision admonishing the intelligence service for such practices.17 Another State 
</p>
<p>recently adopted emergency surveillance legislation that allows the Government to require 
</p>
<p>telephone companies and Internet providers in the country and abroad to collect and store

<p>metadata of communications for a period of up to 12 months. Concerns have been 
</p>
<p>expressed that such blanket data retention may allow for the monitoring of communications 
</p>
<p>of persons, even those outside of the State&#8217;s jurisdiction and those not suspected of any 
</p>
<p>illegal activity.18 These developments all raise serious concerns about their compliance with 
</p>
<p>the right of individuals to be protected by law against arbitrary or unlawful interference in 
</p>
<p>their privacy. 
</p>
<p>26. States have adopted national legislation to implement targeted sanctions against 
</p>
<p>individuals and<b> </b>organizations. While such measures can serve as an important tool for the 
</p>
<p>prevention of terrorist acts, their serious potential repercussions on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>those affected make efforts to ensure the right to due process of individuals affected 
</p>
<p>essential.19 In some cases, such measures have given rise to the arbitrary banning of 
</p>
<p>organizations based on ill-defined or vague legislation, sometimes with the objective of 
</p>
<p>banning political dissent or otherwise peaceful means of expression. National legislation 
</p>
<p>that fails to define &#8220;membership&#8221; or to require a link between the membership and the 
</p>
<p>prohibited status or activity would be contrary to the principle of legality, in particular 
</p>
<p>where such membership leads to targeted sanctions or criminal penalties, such as 
</p>
<p>imprisonment. Any sanctions imposed by proscription should be a result of a clear 
</p>
<p>indication, based on reasonable grounds, that the individual or entity has knowingly carried 
</p>
<p>out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist act.20 
</p>
<p>27. The adoption of exceptional counter-terrorism legislation may be particularly 
</p>
<p>problematic when it is not a stand-alone piece of legislation but rather an amendment to 
</p>
<p>existing criminal laws and procedures. Experience has shown that counter-terrorism 
</p>
<p>measures introduced in moments of crisis or extreme political stress and which are intended 
</p>
<p>as short-term measures can readily become entrenched with the passage of time and 
</p>
<p>invoked routinely by law enforcement authorities.21 Much of the emergency legislation 
</p>
<p>enacted by States in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, for example, is 
</p>
<p>still in force today. A sense of political urgency also may obstruct a proper <i>a priori</i> scrutiny 
</p>
<p>of draft laws, and has led to the adoption of legislation that included imprecise definitions 
</p>
<p>in counter-terrorism laws, opening the door for abuses in implementation.  
</p>
<p>28. I fully endorse the calls made in reports of the previous High Commissioner and 
</p>
<p>underscore the importance of ensuring that counter-terrorism laws are consistent with 
</p>
<p>human rights standards and comply with the principle of legality. Laws must be formulated 
</p>
<p>with sufficient precision to enable an individual to regulate his or her conduct accordingly, 
</p>
<p>and must be made accessible to the public. Laws must not confer unfettered discretion but 
</p>
<p>rather provide sufficient guidance to those charged with their application to enable them to 
</p>
<p>ascertain the sort of conduct that falls within their scope. 
</p>
<p>29. Regular review of the compliance of counter-terrorism laws and practices with 
</p>
<p>human rights standards is critical in order to ensure that counter-terrorism measures are 
</p>
<p>specific, necessary, effective and proportionate. Good practices highlighted by the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner in previous reports include a review of counter-terrorism legislation before 
</p>

<p>adoption, time-limited laws, independent oversight bodies for law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>intelligence agencies, and periodic reviews of sanction measures. The validity of any 
</p>
<p>exceptional measure should be restricted in time through the inclusion of a sunset clause. 
</p>
<p>The compliance of such laws with human rights standards must also be subject to regular 
</p>
<p>review.  
</p>
<p>30. I welcome the dialogue held at national level that accompanies the legislative 
</p>
<p>process in some States, and urge all States to ensure broad and inclusive consultation with 
</p>
<p>all relevant stakeholders. The experience of previous years demonstrates the benefits of the 
</p>
<p>review of draft legislation by relevant domestic bodies before adoption, in particular to 
</p>
<p>ensure its consistency with relevant international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Foreign fighters 
</b></p>
<p>31. Although the phenomenon of foreign fighters22 is not new, a reported recent increase 
</p>
<p>in their numbers and in the range of countries from which they reportedly originate, the 
</p>
<p>groups they join, their motivations and subsequent trajectories have highlighted the 
</p>
<p>complex nature of this issue and raised concerns across the globe. While reported facts and 
</p>
<p>figures vary widely, the Security Council has expressed concern at reports that more than 
</p>
<p>15,000 foreign terrorist fighters from more than 80 countries have travelled to join or fight 
</p>
<p>for terrorist entities associated with Al-Qaida, including in the Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq, 
</p>
<p>Somalia and Yemen, as well as several countries in the Maghreb and Sahel regions.23 Other 
</p>
<p>recent reports have highlighted instances of individuals who have travelled to join forces in 
</p>
<p>fighting against such entities, for example alongside the Kurdish People&#8217;s Protection Units).  
</p>
<p>32. The brutality of the criminal acts committed in the Syrian Arab Republic and in Iraq 
</p>
<p>by the <i>takfiri</i>, also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or Daesh, which 
</p>
<p>have been bolstered through the support of foreign fighters, has given particular impetus to 
</p>
<p>States to take measures to inhibit individuals from travelling for purposes of joining their 
</p>
<p>ranks and to prevent the escalation of violence. The Independent International Commission 
</p>
<p>of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic has noted the increase in experienced and 
</p>
<p>ideologically motivated foreign fighters attracted by ISIL since it proclaimed itself an 
</p>
<p>Islamic caliphate. According to the Commission, while thousands of Syrians have been 
</p>
<p>recruited to the ranks of ISIL its leadership structure is largely dominated by foreign 
</p>
<p>fighters.24  
</p>
<p>33. States have taken a wide range of administrative and legislative measures to deter 
</p>
<p>individuals who have or seek to become foreign fighters. These have involved blocking the 
</p>
<p>validity of travel documents, revoking citizenship, freezing financial assets and the 
</p>
<p>prosecution of individuals for acts ranging from recruitment and incitement to the planning 
</p>
<p>of terrorist acts. The Security Council has taken decisive action through a number of 
</p>
<p>resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. In its resolution 
</p>
<p>2170 (2014), the Council condemned in the strongest terms the gross, systematic and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 22 The term &#8220;foreign fighters&#8221; generally refers to individuals who leave their country of origin or 
</p>
<p>habitual residence, motivated primarily by ideology or religion, and become involved in violence as 
</p>
<p>part of an insurgency or non-State armed group in an armed conflict (even though they may also be 
</p>
<p>motivated by payment). See Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>Foreign Fighters under International Law, Academy Briefing No.7, October 2014.

<p>widespread abuse of human rights by ISIL and the Al-Nusrah Front, demanded that they 
</p>
<p>and all other entities associated with Al-Qaida cease all violence and terrorist acts, and 
</p>
<p>immediately disarm and disband. It also stressed the need to bring perpetrators, including 
</p>
<p>foreign terrorist fighters, to justice. The Council called upon Member States to take national 
</p>
<p>measures to suppress the flow of fighters to join the groups, reiterating the obligations 
</p>
<p>deriving from previous counter-terrorism resolutions to prevent the movement of terrorists 
</p>
<p>and their supply with arms or financial support. 
</p>
<p>34. In its resolution 2178 (2014), the Security Council condemned violent extremism 
</p>
<p>and decided that Member States should, consistent with international law, prevent the 
</p>
<p>recruiting, organizing, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel to a State other 
</p>
<p>than their States of residence or nationality for the purpose of the perpetration, planning of, 
</p>
<p>or participation in terrorist acts. Expressing concern at the establishment of international 
</p>
<p>terrorist networks, the Council underscored the particular and urgent need to implement the 
</p>
<p>resolution with respect to foreign terrorist fighters associated with ISIL, the Al-Nusrah 
</p>
<p>Front and other cells, affiliates, splinter groups or derivatives of Al-Qaida, as designated by 
</p>
<p>the Committee established pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011). 
</p>
<p>35. Importantly, in its resolution 2178 (2014), the Security Council also reaffirms the 
</p>
<p>obligation of all Member States to comply with international human rights law when 
</p>
<p>fighting terrorism, underscoring that, at a practical level, respect for human rights and the 
</p>
<p>rule of law are essential to a successful counter-terrorism effort. It noted that a failure to 
</p>
<p>comply with human rights and other international obligations, including under the Charter, 
</p>
<p>contributed to increased radicalization and fostered a sense of impunity.  
</p>
<p>36. In addressing the flow of foreign fighters, it is critical that States integrate 
</p>
<p>compliance with their obligations under international human rights law by stepping up 
</p>
<p>measures to address the conditions conducive to terrorism and to counter violent 
</p>
<p>extremism; by combating impunity and ensuring accountability for any gross violation of 
</p>
<p>international human rights and serious violation of international humanitarian law; and by 
</p>
<p>ensuring that any measures they take in their efforts to stem the flow of foreign fighters and 
</p>
<p>prevent the commission of criminal acts comply with their obligations under international 
</p>
<p>human rights law.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Addressing the conditions conducive to terrorism and countering violent extremism 
</b></p>
<p>37. Terrorism continues to thrive in environments where State-sponsored violence and 
</p>
<p>corruption continues with impunity, in particular where tensions among ethnic, religious 
</p>
<p>and linguistic groups persist and grievances between social groups fester, and where a lack 
</p>
<p>of respect for the rule of law allows a climate of injustice to take root. Factors that may 
</p>
<p>contribute to such conditions include violations related to prolonged, unresolved conflicts; 
</p>
<p>ethnic, national and religious discrimination; political exclusion and socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>marginalization; and a climate of impunity. These may all contribute to laying the 
</p>
<p>groundwork for hatred and radicalize individuals who may go on to commit violent acts of 
</p>
<p>terrorism. As the Secretary-General highlighted during the open debate of the Security 
</p>
<p>Council on international cooperation and violent extremism on 19 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>problems are further exacerbated when counter-terrorism efforts are not sufficiently 
</p>
<p>targeted and entire communities feel victimized by human rights violations committed in 
</p>
<p>the name of counter-terrorism. 
</p>
<p>38. In my briefing to the Security Council on the situation in Iraq on 18 November 
</p>
<p>2014, I emphasized that national and international strategies to counter ISIL have so far 
</p>
<p>concentrated on a security approach, without sufficient attention to addressing these 
</p>
<p>broader conditions and countering extremist ideologies. As the Council highlighted in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 2178 (2014), States should engage relevant local communities and non-
</p>
<p>governmental actors in developing strategies to counter the violent extremist narrative that </p>


<p>can incite terrorist acts, address the conditions conducive to the spread of violent 
</p>
<p>extremism, which can be conducive to terrorism, including by empowering youth, families, 
</p>
<p>women, religious, cultural and education leaders, and all other concerned groups of civil 
</p>
<p>society, and adopt tailored approaches to countering recruitment to this kind of violent 
</p>
<p>extremism and promoting social inclusion and cohesion. This requires a sustained effort to 
</p>
<p>foster engagement between communities and authorities in order to build trust, support 
</p>
<p>local ownership of initiatives, and to develop positive counter-narratives.  
</p>
<p>39. Countering extremist discourse, promoting dialogue, protecting human rights and 
</p>
<p>enhancing social cohesion may be the most effective means for countering the advocacy of 
</p>
<p>extremism. Civil society actors &#8211; including religious leaders, faith-based organizations, 
</p>
<p>youth groups and women&#8217;s organizations &#8211; have an important role to play in this regard.25 
</p>
<p>A dynamic, diverse and independent civil society is a key element in securing sustainable 
</p>
<p>human rights protection, and can help to address ideologies at the grass-roots level. The 
</p>
<p>measures taken by States to counter terrorism have, however, in many places limited the 
</p>
<p>ability of civil society organizations to carry out their important work, and in some cases 
</p>
<p>have targeted specific ethnic or religious organizations for surveillance purposes. The 
</p>
<p>efforts made by States to counter terrorism should include the creation of an enabling 
</p>
<p>environment, including through the adoption of legislation protecting the space afforded to 
</p>
<p>civil society and the promotion of non-discriminatory measures. <b> </b></p>
<p><b> 2. Combating impunity and ensuring accountability 
</b></p>
<p>40. International human rights law, which continues to apply to situations of armed 
</p>
<p>conflict, imposes direct responsibility on the State in whose territory and under whose 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction violations and abuses may be committed. In particular, the State has the 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure that action is taken so that violations and abuses are prevented and/or 
</p>
<p>not repeated, to promptly, thoroughly, independently and impartially investigate allegations 
</p>
<p>of such violations and abuses, to punish perpetrators and to ensure an adequate remedy and 
</p>
<p>redress are provided to victims. 
</p>
<p>41. Members of non-State armed groups such as ISIL, including foreign fighters, are at a 
</p>
<p>minimum bound by peremptory norms of international law, including prohibitions on the 
</p>
<p>arbitrary deprivation of life, genocide, slavery, racial discrimination, torture and other cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman or degrading treatment, the taking of hostages, imposing collective punishment 
</p>
<p>and the arbitrary deprivation of liberty. In addition, non-State armed groups that exercise 
</p>
<p>effective control over territory, such as ISIL, are increasingly considered to be bound by 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations in relation to all people within that territory. In any 
</p>
<p>event, acts such as murder, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, or enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance, when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed 
</p>
<p>against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack, constitute a crime against 
</p>
<p>humanity and give rise to individual criminal responsibility. 
</p>
<p>42. In situations of armed conflict, the members of ISIL, including foreign fighters, are 
</p>
<p>also obliged to respect applicable rules of international humanitarian law. At a minimum, 
</p>
<p>article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 establishes the minimum 
</p>
<p>standards that all parties involved in a non-international armed conflict should observe 
</p>
<p>concerning the treatment and protection of civilians, those no longer actively participating 
</p>
<p>in the hostilities, and civilian objects. Customary international humanitarian law requires 
</p>
<p>that the parties to the conflict take all measures to minimize the impact of violence on 
</p>
<p>civilians, respect the principles of distinction and proportionality when carrying out military 
</p>
<p>operations and ensure that civilians can leave areas affected by violence in safety and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>dignity. Serious violations of international humanitarian law may amount to war crimes, 
</p>
<p>engaging the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible. 
</p>
<p>43. As I highlighted in my briefing to the Security Council on 18 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>evidence exists indicating that members of ISIL are likely responsible for war crimes and 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity, subject to determination by a competent court of law. It is also 
</p>
<p>possible that, particularly in respect of the Yazidis, some of the offences constitutive of the 
</p>
<p>crime of genocide, as defined in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
</p>
<p>Crime of Genocide, have been perpetrated by individuals within the ISIL leadership. 
</p>
<p>Deliberate and calculated abuses, violations and crimes committed by ISIL have been 
</p>
<p>documented extensively by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic and by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and 
</p>
<p>OHCHR.26 These include murder and other inhumane acts, enslavement, rape, sexual 
</p>
<p>slavery and other forms of sexual violence, forcible displacement, enforced disappearance 
</p>
<p>and torture committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian 
</p>
<p>population in a number of governorates.  
</p>
<p>44. Accountability for all gross violations of international human rights law and serious 
</p>
<p>violations of international humanitarian law through effective investigation and prosecution 
</p>
<p>of those responsible is essential to ensure justice, to provide redress to victims and to 
</p>
<p>prevent further violations. The responsibility for accountability falls primarily on States, 
</p>
<p>which are obliged to ensure investigations and, where the evidence warrants, prosecutions 
</p>
<p>of such violations, meeting minimum international standards of justice. Domestic courts in 
</p>
<p>Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic have jurisdiction over crimes committed by nationals or 
</p>
<p>foreign fighters in those territories and should, whenever possible, exercise such 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. The countries of nationality of these foreign fighters should also effectively 
</p>
<p>investigate and prosecute those responsible whenever they can do so.  
</p>
<p>45. In certain circumstances, where a State is unwilling or unable to investigate or 
</p>
<p>prosecute those responsible for serious violations of international human rights and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law constitutive of international crimes, the jurisdiction of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court may be triggered. I have made numerous calls for a referral of 
</p>
<p>the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic to the Court, following findings by the 
</p>
<p>Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic and OHCHR that international crimes 
</p>
<p>have been committed on an increasingly large scale. I also have called upon Iraq to 
</p>
<p>consider accession to the Rome Statute of the Court and, as an immediate step, to accept the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction with respect to the current situation. I would also hope 
</p>
<p>that the Court can be enabled to exercise its jurisdiction over those foreign fighters 
</p>
<p>implicated in international crimes who are nationals of States party to the court. Every 
</p>
<p>measure should be taken to ensure that individuals responsible for serious violations of 
</p>
<p>international law are held to account.<b> </b></p>
<p><b> 3. Human rights-compliant responses 
</b></p>
<p>46. While Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) includes important provisions for 
</p>
<p>ensuring compliance with international human rights law, concerns have been raised over 
</p>
<p>the broad nature of certain provisions and the potential this creates for the implementation 
</p>
<p>of measures at the national level that may result in violations of human rights. The 
</p>
<p>significant shortcomings in the compliance of many States with their obligations under 
</p>
<p>international human rights law in the context of counter-terrorism are disturbing and 
</p>
<p>provided a backdrop to these concerns. For example, the reference made by the Council in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 26 &#8220;Rule of Terror&#8221; (see footnote 24) and UNAMI/OHCHR, Report on the Protection of Civilians in 
</p>
<p>Armed Conflict in Iraq: 6 July &#8211; 10 September 2014. </p>


<p>resolution 2178 (2014) to &#8220;terrorism in all forms and manifestations&#8221; as one of the most 
</p>
<p>serious threats to international peace and security, without qualification or further 
</p>
<p>definition, has prompted well-founded concerns that the resolution may fuel the adoption of 
</p>
<p>repressive measures at the national level against otherwise lawful, non-violent activities of 
</p>
<p>groups or individuals. The lack of an explicit exemption for acts that otherwise may be 
</p>
<p>lawful under international humanitarian law is also a cause for concern.  
</p>
<p>47. Particularly in view of the legally binding nature of Security Council resolution 
</p>
<p>2178 (2014), concerns also have been raised at the lack of definition of the terms 
</p>
<p>&#8220;terrorism&#8221; or &#8220;extremism&#8221;, as well as to references in the resolution to &#8220;terrorists&#8221; as a 
</p>
<p>category of individuals in addition to specific acts to be sanctioned.  
</p>
<p>48. Resolution 2178 (2014) is, however, explicit in requiring States to ensure 
</p>
<p>compliance with international law, including human rights law, in its implementation. 
</p>
<p>States must therefore ensure that any legislation adopted on the basis of the resolution is in 
</p>
<p>line with the principle of legality, as enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights. This requires that the imposition of criminal liability be 
</p>
<p>limited to clear and precise provisions so as to respect the principle of certainty of the law 
</p>
<p>and ensure that it is not subject to interpretation, which would unduly broaden the scope of 
</p>
<p>the proscribed conduct. Overly vague or broad definitions of terrorism would not meet this 
</p>
<p>requirement and may be used by States as a means to cover peaceful acts, to discriminate 
</p>
<p>against particular individuals or groups or to limit any sort of political opposition.  
</p>
<p>49. Some of the measures taken under the scope of Security Council resolution 2178 
</p>
<p>(2014) may have a negative impact, for example, on the right to due process for affected 
</p>
<p>individuals, including the right to presumption of innocence; to enjoyment of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement, and be protected against arbitrary deprivation of nationality; to the 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of religion, belief, opinion, expression or association;27 and to protection 
</p>
<p>against arbitrary or unlawful interference in privacy. It should not be presumed, for 
</p>
<p>example, that every individual travelling to an area of conflict has criminal intent or is 
</p>
<p>supporting or engaging in criminal terrorist activity. This consideration is fundamental to 
</p>
<p>ensuring respect for due process and the presumption of innocence. While the resolution 
</p>
<p>does not explicitly reflect a minimum age for liability of individuals it seeks to target, 
</p>
<p>States also must take every measure to ensure respect for the rights of individuals under the 
</p>
<p>age of 18 years, and ensure that any measure taken to counter the flow of foreign fighters is 
</p>
<p>compliant with all international legal obligations, including human rights. 
</p>
<p>50. A number of States have taken measures to curtail the movement of foreign fighters. 
</p>
<p>These include travel bans, the withdrawal of passports and the denial of citizenship, all of 
</p>
<p>which have an impact on the right to freedom of movement, as enshrined in article 12 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The right to freedom of movement 
</p>
<p>includes the right to enter one&#8217;s own country and, as explained by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee in its general comment No. 27, covers at the very least an individual who, 
</p>
<p>because of his or her special ties to or claims in relation to a given country, cannot be 
</p>
<p>considered a mere alien, such as nationals of a country who have been stripped of their 
</p>
<p>nationality in violation of international law.28 While the right to freedom of movement is 
</p>
<p>not absolute, limitations must be lawful, pursuant to a legitimate aim and necessary to 
</p>
<p>achieve that aim. The Committee further specified that there were few, if any, 
</p>
<p>circumstances in which the deprivation of the right to enter one&#8217;s own country could be 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 27 See for example Human Rights Committee general comment No. 34 (CCPR/C/GC/34), para. 46, and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/22/17Add.4, annex, appendix. 
</p>
<p> 28 CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9, para. 20. </p>


<p>reasonable.29 Measures such as travel bans, the revocation of passports and the denial of 
</p>
<p>citizenship also raise important due process concerns, where decisions are taken following 
</p>
<p>secretive proceedings, in absentia or on the basis of vaguely defined criteria without 
</p>
<p>adequate safeguards to prevent statelessness.  
</p>
<p>51. International human rights law includes the right of everyone to a nationality, 
</p>
<p>although there is no right to a specific nationality. Given the significant impact that any 
</p>
<p>interference with the enjoyment of nationality has on the enjoyment of rights, the loss or 
</p>
<p>deprivation of nationality must meet certain conditions in order to comply with 
</p>
<p>international law, in particular the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of nationality.30 
</p>
<p>These conditions also include serving a legitimate purpose, being the least intrusive 
</p>
<p>instrument to achieve the desired result and being proportional to the interest to be 
</p>
<p>protected. Where the loss or deprivation of nationality leads to statelessness, the impact on 
</p>
<p>the individual is particularly severe. International law therefore strictly limits the 
</p>
<p>circumstances in which the loss or deprivation of nationality leading to statelessness can be 
</p>
<p>recognized as serving a legitimate purpose. 
</p>
<p>52. States should ensure that adequate procedural standards are in place to guarantee 
</p>
<p>that nationality regulations are not applied arbitrarily and relevant safeguards against 
</p>
<p>statelessness are implemented effectively. In particular, decisions relating to nationality 
</p>
<p>should be &#8220;issued in writing and open to effective administrative or judicial review&#8221;.31 
</p>
<p>International law thus obliges States to provide for the meaningful review of nationality 
</p>
<p>decisions, including on substantive issues.
32
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>53. In its resolution 2178 (2014), the Security Council also called upon States to require 
</p>
<p>airlines to provide advance passenger information to the appropriate national authorities in 
</p>
<p>order to detect the departure from their territories by, or attempted entry into or transit 
</p>
<p>through their territories, of individuals identified as falling within the scope of the 
</p>
<p>resolution. Such measures raise important considerations for the right of individuals to be 
</p>
<p>protected by law against unlawful or arbitrary interference in their privacy, as well as 
</p>
<p>against discrimination. States must ensure that any measure that interferes with the right to 
</p>
<p>privacy is both necessary and proportionate to the specific risk being addressed, that 
</p>
<p>procedural safeguards and effective, independent oversight is in place to ensure to prevent 
</p>
<p>against discriminatory measures and/or the abusive use of personal data, and that redress is 
</p>
<p>provided for in cases of abuse.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>While States have a duty to take measures to protect populations from violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>and insecurity and to deliver justice, such measures must be anchored in respect for 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law. Experience at the national level has demonstrated 
</b></p>
<p><b>that protecting human rights and ensuring respect for the rule of law contribute to 
</b></p>
<p><b>countering terrorism, in particular by creating a climate of trust between the State 
</b></p>
<p><b>and those under its jurisdiction, and by supporting the resilience of communities to 
</b></p>
<p><b>threats of violent radicalism. Conversely, compromising on human rights has proven 
</b></p>
<p><b>corrosive to the rule of law and conducive to a climate of impunity, and may

<p><b>undermine the effectiveness of any counter-terrorism measure, and thereby 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to greater radicalization.  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>I urge States to take measures to ensure that counter-terrorism laws and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing measures are consistent with international human rights standards and 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliant with the principle of legality. A regular review of the compliance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>counter-terrorism laws and practices with human rights standards is critical to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that these measures are specific, necessary, effective and proportionate. The validity 
</b></p>
<p><b>of any exceptional measure should be restricted in time through the inclusion of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>sunset clause. I encourage all States, as part of the legislative process, to ensure broad 
</b></p>
<p><b>and inclusive consultations with all relevant stakeholders and a review of draft 
</b></p>
<p><b>counter-terrorism legislation by relevant domestic bodies before adoption to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that legislation is coherent with relevant international human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>I also urge States, as part of their efforts to stem the flow of foreign fighters, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>integrate compliance with their obligations under international human rights law by 
</b></p>
<p><b>stepping up efforts:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To address the conditions conducive to terrorism and to counter violent 
</b></p>
<p><b>extremism, including by fostering engagement between communities and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities in order to build trust, supporting local ownership of initiatives and 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing positive counter-narratives. The role of civil society should be supported 
</b></p>
<p><b>through the creation of an enabling environment, including through the adoption of 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation protecting the space afforded to civil society and the promotion of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory measures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To combat impunity and ensure accountability for all gross violations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law and of international humanitarian law through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>prompt, thorough, independent and effective investigation and prosecution of those 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To ensure that any measures taken in an effort to stem the flow of foreign 
</b></p>
<p><b>fighters and to prevent the commission of criminal acts comply with their obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>under international human rights law.  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Throughout its activities in support of the implementation of the Global 
</b></p>
<p><b>Counter-Terrorism Strategy, the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and 
</b></p>
<p><b>its entities should intensify efforts to promote respect for human rights and the rule of 
</b></p>
<p><b>law as the fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism. This should include the 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of compliance with human rights as an integral part of assistance to States 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the development and implementation of counter-terrorism-related legislation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policy. OHCHR stands ready to assist Member States in the development and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of human rights-compliant legislation and implementation measures, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in follow-up to Security Council resolution 2178 (2014).
