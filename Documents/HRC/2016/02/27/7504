<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
24/14, in which the Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) to organize a workshop on the impact of the application of 
unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights by the affected populations, 
in particular their socioeconomic impact on women and children, in the States targeted, and 
to prepare a report on the proceedings of the workshop and to submit it to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the workshop 
</b>2. The workshop was held on 23 May 2014 in Geneva. It was chaired and moderated 
by Vera Gowlland-Debbas, Emeritus Professor of International Law at the Graduate 
Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. The workshop comprised an 
opening session and three subsequent thematic sessions: session I, on assessing the impact 
of unilateral coercive measures on human rights, in particular of women and children; 
session II, on mechanisms to assess and mitigate the adverse impact of unilateral coercive 
measures and ensure accountability; and session III, on contemporary unilateral coercive 
measures: learning lessons from the past to develop basic principles to redress adverse 
impacts. During the thematic sessions, nine panellists made presentations; each thematic set 
of panel presentations was followed by an interactive dialogue. The workshop also included 
a presentation by the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee on its forthcoming 
research-based report on mechanisms to assess the negative impact of unilateral coercive 
measures on the enjoyment of human rights and to promote accountability, the preparation 
of which was requested by the Council in its resolution 24/14. 
</p>
<p>3. The objectives of the workshop were to provide a platform for the exchange of 
views among States, academic and civil society experts, and human rights mechanisms on 
the impact of unilateral coercive measures on human rights, especially of women and 
children; to follow up on the recommendations of the previous workshop, held in 2013, and 
contribute to the current efforts of the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to 
identify mechanisms to assess and mitigate the adverse impact of unilateral coercive 
measures and ensure accountability; and to share experiences of contemporary unilateral 
coercive measures and learn lessons from the past as a first step towards developing basic 
principles and guidelines to redress the adverse impacts of unilateral coercive measures. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Opening session 
</b>4. In opening the workshop, the Chair noted a progressive limitation of the freedom of 
States to resort to unilateral measures since the adoption of the Charter of the United 
Nations. In its resolution 2625 (XXV), the General Assembly considered that the use of 
coercive measures in order to obtain from a State the subordination of the exercise of its 
sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind violated the principle of non-
intervention. However, under the customary international law of State responsibility, 
codified by the International Law Commission, countermeasures which would otherwise 
constitute illegal measures were justified if taken by a State injured by an internationally 
wrongful act of another State, provided they complied with certain conditions and 
limitations. Those conditions included the principle of proportionality, respect for 
obligations for the protection of fundamental human rights and respect for obligations of a 
humanitarian character, as well as peremptory norms of general international law. The </p>


<p>Chair recalled that the disproportionate and indiscriminate human costs of comprehensive 
sanctions, most prominently the effects on the civilian population of the decade-long 
sanctions against Iraq, had accelerated the trend towards &#8220;smart&#8221; sanctions targeted against 
individuals (such as government leaders), particular commodities (such as arms) or services 
(such as asset freezes). Those in turn had generated their own human rights problems, and 
the lack of due process mechanisms for the Al-Qaida sanctions list of the Security Council, 
imposing asset freezes and other targeted measures against terrorist suspects, had resulted 
in challenges before domestic and regional courts. She noted that the 2005 World Summit 
Outcome, while recognizing the utility of sanctions as a tool to maintain international peace 
and security, stressed that there should be regular monitoring and review by the Security 
Council to ensure accountability for the way in which sanctions were implemented, and that 
such measures could now be challenged before an ombudsperson. The Chair stated that it 
would be paradoxical if the trend towards constraints on collective measures were not 
accompanied by similar constraints and accountability in respect of unilateral coercive 
measures, to prevent harmful effects on populations. 
</p>
<p>5. On behalf of OHCHR, the Chief of the Development and Economic and Social 
Issues Branch delivered welcoming remarks. He noted that unilateral coercive measures 
had potential impact on all three pillars of the United Nations: peace and security, 
development and human rights. In its thematic report submitted to the Human Rights 
Council in 2012, OHCHR had stressed that such measures must be subject to stringent 
conditions as to their duration and their proportionality to the legitimate and lawful aim 
sought, and must include explicit human rights safeguards, including monitoring by 
independent expert. The workshop provided an opportunity for an exchange of views on the 
forms that such safeguards and monitoring mechanisms should take. He reminded 
participants that no State should ever impose measures against another that were in breach 
of its human rights or humanitarian law obligations under treaty or customary international 
law, and that States which were subject to unilateral coercive measures remained duty 
bearers obligated to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all persons under their 
jurisdiction. In conclusion, he noted the political nature of unilateral coercive measures, 
which were generally resorted to when diplomatic relations between the States concerned 
had become hostile or had broken off altogether, and encouraged participants to focus not 
on politics but rather on the very real effects of such measures on human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. Subsequently, the Chair opened the floor for general statements. Representatives of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement), Qatar, Belarus, the 
Russian Federation, Myanmar, Cuba, Zimbabwe, the Sudan and Pakistan took the floor, 
followed by the Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable 
international order, Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, and representatives of the Organization for 
Defending Victims of Violence, the Hawa Society for Women and the Indian Council of 
South America (CISA). Several participants stated that unilateral coercive measures 
constituted violations of the Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law 
and international human rights law. Speakers highlighted in particular negative impacts on 
the rights to health, to an adequate standard of living, to food, to education, to work and to 
housing, as well as on the right to development. A number of participants proposed that the 
Human Rights Council should create a special procedure on unilateral coercive measures, 
and that a monitoring body within the United Nations system should ensure accountability 
for such measures. </p>


<p><b> IV. Session I. Assessing the impact of unilateral coercive 
measures on human rights, in particular of women 
and children 
</b></p>
<p>7. The panellists were Haifa Zangana, a novelist, artist and journalist, Mohamed 
Younis, Senior Analyst for the Middle East and North Africa at Gallup, and Dursun Peksen, 
Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Memphis. The Chair noted that 
panellists would address the impacts of both unilateral measures and collective measures, as 
their impact on civilian populations was not dependent on the distinction in their legal 
bases. 
</p>
<p>8. Ms. Zangana presented the effects on Iraqi life of the economic sanctions imposed 
pursuant to Security Council resolution 661 (1990). She noted that many Iraqis referred to 
the 12 years and 8 months of sanctions as the &#8220;siege&#8221;, and that the wide-ranging effect of 
sanctions and the importance of family in Iraqi society made it difficult to separate specific 
impacts on women and children from those on society as a whole. She detailed the effects 
on the economy following the collapse of the dinar to less than 1 per cent of its value in 
1990, which led to an acute deterioration of living conditions, severely straining the social 
fabric. Ms. Zangana highlighted particular effects on the right to life, citing estimates by the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) that the first five years of sanctions had resulted 
in the deaths of half a million Iraqi children under the age of 5. She noted the shortages of 
medicines and specific effects on the right to health of women, including increases in the 
incidence of miscarriages, cancer, anaemia, diabetes, depression and other conditions. 
People had reduced their visits to friends or relatives due to their shame at being unable to 
offer hospitality, a deep-rooted tradition in Iraqi society. The right to education had been 
severely affected by poverty, which forced children into work; restrictions on the import of 
educational materials; and the struggle to secure basic daily needs. 
</p>
<p>9. Mr. Younis presented some results of the Gallup World Poll from Egypt, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and Ukraine. The World Poll included a measure of well-being which 
asked individuals to rate their lives currently and their prospects in five years on a scale of 1 
to 10. Those rating 4 or lower on both were defined as &#8220;suffering&#8221;, while those rating their 
current lives as 7 and above and future lives as 8 and above were defined as &#8220;thriving&#8221;. In 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, the suffering rate had increased drastically during the period 
of sanctions, while the thriving rate had remained relatively stable. In 2013, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran had the eighth highest rate of suffering in the Middle East and Central 
Asia region.  
</p>
<p>10. Mr. Younis also presented the results of a survey of Iranians on the impact of 
sanctions, and their views thereon. Between 2011 and 2013, the proportion of respondents 
that considered that the sanctions of the United Nations, the United States of America and 
Western Europe would hurt the livelihood of Iranians a great deal had almost doubled. 
According to the survey, men were the most satisfied with the efforts of the Government to 
deal with the poor (men 62 per cent, women 55 per cent). Households with children were 
suffering more than households with no children. Households with children were more 
exposed to a lack of money to buy food and provide adequate housing. Women were more 
likely than men to express the view that their own personal livelihoods, as well as those of 
Iranians in general, were hurt a great deal by the sanctions. Almost half of the Iranians 
surveyed in 2012 and 2013 held the United States most responsible for the sanctions, 
compared to around 10 per cent who felt that the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran was most responsible; a large majority of both men (68 per cent) and women (62 per 
cent) were of the view that the Islamic Republic of Iran should continue to develop its 
nuclear power capabilities despite the sanctions.  </p>


<p>11. Mr. Younis pointed out that the results of the surveys sparked questions about what 
was accomplished through sanctions, and challenged the assumption that sanctions would 
be able to reverse a situation. 
</p>
<p>12. Mr. Peksen noted that his research showed that, in most cases, economic sanctions 
were more likely to fail in their purpose than to achieve the intended results. They tended to 
be ineffective, counterproductive and detrimental to basic freedoms and rights. Targeted 
elites were generally able to evade their effects, doing whatever they could to resist the 
pressure and maintain credibility, often leading to higher levels of oppression to maintain 
power, with disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups, children, women and 
minorities. Economic sanctions often reduced women&#8217;s level of labour participation, as 
women were often involved in export-oriented industries, such as textiles and the assembly 
of electronic devices. Sanctions could also cause more violence against women, as growing 
frustration and feelings of injustice led to a rise in crime in targeted countries, including 
assault and rape. Examples included Cuba, Haiti and Iraq. Sanctions failed to affect elites or 
to promote reform in the targeted State, but also had effects on neighbouring countries, 
which might suffer economically from the reduction in trade or see an influx of refugees or 
an increase in levels of violence. Negative spillover effects could have a regional impact. 
Mr. Peksen concluded that blunt economic measures were not useful, and suggested a focus 
instead on types of smart sanctions that could reduce military expenditure support and more 
directly target leaders. 
</p>
<p>13. The Chair welcomed the presentations by the panellists and referred to further 
examples demonstrating the harmful effects of sanctions, including the effects on third 
parties, such as Jordan, of sanctions against Iraq, and the way in which the relevant 
sanctions committee of the Security Council had interpreted the humanitarian exceptions, 
refusing for example to allow Cuba to export baby food to occupied Kuwait. She proposed 
that the General Assembly should request special reports from the Security Council, in 
accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, on its adoption of sanctions and their 
impact. 
</p>
<p>14. In the ensuing interactive dialogue, Denis Halliday, former United Nations 
Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq; a representative of the Hawa Society for Women; Obiora 
Okafor, Professor, Osgoode Hall Law School and member of the Human Rights Council 
Advisory Committee; and a representative of the Institut international pour la paix, la 
justice et les droits de l&#8217;homme took the floor. Several speakers questioned whether it was 
possible to make a distinction between different types of sanctions, and in particular 
whether smart sanctions were superior. A number of speakers drew attention to the 
sanctions against the Sudan, stating that those had negative effects on the realization of the 
Millennium Development Goals and human rights, including the rights to health, to an 
adequate standard of living and to education. 
</p>
<p>15. Responding to questions and points raised, Mr. Peksen said that sanctions were 
sometimes used for symbolic purposes, which could be useful, but that there was no 
significant evidence that smart sanctions were better than others. He suggested that perhaps 
travel bans should be imposed and the wealth of leaders should be targeted. Mr. Younis 
stated that it was difficult to assess the impact of smart sanctions globally, but surveys 
similar to that conducted in the Islamic Republic of Iran could be carried out elsewhere. 
Ms. Zangana stated that the question of sanctions was a fundamentally moral one about 
who was entitled to impose them and affect the access of others to water, food and health 
care. She questioned their long-term impacts on how people saw one another and built 
future dialogue.  
</p>
<p>16. Summing up session 1, the Chair highlighted the relationship between the legality 
and effectiveness of unilateral coercive measures. The legal basis of sanctions imposed 
outside the auspices of the Security Council once the latter had taken measures against a </p>


<p>targeted entity should be questioned and it could be argued that the Security Council should 
have exclusive competence in such a situation. She proposed that sanctions could remain 
symbolic, and stated that they should in all cases be equitable and not only effective, and 
should be accompanied by dialogue, mediation and negotiation. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Session II. Mechanisms to assess and mitigate the adverse 
impact of unilateral coercive measures and ensure 
accountability 
</b></p>
<p>17. The panellists were Antonios Tzanakopoulos, Associate Professor of Public 
International Law at the University of Oxford, Susanne K&#252;hn, Head of the Public Sector 
Integrity Programme at Transparency International, and Obiora Okafor, Professor at 
Osgoode Hall Law School and member of the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee. 
</p>
<p>18. Mr. Tzanakopoulos defined a unilateral coercive measure as a measure that was in 
the first instance unlawful under international law, but whose wrongfulness was precluded 
owing to the fact that it was taken by a State that had been injured by an internationally 
wrongful act against the State that bore responsibility for that act. All unilateral coercive 
measures must respect the principle of proportionality. In that connection, measures 
adversely affecting human rights would likely be disproportionate, as they would have 
effects that were not commensurate with the injury suffered by the reacting State. However, 
it would be difficult to establish a direct relation between the unilateral coercive measure 
and the adverse effect on the enjoyment of human rights.  
19. Examining potential avenues for legal accountability for unilateral coercive 
measures, Mr. Tzanakopoulos considered both diplomatic and adjudicatory means of 
dispute resolution. He noted that any imbalance in the relative power of the States party to 
the dispute might hamper progress, so the best protection for a weak State targeted by 
unilateral coercive measures that it considered unlawful would be adjudication. However, 
judicial settlement was premised on the consent of all parties to the dispute, which might be 
difficult to obtain in practice if the State implementing the unilateral coercive measures had 
not previously indicated consent through unilateral declarations or compromissory clauses 
in bilateral or multilateral treaties. It was further premised on the willingness of the targeted 
State to challenge unilateral coercive measures; members of the population suffering the 
adverse impact had no direct say in the matter. A final possibility would be for third States 
to argue that disproportionate unilateral coercive measures affecting human rights 
constituted a breach of an obligation <i>erga omnes</i>, which would allow them in turn to 
impose coercive measures on the State imposing the disproportionate measures. That would 
assume solidarity rarely seen in the international community, and so he considered that the 
best mechanism to mitigate the adverse human rights impacts of unilateral coercive 
measures might be to mobilize public opinion against such measures. That had been done 
effectively in the case of United Nations sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the 
Charter of the United Nations, and had resulted in the creation of a hard monitoring 
mechanism, at least with respect to one sanctions regime (the creation of the Office of the 
Ombudsperson in accordance with Security Council resolutions 1904 (2009) and 1989 
(2011)). The creation of a similar, perhaps softer, monitoring mechanism might be an 
option in the case of unilateral coercive measures, but Mr. Tzanakopoulos noted that all 
attempts to subject such measures to hard monitoring had been abandoned by the 
International Law Commission during its work on the articles on responsibility of States for 
internationally wrongful acts. 
</p>
<p>20. Ms. K&#252;hn addressed the potential positive role that targeted unilateral coercive 
measures might play in the fight against corruption and impunity. She noted that corrupt </p>


<p>public officials often embezzled funds, which were then transferred abroad. Targeted 
sanctions against corrupt officials, in particular politically exposed persons, could help to 
close loopholes, combat corruption and end impunity. Such measures could include denial 
of entry, which, unlike a travel ban, was normally within the jurisdiction of States. In its 
anti-corruption action plan adopted in 2010, the Group of 20 urged its members to adopt ad 
hoc denial-of-entry policies, legal frameworks and enforcement measures, and to cooperate 
in that area. A lack of publicly available information made it difficult to monitor and hold 
Governments to account for proper implementation, and the compliance rate among G-20 
countries was low. Another tool which might put corrupt officials under pressure was the 
temporary freezing of economic resources to prevent their use and transfer. That would 
require greater transparency and information sharing in banking, as well as procedural 
guarantees against abuse. In conclusion, Ms. K&#252;hn stated that targeted measures could be a 
powerful tool against corrupt individuals that might avoid the negative human rights 
impacts of other unilateral coercive measures. She pointed to the need for common 
standards and objective criteria for targeted unilateral coercive measures, the need to 
respect proportionality, and the need for adequate procedural guarantees and the highest 
degree of transparency to ensure their fair and effective implementation. 
</p>
<p>21. Mr. Okafor considered which of the existing international human rights mechanisms 
could be most appropriate for mitigating the adverse effects of unilateral coercive measures 
on the enjoyment of human rights. He identified six factors which should be taken into 
account in that analysis: the challenge of territoriality and jurisdictionally limited 
obligations; the need to ensure accountability; access to independent evidence; financial 
and administrative efficiency; the need to secure and deploy the most appropriate technical 
expertise; and the reduction of politicization. He noted that the mandate of treaty-based 
bodies to examine the human rights obligations of a State was generally limited to the 
territory and jurisdiction of the State under consideration. He suggested that a Charter-
based body might be better placed to examine unilateral coercive measures, which by their 
very nature had extraterritorial effects. Extraterritorial issues might be taken into account in 
the universal periodic review process, and that mechanism might also meet the identified 
requirements of financial and administrative efficiency and accountability. However, those 
Member States conducting the review would not normally have robust access to direct, 
independent evidence or the flexibility to select and deploy the best available technical 
expertise. Were the Human Rights Council to decide to appoint a special rapporteur on the 
issue, that person would have direct access to evidence through country visits, as well as 
information from civil society organizations. Furthermore, the universal periodic review 
involved a significantly more political process than the work of a special rapporteur. Mr. 
Okafor therefore strongly recommended the creation of a dedicated special procedure for 
the assessment and/or mitigation of the adverse effects of unilateral coercive measures on 
the enjoyment of human rights. 
22. The Chair welcomed the rigorous approach of the panellists, and remarked on some 
positive trends to overcome some of the identified jurisdictional challenges, including 
recognition by the International Court of Justice of the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as an <i>erga omnes partes</i> 
convention, meaning that any State party could make a claim regarding non-compliance by 
another State party. She pointed out that many targeted sanctions were not to be seen as 
mere administrative measures, but were punitive in nature without the accompanying due 
process guarantees. 
</p>
<p>23. During the interactive dialogue, interventions were made by representatives of the 
Indian Council of South America, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Hawa Society 
for Women and the Organization for Defending Victims of Violence, and by Mr. de Zayas. 
Several speakers highlighted the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the right to self-</p>


<p>determination and the right to development, and some supported the call for the creation of 
a new special procedure on the human rights impact of unilateral coercive measures.  
</p>
<p>24. Responding to a question about the determination of responsibility for the human 
rights impacts of unilateral coercive measures, Mr. Tzanakopoulos explained that such a 
determination depended on showing causality, but that both the State imposing coercive 
measures and the State targeted could be legally responsible for violations where causality 
was established. Regarding the creation of an international mechanism to determine the 
legality of unilateral coercive measures, Mr. Tzanakopoulos reiterated that it was unrealistic 
due to differing views among Member States. He noted that a strategy of division might not 
have a useful outcome, and could lead to an unstable and politicized mechanism. Ms. K&#252;hn 
highlighted the role of civil society and the media in holding international organizations to 
account and, in response to a point made by the Chair, noted that the legitimacy of the G-20 
to impose targeted sanctions was questionable. Mr. Okafor agreed with one speaker that the 
dominant media had not fulfilled their role of informing the public about the action of 
Governments on sanctions. He noted that many mechanisms became &#8220;instruments of the 
powerful&#8221;, and that of the five permanent members of the Security Council, only the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland currently accepted the compulsory 
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Session III. Contemporary unilateral coercive measures: 
learning lessons from the past to develop basic principles 
to redress adverse impacts 
</b></p>
<p>25. The panellists were Ingrid Macdonald, Geneva Director of the Norwegian Refugee 
Council, Denis Halliday, former United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, and 
Sarah Zaidi, consultant, former Executive Director of the International Treatment 
Preparedness Coalition and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Social Rights. 
</p>
<p>26. Ms. Macdonald discussed the impact of counter-terrorism policies, including 
sanction regimes, on the operation of humanitarian organizations, referring to the 2013 
Study on the Impact of Donor Counter-Terrorism Measures on Principled Humanitarian 
Action commissioned by the Norwegian Refugee Council and the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. She noted that Member States were the architects of 
international law, and that the Geneva Conventions and a number of Security Council and 
General Assembly resolutions acknowledged the primacy and principles of humanitarian 
action. However, there was often a contradiction between those principles and the 
application of counter-terrorism measures, including sanctions. Some States prohibited 
support to anyone associated with terrorists, but it was beyond the mandate of humanitarian 
organizations to determine whether individuals were, for example, family members or 
neighbours of terrorists. Such organizations might also need to engage with terrorist 
organizations to ensure their own security. Another contradiction was that, in accordance 
with Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), the protection of children should be 
enhanced, but organizations that provided training on the non-recruitment of child soldiers 
might be criminally liable under &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; counter-terrorism policies.  
</p>
<p>27. Ms. Macdonald further noted that unilateral coercive measures might prevent 
humanitarian organizations from making financial transfers to States where they work, 
citing the examples of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Somalia and the Sudan. Exemptions 
often took too long to obtain in circumstances of urgent humanitarian need, and banks were 
increasingly unwilling to take the risk of allowing any transfer to States targeted by 
coercive measures. That also affected the ability of individuals to transfer remittances, 
which often provided a vital lifeline for vulnerable populations.  </p>


<p>28. In conclusion, Ms. Macdonald noted the need for a broad-based humanitarian 
exemption under sanctions regimes to allow humanitarian organizations to continue to 
function effectively on the ground, and narrower definitions of concepts such as &#8220;material 
support&#8221; to terrorists, so that they did not prevent humanitarian organizations from fulfilling 
their mandate to provide support to the population. 
</p>
<p>29. Mr. Halliday welcomed the focus of the discussions on accountability, noting that he 
could not recall the Security Council ever being held accountable for the consequences of 
its decisions under Chapter VII, Articles 41 and 42, of the Charter. He considered that it 
was unrealistic to expect States to respect basic principles in implementing unilateral 
coercive measures when the Security Council itself did not respect the purposes and 
principles set out in Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter when it imposed sanctions. Mr. Halliday 
therefore proposed a revised and binding Article 41 compatible with those purposes and 
principles, with time limitations, effective monitoring and rigid accountability provisions.  
</p>
<p>30. With regard to unilateral coercive measures, Mr. Halliday considered that there 
should be nothing less than complete cessation of them, as all such measures violated the 
Charter. However, as unilateral coercive measures would be hard to stop in practice, he 
proposed close monitoring by the Human Rights Council, with quarterly reporting to the 
General Assembly or a revitalized and operational International Court of Justice. 
Accountability could be ensured through devices such as suspension of United Nations 
membership, loss of General Assembly voting rights, payment of reparations and payment 
of compensation to individuals. Mr. Halliday suggested that positive rather than punitive 
intervention might, however, be more productive, with increased United Nations capability 
to anticipate bilateral problems, tensions and actions before coercive measures were begun, 
and early dispute resolution assistance made available to States involved in disputes. He 
stated that true accountability could be ensured only through a reformed, more democratic 
Security Council, with full global and North/South representation.  
</p>
<p>31. In conclusion, Mr. Halliday noted that few, if any, States appeared to win either 
when imposing or as a target of multilateral or unilateral coercive measures, and that non-
violent recognition, support, cooperation, and commitment to the letter and spirit of the 
Charter might prove to be more rewarding. 
</p>
<p>32. Ms. Zaidi, participating by video message, examined the recent history of the use of 
sanctions, noting that prior to 1990, the Security Council had imposed sanctions only twice, 
against the former Rhodesia and South Africa, but between 1990 and 2000, they had 
become a favoured coercive measure as an alternative to military intervention and had been 
imposed 13 times. Drawing from her experience in assessing, analysing and critiquing the 
negative humanitarian impacts of various sanctions regimes, she stated that if sanctions 
were not designed with human rights principles in mind from the outset, subsequent 
attempts to mitigate their humanitarian effects would be minor and insignificant, amounting 
to a form of greenwashing that served to obscure the harmful policies behind the sanctions. 
She gave examples of the human toll of comprehensive trade sanctions in Iraq; the 
improvement of social conditions in the Islamic Republic of Iran under comprehensive 
unilateral sanctions which had then worsened following the imposition of multilateral 
sanctions; public pressure to implement &#8220;smart&#8221; sanctions to reduce negative humanitarian 
and human rights effects; and the broader effect of current targeted sanctions on the 
economy of the Russian Federation. She noted that targeted sanctions, by definition, had 
narrower impacts, and as such were easier for policy elites to circumvent and thus were less 
effective from the perspective of the States imposing them.  
</p>
<p>33. Ms. Zaidi concluded that sanctions were war by another means, analogous to siege and 
blockade. Damage to the national economy on which the population depended for health and 
welfare was used by States imposing unilateral coercive measures to force a change in 
government behaviour. She said that smart sanctions would always be preferable to </p>


<p>comprehensive sanctions in terms of humanitarian impact. However, even under smart 
sanctions as they were currently imposed, vulnerable populations paid the highest price, while 
policy elites were least affected. Humanitarian practitioners had the best access to research 
and data on the impact of sanctions. They should therefore advocate for a political and legal 
understanding that the rights and well-being of civilians and vulnerable populations could not 
be sacrificed because their governments were in conflict with powerful States or multilateral 
institutions. As human rights principles applied to all sanctions regimes, there should always 
be: (a) clear legal exemptions and expedited processes for humanitarian goods, including 
food, medicines, medical inputs and equipment and educational resources; (b) fast-tracking of 
licences for humanitarian goods, with streamlined financial and administrative procedures, 
especially for medicines for the chronically ill; (c) protection for whistle-blowers who report 
on the misuse of humanitarian funds; and (d) ongoing mechanisms to monitor and evaluate 
the humanitarian impact of sanctions.  
</p>
<p>34. Ms. Zaidi noted that war was a terrible, quintessentially human horror which should 
be avoided altogether or waged with great reluctance as a very last resort, and stated that it 
was long overdue for sanctions to be considered in the same light. 
</p>
<p>35. During the ensuing interactive dialogue, representatives of Qatar and the Hawa 
Society for Women took the floor. The speakers called for greater attention to fundamental 
human rights principles, and drew attention to the negative effects of sanctions on 
vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>36. Responding to comments, Ms. Macdonald gave the example of Somalia to illustrate 
the impact of sanctions on the civilian population, noting that the loss of US$ 1.3 million in 
remittances to support livelihoods was not being taken up by any donor. Further, she stated 
the necessity for humanitarian workers to be able to engage with all actors as required by 
their mission to deliver assistance, and the importance of their neutrality, whereas sanctions 
and counter-terrorism measures were essentially political. Mr. Halliday recalled the 
example of Iraq, where the banking sector had been crushed by sanctions. He urged 
Member States to give greater power to the Human Rights Council, which must monitor 
human rights violations associated with coercive measures.

<p><b> VII. Presentation by the Human Rights Council Advisory 
Committee on its forthcoming research-based report on 
mechanisms to assess the negative impact of unilateral 
coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights and 
to promote accountability 
</b></p>
<p>37. Jean Ziegler, a member of the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, 
presented the Committee&#8217;s work to prepare a research-based report on mechanisms to 
assess the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human 
rights and to promote accountability, requested by the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 24/14. In January 2014, the Committee had created a working group and online 
platform for that purpose, sent a questionnaire to the permanent missions in Geneva and 
other stakeholders, and selected case studies from Cuba, the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
Zimbabwe. The report was currently being prepared and would be submitted to the Human 
Rights Council for consideration at its twenty-eighth session. Mr. Ziegler expressed his 
disappointment that few States from the Western European and other States Group had 
submitted responses. He said that the initial responses received supported the view that 
sanctions caused violations of human rights and humanitarian law, and he proposed the 
creation of an international monitoring mechanism with the participation of international 
organizations, as well as a mechanism to provide compensation to victims. </p>


<p> <b>VIII. Conclusions  
</b>38. <b>In summing up the discussions at the workshop, the Chair noted that there was 
a vast and complex web of unilateral coercive measures, which intersected with 
multilateral sanctions and those imposed by regional organizations. Some States that 
imposed unilateral coercive measures claimed to act in the name of the international 
community; in other instances Security Council sanctions were imposed in support of 
unilateral interests. The participants in the workshop had examined a wide range of 
impacts of coercive measures, from their impact on international humanitarian and 
human rights law, to their impact on the economy, on peace and security and on the 
social fabric of States. A number of panellists had questioned the purposes and 
effectiveness of unilateral coercive measures, whether imposed to react to prior 
violations by the targeted State, in response to terrorism, as an alternative to war or in 
the context of war. The Chair pointed to a need to redefine what was understood as 
the effectiveness of coercive measures in order to take human rights and 
humanitarian concerns into account.</b>  
</p>
<p>39. <b>The Chair summarized the discussions on ensuring accountability and 
humanitarian exceptions for unilateral coercive measures. She noted in particular the 
analysis of existing human rights mechanisms, and the call by some speakers for the 
creation of a special procedures mandate. She stressed the importance of public 
opinion and the need for populations to reflect on the accountability of their own 
Governments in States implementing unilateral coercive measures. In conclusion, she 
stated that it was necessary to move beyond tweaking sanctions to examine the place 
of sanctions in the current international setting. She noted deep-rooted problems and 
grievances within the international system, and the importance for the United Nations 
to give a voice to all members of the international community, in order to ensure 
multilateralism, mutual respect and the peaceful settlement of disputes.</b> </p>
