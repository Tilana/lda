the auditors of the Company. Section 207S of the Companies Act 1993 provides that the fees

Resolution 6 – Increase of Directors’ Remuneration Pool
The Company seeks approval under NZX Main Board Listing Rule 3.5.1(a) and ASX Listing Rule 
10.17 to increase Director fees from an aggregate of NZ$125,000 per annum to an aggregate 
of NZ$200,000 per annum.  The current total remuneration pool was set at $125,000 per annum 
at the Company’s 2013 annual meeting.
The Board considers that it is reasonable and appropriate to seek an increase in fees in order to 
appoint and retain as Directors persons of high calibre in possession of the range of skills required 
in  order  to  adequately  meet  the  needs  of  the  Company.  As  the  Company  continues  its 
progression to producer, differing and additional skill sets are required at the board level and 
the pool will need to be increased to take into account the increase in the board’s current skills 
and capabilities by the recent appointments of Murray Stevens, Charbel Nader, Tony Horwath 
as set out in this Notice of Annual Meeting.
For the purposes of ASX Listing Rule 10.17, no securities have been issued to the Company’s 
non-executive  Directors  with  the  approval  of  shareholders  under  ASX  Listing  Rules  10.11  or 
10.14 at any time in the past three years, save in respect of the issue of 10,000,000 ordinary 
shares in the Company to James Murray McKee (at NZ$0.007 per share) and 10,000,000 shares 
to Matthew Hill (at NZ$0.007 per share) on 29 September 2015 (as approved by the Company’s 
shareholders at the annual general meeting on 11 September 2015).
Voting  Exclusion:  The  Company  will  disregard  any  votes  cast  on  this  resolution  6  by  any 
Director of the Company and any Associated Person of a Director. However, the Company need 
not disregard a vote if:
it is cast by a person as proxy for a person who is entitled to vote in accordance with the 
directions on the proxy form; or
it is cast by the person chairing the meeting as proxy for a person who is entitled to vote, 
in accordance with a direction on the proxy form to vote as the proxy decides.
