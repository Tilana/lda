Teck Announces Acquisition of Securities of Jet Gold
Vancouver, B.C. – Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (“Teck”)
announced today that it acquired 8,333,333 common shares, and a $389,117 principal amount
convertible debenture of Jet Gold Corp. (“Jet Gold”). Jet Gold issued the securities in satisfaction
of $889,117 of indebtedness owing to a Teck subsidiary. Jet Gold had assumed the
indebtedness in connection with its indirect acquisition of control over a 30% interest in Haib
Minerals (PTY) Ltd., in which Teck indirectly holds a 70% interest. The common shares were
issued for an aggregate price of $500,000, and the convertible debenture was issued for a price
of $389,117. No cash consideration was paid by Teck and the purchase price was fully satisfied
by set-off against the assumed indebtedness.
As a result of the transaction, Teck holds 8,333,333 Jet Gold common shares, approximately
11.6% of Jet Gold’s outstanding common shares, and a $389,117 principal amount convertible
debenture. The debenture matures in 48 months and is convertible at Teck’s election, in whole or
in part, into Jet Gold common shares at a price of $0.07 per share. If Teck were to convert the
entire principal amount of the debenture, Teck would hold approximately 17.9% of Jet Gold’s
outstanding common shares, calculated on a partially diluted basis assuming the conversion of
the debenture only.
Teck may determine to increase or decrease its holdings in Jet Gold depending on market
conditions and any other relevant factors. This release is required to be issued under the early
warning requirements of applicable securities laws. A copy of the early warning report may be
obtained from the contacts listed below.
