</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> Thailand made enormous achievements in the last decades to ensure access to water 
and sanitation, particularly in the challenging area of basic rural sanitation. At the same 
time, striking contrasts in access to safe drinking water and sanitation continue between 
those who have benefited from the rapid development the country has achieved and those 
groups of people who have been left behind from improvements including migrants, 
indigenous peoples, informal settlement dwellers and prisoners. Other remaining 
challenges with regard to the human rights to water and sanitation are water quality, safe 
management, disposal and treatment of wastewater and treatment of sewage from septic 
tanks. The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the Government of Thailand to revisit 
the situation of access to safe drinking water and sanitation from a human rights point of 
view to ensure these human rights are fully realized for all in terms of quality, availability, 
affordability, accessibility and adaptability of services and that inequalities in access are 
eliminated. She also reiterates that every individual, regardless of nationality, language or 
ethnicity, is entitled to the human rights to water and sanitation, and their legal status 
cannot exempt the State from its obligations to ensure access to water and sanitation. 
Furthermore she calls on the Government to take more vigorous, efficient and targeted 
measures to address and mitigate pollution and bring greater transparency to the processes 
of licensing of industries and enhanced accountability for those who violate the law.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. From 1 to 8 February 2013, the Special Rapporteur on the human right to water and 
sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, undertook an official visit to Thailand, to examine the 
progress and remaining challenges in ensuring the full realization of the human rights to 
water and sanitation in the country. During the mission, she met with different interlocutors 
including the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Natural Resources and Environment, 
Justice and Public Health and the local government of Chiang Mai. She also met with the 
Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, the Provincial Waterworks Authority (Headquarters 
and Region 9), the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority and the Royal Project Foundation. 
She was also given an opportunity to meet with the National Human Rights Commission of 
Thailand and civil society organizations, to visit several communities and talk to people in 
Bangkok and Chiang Mai. The Special Rapporteur expresses her appreciation to the 
Government of Thailand for the cooperation extended, as well as for the excellent 
organization and facilitation of the visit. She also extends her thanks to the United Nations 
country team, in particular the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
Regional Office for South-East Asia. Finally the Special Rapporteur wishes to thank all 
those who took the time to meet with her and help her better understand the situation of 
access to water and sanitation in Thailand. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal and institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Government of Thailand has ratified several international human rights 
instruments and hence has legal obligations to take concrete and deliberate steps to ensure 
the progressive realization of the human rights to water and sanitation. Safe drinking water 
and sanitation are a human right and derive from the right to an adequate standard of living, 
enshrined in, inter alia, article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights. This was explicitly recognized by the General Assembly in its resolution 
64/292, which enjoyed the support of Thailand, and by the Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution 15/9, which was adopted without a vote.  
</p>
<p>3. Human rights are for all. Every individual is entitled to access to drinking water and 
adequate sanitation that are accessible, available, affordable, socially acceptable and safe in 
all spheres in his or her life.1 The realization of these rights also requires ensuring access to 
adequate and affordable hygiene practices, including hand washing and menstrual hygiene 
management while ensuring privacy and dignity. Effective measures have to be taken in 
order to ensure adequate disposal and treatment of human waste, including of wastewater.  
</p>
<p><b> B. National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Constitution of Thailand provides for the protection of several social rights. 
While it does not specifically refer to the human rights to water and sanitation, it does state 
that sanitary conditions need to be protected. The Constitution provides that the State shall 
enact policies with relation to natural resources and the environment, including water. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 15 (2002) on the 
</p>
<p>right to water.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 
</b></p>
<p>5. Thailand does not yet have a comprehensive water law, but a Draft Water Act has 
been under discussion since 1992. Its section 36 categorizes the usages of water into three 
parts: (1) for subsistence; human consumption and domestic use; household agriculture, 
animal husbandry and industry including usage of water in small quantities as specified in 
the ministerial regulations; (2) for commercial agriculture and animal husbandry; industry; 
tourism; electricity generation; waterworks; and other activities as specified in the 
ministerial regulations; and (3) for big businesses using a large amount of water or water 
which can affect transbasin diversion of water or which covers a large area of water as 
specified in the ministerial regulations. Section 37 indicates that the guidance set by the 
Minister must &#8220;give priority&#8221; to human consumption and domestic use of water. These 
</p>
<p>provisions are important as the prioritization of water for personal and domestic use over 
other water uses is required by the human right to water. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government to adopt the Act urgently and to fully integrate the human right 
to water into it, so that the normative content of the human right to water and the principles 
of equality and non-discrimination and sustainability in access to water are fully and 
explicitly enshrined therein. The Government of Thailand is organizing public hearings on 
the Act across the country, which is an important process. The Special Rapporteur 
considers that the involvement of the Ministry of Justice and of the National Human Rights 
Commission, as well as of relevant national and international human rights and 
environmental civil society organizations in the consultations would be a very welcome 
initiative. 
</p>
<p>6. Sanitation is regulated mainly by the 1992 Public Health Act and the National 
Environmental Quality Act among others. The latter Act contains provisions on 
environmental quality management, including provisions that are especially relevant to 
water quality management and pollution control. Based on this Act, sub-laws and 
ministerial regulations have been put in place for domestic, industrial, and agricultural 
wastewater treatment and effluent standards. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. In Thailand, under the Determining Plans and Process of Decentralization to Local 
Government Organization Act (Decentralization Act 1999), the Committee of 
Decentralization to Local Government Organizations, composed of ministers, 
representatives of local government and experts, has the competence to establish a 
decentralization plan for local government organizations. Under this Act, the local 
authorities have the &#8220;power to systematize the public services for the benefit of local 
</p>
<p>communities&#8221; in such areas as water drainage and waste management.2 
</p>
<p>8. The institutional framework for water and sanitation in Thailand is quite dispersed 
among different national level agencies and local authorities. A fragmented distribution of 
responsibilities for different sources of water, sanitation issues and quality control of both 
water and sanitation can be identified as one of the challenges for the Government to ensure 
the quality of drinking water, sound sanitation management and reaching the unserved and 
underserved populations in Thailand.  
</p>
<p>9. Central government assumes the duties and privileges of states and bears the main 
responsibility for ensuring the realization of human rights. The reality, however, is that 
central government rarely exercises direct power over the issues that are of most immediate 
concern to the vast majority of the people, including the management and provision of 
water and sanitation services. Hence decentralization is a process that aims at strengthening 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Sect. 16 (18) and sect. 17 (10) of the Decentralization Act 1999.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>local governments so that they may deliver specific services to the populations living in the 
areas they administer. Decentralization, however, does not exempt central government from 
its human rights obligations. Irrespective of the responsibilities of the local authorities, 
central government remains the primary duty-bearer for the realization of human rights. 
Hence it has a duty to regulate and monitor the way in which local governments respect, 
protect and fulfil the human rights to water and sanitation. Moreover, it may need to adopt 
supplementary measures depending on the circumstances, for instance to ensure the 
affordability of services. Furthermore central government has the obligation to develop an 
overall strategy on how to fully realize the rights to water and sanitation. Hence in 
Thailand, central government remains obliged to ensure that local governments have the 
necessary financial, human and other resources to regulate their activities and to monitor 
and control their performance. 
</p>
<p>10. The National Human Rights Commission of Thailand has a mandate to receive 
complaints related to economic, social and cultural rights, and it has filed several cases on 
alleged violations of human rights related to water and sanitation. The Commission can, 
when it finds that any provision of a law, by-law, order or any other administrative act 
affects human rights and creates a question of constitutionality, refer the matter to the 
Constitutional Court or Administrative Court, together with its own opinion about the case. 
In appropriate cases and in the public interest, the Commission can file a lawsuit before the 
Court of Justice on behalf of the injured person to find a solution to the human rights 
violation.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Water 
</b></p>
<p>11. According to the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority Act of 1967 and the Provincial 
Waterworks Authority Act of 1979, State enterprises under the Ministry of Interior &#8211; the 
Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) and the Provincial Waterworks Authority 
(PWA) &#8211; provide piped water, their waterworks covering a little over 20 per cent of the 
households across the country located mainly in urban areas. Local authorities are 
responsible for the supply of both piped and non-piped water to the rest of the population. 
In the eastern region, a private company (Eastern Water Resources Development and 
Management Public Company Limited (East Water) established by PWA in 1992) operates 
and provides raw water and other water supplies for industrial usage in the Eastern 
Seaboard, comprising seven provinces.  
</p>
<p>12. Another State enterprise, the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand, attached to the 
Ministry of Industry, is responsible for implementing the Government&#8217;s industrial 
development policy, including the control and monitoring of industrial pollution.  
</p>
<p>13 The Ministry of Public Health sets basic minimum water quality standards and 
carries out some limited sampling of tap water, rainwater and bottled water.  
</p>
<p>14. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment monitors the situation of some 
of the groundwater and surface water sources.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>15. According to the Public Health Act, local governments have the power and duty to 
collect and dispose of sewage in their respective areas. The Act further provides for local 
authorities to issue a licence to private entities for the disposal of sewage. The Department 
of Public Works and Town and Country Planning of the Ministry of the Interior is 
responsible for controlling the construction standards of wastewater treatment systems by 
local authorities.  
</p>
<p>16. The Department of Health of the Ministry of Public Health is currently drafting a 
ministerial regulation defining the standards of septic tanks. While the Public Health Act </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>states that the Minister of Public Health shall be in charge of and control the execution of 
the Act and that it shall have powers to appoint public health officials and issue ministerial 
regulations, Ministry officials told the Special Rapporteur that they do not have enough 
human and financial resources to ensure monitoring and implementation of their guidelines 
and regulations at the local level.  
</p>
<p>17. According to the National Environmental Quality Act, the Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environment regulates sewage and wastewater, as well as the quality of 
groundwater resources and surface water. A State enterprise under the Ministry, the 
Wastewater Management Authority, in cooperation with local authorities, is responsible for 
wastewater treatment.  
</p>
<p>18. The Ministry of Finance supervises the performance of State enterprises. In the case 
of MWA and PWA, their performance is evaluated every year against 18-19 criteria, 
including, among others, water quality, the number of water breakdowns and the leakage 
level. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Budget 
</b></p>
<p>19. As at 2009, the nominal income per capita in Thailand was US$ 4,115 and the 
State&#8217;s annual water budget per capita was US$ 30. The annual sanitation budget per capita 
was not available.3 While the Special Rapporteur did not receive updated information on 
the national and local budgets allocated for water and sanitation, she was informed that 45 
per cent of the profits that MWA and PWA make are credited as Government revenue. It is 
important for such revenues to be appropriately invested for maintenance and other 
necessary measures to ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to water and 
sanitation for all in Thailand.<b> </b>It is crucial that the national and local budgets adequately 
account for the amount of expenditures in the sector and for how, where and by whom 
expenditures in the water and sanitation sector will be allocated. The Government should 
also ensure that funding to the sector is reported by all those concerned, including donors, 
private providers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in order to obtain a 
complete picture of the resources allocated to the sector and how they are being used. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The human rights to water and sanitation in Thailand 
</b></p>
<p>20. Thailand has achieved 96 per cent coverage of improved drinking water sources and 
93 per cent coverage of improved sanitation in 2011, according to global monitoring of the 
situation of access to water and sanitation.4 While access to drinking water in the central 
provinces was above 98 per cent, in the southern provinces it was almost 20 per cent lower. 
These figures, however, do not portray an accurate picture of the real situation that the 
Special Rapporteur observed in the country, because current global monitoring does not 
measure quality, quantity or affordability of access to water and sanitation. The Special 
Rapporteur also learned that national monitoring excludes stateless people, refugees, 
undocumented migrants or migrants in an irregular situation &#8211; including sex workers &#8211; and 
those in informal settlements. Several million people are thus left out of the statistics.

<p>21. In Thailand, as a result of the Government&#8217;s consolidated efforts to improve rural 
sanitation and public health, the number of deaths caused by diarrhoea has decreased 
significantly since the late 1990s. This was a result of strong political will combined with 
targeted actions by the Government. Surprisingly, according to the Government, from 2000 
to 2009 the number of diarrhoea cases witnessed an opposite trend and increased by 31 per 
cent.5 This may have been caused by unsafe water, inappropriate management of human 
faeces and a lack of hygiene practices &#8211; this will be analysed further below. 
</p>
<p>22. Significant progress was made in terms of access to public toilets as well. Whereas 
the rate of access to clean public toilets in 2006 was 9 per cent, it is now already above 62 
per cent. This is another sign that when there is political will and vision, immense progress 
can be achieved in the country. The Special Rapporteur visited and used one of the public 
&#8220;Happy Toilets&#8221; and was very positively impressed by its level of cleanliness. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Invisibility of people caught in a protection gap 
</b></p>
<p>23. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur was struck by the contrast in access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation between modern cities under rapid development and left-
behind areas such as migrant workers&#8217; camps, hill tribes and informal settlements. Despite 
the progress which has benefited the majority of the population, a significant number of 
people are left behind due to their personal status, since the current structure of water and 
sanitation supply only covers the registered population.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>24. There are reportedly as many as 3 million migrant workers in Thailand mainly from 
bordering countries, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, the majority of whom are in an 
irregular situation, and many of whom are accompanied by their families, including 
children. They make up as much as 10 per cent of the national workforce.6 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about access to water and sanitation for 
migrants, in particular migrant workers in an irregular situation. She visited a migrant 
construction workers&#8217; camp in Chiang Mai. Access to water and sanitation in the camp was 
</p>
<p>far below the standard set by the Building Control Act (1979) which requires any building 
to have water and proper systems for wastewater collection and solid and human waste 
management as per the established standards.7 The camp visited only had 10 non-sex-
segregated toilets and 1 open bathing point. These were shared by the nearly 300 workers, 
including 70 women, as well as by 40 children living in the camp. This situation 
contravenes the normative content of the rights to water and sanitation &#8211; these migrants 
suffer not only from a lack of access to sufficient water and sanitation, but also from stigma 
and denial of privacy and dignity. When the Special Rapporteur asked one migrant worker 
how she bathed in the open bathing point especially during menstruation, she said: &#8220;I just 
</p>
<p>shut my eyes and wash myself as quickly as possible, so that it is done.&#8221; The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was also surprised to learn that the women in the camp needed to spend 10 per 
cent of their daily wage on sanitary napkins &#8211; this is explained due to the fact that migrants

</p>

identified drinking water as a major source of infection.  
</p>
<p> 6 Human Rights Watch, <i>From the Tiger to the Crocodile: Abuse of Migrant Workers in Thailand</i> 
(February 2010), p. 6.  
</p>
<p> 7 Female workers in the camp are allegedly paid 140 Thai baht per day while the minimum wage in 
Thailand is 300 baht. Four sanitary napkins cost from 12 to 16 baht.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.3

</b></p>
<p>in irregular situations receive a salary that is below the national minimum wage set by law, 
although the Government explained that they can file a complaint to the Provincial Labour 
Protection and Welfare Officers if they receive less than the minimum wage. In addition, 
these families have to incur additional expenses since they are forced to buy purified water, 
as the water they are provided with by their employers is not safe to drink. It is the 
employer&#8217;s responsibility, from a human rights perspective, to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore State authorities have an obligation to monitor compliance with the law and 
punish any violations of the law. According to information received by the Special 
Rapporteur the situation on the construction site she visited is not unique in the country, 
and it rather reflects a pattern of indifference on behalf of the national authorities regarding 
the situation of migrant workers in an irregular situation.  
</p>
<p>26. Migrant sex workers also experience difficulty accessing water and sanitation. Since 
prostitution is illegal in Thailand under the Prevention and Suppression of Prostitution Act 
(1996), migrant sex workers in irregular situations are doubly vulnerable to a denial of 
human rights as they have to hide themselves from society: they are in an irregular situation 
and practising an illegal profession. These circumstances put sex workers at a high risk of 
abuse from their employers. A civil society representative told the Special Rapporteur that 
sex workers were often charged by their employer for use of a bathroom after they 
performed their services, while their clients were provided with clean bathrooms. Such a 
condition might lead to situations where sex workers refrain from washing themselves after 
serving a client so as to save money. This creates potential hygiene concerns, and affects 
sex workers&#8217; right to sanitation, including hygiene. The right to sanitation has to be 
accessible in all spheres of a person&#8217;s life, including in the workplace. The Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights specified that, with regard to the right to healthy 
natural and workplace environments, &#8220;&#8216;[t]he improvement of all aspects of environmental 
and industrial hygiene&#8217; (art. 12.2 (b)) comprises, <i>inter alia</i> &#8230; the requirement to ensure an 
adequate supply of safe and potable water and basic sanitation &#8230; [and it embraces] safe 
</p>
<p>and hygienic working conditions&#8221;.8 Furthermore International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Convention No. 120 (1964) concerning Hygiene in Commerce and Offices provides that 
&#8220;[s]ufficient and suitable washing facilities and sanitary conveniences shall be provided and 
properly maintained&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>27. In Thailand, there are no comprehensive data available on the indigenous population 
and the term &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; is not officially recognized under the Thai Constitution 
and relevant legislation, but it is estimated that between 600,000 and 1.2 million indigenous 
peoples (approximately 1-2 per cent of the total population) live in Thailand, especially in 
forests, mountains or on the sea coast. The Department of Welfare and Social Development 
has recorded 3,429 hill tribe villages with 93,257 villagers.  
</p>
<p>28. Over 60 per cent of Thailand was forested 60 years ago, but today forests represent 
only 28.4 per cent of the land.9 As economic and industrial development in the country 
advances and forest areas are reduced, indigenous peoples have faced eviction, including 
forced eviction, as well as limitations in access to and availability of natural resources upon 
which they depend, including water. The indigenous peoples&#8217; right to the conservation and 
</p>
<p>protection of the environment recognized under the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples is of particular importance to them because of the &#8220;special 
</p>

</p>
<p>the highest attainable standard of health, para. 15.

</i></p>

<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>ties&#8221; that they &#8220;maintain with the natural habits of the territories in which they live&#8221;.10 In 
this connection, the Government has announced that it is pushing forward with passing a 
Community Rights Act to protect the management of natural resources (land, water, forests 
and sea) by communities themselves,11 which is a positive policy. The implementation of 
such an act, if adopted, will be key, and its implementation should include awareness-
raising among indigenous peoples on the law and on their rights, overcoming the language 
barrier so that they fully understand their rights.  
</p>
<p>29. The lack of citizenship of many indigenous peoples bars their access to water and 
sanitation as well to other basic services like health care and education. Approximately 30 
per cent (296,000) of indigenous peoples lacked citizenship as at 2011,12 due to a complex 
process which requires them to produce birth certificates or other registration which they 
usually do not have, as well as money and time. Indigenous peoples often live in remote 
areas which makes access to water more difficult. The Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) noted that access to sanitation and water by rural 
and hill tribes, in particular women, is a concern.13 In one of the hill tribes near the border 
with Myanmar, for instance, the Special Rapporteur was informed that stateless people and 
people without Thai nationality had not even been counted during the national census 
survey. This fact contributes to a higher coverage rate of access to water and sanitation in 
the records than in reality. In their village, women and girls fetch water from three 
reservoirs and need to queue for three hours during the dry season because there is not 
enough water available. This restricts their access to other rights including education and 
work. Schools also run out of water during the dry season, and a teacher shared the view 
that toilets would be kept cleaner if enough water were available. In addition, there has 
reportedly been a stigma attached to some hill tribes labelled as &#8220;drug addicts&#8221;, and such 
stigma has justified denial of their access to basic services. Some of the villagers, for 
instance, still go to the forest to defecate in the open, while others dig big holes in which 
they relieve themselves.

<p>30. In Thailand 10 per cent of families in urban areas reportedly live in informal 
settlements and a large proportion of families have problems accessing basic services, 
including water and sanitation.14 There have been efforts to improve urban conditions on 
the part of the Government, civil society and international organizations, and many people 
in informal settlements have gained access to basic water and sanitation.15 During her 
mission, the Special Rapporteur visited one of the informal settlements on the outskirts of 
Bangkok where people &#8211; after struggling for the past 10 years &#8211; had finally managed to get 
connected, as a group, to MWA. She was, however, surprised to learn that the water tariff 
for industries applied to these households because they were connected as a group of almost

<p>30 households. This means that these visibly very poor people pay 2.5 times more per cubic 
metre than an individual private household. This situation makes the price of water 
unaffordable for this group of people who live in a very precarious economic situation. 
Moreover, even though connected to the water network, many people opt for buying big 
containers of water for drinking, as they are not sure about the quality of tap water. The cost 
of bottled water is even higher than tap water, a situation that raises affordability concerns 
and  clearly discriminates against this group of people. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>31. There are currently over 262,000 prisoners in 143 prisons in Thailand.16 Both civil 
society and prison authorities informed the Special Rapporteur that prisons in Thailand, in 
particular women&#8217;s prisons, are overcrowded. The occupancy rate is 231 per cent, which 
makes them the ninth most crowded prisons in the world and the third in Asia.17 This 
inevitably causes overcrowding of sanitation and hygiene facilities.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur visited the Central Women Correctional Institution in 
Bangkok in order to assess the way in which the inmates enjoyed their human rights to 
water and sanitation. She regrets the fact that private interviews with inmates could not be 
arranged by the authorities and that she could not visit all sectors of the prison as she had 
requested. The Special Rapporteur again regrets that she could not meet with prisoners 
sentenced to heavy penalties, including those on death row. Although the Special 
Rapporteur received information from the Government regarding conditions of detention as 
well as from civil society organizations, in order for her to be able to undertake an impartial 
assessment of the situation, it was indispensable to be able to talk to inmates in privacy and 
not limit the visit to the observation of sanitized empty cells and toilets.   
</p>
<p>33. Although the Special Rapporteur was not given an opportunity to collect first-hand 
information from the inmates, it was still evident that the prison was overcrowded, and also 
that access to showers and toilets did not comply with human rights requirements of respect 
for privacy and dignity. The showers and toilets were open, without doors or curtains both 
for men and women. According to interviews with women prisoners conducted by a civil 
society organization in 2011, the shower time is &#8220;the most tense and stressful part of the 
</p>
<p>day as one must compete with others for a limited water supply. The time to shower is also 
limited&#8221;.18 The organization also raised concerns about there being no doors to the toilets 
and observed that it takes time for a woman prisoner to get used to such lack of privacy. In 
contrast, when the Special Rapporteur asked a prison official whether it was not 
embarrassing for the women to defecate and urinate in sight of dozens of other inmates and 
prison guards, the answer she received was simply that: &#8220;After one month they get used to 
it.&#8221; The lack of access to sanitation in conditions of safety and dignity can be tantamount to 
inhuman or degrading treatment especially in the context of detention. Therefore, the 
Government must adopt urgent measures to ensure dignity and privacy in access to water 
and sanitation, including hygiene, for all inmates. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the observation made to Thailand by the Human 
Rights Committee in 2005, in which it stated its concern &#8220;at the overcrowding and general 
conditions of places of detention, particularly with regard to sanitation and access to health 
care and adequate food&#8221;.19. She also reaffirms the recommendation made then to &#8220;guarantee 
the right of detainees to be treated humanely and with respect for their dignity, particularly

<p>with regard to hygienic conditions&#8221;20 and calls on the Government to guarantee that the 
exercise of the right to sanitation is ensured in conditions of privacy.  
</p>
<p>35. The Government of Thailand has been making efforts to ensure the right to water in 
prisons, based on a policy to provide 5 litres of drinking water and 45 litres of water for 
other purposes per inmate per day. The prison authorities filter the tap water and test 
coliforms in the water. They also carry out awareness-raising on hygiene. The authorities of 
the Central Women Correctional Institution explained that each inmate receives a hygiene 
kit containing, among other things, a bar of soap, toothpaste and 10 sanitary napkins per 
month, additional sanitary napkins needing to be requested if those provided are 
insufficient. It is reported that such a kit is provided to an inmate on death row only once in 
six months,21 which is a practice obviously contravening the principle of non-
discrimination, moreover raising severe hygiene concerns.  
</p>
<p>36. The marginalized people that the Special Rapporteur met during her mission 
represent a significant number of people living in Thailand. Every individual, regardless of 
national origin, race, language and status, is equally entitled to the human rights to water 
and sanitation. The Committee on the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that: 
&#8220;The ground of nationality should not bar access to Covenant rights&#8230; The Covenant rights 
apply to everyone including non-nationals, such as refugees, asylum-seekers, stateless 
persons, migrant workers and victims of international trafficking, regardless of legal status 
and documentation.&#8221;22 People&#8217;s status cannot be used as a pretext to deny them access to 
water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur also recalls that experience in seeking to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has shown that &#8220;trickle-down&#8221; effects cannot be 
expected in development. Without specific, direct and targeted measures to address the 
most disadvantaged and marginalized groups of people, development may never reach 
them. Hence, instead of focusing on low-hanging fruit, the Government should make an 
additional effort to target the above-mentioned groups of people. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Water quality 
</b></p>
<p>38. Quality is fundamental to the human right to water. This means that drinking water 
should not put human health in danger. In Thailand this requirement is partially met, but a 
large proportion of the country&#8217;s population has no assurances in that regard. During her 
mission, the Special Rapporteur observed that Thai people do not trust tap water. This 
might be one reason why almost 30 per cent of the population rely on bottled water as their 
main source of drinking water, while 39 per cent of tap-water drinkers have the water 
filtered first and 16 per cent have it boiled before drinking it.23 The high prevalence of 
diarrhoea might further explain why people avoid drinking tap water. Information on water 
quality is not easily available either.  
</p>
<p>39. The water quality standards in Thailand were set in 2000 by the Department of 
Health. They are based on, but are less strict than, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality as, according to the Ministry of Public Health, some 
parameters were not relevant to the Thai context. MWA in Bangkok and PWA in other 
cities have their own water standards. Clients of MWA and PWA benefit from water

<p>provision that meets quality requirements at the water plant and in the main pipes. While 
the quality control they undertake complies with high standards, there are cases where 
cracks in pipes and low pressure could cause water contamination by allowing infusion of 
external substances, including wastewater, particularly in locations far from the water 
plants. Uncertainties regarding the quality of the water exist at the tap level because there is 
no State entity mandated to monitor quality at the drinking point inside the household. 
Sometimes household pipes are old and no repairs are done since this is each household&#8217;s 
responsibility. Often households illegally install water pumps or boosters connected to the 
water pipes to increase the water pressure particularly in apartments or buildings &#8211; these do 
not only suck water, but in case of cracks in the pipes, also bring dirt into the pipes. 
Occasionally water filters are not adequately maintained at the household level. These 
circumstances lead to possible interference with water quality standards.  
</p>
<p>40. In Thailand, the Ministry of Public Health has overall responsibility for ensuring the 
quality of drinking water. According to the Ministry, most of the tap-water samples taken in 
2008 and 2010 did not meet the drinking-water standards set by the Department of Health, 
apart from some sampled water produced by the Public Waterworks Authority.24 According 
to the sampling only 40 per cent of municipal water and 20 per cent of water provided by 
subdistrict authorities was safe. Also a large portion of the random testing of water quality 
in schools and at street food vending stalls conducted by the Department of Health did not 
meet drinking-water standards.25 
</p>
<p>41. According to estimates based on limited sampling by the Ministry of Public Health, 
the current rate of access to safe water both in rural and urban areas is roughly half of the 
target. It is welcoming that Thailand is not satisfied with targets set under the MDGs for 
water &#8211; which is silent regarding water quality &#8211; and has set the bar higher by aiming to 
cover 80 per cent of the people living in urban areas and 50 per cent of the people living in 
rural areas with safe drinking water by 2015. This is a good example of the progressive 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights as the Government has a concrete plan to 
gradually achieve the full realization of the human right to water. The Ministry of Public 
Health, however, is not given enough means to achieve this goal as it only has financial and 
human capacities to carry out sampling of water quality on a very limited scale. 
</p>
<p>42. The Department of Groundwater Resources of the Ministry of Natural Resources 
and Environment manages the development of groundwater resources and carries out 
regular monitoring of them. According to the Ministry, the majority of major wells in 
Bangkok are monitored systematically on a monthly basis, including for water level and 
quality. It is important to monitor and conserve the quality of groundwater for a sustainable 
supply of safe drinking water in particular during emergencies, like droughts. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the systematic monitoring of groundwater at the observation well she 
visited in Bangkok. She was also encouraged by the initiative of the Government to expand 
such groundwater monitoring mechanisms outside Bangkok for monitoring and preserving 
vulnerable water resources.  
</p>
<p>43. Despite the steady expansion of the water network there is a growing tendency to 
rely on bottled water in Thailand, which is not only a concern from an affordability and 
availability point of view, but also a serious environmental problem. According to a study, 
Thailand is ranked as one of the top 10 countries both in per-capita bottled water 
consumption (114 litres per person per year in 2010)26 and in bottled water consumption by

<p>country.27 It is estimated that 3 litres of water are needed to produce a bottle of 1 litre of 
water), and bottled water is much more expensive than tap water.28 An enormous amount of 
plastic bottles has a negative impact on the environment, also because manufacturing, 
recycling and incinerating bottles uses energy and fuel. In this connection, it was 
encouraging to witness a campaign to promote tap water by PWA and the Ministry of 
Public Health through expanding the tap water coverage area across the country, small- 
scale sampling of water quality and awareness-raising on the safety and affordable price of 
tap water. Such a promotional activity should come with accessible and accurate 
information on the quality of water. The Special Rapporteur also encourages civil society 
not to be satisfied with bottled water as the primary source of safe drinking water as it is not 
a sustainable solution. The human right to water is not met if people living in Thailand have 
no other choice but to buy costly bottled water.   
</p>
<p>44. MWA and PWA are State enterprises permitted to make a profit. They adopt a 
cross-subsidy tariff mechanism. For the consumption range of 0-10 cubic metres per month, 
MWA charges 8.5 baht per cubic metre for domestic water, and 9.5 baht per cubic metre for 
commerce, government agencies, State enterprises and industry. PWA charges 10.20 baht 
per cubic metre for domestic users, 16 baht for the Government and small-scale businesses; 
and 18 baht for State enterprises and industries. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion 
that the profits made by MWA and PWA should be kept within the sector for further 
investment in maintenance, expansion, upgrades and other necessary measures. She also 
recommends that the Government of Thailand monitor the quality of drinking water inside 
households and create a system, like a revolving fund aimed at enabling the reparation of 
pipes inside households and buildings, so as to ensure drinking-water quality. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Safe disposal of sewage and wastewater management 
</b></p>
<p>45. The progress that Thailand has made over the last 50 years in relation to access to 
sanitation, especially basic rural sanitation, is impressive. Whereas its coverage rate was 
below 1 per cent in 1960, it rapidly rose to near universal coverage of the registered 
population by 1999. While the Government&#8217;s objective was to reach a high coverage rate, 
the current challenge is to ensure quality, as well as safe disposal and treatment of human 
waste &#8211; which are essential measures to realize the right to sanitation. Deficient sludge 
collection and disposal, as well as lack of wastewater treatment are issues of particular 
concern. Safe disposal of the faeces of children between 0 and 2 years old was only 64.6 
per cent.29 These circumstances explain the increasing rate of diarrhoea morbidity in the 
country.  
</p>
<p>46. In Thailand, wastewater management is under the responsibility of the local 
authorities. According to the Wastewater Management Authority, a State enterprise, only 
20 per cent of local authorities have wastewater treatment plants and only 20 per cent of 
total domestic wastewater is treated. In the city of Bangkok, the Bangkok Metropolitan 
Administration only treats 40 per cent of the wastewater, dumping the remaining 60 per 
cent directly into the canals with only initial treatment. About 40 to 50 regional officers of 
the Pollution Control Department monitor the negative impact of untreated wastewater on

<p>surface water by sampling, and according to government officials, building of treatment 
plants will be a priority in areas where such a negative impact has been detected.  
</p>
<p>47. The collection of the contents of septic tanks falls under the responsibility of the 
local authorities according to Ministry of Public Health regulations. A high percentage of 
households in Bangkok still rely on septic tanks. The high population density in the capital 
city, the high water table and septic tanks with open bottoms might lead to water 
contamination. Furthermore, in other areas of the country, licensed vacuum trucks are 
supposed to collect the sludge or septage contained in septic tanks and dispose of it at 
designated places for adequate treatment. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
that there was very poor control of the trucks by the competent local governments, that the 
majority of trucks operate freely without the necessary licence and that they often simply 
dump collected untreated sludge anywhere in the vicinity of the city. Reportedly, some 
local governments have received complaints from the people about unsanitary transport and 
unsafe disposal of septage, but they do not have the capacity to provide adequate collection 
or treatment services. According to the Public Health Act, the local government has powers 
to issue local provisions on a rate of maximum charges collectable by the persons obtaining 
a licence. However, illegal private vacuum trucks often charge people prices that are not 
affordable to low-income families. Since the number of licensed vacuum trucks is 
insufficient, illegal trucks are needed especially in times of flooding, when people are 
forced to hire them. In the hill tribe in the north-eastern area, for instance, the villagers 
declared that a Thai ethnic group which collects sludge charges 200 baht (US$ 7) per septic 
tank. In that village, the average annual income of people is of about 80,000 baht 
(approximately US$ 2,730) and poor people earn only 10,000 baht (US$ 342). Hence 
desludging their septic tank can be very expensive, representing a considerable percentage 
of the household income.  
</p>
<p>48. Regarding wastewater, the Ministry of Interior issued a ministerial regulation for the 
imposition of a wastewater tariff in 2004 based on the Enhancement and Conservation of 
National Environmental Quality Act (1992). A tariff was set at between 2 and 5 baht per 
cubic metre. Each household is charged 60 baht (US$ 2) per month and hotels or other 
business entities are charged a higher tariff. The imposition of a tariff is intended to provide 
the necessary funds for expansion of the sewerage system and maintenance and operation 
of the existing systems. The Act allows for penalties in case of lack of treatment and 
disposal of untreated wastewater, but in reality the local authorities do not have the capacity 
to police illegal disposal and the penalty is not enforced.  
</p>
<p>49. One of the significant challenges is the legal and institutional separation of powers 
over septage, sewage and wastewater falling under the Ministry of Public Health and the 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, operated by the local authorities. The 
management of septage, sewage and wastewater is physically connected, and it needs a 
comprehensive policy, plan and executive bodies. It is recommended that both ministries 
take a more coordinated approach to the management of septage, sewage and wastewater 
and provide the necessary support and supervision to the local authorities who manage 
them on the ground. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Water pollution by industrial projects 
</b></p>
<p>50. According to water quality monitoring in major rivers and lakes conducted by the 
Pollution Control Department, the number of surface water sources with very good or 
medium quality is decreasing, while the number of surface water sources with deteriorating </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>quality is on the rise.30 It is a serious concern that water pollution is being exacerbated by 
faecal coliform, and also by large-scale industrial, mining and agricultural projects which 
have had a severe impact on the environment in general, and on water sources, including 
drinking-water sources in particular. According to official data produced by the Industrial 
Estate Authority, the amount of toxic chemicals and hazardous substances used has 
increased significantly over the last few years. While the Industrial Works Department is 
competent to license waste-disposal plants to dispose of chemical substances, such licensed 
plants still dump waste in inappropriate places and contaminate the environment.31 In terms 
of agriculture, there are currently no clear regulations on hazardous waste management in 
the agricultural sector.32 WHO estimated that: &#8220;Enforceable standards have yet to be set for 
permissible levels of hazardous chemicals in food, water and the environment. An effective 
surveillance system must also be established to monitor compliance with standards and be 
directly linked to enforcement and punitive action when violations are detected.&#8221;33 The 
Ministry of Public Health registers an increasing number of chemical poisoning cases 
caused by both the agricultural and industrial use of hazardous chemicals.34 Many civil 
society organizations and journalists also talked to the Special Rapporteur about several 
recent cases of severe pollution by industrial or mining activities, which caused death, 
blindness and other serious sicknesses. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Environmental impact assessments 
</b></p>
<p>51. In Thailand, environmental impact assessments (EIA) are required for 35 types of 
development project and activities of any government agency, State enterprise or private 
entity that are likely to have an environmental impact under the 1992 Enhancement and 
Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act and the relevant Notification of the 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. EIA reports, usually prepared by 
consultancy firms registered with the Ministry, are submitted to the Office of Natural 
Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP) for preliminary review, and 
then to the Expert Review Committee for the final decision. The ONEP Environmental 
Impact Evaluation Bureau is mandated to review EIA reports and other documents 
submitted within 30 days from the date of receiving the reports. According to the 
Government, the Bureau has 73 staff members, and on average, the total number of projects 
submitted for EIA approval is around 282 per year.35 During her mission, the Special 
Rapporteur received complaints that the review of EIA reports was limited to a brief desk 
review by government officials with no meaningful on-site visits, despite a relatively well-
staffed bureau. Several NGOs the Special Rapporteur met with affirmed that often these 
reviews were a simple formality given the lack of capacity on the part of the governmental 
entities to critically examine them.  
</p>
<p>52. A guideline on EIA reports developed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Environment states that these must include &#8220;results of the environmental study in its present 
state, its value to human life quality&#8221;.36. On water specifically, source, quantity, quality,

<p>flow rate of surface and groundwater must be studied. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed, however, that no baseline data on water quality are usually available because no 
examination of water bodies is carried out before permission is granted for activities. Hence 
it is very difficult to assess whether subsequent pollution of water bodies is due to 
industrial, mining or agricultural activities.  
</p>
<p>53. Participation in the EIA process of people likely to be affected is not clearly defined 
either in the Act or the ministerial guidelines, while the Act provides that individual persons 
may be accorded the right &#8220;[t]o be informed and obtain information and data from the 
government service in matters concerning the enhancement and conservation of 
environmental quality...&#8221;. While the relevant Notifications of the Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environment on EIAs state that public hearings have to be held, the public 
has no access to draft EIA reports and they can only see the approved EIA reports. The 
Government has no obligation to respond to public concerns either. 
</p>
<p>54. Public hearings are required only for 11 types of large-scale project. Civil society 
informed the Special Rapporteur that companies try to avoid public hearings by naming the 
projects differently or designing projects to be just below the size that requires a public 
hearing. Even when a public hearing is held, it seems that the affected populations do not 
always participate, either because they are not informed in advance to prepare themselves, 
they are required to register on the Internet beforehand or they do not realize how such 
projects will affect their health or access to safe water, food and environment, again owing 
to a lack of information. When a public hearing was held in November 2012 on the 
expansion of a gold mine, for example, only those who had registered in advance were 
allowed to participate in the public hearing. The villagers affected, however, claimed that 
they had not been notified of the need for registration and hence had not been allowed to 
participate. There were apparently many military and police officials deployed to secure the 
site as well, so as to ensure that people who failed to register within the established deadline 
did not attend the meeting. Another example is a dam project in north-east Thailand about 
which the villagers affected were not consulted nor were they involved in decision-making 
at the early stages. The World Commission on Dams estimated that &#8220;[e]xclusion of affected 
people from the decision-making process gave rise to protracted protests, demonstrations 
and confrontations&#8221;.37 
</p>
<p><b> B. Accountability and compensation 
</b></p>
<p>55. According to the Organization of Ministries, Sub-Ministries and Departments Act 
2002, the Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Environment monitors and examines the quality of the environment and annually reports on 
pollution conditions to the Pollution Control Committee and the National Environment 
Board. According to the Government, there are currently 489 sampling stations, 392 of 
which monitor surface sources and 97 of which monitor groundwater sources in 25 river 
basins. Water quality samples are taken four times a year for surface water and twice a year 
for groundwater. In addition, there are at least 44 automatic water sampling and monitoring 
stations on major rivers in Thailand.  
</p>
<p>56. The Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act 
provides the right &#8220;to be remedied or compensated by the State in case damage or injury is 
sustained as a consequence of dangers arisen from contamination by pollutants &#8230; caused 
by any activity or project initiated, supported or undertaken by government agency or state

Natural Resources and Environment and the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand, 
monitors compliance with environmental standards. The Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Environment is authorized to take action only after a problem is detected. Furthermore the 
criminal penalty against industrial companies is very light as illustrated in the case 
mentioned below, and does not provide any efficient disincentive for polluters. On the other 
hand, people affected have themselves to prove the actual damage in order to receive 
compensation, which is particularly difficult when baseline data on the environmental 
situation are usually unavailable. As such, the accountability mechanism to protect the 
environment and hence to protect the well-being of the people concerned is weak.  
</p>
<p>57. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur received information on the lack of 
accountability cases related to pollution, especially those caused by large-scale 
development projects. One of them was the Klity Creek case in Kanchanaburi province on 
the Thai-Myanmar border, which was the first case in which the Supreme Administrative 
Court ordered the Pollution Control Department to pay compensation to the victims of 
water pollution. In 1967, a lead mining company and treatment factory initiated its 
activities upstream from Klity village. In the late 1970s, the villagers noticed that the water 
in the creek had become murky and putrid and that their fish and cattle had started to die. In 
1998, the Department of Mineral Resources of the Ministry of Industry ordered the closure 
of the company because of the illegal discharge of sewage and lead sediments from its 
tailing pond into the Klity Creek, and it fined the operator 2,000 baht (about US$ 67) which 
was the maximum penalty stipulated in the 1967 Minerals Act. The year 1998 was the first 
time that some of the villagers had managed to accede to the hospital, 100 km away, for a 
health check-up and they realized that they had been suffering from lead poisoning. By this 
point, one villager had allegedly died and one had gone blind. In 2004, 22 villagers, victims 
of lead poisoning, filed a complaint before the Central Administrative Court against the 
Pollution Control Department, and in 2008, the Court ruled that the Department was guilty 
of negligence for having being slow in preventing further damage from the lead 
contamination and ordered the Department to pay compensation of 33,783 baht 
(approximately US$ 1,100). In January 2013, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the 
lower Court&#8217;s ruling, but ordered an increased compensation of 177,199 baht (US$ 5,900) 
per victim.  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Pollution Control Department had not 
cleaned up the creek to rehabilitate the contaminated water, claiming that the natural 
healing system would work, based on the conclusion made by the National Environment 
Committee in 2005. According to a study conducted by civil society organizations in May 
2012, however, the lead levels in water near the mining area were mostly lower than the 
national standard, but the lead levels in the riverbed were much higher than the standard at 
the processing plant point and down to a 11.5 km downstream point.38 Since the lead level 
had never been measured before the industry had started, it appears difficult to prove the 
natural level of lead in this creek. According to the Supreme Court&#8217;s verdict, the 
Department must come up with a plan for rehabilitating the creek water as well as a remedy 
for drinking water, among others, during the rehabilitation process. The Government should 
act immediately according to its plan to clean up the lead-contaminated sediment between 
2013 and 2016 to ensure the villagers&#8217; access to safe drinking water.  
</p>
<p>  
 38 According to a study conducted by Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the Wants and two 
</p>
<p>other organizations, the lead levels of the riverbed soil were 3,595 mm per kg at processing plant 
point and 4,082 mm per kg at a point 11.5 km down from the plant while the national standard is less 
than 30 mm per kg.   </p>

<p>59. Participation, access to information and other procedural rights inform policies and 
development projects for the affected populations and at the same time these rights ensure 
better protection of their human rights to water and sanitation, as well as health. This is 
particularly the case with environmental issues. The rights to information and petition are 
guaranteed by the Constitution of Thailand. The Constitution further provides that: &#8220;The 
State shall organise public consultation thoroughly before the making of social, economic, 
politic and cultural development plan, the expropriation of immovable property, the making 
of town and country planning, the determination of land use, and the enactment of rule 
which may affect material interest of the public.&#8221;39 The implementation of such rights is 
still relatively new to Thailand, and is carried out in a restrictive manner. &#8220;Participation 
must be active, free and meaningful and thus needs to go beyond mere consultation and 
provision of information. It requires a genuine opportunity to express demands and 
concerns and influence decisions. It is also crucial for all concerned individuals, groups and 
communities to be able to take part or be represented in participatory processes. In 
particular, the inclusion of women must be ensured. Failing to do so may undermine a 
project.&#8221;40 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur calls on Thailand to create a fully 
independent environment or water and sanitation regulator. This issue will be developed 
further below. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Monitoring and accountability mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>60. As noted above, the lack of systematic independent monitoring of drinking water 
quality and water resources, as well as of wastewater management is one of the crucial 
defects in the water and sanitation provision system in Thailand. The absence of any 
regulation of water tariffs and the lack of implementation of the wastewater tariff regulation 
are also concerns in relation to the affordability of services.  
</p>
<p>61. Human rights impose three types of obligation on States parties: obligations to 
respect, to protect and to fulfil. With regard to water, the obligation to protect requires 
&#8220;State parties to prevent third parties from interfering in any way with the enjoyment of the 
right to water&#8221;.41 This obligation requires the adoption of all necessary measures to restrain 
third parties from, inter alia, denying equal access to adequate water, polluting or 
inequitably extracting water from water resources, including natural sources, wells and 
other water distribution systems. In the case of sanitation, States must ensure that non-State 
players act in accordance with human rights obligations, including through the adoption of 
legislative and other measures to prevent the negative impact of non-State players on the 
enjoyment of sanitation. Such abuses can be avoided through the creation of an effective 
regulatory system, which includes independent monitoring, genuine public participation 
and imposition of penalties for non-compliance.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur underlines the importance of establishing strong 
accountability mechanisms to ensure full compliance by all &#8211; including the private sector &#8211; 
with the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation. A transparent and 
comprehensive regulatory framework would help to reduce the potential for abuse, would 
ensure appropriate monitoring and regulation of the behaviour of water and sanitation 
service providers, as well as of companies, industries and the agricultural sector, make sure

<p>  
 39 Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand 2007, part 10, sect. 57.  
 40 Report of the independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, submitted to the Human Rights Council in 
2011 (A/HRC/15/31/Add.1), para. 49.  
</p>
<p> 41 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to

</b></p>
<p>they complied with environmental protection standards and the water quality was 
controlled. The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends the establishment of an 
adequately funded independent regulator, which would undertake independent monitoring 
of companies, industries and the agricultural sector with environmental protection 
standards, ensure genuine public participation and impose penalties for non-compliance. 
This independent regulator should also be given competence in terms of tariff-setting.   
</p>
<p>63. Progress towards the full realization of the human rights to water and sanitation 
cannot be sustainable unless it occurs within the context of a strong regulatory framework. 
National regulatory frameworks will make it easier to improve the remaining challenges in 
Thailand, such as setting clear targets and benchmarks for implementation; clarifying and 
harmonizing the responsibilities of those involved; setting minimum standards for quality, 
accessibility and affordability, and improving accountability by creating incentives for 
compliance. Effective regulation depends on the capacity to carry out regulatory functions. 
Regulation must be independent and shielded from political interference and control on 
behalf of specific groups or politicians. A transparent and comprehensive regulatory 
framework would help to reduce the potential for abuse.  
</p>
<p>64. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that a policy disconnect seems to 
exist between polluting activities and their ultimate impact on the safety of drinking water 
sources. The absence of an integrated policy and structure has generated enormous burdens, 
including detrimental health outcomes for individuals and communities. She recommends a 
holistic consideration of the right to water by factoring it into policies that have an impact 
on water quality, ranging from agricultural use of chemical products to mining activities. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> Thailand has an obligation to take steps towards the progressive realization of 
the human rights to water and sanitation. The Special Rapporteur commends 
</b></p>
<p><b>Thailand for the impressive progress achieved particularly in rural sanitation, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>has demonstrated its competence to continue its efforts towards fully realizing this 
</b></p>
<p><b>human right.  
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The Special Rapporteur reiterates that everyone is entitled to the human rights 
to water and sanitation, and status cannot exempt the State from its obligations to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure access to water and sanitation. Non-</b>discrimination and equality is a State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>immediate human rights obligation. In this regard, the Government is urged to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>affirmative action to reach </b>&#8220;<b>invisible</b>&#8221;<b> individuals caught in a protection gap, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including migrants, indigenous populations, informal settlement dwellers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prisoners.  
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> </b>One of the issues repeatedly drawn to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention 
<b>during the visit to Thailand was the disconnection between the laws, regulations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>by-laws, and their actual implementation. The lack of appropriate and independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring means that water and sanitation service providers remain to a large extent 
</b></p>
<p><b>unaccountable to the authorities and the users.  
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Thailand, which has been a 
leader in advocating the importance of water quality in the framework of the global 
</b></p>
<p><b>development agenda, and also a lead member of the Friends of Water Group in New 
</b></p>
<p><b>York, to promote the inclusion of quality and elimination of inequalities, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>other criteria, into the post-2015 water and sanitation global development agenda.  </b></p>

</b></p>
<p>69.<b> In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of 
Thailand: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Establish strong independent accountability mechanisms to ensure full 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance by all </b>&#8211;<b> including the private sector </b>&#8211;<b> with the human rights to safe
