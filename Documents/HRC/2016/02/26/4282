April 1999, 2000/82 of 26 April 2000, 2004/18 of 16 April 2004 and 2005/19 of 14 April 
2005, as well as Human Rights Council decision 2/109 of 27 November 2006 and 
resolutions 7/4 of 27 March 2008, 11/5 of 17 June 2009, and 14/4 of 17 June 2010, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the

duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto,

human rights, </p>

cultural rights of their people,
