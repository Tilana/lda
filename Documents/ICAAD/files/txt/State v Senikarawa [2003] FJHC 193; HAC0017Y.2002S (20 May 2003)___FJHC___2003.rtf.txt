JUDGMENT

I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up. The 3 assessors are unanimously of the opinion that the accused is guilty on each count. I find PW1 to be a credible and reliable witness and despite the lack of corroboration on Counts 1  3, I am satisfied of the guilt of the accused on each count as charged. I convict him accordingly.
