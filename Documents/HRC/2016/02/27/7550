<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-seventh session 
</b>Agenda item 2 
<b>Annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner  
for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the  
High Commissioner and the Secretary-General</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Follow-up review of the management and 
administration of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the Joint Inspection Unit 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 22/2, requested the Joint Inspection 
Unit to undertake a comprehensive follow-up review of the management and administration 
of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in particular 
with regard to its impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, and to 
submit a report thereon and containing concrete proposals for the implementation of 
resolution 22/2 to the Council at its twenty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p>2. The Joint Inspection Unit has informed the Secretariat that the review mandated by 
the Human Rights Council in its resolution 22/2 has been included in its programme of 
work for 2014, and is already well under way. It has also informed the Secretariat, however, 
that, given its own procedural requirements, it would not be feasible for the Unit to submit 
the results of the review to the Council at its twenty-seventh session, and that it will do so at 
the twenty-eighth. It has therefore requested the Secretariat to bring these circumstances to 
the attention of the Council. The President of the Council and the Office of the High 
Commissioner were informed thereof earlier in 2014.
