</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the principles of economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in 
international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the 2005 World 
Summit Outcome and General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which the 
Assembly established the Human Rights Council, all affirm that all human rights are 
universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and must be 
treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, and 
recalling also that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never 
exempt States from the promotion and protection of the other rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in which the Heads of 
State and Government affirmed their commitment to spare no effort to promote democracy 
and strengthen the rule of law, as well as respect for all internationally recognized human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> its resolutions on the question of the realization in all countries of 
economic, social and cultural rights, and the resolutions adopted by the Commission on 
Human Rights on the same topic, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the obligations and commitments to take steps, individually and through 
international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization 
of economic, social and cultural rights by all appropriate means, including particularly the 
adoption of legislative measures,
