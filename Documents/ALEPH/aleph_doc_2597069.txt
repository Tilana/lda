ZYL Limited (subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement) (ZYL, the “Company” or “parent entity”) is 
currently in administration, subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) signed on 19 February 2015. 
The DOCA is intended to satisfy creditors’ debts through the disposal of interests in the Kangwane Central 
Anthracite Project and other assets, while retaining the interest in the Kangwane South Anthracite Project. 
Before entering into the DOCA, ZYL was actively attempting to progress its Anthracite projects in South 
Africa.

Interim Financial Report 31 December 2013
Directors’ report (continued)
4.  REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Incomplete Financial Information
Due to turnover of previous staff and officers, and the parent entity being subject to external administration, 
complete accounting records have not been able to be located. For the half year ended 31 December 2013 
and since, this has led to insufficient information being available to support several material contracts as well 
as transactions and balances of subsidiaries.
The Directors are of the opinion that it is not possible to state that the financial statements and notes are in 
accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, due to the lack of records and certainty in 
connection with material transactions, for both the year ended 31 December 2013 and since then.
It is noted by the Directors that the intended sale of the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project to satisfy the 
creditors’ and administrator’s debts, along with the continued existence of the Kangwane South Anthracite 
Project, means that while historical records are affected by incomplete financial information, the absence of 
these records is not expected to significantly detract from the Company’s ability to maintain proper books and 
records for the period from 23 February 2015 for Australian entities, when current directors were appointed. 
Therefore, the absence of records due to turnover of previous staff and officers, unavailable documents of 
foreign  subsidiaries  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to  external  administration,  primarily  affects  the 
historical  records  of  the  economic  entity  rather  than  its  ability  to  continue  its  retained  business  and 
operations.
Summary of Results
The Group’s net loss for the period attributable to members of the Group for the half year ended 31 December 
2013 was $871,670 (2012: $2,421,518).
At  31  December  2013,  the  Group  had  a  net  asset  deficit  of  $934,414  (30  June  2013:  $784,568)  and  the 
Company had 612,747,560 (30 June 2013: 561,667,899) shares on issue.
Revised Mbila Project Settlement
At the end of the 2012/2013 financial year, ZYL announced that that it would no longer proceed with the 
acquisition of the Mbila project and the Settlement Agreement, announced earlier in the year, had been varied 
to effect this.
Under the terms of the revised Settlement Agreement, ZYL agreed to pay to the Mbila Vendors the amount of 
AUD$350,000 by 3 July 2013 and a further AUD$150,000 on 25 September 2013.  All payments were made 
during the half year, pursuant to the revised Settlement Agreement and the respective parties released each 
other from any further claims.
Kangwane Central Project
On 4 February 2013, ZYL entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with its partners in the 
Kangwane  Central  Anthracite  Project.  The  MOU  sought  to  restructure  the  original  transaction  that  was 
executed and announced on 13 December 2010 between Siyanda Resources (Pty) Ltd (“Siyanda”), Double 
Ring Resources (Pty) Ltd (“Double Ring”) and Opes Capital (Pty) Ltd (collectively the “Partners”).
ZYL Limited page 4
Interim Financial Report 31 December 2013
Directors’ report (continued)
The finalisation of the MOU was subject to the fulfilment of a number of conditions precedent by 30 April 
2013. The conditions precedent were not fulfilled and the MOU consequently lapsed and as such the original 
transaction remained binding.
Kangwane South Project
The Kangwane South Project is located in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa, approximately 150km 
from the coast to the Matola Terminal at Maputo Port in Mozambique and approximately 25 kilometres to 
the south of the Company’s Kangwane Central Project.
5.  EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD
•  Extension of bridging facility with Prestige Glory
On 8 April 2014, ZYL announced that it had executed a third deed of extension and forbearance with Prestige 
Glory whereby Prestige Glory (PGL) agreed to extend the termination date of the bridging facility to 30 June 
2014 and advance ZYL a further $300,000. Before this date, PGL had provided $2,000,000, to ZYL under the 
bridging facility, with this deed agreeing provision of a further $150,000 immediately and $150,000 on 31 May 
2014.
•  Appointment of voluntary administrator
On 8 January 2015, ZYL’s then board comprised ofMr Yuzheng Xie and Mr Stephen Woods resolved to appoint 
Jack James of Palisade Business Consulting as voluntary administrator to the Company.
•  Resolution to enter Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA)
On 13 February 2015 at the second meeting of creditors, ZYL’s creditors resolved that the Company execute a 
Deed of Company Arrangement and that Jack James be appointed Administrator of the DOCA. The Company 
executed the DOCA with Konkera Corporate on 19 February 2015. The end date of the DOCA was extended to 
19 February 2016 on 15 July 2015, then to 19 August 2016 on 25 January and finally on 16 August 2016 the 
end date was extended to 19 February 2017.

Notes to the financial statements
Interim Financial Report 31 December 2013
1
(a)
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Basis of preparation
The interim financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, applicable Accounting Standards including AASB 
134  “Interim  Financial  Reporting”,  Australian  Accounting  Interpretations  and  other  authoritative 
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards.
The interim financial report covers ZYL Limited (“the Company”) and controlled entities (“the Group”). 
The Company is limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia.
The  interim  financial  report  has  been  prepared  on  an  accruals  basis  and  is  based  on  historical  cost 
modified by the revaluation of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial liabilities for 
which the fair value basis of accounting has been applied. All amounts are presented in Australian Dollars.
The interim report does not include full disclosures of the type normally included in an annual financial 
report.
The  interim  financial  report,  including  comparatives,  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  annual 
Financial Report of ZYL Limited for the year ended 30 June 2013 and any public announcements made by 
ZYL Limited during the half year in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations arising under 
the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules and Corporations Act 2001 (where possbile – see note 
1(b)).
Significant Accounting Policies
The significant accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of the half-
year financial report are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Company’s annual financial 
report for the financial year ended 30 June 2013 and have been consistently applied by the entities in 
the Consolidated Entity. These accounting policies are consistent with Australian Accounting Standards 
and with International Financial Reporting Standards.
(b)
Incomplete Financial Information
Due  to  turnover  of  previous  staff  and  officers,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to  external 
administration, complete accounting records have not been able to be located. For the year ended 30 
June 2013 and since, this has led to insufficient information being available to support several material 
contracts as well as transactions and balances of foreign subsidiaries.
The Directors are of the opinion that it is not possible to state that the financial statements and notes 
are in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, due to the lack of records and 
certainty in connection with material transactions, for both the year ended 30 June 2013 and since then.
It is noted by the Directors that the intended sale of the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project to satisfy 
the creditors’ and administrator’s debts, along with the continued existence of the Kangwane South 
Anthracite Project, means that while historical records are affected by incomplete financial information, 
the absence of these records is not expected to significantly detract from the Company’s ability to
ZYL Limited page 11

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
maintain proper books and records for the period from 23 February 2015 for Australian entities, when 
current directors were appointed. Therefore, the absence of records due to turnover of previous staff 
and  officers,  unavailable  documents  of  foreign  subsidiaries  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to 
external administration, primarily affects the historical records of the economic entity rather than its 
ability to continue its retained business and operations.
(c)
Going Concern
The financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of 
normal business activities and the realisation of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
The Group has incurred a loss for the period of $871,670 (2012: $2,421,518) and net cash outflows from 
operating  activities  of  $804,939  (2012:  $2,621,492).  The  losses  are  mainly  due  to  continued 
administrative  costs  without  revenue.  In  the  2013  financial  report,  projects  were  impaired  down  to 
values expected to be received following the administration of the Company in the financial report for 
the year ended 30 June 2013. 
 
The Group had cash assets of $39,183 at 31 December 2013 (30 June 2013: $978,239). These conditions 
indicate a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
 
The directors believe that it is appropriate preparing the financial information on a going concern basis 
for the following reasons:
The Directors expect the Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) will result in the extinguishment 
of all secured and unsecured liabilities. Under the DOCA, it is proposed that: 
•
the Kangwane Central Project will be disposed of to satisfy the secured creditor and, with other 
available funds, satisfy identifiable unsecured creditors; 
the 70% interest in the Kangwane South project will be retained by the Company;
• 
•  all prior employment and service contracts will be terminated; and 
•
the issued capital will be consolidated on the basis of 1 share for every 100 shares held;
The Group expects to variously realise or continue developing its assets following completion of 
the DOCA; and 
 
The Group expects to recapitalise following completion the DOCA with sufficient funds to continue 
as a going concern. The DOCA requires a capital raising of at least $1,250,000 before completion, 
however, to satisfy ASX’s conditions for reinstatement, the capital raising will be for an amount of 
$2,000,000.  Following the capital raising, the DOCA requires: 
•  payment  of  fees  to  the  Trustee,  Administrator  and  the  Proponent  totalling  approximately
$200,000; 
the Company to reimburse the proponent for all costs in relation to the ASX relisting and capital 
raising; and
•  post consolidation shares representing 27.6% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the 
completion of the issues will be issued to the Proponent and a compliance manager appointed 
by the Proponent (or their nominees).

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
It is for these reasons that the Directors consider the Group to be a going concern. Notwithstanding the 
material uncertainties of future events inherent in the above, the Directors consider it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial information on a going concern basis and hence no adjustments have been made 
to the financial information relating to the recoverability and classification of the asset carrying amounts 
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the entity does not continue as 
a going concern.

(b)  The reduction in expenditure in relation to employees and directors during the half year was due to 
the termination of employment of South African based employees and directors.  Due to the lack of 
accounting records, the termination payments during the period have conservatively been classified 
as  director  benefits  expense  as  it  included  the  termination  payment  of  a  South  African  based 
executive director.

Closing Balance
The balance carried forward represents projects in the exploration and evaluation phase. Ultimate recoupment 
of  exploration  expenditure  carried  forward  is  dependent  on  successful  development  and  commercial 
exploitation, or  alternatively,  sale of  respective  areas.  Other  than  the  Kangwane  South  Anthracite Project, 
capitalised exploration expenditure has been fully impaired based on expected recovery. The interest in the 
Kangwane South Anthracite Project has been impaired down to the estimated value that would be reasonably 
expected to be realised following the potential completion of the Deed of Company Arrangement.

The termination date of the secured loan from Prestige Glory Limited has been extended from 30 September 
2013 to 30 June 2014 and is secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the Company. Movements 
in the Prestige Glory Loans were solely due to interest accruing on unpaid loan balances. 
 
The Finevest Investment borrowing was for a term of one year from drawdown on 23 August 2013 at an 
interest rate of 15%pa. The 31 December 2013 balance of $262,759 is due to $250,000 drawn down plus 
$12,759 of accrued interest payable. No evidence is available that this loan has ever been repaid.

EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD
•
Extension of bridging facility with Prestige Glory
On 8 April 2014, ZYL announced that it had executed a third deed of extension and forbearance with 
Prestige Glory whereby Prestige Glory (PGL) agreed to extend the termination date of the bridging facility 
to 30 June 2014 and advance ZYL a further $300,000. Before this date, PGL had provided $2,000,000, to 
ZYL under the bridging facility, with this deed agreeing provision of a further $150,000 immediately and 
$150,000 on 31 May 2014.
•  Appointment of voluntary administrator 
On 8 January 2015, ZYL’s then board comprised of My Yuzheng Xie and Mr Stephen Woods resolved to 
appoint Jack James of Palisade Business Consulting as voluntary administrator to the Company.
•
Resolution to enter Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA)
On 13  February 2015 at the second meeting of creditors, ZYL’s creditors resolved that the Company 
execute a Deed of Company Arrangement and that Jack James be appointed Administrator of the DOCA. 
The Company executed the DOCA with Konkera Corporate on 19 February 2015. The end date of the 
DOCA was extended to 19 February 2016 on 15 July 2015, then to 19 August 2016 on 25 January 2016 
and finally on 16 August 2016 the end date was extended to 19 February 2017.  
 
RELATED PARTIES
The Company paid rent, administration, labour and general office expenses to Hemisphere Corporate 
Services  Pty  Ltd  (Hemisphere),  a  company  in  which  Mr  Glenn  Whiddon  has  a  financial  interest.    Mr 
Whiddon resigned as Non-Executive Chairman of the Company on 28 March 2013.  
 
The Board concluded that it was not economically beneficial to the Group to have a dedicated office in 
Australia  to  fulfil  ZYL’s  Australian  regulatory  and  reporting  requirements.  Hemisphere  provides  its 
services to a number of ASX Listed companies on a shared services basis and charges on a cost plus 
arrangement; thereby the fees charged to the Group can be directly correlated to the services provided 
by Hemisphere.

ZYL Limited page 18
In accordance with a resolution of the Directors of ZYL Limited and its controlled entities, we state that: 
 
1)
In the opinion of the Directors, subject to the qualification set out in paragraph 2 below:
the financial statements and supplementary notes, set out on pages 7 to 18, are in accordance with 
the Corporations Act 2001, including:
(i)
(ii)
giving a true and fair view of the financial position of ZYL Limited  and its controlled entities as 
at 31 December 2013 and of its performance, as represented by the results of its operations 
and its cash flows, for the period ended on that date; and
complying  with  Accounting  Standards  AASB  134:  Interim  Financial  Reporting  and  the 
Corporation Regulations 2001; and
b)  as  indicated  in  Note  1(c),  subject  to  the  successful  recapitalisation  of  the  Company,  there  are 
reasonable grounds to believe that ZYL Limited and its controlled entities will be able to pay its 
debts as and when they become due and payable.
2)  Due  to  turnover  of  previous  staff  and  officers,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to  external 
administration, complete accounting records have not been able to be located. For the year ended 30 
June 2013 and since, this has led to insufficient information being available to support several material 
contracts as well as transactions and balances of foreign subsidiaries.
a)
Directors’ declaration
Interim Financial Report 31 December 2013
The Directors are of the opinion that it is not possible to state that the audited financial statements and 
notes are in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, due to the lack of records 
and certainty in connection with material transactions, for both the year ended 30 June 2013 and since 
then.
It is noted by the Directors that the intended sale of the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project to satisfy 
the  creditors’  and  administrator’s  debts,  along  with  the  continued  existence  of  the  Kangwane  South 
Anthracite Project, means that while historical records are affected by incomplete financial information, 
the  absence  of  these  records  is  not  expected  to  significantly  detract  from  the  Company’s  ability  to 
maintain proper books and records for the period from 23 February 2015 for Australian entities, when 
current directors were appointed. Therefore, the absence of records due to turnover of previous staff 
and  officers,  unavailable  documents  of  foreign  subsidiaries,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to 
external administration, primarily affects the historical records of the economic entity rather than its 
ability to continue its retained business and operations.
The directors have been given the declarations required by section 295A of the Corporations Act 2001, which 
is also subject to the qualification in paragraph 2 above. 
 
Signed in accordance with a resolution of the directors:
Mr Shaun Hardcastle  
Non-Executive Director 
Dated this 26th August 2016

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ZYL
LIMITED AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of ZYL Limited (the
company) and the entities it controlled at the half-year's end or from time to time during
the half year (the consolidated entity) on pages 7 to 19. which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2013, the consolidated
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of
changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash ﬂows for the half-year ended on
that date, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information. and the directors' declaration.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year
financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting
Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the half-year financial report that is
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on
our review. Because of the matters described in the Basis for Disclaimer Conclusion
paragraphs, however, we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate review evidence
to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied With the independence requirements of the
Corporations Act 2001.
Basis for Disclaimer of Conclusion
a) As disclosed in Note 1(c) to the half-year financial report, the directors state
that the consolidated entity’s half-year financial report has been prepared on a
going concern basis. In assessing the going concern basis of preparation, the
consolidated entity has made a number of assumptions including the
assumption that the consolidated entity is able to raise capital of at least
$1,250.000 before completion of the Deed of Company Arrangement, however, 21:27:33 ACCOUNTANTS
to satisfy ASX s conditions for reinstatement, a capital raising of $2,000,000 is Lem 3‘ 15 Labcuchere Road
relillllred- South Perth WA 6151
PO Box m
We have been unable to obtain alternative evidence which would provide SW1" PM" WA 695‘
sufficient appropriate evidence as to whether the company may be able to raise Té‘é”h°ne'*s‘ “4362888
such capital, and hence remove significant doubt of its ability to continue as a w'mamhuu'wm
going concern within twelve months of the date of this auditor's review report.
b) On 8 January 2015, ZYL Limited went into administration and new directors were
appointed on 23 February 2015. As stated in Note 1(b) of the half-year financial
report, due to turnover of previous staff and ofﬁcers, a number of subsidiaries
located overseas, and the parent entity being subject to external administration,
