</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action recognizes

rights education, is a key to changing attitudes and behaviour based on racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and to promoting tolerance and respect 
for diversity in societies, and affirms that such education is a determining factor in the 
promotion, dissemination and protection of the democratic values of justice and equity, 
which are essential to prevent and combat the spread of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the important role played by the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization in relation to education against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular the Slave Route Project and the Teaching 
Respect for All initiative,  
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging</i> all States, in cooperation with the United Nations, the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other relevant international 
organizations, to initiate and develop cultural and educational programmes aimed at 
countering racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to 
ensure respect for the dignity and worth of all human beings and to enhance mutual 
understanding among all cultures and civilizations,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the efforts made by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in this regard,  
</p>

persons belonging to vulnerable groups, contributes to the eradication of poverty and of

xenophobia and related intolerance;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Recognizes</i> that quality education, the elimination of illiteracy and access to

harmonious relations and friendship among nations, peoples, groups and individuals, and a 
culture of peace, fostering mutual understanding, solidarity, social justice and respect for all 
human rights for all; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Underlines</i> the essential role of education, including human rights education 
and education that is sensitive to and respects cultural diversity, especially among children

respect for human rights and also respect for the value of cultural diversity; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Stresses</i> <i>the need</i> for States parties to implement fully their obligations under 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as

and training and their obligations to adopt immediate and effective measures in the fields of
