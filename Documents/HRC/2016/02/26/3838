allowing States to accept collective communications by opting in at the time of signature or

under another procedure of international investigation or settlement but also under another 
regional procedure. Other delegations, as well as non-governmental organizations and 
experts, including Committee members, were not in favour of this proposal. They recalled 
that regional bodies did not have competence to adjudicate many of the rights protected 
under the Convention or its optional protocols. Regional bodies could only apply their </footnote>9 14

to submit further information in their subsequent reports about any follow-up measures 
taken should apply to reports under article 44 of the Convention &#8220;and, where appropriate,&#8221; 
to reports under articles 12 or 8, respectively, of the two Optional Protocols. </footnote>1 18 
</p>
<p>  N. Consideration of the merits.............................................................................  72&#8211;<footnote name="7">8. In the light of the potentially far-reaching measures required to implement the 
Committee&#8217;s views, such as changes in domestic practice or legislation, numerous 
delegations were in favour of a six-month time limit for the submission of follow-up 
responses by States parties, rather than three months as originally stated in the 
Chairperson&#8217;s proposal. Several delegations favoured a more flexible approach, either by 
making six months the general rule and three months the exception in urgent cases, or by 
making three months the general rule and allowing for six months in exceptional 
circumstances. Experts, including Committee members, preferred the latter approach. One 
delegation and some non-governmental organizations held the view that the three-month 
time limit should be retained to avoid unnecessary delays and potential harm to victims. 
Several delegations, non-governmental organizations and experts did not support a proposal 
that the State party &#8220;shall endeavour to submit its response as soon as possible within six 
months&#8221; owing to the legal vagueness of the wording &#8220;shall endeavour&#8221; and &#8220;as soon as 
possible&#8221;. Non-governmental organizations and experts suggested replacing &#8220;as soon as 
possible within six months&#8221; by &#8220;no later than (within) six months&#8221;.

In introducing the draft, the Chairperson proposed oral amendments and indicated that the 
draft, as orally amended, reflected the result of the negotiations of the Working Group. The 
oral amendments proposed (a) the deletion of the provision  allowing States parties not to 
recognize the competence of the Committee to consider communications under the first two 
Optional Protocols; (b) the deletion of the article  allowing the Committee to consider 
collective communications; (c) the deletion of the article  allowing the Committee to 
decline consideration of a communication that did not reveal a clear disadvantage; and

</p>
<p>  Draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child  
  to provide a communications procedure ..........................................................................................  26 </p>


<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council decided, in its resolution 11/1, to establish an open-
ended working group to explore the possibility of elaborating an optional protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure 
complementary to the reporting procedure under the Convention. Pursuant to that 
resolution, the Working Group met from 16 to 18 December 2009 and submitted its report 
(A/HRC/13/43) to the Council at its thirteenth session.  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 13/3, the Human Rights Council decided to extend the mandate of 
the Open-ended Working Group until its seventeenth session. It also decided to mandate the 
Working Group to elaborate an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child to provide a communications procedure. In this regard, the Council requested the 
Chairperson of the Working Group to prepare a proposal for a draft optional protocol to be 
used as a basis for the negotiations, taking into account the views expressed and inputs 
provided during the first session of the Working Group and giving due regard to the views 
of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and, where appropriate, the views of relevant 
United Nations special procedures and other experts.  
</p>
<p>3. The second session of the Working Group was held in two parts: from 6 to 10 
December 2010, and from 10 to 16 February 2011.<footnote name="1">06. Uruguay stated that the concessions were necessary for the sake of reaching 
consensus, but regretted that the innovative proposals that they had made had not been 
retained. It expressed the hope that the compromise text would be adopted by the Human 
Rights Council and the General Assembly. 
</footnote>  
</p>
<p>4. The session was opened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, on 6 December 2010. The High Commissioner expressed her interest and that of her 
Office in the mandate of the Working Group. She firmly believed that litigation and the 
examination of communications from individuals at the regional and international levels 
could make a vital contribution to the understanding of the substantive content of 
international norms and lead to real change not only for the individuals directly concerned 
but for all those protected by the rights guaranteed in the treaties. She was convinced that 
regional and international remedies also provided a strong incentive for strengthening 
national protection mechanisms. The future optional protocol would serve the same 
purpose, thus improving access to remedies and relief for victims.  
</p>
<p>5. The High Commissioner informed the Working Group that, in support for its 
mandate and upon the initiative of the Chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, her Office had organized, in June 2010, an expert consultation, where most of the 
relevant issues regarding the optional protocol were discussed. For two days, experts on 
litigation on children issues shared their experience and expressed their views with regard 
to the possible content of the future optional protocol. While acknowledging the merits of 
existing communication procedures and their valuable contribution to the development of a 
rich body of international jurisprudence, experts were generally in favour of an optional 
protocol that was innovative, suited to the needs of children and that would take into 
account the main principles enshrined in the Convention. They considered, inter alia, that 
the communications procedure should be transparent and that measures should be taken to 
ensure wide dissemination among potential users. Consistent with the campaign for their 
universal ratification, the optional protocol should apply to the rights protected under the 
Convention and the two optional protocols thereto. Experts were generally in favour of 
including provisions allowing the Committee to examine both individual and collective 
communications, as well as of including a provision by which no reservation to the optional 
protocol would be allowed. They believed that the Committee should have the competence 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Working Group was unable to meet on the morning of 14 February 2011 owing to lack of 
</p>
<p>interpretation services, a situation regarding which the Chairperson expressed concern. </p>


<p>to request interim measures in cases pending before it, and that a call should be addressed 
to States to take action when such requests for interim measures were formulated. Experts 
were also in favour of including a procedure for friendly settlements between the parties in 
a communication, while ensuring that such a procedure would take fully into consideration 
the interests of the child.  
</p>
<p>6. The High Commissioner encouraged the Working Group to give due consideration 
to the suggestions made by the experts and to the comments on the proposal of the 
Chairperson prepared by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, as well as to relevant 
regional human rights instruments, such as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare 
of the Child, which contained a communications and inquiry procedure. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>7. At its first meeting, on 6 December 2010, the working group elected Drahoslav 
&#352;tef&#225;nek (Slovakia) as its Chairperson-Rapporteur, by acclamation. Mr. &#352;tef&#225;nek was 
nominated by the core group of States (Chile, Egypt, Finland, France, Kenya, Maldives, 
Slovakia, Slovenia, Thailand and Uruguay) supporting the initiative for a new optional 
protocol on a communications procedure under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
The representative of Egypt, speaking on behalf of the core group, stated that Mr. &#352;tef&#225;nek 
had successfully accomplished his mandate during the negotiations and, in the preparation 
of the draft optional protocol, had led the process in a transparent and cooperative way and 
should continue to do so in order to ensure a consistent approach. 
</p>

</footnote> Revised proposal for a draft optional protocol 
</p>
<p><b> D. Organization of the debate 
</b></p>
<p>14. At its first meeting, on 6 December 2010, the Working Group adopted its agenda for 
the session (A/HRC/WG.7/2/1). It also adopted its programme of work for the first part of 
the session. On 10 February 2011, the Working Group adopted its programme of work for 
the second part of the session.  
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group agreed to devote the first part of the session (6 to 10 December 
2010) to a debate on the proposal for a draft optional protocol prepared by the Chairperson 
(A/HRC/WG.7/2/2). On the basis of the discussions, a revised text of the proposal was 
prepared by the Chairperson. The second part of the session (10 to 16 February 2011) was 
devoted to discussions on the revised proposal (A/HRC/WG.7/2/4). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Debate on the proposal for a draft optional protocol prepared 
by the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>16. In his opening statement at the beginning of the second session, the Chairperson-
Rapporteur underlined that, in preparing his proposal, he had sought consistency and 
coherence with existing communications procedures while taking into account the </p>


<p>specificities of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the special needs of children. 
He expressed his intention not to lower the standards that had been set in the instruments 
establishing those procedures. Numerous delegations welcomed the proposal as a sound 
basis for the negotiations.  
</p>
<p>17. Between the first and second part of the second session, the Chairperson met all five 
regional groups in order to introduce the revised proposal and exchange preliminary views 
on it. As a result, the Chairperson suggested some amendments to the revised proposal, 
which were discussed during the second part of the session.  
</p>
<p>18. Upon resuming the session on 10 February 2011, the Chairperson explained that his 
aim was to finalize the negotiations on the optional protocol by the end of the session. In 
introducing his revised proposal, he stated, inter alia, that following suggestions made 
during the first part of the session, he had reorganized the text, which was now divided in 
four parts. Part I (arts. 1 &#8211; 5), contained general provisions considered relevant in 
connection with all procedures but that, in the initial proposal, were dispersed in different 
articles throughout the text. Part II (arts. 6 &#8211; 15) described the communications procedure 
for both individual and collective communications and inter-State communications. Part III 
(arts. 16 &#8211; 17) described the inquiry procedure for grave or systematic violations. Part IV 
(arts. 18 &#8211; 28) contained the final provisions. 
</p>
<p>19. Delegations expressed their gratitude to the Chairperson for his cooperative work 
with them between the two parts of the session and for the revised proposal. Most 
delegations were of the view that the revised proposal was a sound basis to reach consensus 
and expressed the wish that, by the end of the session on 16 February 2011, the Open-ended 
Working Group would finish its negotiations. Other delegations indicated that the Working 
Group might not be in a position to complete its mandate during the session. 
</p>
<p><b>  A. Preamble 
</b></p>
<p>20. When discussing the text of the preamble contained in the initial proposal,<footnote name="2">. Where the Committee exercises its discretion under paragraph 1 of the present article, this does 
not imply a determination on admissibility or on the merits of the communication.&#8221; </footnote> most 
States agreed that the non-discrimination clause contained in the second preambular 
paragraph should refer to ethnic origin and disability. There was also agreement that the 
preamble should make direct reference to the Convention on the Rights of the Child rather 
than to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>21. Most delegations were of the view that the overarching principle of the best interest 
of the child should be reflected in the preamble, as well as the status of the child as a 
subject of rights and as a human being with evolving capacities. The Committee and 
national human rights institutions recommended the inclusion of a reference to dignity (&#8220;a 
human being with dignity and with evolving capacities&#8221;). A majority of delegations also 
expressed the wish to reflect in the preamble the need for the States parties to offer children 
domestic remedies that offer child-sensitive procedures. Several delegations expressed the 
wish for a reference to the fact that children&#8217;s special and dependent status may constitute 
an obstacle to the pursuit of domestic remedies, recognizing the fact that it would not 
always be the case. 
</p>
<p>22. There was also agreement that the preamble should include a reference to the role of 
national human rights institutions in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child. 
State delegations also agreed that the complementary nature of the communications 
procedure vis-&#224;-vis both national jurisdictions and regional mechanisms should be 
highlighted. It was found that the reference to access to effective remedies should only be 
</p>
<p>  
 2 A/HRC/WG.7/2/2. </p>


<p>directed to children (not including their representatives) as the ultimate and relevant 
beneficiaries of remedies. Delegations rejected having a direct reference to article 4 of the 
Convention in this section.  
</p>
<p>23. In addition to its complementary nature, the Working Group considered that the 
preamble should also highlight the purpose of the Optional Protocol to further enhance 
implementation of the Convention and its two substantive Optional Protocols. In this 
regard, most delegations favoured the inclusion of language such as &#8220;where applicable&#8221;, 
reflecting the principle that only those States that are parties to one or both of the two 
substantive Protocols would be bound thereto.  
</p>
<p><b>  B. Competence of the Committee under the optional protocol</b>3<b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. Article 1 of the initial and revised proposals concerned the general competence of 
the Committee under the Optional Protocol. Some delegations suggested that this provision 
should refer explicitly only to the competence to receive and consider communications and 
not to the competence to conduct inquiries. Many delegations, however, preferred to 
include both procedures, even if the possibility to opt out of the inquiry procedure was 
ultimately maintained. As a compromise, most delegations supported referring to &#8220;the 
competence of the Committee as provided for by the present Protocol&#8221;. One delegation 
preferred to retain an explicit reference to the Committee&#8217;s competence &#8220;to receive and 
consider communications&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>25. Many States supported the inclusion of specific language that &#8220;the Committee shall 
not exercise its competence regarding a State party to the present Protocol on matters 
concerning violations of rights set out in an instrument to which that State is not a party&#8221;. 
This principle should be stated either in article 1 or in the articles bestowing a monitoring 
function on the Committee in order to avoid any ambiguity, as no other provision 
comprehensively addressed the Committee&#8217;s <i>ratione materiae</i> jurisdiction. There was also 
broad support for the inclusion of a provision to the effect that &#8220;no communication shall be 
received by the Committee if it concerns a State which is not a party to the present 
Protocol&#8221;. This was agreed language included in similar optional protocols. One delegation 
suggested placing this provision under the admissibility criteria for communications. 
</p>
<p>26. Other delegations considered, however, that the inclusion of the latter paragraphs 
was unnecessary in the light of the general principles of the Vienna Convention on the Law 
of Treaties. A consensus was reached to include the proposed paragraphs in article 1. 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Article 1 of the revised proposal (A/HRC/WG.7/2/4): 
</p>
<p>  &#8220;<footnote name="1">05. Iran (Islamic Republic of) shared the view of Nigeria regarding the first two 
Optional Protocols (see paragraph 103 above). With regard to paragraph 2 of article 5, it 
should read: &#8220;Where a communication is submitted on behalf of an individual or group of 
individuals, this shall be with their consent&#8221;. 
</footnote>. A State party to the present Protocol recognizes the competence of the Committee to receive and 
consider communications and to conduct inquiries as provided for by the provisions of the present 
Protocol.  
</p>
<p>  2. The Committee shall not exercise its competence regarding a State party to the present Protocol 
on matters concerning violations of rights set forth in an instrument to which that State is not a 
party.&#8221;  </p>


<p><b>  C. General principles guiding the functions of the Committee</b>4<b> 
</b></p>
<p>27. Many delegations and non-governmental organizations were in favour of including a 
provision requiring the Committee to exercise the functions conferred on it by the Optional 
Protocol &#8220;in a manner that respects the rights of the child, including the right to express 
their views freely in all matters affecting them&#8221; and referring to &#8220;the views of the child 
being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child&#8221;, as well as to 
the need to ensure &#8220;that the best interests of the child as a primary consideration in all 
actions concerning the child&#8221;. One delegation suggested placing the provision under the 
article dealing with the Committee&#8217;s competence. Several delegations criticized the use of 
obligations-based language to describe the Committee&#8217;s guiding principles and either asked 
for the provision to be deleted and reflected in the preamble or for it to be reworded, using 
agreed language from the Convention. One delegation suggested replacing &#8220;in all actions 
concerning the child&#8221; by &#8220;in its actions concerning the child&#8221; in order to distinguish actions 
of the Committee from those of States parties. Some delegations and experts considered it 
important to keep a reference to the best interests of the child in the operative part of the 
Protocol. 
</p>
<p>28. One expert indicated that the best interest principle should not be given precedence 
over the rights of the child and favoured the wording contained in article 2 of the 
Chairperson&#8217;s revised proposal.<footnote name="5">. Where the author of a communication is acting on behalf of a child as defined in article 1 of the 
Convention, or a group of children, the Committee shall determine whether it is in the best 
interests of the child or group of children concerned to consider the communication.  
</footnote> 
</p>
<p><b>  D. Rules of procedure 
</b></p>
<p>29. A proposal was made during the first part of the session to include a provision that 
would refer to procedural aspects and make reference to the Committee&#8217;s power to 
elaborate rules of procedure under the protocol.<b>6</b> Those rules should include, for instance, 
the need to have child-friendly and child-sensitive procedures. Views were expressed on the 
distinction between these terms and which of them would be more appropriate in this 
context. Committee members indicated that, in the light of the new guidelines on child-
friendly justice, the latter term would be appropriate. 
</p>
<p>30. One delegation suggested that States parties should be able to participate in the 
process of elaboration of the rules of procedure by the Committee. This position was shared 
by another delegation. Many delegations did not share this view. The Committee members 
recalled that article 43, paragraph 8, of the Convention provided for the adoption by the 
Committee of its rules of procedure, namely, with no external participation envisioned. 
Furthermore, that requirement would undermine the Committee&#8217;s independence and 
professionalism and would be without precedent in any other human rights treaty. One 
delegation supported the view that ongoing interaction between the Committee and States 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Article 2 of the revised proposal read as follows: &#8220;The Committee shall exercise the functions 
</p>
<p>conferred on it by the present Protocol in a manner that respects the rights of the child and the views 
of the child, and ensures that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all actions 
concerning the child.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 5 Article 2 of the revised proposal: &#8220;The Committee shall exercise the functions conferred on it by the 
present Protocol in a manner that respects the rights of the child and the views of the child, and 
ensures that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all actions concerning the 
child.&#8221; 
</p>

<p>parties was desirable. The Chairperson-Rapporteur reminded delegations that the regular 
meetings of States parties and their participation in inter-committee meetings provided 
them with ample opportunities to table their views on the working methods of treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p><b>  E. Protection measures 
</b></p>
<p>31. There was a consensus among delegations to support the inclusion of a provision 
allowing the Committee to request States parties to adopt protection measures to ensure that 
individuals under their jurisdiction are not subjected to any form of pressure for having 
submitted communications or information to the Committee under the Optional Protocol.<b>7</b> 
Views were expressed that such measures should cover not only child victims but also 
children otherwise involved in a communication procedure, family members as well as their 
representatives bringing a communication before the Committee, including organizations.  
</p>
<p>32. The criteria for requesting protection measures were also debated. The initial 
proposal only contemplated situations of ill-treatment or intimidation. However, this was 
considered insufficient by a number of delegations and non-governmental organizations, 
which supported the inclusion of situations of human rights violations in general, in 
addition to ill-treatment or intimidation, which could also extend to those committed by 
non-State actors. One delegation proposed a more detailed formulation that would refer to 
threats, pressure, intimidation or sanctions.  
</p>
<p>33. Some delegations favoured strengthening the provision on protection measures by 
replacing &#8220;appropriate steps&#8221; by &#8220;necessary steps&#8221;. One delegation suggested replacing 
&#8220;shall take all appropriate steps to ensure&#8221; by &#8220;shall ensure&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>  F. Non-publication of identity  
</b></p>
<p>34. Most delegations favoured the inclusion of a provision capturing the principle that 
the identity of the child submitting a communication would be revealed to the State party 
for the purpose of the communication, but would not otherwise be publicized, unless this 
was expressly consented to by those concerned.<b>8</b> A broad description of beneficiaries was 
favoured by many delegations in order to cover not only children but also representatives 
potentially presenting a communication on their behalf. 
</p>
<p>35. Some suggested that the provision in question should make it clear that the identity 
of the individual or individuals concerned must be revealed to the State party. Others were 
of the view that, in exceptional situations, it might not be appropriate to reveal the identity 
to the State and that language should be added to that effect. A number of delegations 
suggested that this provision be merged with the article on protection measures. Some 
delegations preferred to keep the two provisions separate. One delegation considered that 
protection measures were directed at States parties, whereas the principle of non-
publication of identity was directed at both States parties and the Committee. Some 
delegations disagreed with the title of the provision (&#8220;non-publication of identity&#8221;) and 
</p>
<p>  
 7 Article 4 of the revised proposal: &#8220;A State party shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that 
</p>
<p>individuals under its jurisdiction are not subjected to any human rights violation, ill-treatment or 
intimidation as a consequence of communications or cooperation with the Committee pursuant to the 
present Protocol.&#8221; 
</p>

<p>proposed alternatives such as &#8220;confidentiality&#8221;. The decision was finally taken to deal with 
the matter in the provision on protection measures. 
</p>
<p><b>  G. Individual communications</b>9<b> 
</b></p>
<p>36. A debate was held on whether the optional protocol should apply in connection with 
the Convention and its two existing Optional Protocols or whether States, when ratifying 
the protocol, could choose not to recognize the competence of the Committee to examine 
communications alleging violations of the rights set forth under either of the two existing 
Protocols. Many delegations, UNICEF, non-governmental organizations, experts, including 
members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the European Network of 
Ombudspersons for Children, indicated that no such distinction should be made because it 
would mean establishing a hierarchy of norms and different implementation regimes. 
Others welcomed the flexibility involved in opting or the expressed readiness to go along if 
needed to reach a maximum adhesion to the text. One delegation, supported by others, 
suggested that the Committee&#8217;s jurisdiction should extend to violations of any of the rights 
set forth in any of the above instruments to which the State party concerned is a party. 
</p>
<p>37. Some delegations suggested the inclusion of a provision clarifying the competence 
of the Committee in connection with States that were parties to the first two Optional 
Protocols but not to the Convention itself. 
</p>
<p>38. Numerous delegations and UNICEF held the view that the right to submit a 
communication should pertain to &#8220;individuals or groups of individuals&#8221;, which was more 
inclusive than the wording &#8220;children or groups of children&#8221; proposed by other delegations. 
The Chairperson withdrew his proposal, based on statements from some participants, to 
explicitly include individuals or groups of individuals claiming &#8220;to have been victims while 
they were children&#8221; of a violation. The proposal was rejected by most delegations as being 
either redundant or retroactive or incompatible with national statutes of limitations. 
</p>
<p>39. Some delegations were in favour of restricting the right to submit a communication 
to child victims or their legal representatives. The issue of representation of children and 
consent were the object of considerable discussion. A number of delegations recalled that, 
</p>
<p>  
 9 Article 6 of the revised proposal: 
</p>
<p>  &#8220;<footnote name="1">04. China did not oppose the consensus but, like the Russian Federation, expressed 
concern about the absence in article 5 of a definition of the persons able to represent a 
child.  
</footnote>. Communications may be submitted by or on behalf of an individual or group of individuals, 
within the jurisdiction of a State party, claiming to be victims or to have been victims while they 
were children, of a violation by that State party of any of the rights set forth in: 
</p>
<p>   (a) The Convention; 
   (b) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography; 
   (c) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 
  [2. A State party may, at the time of signature or ratification of the present Protocol or accession 
</p>
<p>thereto, declare that it does not recognize the competence of the Committee provided for in 
subparagraph 1 (b) and/or (c) of the present article. 
</p>
<p>  3. Any State party having made a declaration in accordance with paragraph 2 of the present article 
may, at any time, amend or withdraw this declaration by notification to the Secretary-General of 
the United Nations.] 
</p>
<p>  4. Where a communication is submitted on behalf of an individual or group of individuals, this shall 
be with their consent unless the author can justify acting on their behalf without such consent. 
</p>

<p>according to their domestic law, children should not be directly involved in legal 
proceedings and that the optional protocol should similarly reflect the fact that it is only 
where they are represented by their parents, legal guardian or relevant third party that a 
communication on their behalf should be accepted by the Committee. Alternatively, one 
delegation suggested requiring legal representation for children below the age of 16. Other 
delegations stated that a child must be entitled to bring a communication on his or her own, 
and asked that a provision on assistance for children submitting communications on their 
own should be included in the optional protocol or in the Committee&#8217;s rules of procedure. 
Some delegations stated that the optional protocol should refer to the relevant national 
legislation for identifying the persons and entities entitled to represent a child. One 
delegation warned that legal representatives were often among those responsible for 
violations of the rights of a child, if only by omission. Some delegations preferred to clearly 
state who was entitled to submit a communication on behalf of a child either in the optional 
protocol or in the Committee&#8217;s rules of procedure. One delegation suggested referring to 
the representatives mentioned in article 5 of the Convention. Another delegation was 
against any closed definition of legal representatives. One delegation expressed the view 
that the appointment of a legal guardian would best protect the interests of the child, while 
another delegation favoured restricting the right to submit a communication to the child and 
the child&#8217;s parents or legal guardians. Another delegation considered that the draft optional 
protocol should address situations where children, such as street children, have no legal 
guardian and where conflicts of interest may arise when a child is represented by the child&#8217;s 
parents or legal guardians. 
</p>
<p>40. Some delegations suggested that the issue of legal representation should be dealt 
with in the Committee&#8217;s rules of procedure and that the Committee should deal with this 
matter on a case-by-case basis. It was proposed that a provision should be included to the 
effect that the Committee should determine whether such representation was in the best 
interest of the child or group of children. Some delegations argued that the Committee 
should always determine whether or not the consideration of a communication was in the 
best interest of the child, irrespective of legal representation. Other delegations considered 
that the best interests of the child were sufficiently covered as a general principle in the 
optional protocol. One delegation preferred reflecting that principle in the article dealing 
with the modalities of consideration of communications. Several delegations supported 
reverting the wording of the proposal by stating that the Committee may decline 
considering a communication if such consideration was not in the best interests of the child. 
Another delegation suggested that the Committee&#8217;s rules of procedure should contain 
criteria for defining the best interests of the child. Two delegations asked for deletion of 
any reference to the best interests of groups of children in the absence of a legally defined 
concept. 
</p>
<p>41. Experts, including Committee members, indicated that the optional protocol should 
uphold the legal personality of children and not reproduce hurdles of legal representation 
contained in domestic systems. They cautioned against an automatic assumption that the 
interests of parents are always identical with the best interests of the child and emphasized 
that the right of a child to participate in the proceedings must not be restricted. 
</p>
<p>42. Non-governmental organizations indicated that the notion of &#8220;legal capacity&#8221; existed 
at the national level, but not at the regional or international levels. Introducing this concept, 
or a reference to national legislation, or establishing a system of obligatory representation 
of child victims would reproduce the obstacles that children face at the national level and 
run contrary to the rationale of the optional protocol. 
</p>
<p>43. One delegation sought clarification as to when the author of a communication 
submitted on behalf of an individual or group of individuals could justify acting on their 
behalf without their consent. </p>


<p>44. Several delegations and non-governmental organizations supported the paragraph in 
the Chairperson&#8217;s revised proposal providing that &#8220;the Committee shall include in its rules 
of procedure safeguards to prevent the manipulation of children by those who represent 
them and to protect their rights under the present Protocol.&#8221; However, a number of 
delegations preferred deleting &#8220;and to protect their rights&#8221; to avoid the impression that the 
optional protocol creates new rights. Some delegations and UNICEF did not support the 
new paragraph because it would overload the Protocol. Others argued that the risk of 
manipulation could be better addressed by either requiring legal representation or by 
explicitly defining the legal representatives. A new compromise text replacing &#8220;the 
manipulation of children by those who represent them&#8221; by &#8220;the manipulation of the child by 
those acting on his/her behalf&#8221; and substituting &#8220;and to protect their rights under the present 
Protocol&#8221; by &#8220;and may decline to consider any communication where it appears to the 
Committee that the communication is not in the child&#8217;s best interest&#8221; was supported by 
many States. One State suggested inserting &#8220;the consideration of&#8221; before &#8220;the 
communication&#8221;. Another State criticized that &#8220;where it appears&#8221; was not sufficiently 
precise. Most delegations were in favour of moving the provision under the article on rules 
of procedure as a new paragraph 2. Others preferred keeping it in part II of the protocol 
dealing with communications. 
</p>
<p>45. The Chairperson-Rapporteur stated that the practical relevance of the question of 
legal representation was limited. He recalled that the Optional Protocol to the  Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the rules of procedure of the Committee on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities omitted specific provisions on legal representation 
despite the fact that persons with mental disabilities frequently required such 
representation. 
</p>
<p>46. In connection with the question of consent, a number of delegations, non-
governmental organizations and experts, including members of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, indicated that the right of the child to be heard, which is one of the 
leading principles of the Convention, should be referred to in the optional protocol, as well 
as the child&#8217;s status as a rights holder.  
</p>
<p><b>  H. Collective communications</b>10<b> 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled that none of the international human rights 
treaties provided for a collective communications procedure, although such procedure 
existed at the regional level, under the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the 
</p>
<p>  
 10 Article 7 of the revised proposal: 
</p>
<p>  &#8220;<footnote name="1">03. Nigeria, on behalf of the African Group, stated that although it would not oppose the 
consensus, it still had objections to some articles. In particular, it would have preferred that 
the protocol allow a State to choose, when ratifying, not to recognize the competence of the 
Committee to examine communications alleging violations of either of the first two 
Optional Protocols to which that State was a party.  Nigeria also underlined the right of 
each State to make reservations.  
</footnote>. Each State party may, at the time of signature or ratification of the present Protocol or accession 
thereto, declare that it recognizes the competence of the Committee to receive and consider 
collective communications as provided for in the present article in respect of the rights set forth in 
some or all of the instruments listed in paragraph 2. 
</p>
<p>  2. National human rights institutions and ombudsman institutions as well as non-governmental 
organizations, fulfilling the criteria established in the Committee&#8217;s rules of procedure may submit 
collective communications alleging recurring violations affecting multiple individuals of any of 
the rights set forth in:  
</p>
<p>   (a) The Convention; 
   (b) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography; 
   (c) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict.  
  3. Any State party having made a declaration in accordance with paragraph 1 of the present article 
</p>
<p>may, at any time, withdraw this declaration by notification to the Secretary-General of the United 
Nations.&#8221; </p>


<p>Child and under the 1995 Additional Protocol to the European Social Charter. He also 
recalled that the inclusion of a collective communications procedure had been discussed but 
rejected during the negotiations on the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and to the  International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>48. Numerous delegations declared that they were not in favour of including a provision 
in the optional protocol that would extend the competence of the Committee to the 
examination of collective communications. They said, inter alia, that such a provision was 
without precedent, represented no added value as no protection gap existed, that it 
overlapped with the inquiry procedure for grave or systematic violations and, to a large 
extent, with the reporting procedure, and that the provision on individual communications 
already envisaged the submission of communications by groups of individuals. Both the 
individual communication and the inquiry procedure could ultimately lead to the 
amendment of laws and policies. They saw more merit in keeping the inquiry procedure, 
which existed also in other instruments. Collective communications also posed difficulties 
in terms of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as victims could not be easily identified. They 
would result in abstract proceedings, undermine the right to response of States and, 
ultimately, the integrity of the communications procedure. Some argued that having to deal 
with collective communications would overstretch the Committee&#8217;s limited time and 
resources. Questions were asked as to what should be understood by &#8220;grave and 
systematic&#8221;. These delegations similarly highlighted the need to ensure broad adhesion to 
the draft optional protocol, which would not be favoured with the inclusion of a provision 
allowing collective communications. A problem exposed by many States was also the lack 
of clarity with regard to the fulfilment of the requirement of exhaustion of domestic 
remedies for collective complaints. 
</p>
<p>49. A number of delegations, experts, including members of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, national human rights institutions, UNICEF and non-governmental 
organizations, were in favour of such a provision, as they felt that it filled a gap in the 
protection mechanisms. They considered that collective communications could play a 
preventive role; prevent the Committee from having to examine identical individual 
communications separately and therefore reduce the caseload; eliminate the difficulty of 
identifying individual victims ready to submit their cases, and the re-victimization of the 
children authors of such communications; would be particularly appropriate in connection 
with children belonging to vulnerable groups, such as children in institutional settings, child 
victims of prostitution or child victims of traditional practices as it would, inter alia, reduce 
the risk of reprisals. They said that there was no overlap between the collective 
communications and the inquiry procedure, and stressed the positive impact they could 
have on the interpretation of the Convention by the Committee. These delegations 
proposed, inter alia, that the possibility of submitting collective communications should not 
be limited to non-governmental organizations with consultative status with the Economic 
and Social Council, but be open to non-governmental organizations constituted under the 
national legal systems. National human rights institutions welcomed the possibility for 
them to submit collective communications and suggested including a reference to the Paris 
Principles. Such a reference was considered too limitative by some delegations. It was 
suggested that collective communications should not be limited to cases of &#8220;grave or 
systematic violations&#8221; but to &#8220;recurring violations&#8221; or &#8220;violations of rights of multiple 
victims&#8221;. Some suggested that the provision on collective communications should include 
an opt-in or an opt-out clause.  
</p>

<p>allowing States to opt in &#8220;at any time&#8221; and not just at the moment of ratification or 
accession. Some delegations, UNICEF, national human rights institutions and non-
governmental organizations were against any optional clauses. Some considered that 
&#8220;recurring violations&#8221; was not a sufficiently defined concept. Numerous delegations 
maintained that they could not support a collective communications procedure, even as an 
opt-in provision. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  I. Admissibility</b>11<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. Most delegations expressed the view that communications should be submitted to 
the Committee in writing. Others suggested that other forms of communication, such as 
videotapes, should be accepted, as many children were not in a position to make written 
submissions. Several delegations stated that the initial submission should be in writing in 
order to verify, inter alia, the author&#8217;s identity, the authorization to submit a communication 
on behalf of the victim and the authenticity of a communication; however, additional 
evidence should be admitted also in non-written formats. One delegation questioned 
whether the Committee had the necessary resources to ascertain the authenticity of non-
written evidence.  
</p>
<p>52. Many delegations upheld the principle that complainants should have the possibility 
of submitting evidential material in a non-written form. While several delegations, non-
governmental organizations and experts held the view that this principle should be stated in 
the protocol, other delegations proposed to leave it to the rules of procedure. In the view of 
one delegation, the provision according to which the Committee should consider 
communications &#8220;in the light of all documentation submitted to it&#8221; sufficiently covered the 
possibility of receiving non-written evidence. A few delegations wondered whether the 
Committee would hold oral hearings. 
</p>
<p>53. Experts, including Committee members, expected that the vast majority of 
communications would be received in writing. However, they observed that the Committee 
would not wish to close the door on other possible formats, as children without assistance 
might need more flexible accommodation. The Committee should therefore not be bound 
by a strict admissibility requirement of submission in writing. It was recalled that the 
</p>
<p>  
 11 Article 9 of the revised proposal:  
</p>
<p>  &#8220;The Committee shall consider a communication inadmissible when:  
   (a) The communication is anonymous; 
   (b) The communication is not in writing. This is without prejudice to non written materials that 
</p>
<p>could be submitted in support of the allegations contained in the communication;  
   (c) The communication constitutes an abuse of the right of submission of such communications 
</p>
<p>or is incompatible with the provisions of the Convention and/or the Optional Protocols thereto;  
   (d) The same matter has already been examined by the Committee or has been or is being 
</p>
<p>examined under another procedure of international investigation or settlement; 
   (e) All available domestic remedies have not been exhausted. This shall not be the rule where 
</p>
<p>the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged or unlikely to provide effective 
reparation. The Committee shall interpret the application of the remedies in a manner sensitive to 
the impact that delays may cause to a child&#8217;s well-being and development;  
</p>
<p>   (f) The communication is manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently substantiated;  
   (g) The facts that are the subject of the communication occurred prior to the entry into force of 
</p>
<p>the present Protocol for the State party concerned, unless those facts continued after that date.  
   (h) The communication is not submitted within one year after the exhaustion of domestic 
</p>
<p>remedies, except in cases where the author can demonstrate that it had not been possible to submit 
the communication within that time limit.&#8221; </p>


<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities did not 
require communications to be submitted in writing. 
</p>
<p>54. A majority of States also favoured the inclusion of a time limit between exhaustion 
of domestic remedies and the submission of a communication to the Committee. In the 
view of most delegations, this was necessary to allow States to investigate and provide a 
response on a communication. The majority of States agreed to a time limit of 12 months, 
following the precedent of the Optional Protocol to the  International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 3(2)(a)). Some States, however, proposed a 
shorter time limit of six months since the last domestic decision. Many States in favour of 
the inclusion of such a time limit also proposed including an exception to the rule, where 
the author could demonstrate that it was not possible for him to submit a communication 
earlier (following article 3(2)(a) of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). Two delegations proposed the introduction of a 
time limit of one year, which would be triggered upon the age of majority if it was 
demonstrated that the child could not bring a complaint before. Two delegations pointed to 
an apparent contradiction between the Committee&#8217;s ability to dispense with non-exhaustion 
of domestic remedies if they were unduly prolonged and the introduction of a strict time 
limit.  
</p>
<p>55. Non-governmental organizations and national human rights institutions stated that 
they did not consider it appropriate to apply time limits to the submission of 
communications following exhaustion of domestic remedies in the light of the particular 
status of children and the fact they lacked knowledge and understanding of the availability 
of the international communications procedures. While regional bodies were close to 
potential complainants and well-known by them, international communications procedures 
did not enjoy the same level of knowledge at the national level. This was not a standard 
requirement at the United Nations and ran counter to the expressed desire of many 
delegations to make this communication procedure child-sensitive and easily accessible to 
children. If a timeline was to be introduced, it would be preferable to follow the language 
under article 56 of the African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights, which referred to 
&#8220;within reasonable time&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>56. With regard to the exhaustion of domestic remedies, some delegations did not 
support the idea that the rule would not apply when those remedies were regarded by the 
Committee as unlikely to provide effective relief, as the Committee could not be in a 
position to prejudge on the outcome of any internal remedy. A proposal to replace &#8220;unlikely 
to bring effective relief&#8221; by &#8220;unlikely to provide effective reparation&#8221; was not supported by 
most delegations, as it departed from the wording used in other instruments. For similar 
reasons, a proposal to provide that the Committee &#8220;shall interpret the application of the 
remedies in a manner sensitive to the impact that delays may cause to a child&#8217;s well-being 
and development&#8221; did not find sufficient support.  
</p>
<p>57. One delegation was against extending the Committee&#8217;s <i>ratione temporis</i> competence 
to facts that occurred prior to the entry into force of the optional protocol for the State party 
concerned but that continued after that date. Another delegation concurred with the 
Chairperson that continuing facts referred to situations such as disappeared children, not to 
historic claims.  
</p>

<p>respective instruments, which did not cover all provisions contained in the Convention and 
the optional protocols.  
</p>
<p>59. A few States proposed that the Committee should systematically decide on the 
admissibility of a communication before seeking the State party&#8217;s observations on the 
merits. However, this proposal did not attract support from other delegations, which 
considered that this would delay the procedure considerably. The Chairperson recalled that 
the current practice of treaty bodies did not favour such an approach.  
</p>
<p><b>  J. Communications not revealing a clear disadvantage 
</b></p>
<p>60. A number of States proposed the insertion either in the protocol or in the 
Committee&#8217;s rules of procedure of a provision similar to article 4 of the Optional Protocol 
to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights providing the 
Committee with the possibility of declining to consider a communication where it did not 
reveal that the author had suffered a clear disadvantage.<b>12</b> Such a provision, which also 
exists in the European Convention on Human Rights, was perceived as a way to avoid a 
potential backlog to the Committee as well as to filter so-called petty complaints. 
</p>
<p>61. Other delegations and non-governmental organizations were not in favour of such a 
provision and considered that the problem raised could be dealt with by declaring such 
communications inadmissible because they were manifestly ill-founded, not sufficiently 
substantiated or an abuse of the right of submission. It was difficult to think of a situation 
where a child&#8217;s rights had been violated but the child had suffered &#8220;no clear disadvantage&#8221;. 
A disadvantage was a necessary and unavoidable consequence of a violation, even if harm 
cannot always be quantified. 
</p>
<p><b>  K. Interim measures</b>13<b> 
</b></p>
<p>62. Many delegations expressed their support for the inclusion of an article providing 
the Committee with competence to request States parties to take interim measures to avoid 
irreparable harm to alleged victims. Many delegations requested the inclusion of wording 
similar to article 5 of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, namely that such request would only be made in exceptional 
circumstances. Several delegations, non-governmental organizations and experts, including 
Committee members, considered that this threshold was excessive and argued that 
&#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; sufficiently reflected the exceptional nature of interim measures. One 
delegation suggested including a qualification on the non-binding nature of interim 
measures. Another delegation challenged the authority of the Committee to request interim 
measures and suggested including a timeline for their validity (which could be shorter than 
the duration of the proceedings before the Committee) and for the adoption of a decision by 
</p>
<p>  
 12 As a result, article 10 was introduced in the revised proposal, reading &#8220;The Committee may, if 
</p>
<p>necessary, decline to consider a communication where it does not reveal that the author has suffered a 
clear disadvantage, unless the Committee considers that the communication raises a serious issue of 
general importance.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 13 Article 8 of the revised proposal: 
  &#8220;<footnote name="1">02. France welcomed the efforts to reach a consensus and recalled that it was now up to 
the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly to adopt the draft optional protocol.  
</footnote>. At any time after the receipt of a communication and before a determination on the merits has 
</p>
<p>been reached, the Committee may transmit to the State party concerned for its urgent 
consideration a request that the State party take such interim measures as may be necessary to 
avoid possible irreparable damage to the victim or victims of the alleged violations.  
</p>

<p>the Committee in cases where interim measures had been sought. Thus, such decisions 
should be adopted within six months of the receipt of the State party&#8217;s observations, or no 
later than at the following session of the Committee, unless the request was lifted in the 
meantime. Another delegation was against introducing such time limits. Some delegations 
suggested the insertion of language by which the Committee would have to seek the State 
party&#8217;s observations on the Committee&#8217;s request for interim measures. Other delegations 
and non-governmental organizations argued that an additional layer of correspondence 
would only prolong the proceedings and was inconsistent with agreed language in other 
optional protocols.  
</p>
<p>63. Some delegations proposed requiring that a request for interim measures be 
transmitted to the State party for its urgent consideration and appropriate action. Another 
delegation stated that, while States parties had an obligation to consider interim measure 
requests in good faith, there was no obligation to take any action on such requests. 
</p>
<p>64. Other delegations and non-governmental organizations suggested that the protocol 
should include an obligation for the State concerned to comply with the request for interim 
measures. In this respect, non-governmental organizations stated that the authority of the 
Committee to issue requests for interim measures was an indispensable component of the 
dispute mechanism, and stressed the recognition of their obligatory nature. Experts, 
including Committee members, highlighted the essential role played by the Committee in 
issuing requests for interim measures, and the need for States to commit to respect such 
requests.  
</p>
<p><b>  L. Transmission of communications to the State concerned</b>14<b> 
</b></p>
<p>65. Most delegations agreed with the principle of confidentiality of the procedure. Many 
delegations, however, were against the anonymous transmittal of a communication to the 
State party concerned, as they felt that States would not be in a position to consider it or to 
offer an adequate relief thereof. Most States favoured wording suggesting that the identity 
of the child or children was not public, and was revealed to the State party only for the 
purpose of the procedure.  
</p>
<p>66. Some non-governmental organizations supported the anonymous transmittal of 
communications to State parties as a necessary safeguard for the protection of the interests 
of children. Some, on the other hand, supported the suggestion, made by several States, to 
include the possibility of withholding the identity of the victim in exceptional 
circumstances. Experts drew a distinction between anonymity and confidentiality, and 
stressed that the transmittal should be confidential, that is, not public, which did not mean 
anonymous; however, anonymity could be used, if needed, in exceptional circumstances. 
They recalled the need to uphold the general principle of confidentiality, in accordance with 
article 16 of the Convention. The general rule should therefore be that the child&#8217;s identity 
should be preserved; there may be situations, however, where publicizing certain cases may 
have a particular interest, to the extent that the children involved consent, for instance in 
order to persuade States to change their laws, policies or practices. As stated above, an 
</p>
<p>  
 14 Article 11 of the revised proposal: 
</p>
<p>  &#8220;<footnote name="1">01. Without prejudice to the consensus reached, the Russian Federation stated that it was 
essential to consider the inclusion in article 5 of the draft text of a definition of the persons 
who are able to represent a child in the proceedings before the Committee. 
</footnote>. Unless the Committee considers a communication inadmissible without reference to the State 
party concerned, the Committee shall bring any communication submitted to it under the present 
Protocol confidentially to the attention of the State party concerned as soon as possible. 
</p>

<p>agreement was reached , to include a separate provision indicating that the identity of the 
individuals concerned in a communication should not be revealed publicly without their 
express consent. Such a provision would apply in general and not only in connection with 
the transmission of the communication to the State concerned.  
</p>
<p>67. The majority of State delegations considered a three-month time limit for 
submission of their observations to the Committee too short, and preferred a six-month 
deadline, as provided for in most other communications procedures. Federal States drew 
particular attention to the difficulties they faced when compiling observations from 
provincial/State and federal jurisdictions. A few States proposed to uphold the general rule 
of a six-month time limit, unless the Committee, given the urgency of the situation, 
requested the State party to provide its observations within three months. A majority of 
States favoured stating that the State party should submit its response as soon as possible 
within six months. A few delegations did not support the inclusion of the words &#8220;as soon as 
possible&#8221;, which were perceived as lacking legal certainty. A proposal to require that a 
State party &#8220;shall endeavour&#8221; to submit its response within such time limit was considered 
too vague by most delegations and non-governmental organizations. The latter recalled that 
a three-month limit exists in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Racial Discrimination  and saw no reason not to follow that precedent. One organization 
suggested replacing &#8220;as soon as possible within six months&#8221; by &#8220;no later than (within] six 
months&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>68. One delegation sought the inclusion of wording that provided that the 
communication was sent to the State party in its national language. 
</p>
<p><b>  M. Friendly settlements</b>15<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. Most delegations were in favour of including a provision regarding the possibility of 
dealing with communications through a friendly settlement between the parties in order to 
avoid re-victimization of children and to reduce the Committee&#8217;s workload. A few 
delegations supported changing the term &#8220;friendly settlement&#8221; to &#8220;amicable settlement&#8221;. A 
number of delegations held the view that the provision should be based on the language 
contained in article 7 of the Optional Protocol to the  International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>70. The need for any friendly settlement to respect the obligations set forth in the 
Convention and its first two optional protocols was stressed. One delegation indicated that 
the optional protocol should require the Committee to encourage friendly settlements and 
asked until what stage of the proceedings friendly settlements could be reached. Another 
delegation considered it useful to allow for friendly settlements also after the merits stage 
had been reached. 
</p>
<p>71. A debate was held on whether a friendly settlement closed consideration of a case 
and whether the Committee should be able to monitor the implementation of friendly 
settlements. A proposal to state both in the protocol did not receive wide support. Some 
delegations held the view that the Committee should not have the power to reopen a case 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Article 12 of the revised proposal:  
</p>
<p>  &#8220;<footnote name="1">00. The Working Group adopted the text of the draft optional protocol by consensus and 
thus completed its mandate.  
</footnote>. The Committee shall make available its good offices to the parties concerned with a view to 
reaching a friendly settlement of the matter on the basis of respect for the obligations set forth in 
the Convention and/or the Optional Protocols thereto.  
</p>

<p>that had been the object of a friendly settlement between the parties, because such a 
scenario would run against legal predictability and certainty. One delegation proposed that 
the Committee be able to reopen a friendly settlement only if the relevant State party failed 
to honour its obligations under the deed of such a settlement. Other delegations considered 
that the Committee should be able to examine whether friendly settlements were consistent 
with the Convention and in the best interests of the child. Those proposals were supported 
by non-governmental organizations and experts, including Committee members, who stated 
that the consideration of a communication should not be closed until satisfactory 
implementation of a friendly settlement, and that such settlement must ensure respect for 
the rights set forth in the Convention. One delegation argued that the Committee should be 
able to invite a State party to submit further information about any measures taken to 
implement a friendly settlement, including in its subsequent reports under the Convention 
or its Optional Protocols, similar to the procedure for follow-up on the Committee&#8217;s views. 
Several delegations preferred leaving the modalities of the follow-up on friendly 
settlements to the Committee&#8217;s rules of procedure.  
</p>
<p><b>  N. Consideration of the merits</b>16<b> 
</b></p>
<p>72. One delegation held the view that the optional protocol should allow for exceptions 
to the rule that the Committee should examine communications in closed meetings, when 
they were in the best interests of the child. One national institution considered that closed 
proceedings would result in lack of transparency and make amicus curiae interventions very 
difficult. 
</p>
<p>73. Several delegations and experts, including Committee members, were in favour of 
inserting a clause requiring the Committee to consider communications as quickly as 
possible, in particular in cases where it had requested interim measures. Some delegations 
considered such a clause redundant. 
</p>
<p>74. Many delegations were in favour of adding a provision similar to article 8, 
paragraph 4, of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights  with a view to limiting the Committee&#8217;s scope of review when 
examining alleged violations of economic, social and cultural rights protected under the 
Convention to a reasonableness test and granting States parties discretion to &#8220;adopt a range 
of possible policy measures for the implementation of the economic, social and cultural 
rights in the Convention&#8221;. Such an inclusion was perceived by many delegations as 
adequately reflecting the principle of progressive realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights as set forth in articles 4 and 28 of the Convention. A number of States, 
however, opposed the inclusion of such a provision, on the grounds that it would create a 
</p>
<p>  
 16 Article 13 of the revised proposal: 
</p>
<p>  &#8220;<footnote name="1">7 Article 24 of the revised proposal: &#8220;No reservations to the present Protocol shall be permitted.&#8221; </footnote>. The Committee shall hold closed meetings when examining communications received under the 
present Protocol. 
</p>
<p>  2. The Committee shall consider communications received under the present Protocol as quickly as 
possible, in the light of all documentation submitted to it, provided that this documentation is 
transmitted to the parties concerned. 
</p>
<p>  3. When examining a communication under the present Protocol, the Committee may consult, as 
appropriate, relevant documentation emanating from other United Nations bodies, specialized 
agencies, funds, programmes and mechanisms, and other bodies, including from regional human 
rights systems, and any observations or comments by the State party concerned. 
</p>
<p>  4. After examining a communication, the Committee shall, without delay, transmit its views on the 
communication, together with its recommendations, if any, to the parties concerned.&#8221; </p>


<p>hierarchy of rights that would run counter to the principle of indivisibility and 
interdependence of all human rights.  
</p>
<p>75. Experts and non-governmental organizations were against such different treatment 
of economic, social and cultural rights, which had no precedent in the Optional Protocols to 
the  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and to 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In their view, this would 
undermine the holistic nature of the Convention, the fact that, for all rights, there were 
obligations to respect, protect and fulfil and the principle that all rights covered in a treaty 
should be protected to the same degree. Communications may involve multiple violations 
arising out of the same situation &#8211; violations of civil and political rights as well as of 
economic social and cultural rights. The Convention rights were not severable from one 
another. Non-governmental organizations and experts considered the proviso that &#8220;the State 
party may adopt a range of possible policy measures for the implementation of economic, 
social and cultural rights in the Convention&#8221; a commentary rather than a principle, and one 
that undermined article 4 of the Convention, which required States parties to take all 
appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures, and not just policy measures, for 
the implementation of all Convention rights. There were situations where only one measure 
was possible: for example, when a State must cease a violation.  
</p>
<p>76. In response to the question posed by one delegation, the Committee members stated 
that the adoption of a communications procedure would not require additional sessions of 
the Committee. Rather, the Committee could handle its additional workload by establishing 
special working groups, redistributing tasks among its members and replacing consensus by 
vote, if need be. 
</p>
<p>77. With regard to the documentation to be consulted by the Committee when 
examining communications under the protocol, one delegation pointed out that such 
documentation may only emanate from United Nations entities &#8220;and other international 
organizations&#8221;.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  O. Follow-up to the views of the Committee 
</b></p>

<p>80. Some delegations proposed that States should not only report on measures taken in 
the light of the views and recommendations, but also on measures envisaged.  
</p>
<p><b>  P. Inquiry procedure for grave or systematic violations 
</b></p>
<p>81. Most delegations reaffirmed the key importance of the inquiry procedure 
mechanism. However, some expressed concern at the risk of duplication. A proposal was 
made in that respect that would exclude the Committee&#8217;s competence when the same 
situation was being considered under another similar international inquiry mechanism.  
</p>
<p>82. One delegation considered &#8220;grave or systematic violations&#8221; a vague threshold. 
Another delegation stated that the reference to the Convention and its two Optional 
Protocols for describing the Committee&#8217;s <i>ratione materiae </i>competence should be worded 
similarly as for the other procedures under the protocol. 
</p>
<p>83. Representatives of national human rights institutions and experts suggested 
including an explicit reference to those institutions as sources of information. 
</p>
<p>84. One delegation stated that, together with its findings, the Committee should only 
transmit &#8220;relevant&#8221; comments and recommendations to the State party concerned.  
</p>
<p>85. Many delegations expressed concern over the brevity of a three-month time limit for 
States to provide their observations to the Committee, and preferred a six-month time limit 
instead. Different compromise proposals were made, including one to the effect that the 
State party concerned &#8220;shall, as soon as possible within six months of receiving the 
findings, comments and recommendations transmitted by the Committee, submit its 
observations to the Committee&#8221;. While one delegation welcomed the extension of the time 
frame from three to six months, another delegation suggested deleting &#8220;as soon as 
possible&#8221;, as it was a legally uncertain concept. Some delegations stated that this time 
frame should be aligned with those stipulated for the other procedures under the protocol. It 
was also suggested that a State party&#8217;s observations shall be reflected, in case that the State 
party agreed to include a summary account of the results of the inquiry in the Committee&#8217;s 
annual report to the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>86. Numerous delegations supported the inclusion of an opt-out provision with regard to 
the inquiry procedure to promote wider acceptance of the protocol. Apart from withdrawal, 
one delegation suggested allowing States to amend their opt-out declaration. Several 
delegations favoured replacing the opt-out by an opt-in clause, following the example of the 
inter-State procedure. Many delegations, non-governmental organizations and experts, 
including Committee members, argued that the Committee&#8217;s competence to conduct 
inquiries into grave or systematic violations must not be optional and asked for the deletion 
of any possibility for States to opt-in or opt-out of this procedure. Another delegation 
suggested reformulating the provisions on the inquiry procedure based on articles 11 and 12 
of the Optional Protocol to the  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>87. Responding to questions regarding the management of inquiries, Committee 
members noted that this procedure could be dealt with by a working group of the 
Committee. On questions regarding the concept of &#8220;reliable information&#8221; and the 
characterization of &#8220;grave or systematic violations&#8221;, they responded that the criteria should 
be included in the rules of procedure and be based on the Committee&#8217;s experience and 
jurisprudence on the matter. <b> </b></p>


<p><b>  Q. Follow-up to the inquiry procedure 
</b></p>
<p>88. A number of States expressed concern about a period of three-months for the State 
to report on follow-up measures and suggested a longer one. Some delegations suggested 
that the State should not only report on measures taken but also on those envisaged. Thus, it 
was proposed that the Committee &#8220;may, if necessary, after the end of the period of six 
months&#8221; given to the State party to submit its observations, &#8220;invite the State party 
concerned to inform it of the measures taken and envisaged in response to such an inquiry&#8221; 
or invite it to include such information in its reports under article 44 of the Convention, 
article 12 of the Optional Protocol on the sale of children or article 8 of the Optional 
Protocol on children in armed conflict, as appropriate. Some delegations favoured replacing 
the proposed text by the wording of the provision on follow-up to the Committee&#8217;s views. 
One State suggested inserting &#8220;and, where appropriate,&#8221; before referring to the Optional 
Protocols. 
</p>
<p><b>  R. Inter-State communications 
</b></p>
<p>89. The Chairperson-Rapporteur indicated that this provision, as formulated in his initial 
proposal, was based on article 32 of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance and recalled that, in practice, the inter-State 
communications procedure had, to date, never been used under any of the human rights 
treaties of the United Nations. Some delegations expressed doubts about whether this 
provision would serve any purpose, and one suggested the inclusion of an opt-out clause. 
Some delegations suggested including a good offices function of the Committee following 
the example of article 10 (d) of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, like in article 10 of that Optional 
Protocol, the modalities of the inter-State procedure should be spelled out in more detail. 
These suggestions were reflected in the revised proposal. No further suggestions for 
amendment were made during the second part of the session. 
</p>
<p><b>  S. International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>90. A few delegations affirmed that they were not in favour of the creation of new funds 
to assist States in the implementation of recommendations under the optional protocol. 
Such a provision would weaken article 45 of the Convention and did not belong in a 
procedural instrument. UNICEF affirmed that it would extend its support concerning 
communications and inquiries, and stressed that new assistance mechanisms should not be 
needed. 
</p>
<p>91. Some States, however, alluded to the need, or were flexible to, the possibility of 
establishing a new mechanism/fund, especially for third-world countries.  
</p>
<p><b>  T. Standard provisions 
</b></p>

<p>against a State that was a party to the instrument under which the communication was 
presented.  
</p>
<p>94. With regard to dissemination and information on the optional protocol, several 
delegations, non-governmental organizations and experts indicated that information about 
the protocol and the views and recommendations of the Committee be disseminated &#8220;by 
appropriate, accessible and active means to adults and children alike, including those with 
disabilities&#8221;. A suggestion to replace &#8220;including those with disabilities&#8221; with &#8220;irrespective 
of their personal skills, impairments and economic resources&#8221; was not supported. 
Numerous delegations were in favour of adding &#8220;and formats&#8221; after &#8220;active means&#8221;, in line 
with the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
and to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Some 
delegations suggested including a reference to child-friendly means. One delegation 
suggested adding &#8220;and other disadvantaged persons&#8221; at the end of the provision. Two 
delegations were in favour of adding an additional sentence providing that &#8220;States should 
strive, in particular, to facilitate access for children to information regarding the activities 
and the functioning of the Committee&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>95. A proposal was made to include an article limiting the Committee&#8217;s <i>ratione temporis</i> 
competence to violations occurring after the entry into force of the optional protocol for the 
State party concerned. Some delegations were in favour of this inclusion for the sake of 
clarity. Other delegations, non-governmental organizations and experts, including 
Committee members, considered, however, that such an article would be redundant, as this 
matter was sufficiently covered in the admissibility criteria and in the general provisions. 
Some stressed that it would even be contrary to the provision according to which the 
Committee could declare a communication inadmissible when the facts had occurred prior 
to the entry into force of the protocol for the State concerned unless those facts continued 
after that date. The proposed article potentially undermined the latter provision by not 
taking into account continuous or ongoing violations that started prior to the entry into 
force of the protocol.  
</p>
<p><b>  U. Reservations</b>17<b> 
</b></p>
<p>96. Numerous delegations did not favour the inclusion of a provision stating that no 
reservations to the protocol should be permitted; they considered that such a provision 
would discourage many States from adhering to the protocol and that the reservations 
regime governed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which only prohibits 
reservations that are incompatible with the object and purpose of a treaty, was sufficient. A 
number of delegations, experts, including Committee members, and non-governmental 
organizations supported such a prohibition, as no reservations should be permissible to a 
procedural instrument that does not create any new substantive rights. They recalled that 
the Vienna Convention explicitly allowed for the prohibition of reservations in a treaty. It 
was also recalled that an explicit prohibition was in line with article 17 of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women and article 30 of the Optional Protocol to the  Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In the case of those Optional 
Protocols, the prohibition of reservations had not adversely affected the number of 
ratifications. Reservations to procedural instruments were per se incompatible with their 
object and purpose. 
</p>

<p>97. One delegation challenged that all reservations to the Protocol would be 
impermissible. As a compromise, it suggested deleting all opt-in and opt-out clauses in 
return for the deletion of the proposed prohibition of reservations. Several delegations were 
against reducing the flexibility for States by deleting the opt-in and opt-out provisions. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Closure of proceedings and adoption of the report 
</b></p>

<p>communications, expressed disappointment that the protection standards that it contained 
were not as high as expected. 
</p>
<p>108. The representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights stated that it was in the nature of a compromise that the parties to it would 
not be fully pleased. Nevertheless, the adoption of the draft optional protocol was a historic 
moment in the progressive development of international human rights law. He hoped that, 
in the future, the Committee would be provided with sufficient resources to comply with its 
mandate under the optional protocol.  
</p>
<p>109. The International Commission of Jurists and the NGO Group for the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child took the view that the process of adoption had been too hasty, with 
not enough time to consider fully a number of complex legal issues. Further discussions 
might be necessary before the seventeenth session of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>110. At its final meeting, on 16 February 2011, the Working Group adopted the report on  </p>
<p>its second session ad referendum. The text of the draft optional protocol, as adopted by the 
Working Group, is annexed to the present report. </p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child to provide a communications procedure 
</b></p>
<p><i>The States parties to the present Protocol,  
</i></p>
<p><i>Considering </i>that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the 
United Nations, the recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights 
of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the 
world,  
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that the States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(hereinafter referred to as the Convention) recognize the rights set forth in it to each child 
within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child&#8217;s or his 
or her parent&#8217;s or legal guardian&#8217;s race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the status of the child as a subject of rights and as a human being 
with dignity and with evolving capacities,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that children&#8217;s special and dependent status may create real difficulties 
for them in pursuing remedies for violations of their rights,  
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that the present Protocol will reinforce and complement national and 
regional mechanisms allowing children to submit complaints for violations of their rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration to 
be respected in pursuing remedies for violations of the rights of the child, and that such 
remedies should take into account the need for child-sensitive procedures at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging</i> States parties to develop appropriate national mechanisms to enable a 
child whose rights have been violated to have access to effective remedies at the domestic 
level,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the important role that national human rights institutions and other 
relevant specialized institutions, mandated to promote and protect the rights of the child, 
can play in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that, in order to reinforce and complement such national mechanisms 
and to further enhance the implementation of the Convention and, where applicable, the 
Optional Protocols thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
and on the involvement of children in armed conflict, it would be appropriate to enable the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) to carry out 
the functions provided for in the present Protocol,

<p><i>Have agreed </i>as follows: </p>


<p><b>  Part I  
General provisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Article 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Competence of the Committee on the Rights of the Child  
</b></p>
<p>1. A State party to the present Protocol recognizes the competence of the Committee as 
provided for by the present Protocol.  
</p>
<p>2. The Committee shall not exercise its competence regarding a State party to the 
present Protocol on matters concerning violations of rights set forth in an instrument to 
which that State is not a party. 
</p>
<p>3. No communication shall be received by the Committee if it concerns a State that is 
not a party to the present Protocol.  
</p>
<p><b>  Article 2  
</b></p>
<p><b>  General principles guiding the functions of the Committee 
</b></p>
<p> In fulfilling the functions conferred on it by the present Protocol, the Committee 
shall be guided by the principle of the best interests of the child. It shall also have regard for 
the rights and views of the child, the views of the child being given due weight in 
accordance with the age and maturity of the child. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 3 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Rules of procedure 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Committee shall adopt rules of procedure to be followed when exercising the 
functions conferred on it by the present Protocol. In doing so, it shall have regard, in 
particular, for article 2 of the present Protocol in order to guarantee child-sensitive 
procedures.

behalf without such consent. 
</p>
<p><b>  Article 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Interim measures

necessary in exceptional circumstances to avoid possible irreparable damage to the victim 
or victims of the alleged violations.  
</p>
<p>2. Where the Committee exercises its discretion under paragraph 1 of the present

bring effective relief;  
</p>
<p> (f) The communication is manifestly ill-founded or not sufficiently 
substantiated;  
</p>
<p> (g) The facts that are the subject of the communication occurred prior to the 
entry into force of the present Protocol for the State party concerned, unless those facts 
continued after that date;

domestic remedies, except in cases where the author can demonstrate that it had not been 
possible to submit the communication within that time limit.   
</p>
<p><b>  Article 8  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Transmission of the communication 
</b></p>

in accordance with article 4 of the Convention. In doing so, the Committee shall bear in </p>


<p>mind that the State party may adopt a range of possible policy measures for the 
implementation of the economic, social and cultural rights in the Convention.
