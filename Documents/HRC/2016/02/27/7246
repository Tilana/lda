<p> 
</p>

<p><b>I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 27/6, the Human Rights Council decided to convene, at its twenty-
</p>
<p>ninth session, a panel discussion on realizing the equal enjoyment of the right to education 
</p>
<p>by every girl with a view to sharing lessons learned and best practices in that regard. Also 
</p>
<p>in resolution 27/6, the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights to organize the panel and to liaise with States, relevant United Nations 
</p>
<p>agencies, funds and programmes, relevant special procedures, civil society, including 
</p>
<p>relevant children&#8217;s and youth organizations, national human rights institutions and other 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders with a view to ensuring their participation in and contribution to the 
</p>
<p>panel discussion. Pursuant to that request, the panel discussion was held on 16 June 2015. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 27/6, the Human Rights Council also requested the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner to prepare a summary report on the panel discussion and to present it to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council at its thirtieth session. The present report was prepared pursuant to 
</p>
<p>that request. 
</p>
<p>3. The High Commissioner opened the panel discussion, which was moderated by the 
</p>
<p>Associate Director of Programme Partnerships (Division of Programmes) at the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF). The panellists were Minister of State of the United 
</p>
<p>Arab Emirates Reem Al Hashimy; the Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women and Chairperson of its working group on 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s right to education, Barbara Bailey; the Special Rapporteur on the right 
</p>
<p>to education, Kishore Singh; UNICEF Ethiopia Goodwill Ambassador Hannah Godefa; and 
</p>
<p>the Regional Director for the West African Region of Plan International, Adama Coulibaly. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of the discussion 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Statement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>4. In his opening remarks, the High Commissioner stated that the empowerment of 
</p>
<p>women had been one of the most significant achievements of the past century, and access to 
</p>
<p>education one of the key elements in overturning the outdated view of women as confined 
</p>
<p>to the domestic sphere. He stressed that education was a multiplier right that empowers 
</p>
<p>women to make choices and to claim their human rights, including the right to participate 
</p>
<p>fully in the taking of decisions that shape society. He welcomed the considerable progress 
</p>
<p>that had been made in girls&#8217; education in recent years. 
</p>
<p>5. Nonetheless, almost one third of all countries had not achieved parity in primary 
</p>
<p>education. and in less than half, there were as many girls as boys in lower-secondary 
</p>
<p>grades. Despite the progress made, discrimination against girls persisted, including in the 
</p>
<p>form of child marriage, early pregnancy and sexual violence, and harassment inside and 
</p>
<p>outside schools. Together with social and cultural stereotypes that enforce obedience and 
</p>
<p>fixed gender constructs, violence against girls and the targeting of schools by extremist 
</p>
<p>movements continued to impair girls&#8217; access to education. 
</p>
<p>6. The High Commissioner also noted that, as a result of deeply entrenched 
</p>
<p>discrimination, girls continued to be corralled into specific fields of study, which were often 
</p>
<p>not those in high demand on the labour market. Young women, even when well-educated, 
</p>
<p>consistently experienced higher unemployment rates than men, worked in more precarious 
</p>
<p>jobs and were paid less for work of equal value. Enabling women and girls to obtain 
</p>
<p>qualifications, but subsequently denying them the right to pursue their aspirations in full 
</p>
<p>equality with men, did a disservice to young women and was a waste of many talents. </p>


<p>7. The High Commissioner emphasized that the culture of discrimination deeply 
</p>
<p>entrenched in many societies should be challenged so as to allow women and girls to 
</p>
<p>achieve their full potential and to deploy the skills that they have learned. He recalled the 
</p>
<p>key role that education could play in dismantling persistent gender stereotypes that may 
</p>
<p>have a profound impact on girls&#8217; health, self-confidence, vulnerability to violence and their 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of every other human right. Pointing out that Girls&#8217; education was imperative in 
</p>
<p>achieving the new agenda for development, the High Commissioner called upon States to 
</p>
<p>take urgent measures to ensure that all girls had effective and safe access to education of 
</p>
<p>quality, including human rights education. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Overview of presentations by the panellists  
</b></p>
<p>8. The panel moderator recalled that the right to education had been acknowledged as a 
</p>
<p>multiplier right and stressed that, in spite of the remarkable progress made in increasing 
</p>
<p>enrolment, gaps remained, particularly in the area of ensuring education for girls from 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged backgrounds and in emergency situations. 
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Al Hashimy pointed out that States would be unable to meet current 
</p>
<p>development goals and targets if they failed to empower women. She referred to some of 
</p>
<p>the challenges that the United Arab Emirates had faced in achieving its Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goal on education, including the low level of development and absence of 
</p>
<p>governance and institutions. These challenges also presented opportunities for building an 
</p>
<p>education system based on the principle of gender equality funded by the State&#8217;s income 
</p>
<p>deriving from natural resources. Robust legal frameworks had been adopted, including 
</p>
<p>compulsory, free-of-charge primary education and the establishment of 18 years as the 
</p>
<p>minimum age for marriage. The State&#8217;s robust formal school system reflected the principle 
</p>
<p>of gender equality: 90 per cent of girls and 87 per cent of boys were enrolled in primary 
</p>
<p>education, while 95 per cent of girls and 80 per cent of boys who graduated from high 
</p>
<p>school entered higher education. In addition, women in the United Arab Emirates 
</p>
<p>constituted 70 per cent of college graduates, one of the highest proportions in the world. 
</p>
<p>She emphasized that any State that prioritized education in its budget and built an 
</p>
<p>educational system founded on the principles of gender equality and the rights of the child 
</p>
<p>would obtain positive results. 
</p>
<p>10. Ms. Bailey outlined various ways in which structural and ideological factors 
</p>
<p>hindered access to education for girls. She referred in particular to entrenched sociocultural 
</p>
<p>norms and stereotypes, which dictated gender relations in the family, including the 
</p>
<p>allocation of resources within the family and determing what a given generation considered 
</p>
<p>appropriate gender roles. This often resulted in gender inequalities, including in the area of 
</p>
<p>access to schooling and participation in the formal work force, with women being 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged. She referred to the incidence of early and forced marriages and adolescent 
</p>
<p>pregnancy, and the marked preference for boys as examples that exacerbated the continued 
</p>
<p>subordination of females in the private and public domains. To address this challenge, 
</p>
<p>women had to have the right to exercise personal autonomy and greater control over their 
</p>
<p>sexual and reproductive health and rights. In addition, in order for women to become 
</p>
<p>economically independent and less reliant on male patronage, they had to be able to move 
</p>
<p>out of the private sphere into paid decent work in the formal labour market. Women had to 
</p>
<p>be able to participate more fully in political processes and decision-making at all levels.  
</p>
<p>11. Mr. Singh welcomed the recognition of the right to education as a multiplier right, 
</p>
<p>and stressed that making it a true right required entitlement and empowerment. He 
</p>
<p>described inclusive, non-discriminatory education as a core element of the right to 
</p>
<p>education. He also stressed the need for quality, human rights-based education in all areas &#8211; 
</p>
<p>knowledge, values, competence and skills &#8211; as well as the importance of focusing on the </p>


<p>contents of education. He recalled that States had an obligation to translate their 
</p>
<p>international obligations into national policies, and emphasized the need for an adequate 
</p>
<p>legal framework as the foundation for the equal right to education. In the area of education, 
</p>
<p>this obligation included temporary special measures and ensuring gender parity and access 
</p>
<p>to education by marginalized communities, including rural communities. Mr. Singh further 
</p>
<p>explained the need for developing strategies that linked literacy programmes and skills 
</p>
<p>development, and expressed concern about the mushrooming of privatization of education, 
</p>
<p>which disadvantaged women. 
</p>
<p>12. Ms. Godefa focused her intervention on the role of young people, including girls, in 
</p>
<p>the development of education policies. She stated that Governments could ensure that all 
</p>
<p>girls had access to education by making it a State priority and by working with youth 
</p>
<p>groups to give them a voice in education policies. The barriers to girls&#8217; access to education 
</p>
<p>could be both direct and indirect, including, for example, trafficking. To ensure that girls 
</p>
<p>were able to enjoy the right to education on an equal footing with boys, she recommended 
</p>
<p>that States provide stipends and scholarships, and free or subsidized child care for girls with 
</p>
<p>children, as well as income transfer programmes for poor families, so that girls were not 
</p>
<p>removed from schools for economic reasons. She also recommended that schools be 
</p>
<p>constructed locally and closer to communities as a means to increase enrolment and to 
</p>
<p>lower the indirect costs of sending girls to school. She also stressed the importance of 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising by youth groups and States in the domestic and global spheres. 
</p>
<p>13. Mr. Coulibaly recounted the story of his sister to highlight the multiple barriers to 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; education, which included the cost of education, the distance to schools, violence in 
</p>
<p>and around schools, harmful gender norms, child marriage and early pregnancy. Such 
</p>
<p>barriers became insurmountable during emergencies and in conflict situations, and were 
</p>
<p>particularly acute for marginalized and excluded populations, particularly girls with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and those belonging to minority groups. He pointed out that emergencies often 
</p>
<p>led to disruptions in education after which many children never returned to school, while 
</p>
<p>those who stayed received poor quality education as a result of an unsafe and inadequate 
</p>
<p>learning environment. For girls, even a short interruption caused by an emergency situation 
</p>
<p>could lead not only to missing out on education but also expose them to the risk of child 
</p>
<p>marriage, trafficking and other forms of gender-based violence. Emergencies could 
</p>
<p>nonetheless offer the opportunity to rebuild more a resilient community or to change norms 
</p>
<p>and behaviours that hindered girls&#8217; education. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Interventions by representatives of States Members of the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council, observer States and other observers 
</b></p>
<p>14. In their interventions, States emphasized the importance that they placed on 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing girls&#8217; equal access to education and described specific programmes and 
</p>
<p>policies to overcome obstacles and challenges in this regard. A number of representatives 
</p>
<p>referred to good practices at the national level, including enshrining the right to education 
</p>
<p>in the Constitution and enacting specific laws to guarantee free primary and secondary 
</p>
<p>education. States also referred to measures taken to reduce the distance between schools 
</p>
<p>and homes, investments in infrastructure and special measures such as scholarships, school 
</p>
<p>uniforms and the removal of other education-related costs for children from marginalized 
</p>
<p>communities. A number of States pointed out that women often achieved less in their 
</p>
<p>careers and in the labour market owing to deeply rooted stereotypes in public 
</p>
<p>consciousness, while several expressed their concern about gender stereotypes, including in 
</p>
<p>fields of study reserved for girls. 
</p>
<p>15. Several speakers expressed their concern that gender parity had not been achieved in 
</p>
<p>education owing to, inter alia, gender and ideological stereotypes, violence and </p>


<p>discrimination against girls both in and around schools, harmful practices such as female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation and child, early and forced child marriage, the militarization of school 
</p>
<p>premises in situations of conflict, attacks against schools, and threats to the security and 
</p>
<p>safety of female students. A number of speakers referred to the Safe Schools Declaration, 
</p>
<p>which focuses on education for children in conflict situations, signed to date by 47 States. 
</p>
<p>16. Several speakers highlighted the importance of a continued focus on education in the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 development framework as a means to ensure gender equality and the 
</p>
<p>empowerment of women and girls. Speakers referred to the need for good practices in the 
</p>
<p>areas of comprehensive sexuality education, education for girls in conflict settings, 
</p>
<p>addressing gender-based violence in and around schools, and the contents of education and 
</p>
<p>its role in gender stereotypes. Participants urged the Human Rights Council to prioritize 
</p>
<p>school-related gender-based violence in its agenda. Several States referred to the 
</p>
<p>importance of international cooperation to make schools safer, to empower women and to 
</p>
<p>obtain the necessary budgetary resources. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Concluding remarks by the panellists 
</b></p>
<p>17.<b> The panellists highlighted the importance of adopting and enforcing legislation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other polices on education in accordance with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards and on the basis of the principle of the best interests of the child. 
</b></p>
<p>18.<b> It was agreed that the provision of such basic services as separate sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilities and hygiene kits had enormous benefits in the enrolment and retention of 
</b></p>
<p><b>girls in schools. In addition, including comprehensive sexuality education in school 
</b></p>
<p><b>curricula was highlighted as a key action to help girls to avoid early pregnancy and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to address harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and child, early 
</b></p>
<p><b>and forced marriage.  
</b></p>
<p>19.<b> The panellists recommended that quality primary education should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>compulsory and free, and highlighted the importance of the transition to secondary 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. They referred to the importance of measures to prevent child and forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>marriages, including of setting the minimum legal age for marriage at 18. Appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional frameworks that prioritized education in budgetary allocations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>supported early childhood education, provided a safe and supportive environment in 
</b></p>
<p><b>schools and integrated a gender perspective into education policies were also 
</b></p>
<p><b>highlighted as necessary. They also stressed that education should be non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory, inclusive and culturally sensitive, and that education policies should 
</b></p>
<p><b>incorporate the voices of children and young people, including marginalized and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disadvantaged girls, such as girls with disabilities, and rural and poor girls, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>harness the power of social media as a means of changing education policies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraging girls to stay in school.  
</b></p>
<p>20.<b> The panellists also noted that education outcomes for girls were closely linked 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the division of labour between the sexes, gender stereotypes and gender-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, violence and abuse, and that many women and girls were therefore 
</b></p>
<p><b>unable to enjoy the multiplier effect of education. Most current education systems, it 
</b></p>
<p><b>was noted, failed to live up to their potential as catalysts for equality between men and 
</b></p>
<p><b>women, but rather strengthened the existing gender order and helped to maintain 
</b></p>
<p><b>hierarchies within schools and in the wider community. It was therefore important to 
</b></p>
<p><b>review the content of education so as to remove all discriminatory elements.  
</b></p>
<p>21.<b> In Ethiopia, girl clubs, in which girls at the local level were involved in 
</b></p>
<p><b>mitigating school- and community-based barriers to education by liaising with school 
</b></p>
<p><b>management and parents to advocate for changes such as separate sanitation facilities, </b></p>


<p><b>were cited a good practice. In the area of social media, in South Africa, the UNICEF 
</b></p>
<p><b>Techno Girl programme, which connects more than 10,000 adolescent girls in 
</b></p>
<p><b>underprivileged schools with mentors from the technological sector in order to boost 
</b></p>
<p><b>their skills and job readiness, was also cited as a good practice. States were invited to 
</b></p>
<p><b>heed the concluding recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Women and to note the </b>Committee&#8217;s <b>upcoming general 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendation on addressing obligations in all dimensions of the right to education.  
</b></p>
<p>22.<b> With regard to disasters and emergency settings, the panellists concurred that 
</b></p>
<p><b>even the worst situations could offer opportunities to strengthen communities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>make them more resilient and more inclusive and equal. In addition, good education 
</b></p>
<p><b>in emergencies could bring both short-term protective and long-term transformative 
</b></p>
<p><b>change. For example, the Plan International programmes for internally displaced 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons and refugees in Mali and South Sudan had allowed many girls to attend 
</b></p>
<p><b>formal and non-formal education, often for the first time. As a result, not only did 
</b></p>
<p><b>more girls have access to education but were also better prepared to participate in 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making, which had in turn led to a gradual change in community attitudes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The panellists encouraged States to take preventive measures to minimize disruptions 
</b></p>
<p><b>to education during disasters, to have education sector plans based on gender-sensitive 
</b></p>
<p><b>and participatory approaches in all phases of emergency responses, and to establish a 
</b></p>
<p><b>funding mechanism for education in emergencies. They also recommended that States 
</b></p>
<p><b>pay greater attention to the human rights of children in emergencies, </b>including girls&#8217; 
</p>
<p><b>right to education, and include related issues in their engagement with the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations human rights system, including the treaty bodies, the universal periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>review and the special procedures. 
</b></p>
<p>23.<b> The panellists also emphasized underlined that, in order to implement fully the 
</b></p>
<p><b>equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl, States had to remove 
</b></p>
<p><b>structural barriers to education, such as gender bias and stereotypes from curricula 
</b></p>
<p><b>and teaching and learning materials, and ensure girls</b>&#8217;<b> safety in schools, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>through the provision of adequate sanitary facilities and safe drinking water, as well 
</b></p>
<p><b>as protection from sexual harassment, abuse and violence in the school environment. 
</b></p>
<p><b>They should in addition ensure the justiciability of the right to education. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>panellists encouraged States collectively to make the vision of every girl enjoying full 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to education a reality. 
</b></p>
