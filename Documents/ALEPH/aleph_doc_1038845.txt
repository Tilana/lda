PART I 
 
Item 1.   Description of Business 
 
GeoGlobal Resources Inc. is engaged, through our subsidiaries and joint ventures in which we are a participant, 
in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas reserves.  At present, these activities are being 
undertaken  in  locations  where  we  and  our  joint  venture  participants  have  been  granted  exploration  rights 
pursuant to production sharing contracts (“PSCs”) we have entered into with the Government of India ("GOI") 
under  its  New  Exploration  Licensing  Policy  (“NELP”)  bidding  processes.    As  of  April  13,  2007,  we  have 
entered into contracts with respect to ten of these exploration blocks as follows: 
•
The first of our agreements, entered into in February 2003 under NELP-III, grants exploration rights in an 
area offshore eastern India in the Krishna Godavari Basin in the State of Andhra Pradesh.  We refer to this 
KG-OSN-2001/3 exploration block as the “KG Offshore Block” and we have a net 5% carried interest 
(“CI”) under this agreement.
•
•
•  We entered into two agreements which grant exploration rights in areas onshore in the Cambay Basin in 
the State of Gujarat in western India.  These agreements were entered into in February 2004 under NELP-
IV and we have a 10% participating interest (“PI”) under each of these agreements.  We refer to the CB-
ONN-2002/2 exploration block as the “Mehsana Block” and the CB-ONN-2002/3 exploration block as 
the “Sanand/Miroli Block.” 
Pursuant  to  an  agreement  entered  into  in  April  2005,  we  purchased  from  Gujarat  State  Petroleum 
Corporation  Limited  (“GSPC”),  a  20%  PI  in  the  agreement  granting  exploration  rights  granted  under 
NELP-III to an onshore exploration block in the Cambay Basin in the State of Gujarat in western India.  
We refer to this CB-ON/2 exploration block as the “Tarapur Block”. 
In September 2005, we entered into agreements with respect to two areas under NELP-V.  One area is 
located  onshore  in  the  Cambay  Basin  located  in  the  State  of  Gujarat  south-east  of  our  three  existing 
Cambay blocks, for which we hold a 10% PI.  We refer to this CB-ONN-2003/2 exploration block as the 
“Ankleshwar Block”.  The second area is located onshore in the Deccan Syneclise Basin located in the 
northern portion of the State of Maharashtra in west-central India for which we hold a 100% PI interest 
and are the operator.  We refer to this DS-ONN-2003/1 exploration block as the “DS 03 Block”. 
In March 2007, we signed agreements with respect to four additional locations awarded under NELP-VI.   
(cid:131) 
One area is located onshore in the Krishna Godavari Basin in the State of Andhra Pradesh adjacent 
to our KG Offshore Block in eastern India in which we hold a 10% PI.  We currently refer to this 
KG-ONN-2004/1 exploration block as the “KG Onshore Block”. 
The second area includes two agreements located onshore in north-west India in the Rajasthan Basin 
in the State of Rajasthan and we hold a 25% PI in each of the agreements.  We currently refer to the 
RJ-ONN-2004/2 exploration block as the “RJ Block 20” and the RJ-ONN-2004/3 exploration block 
as the “RJ Block 21”. 
The  fourth  area  is  located  onshore  in  the  Deccan  Syneclise  Basin  in  the  State  of  Maharashtra 
adjacent  to  our  DS  03  Block  in  west-central  India  for  which  we  hold  a  100%  PI  and  are  the 
operator.  We currently refer to this DS-ONN-2004/1 exploration block as the "DS 04 Block".

(cid:131)
To date, we have not earned any revenue from these activities and we are considered to be in the development 
stage.  The recoverability of the costs we have incurred to date is uncertain and dependent upon us achieving 
commercial  production  and  sale  of  hydrocarbons,  our  ability  to  obtain  sufficient  financing  to  fulfill  our 
obligations under the PSCs in India and upon future profitable operations and upon finalizing agreements with 
GSPC. 
All of the exploration activities in which we are a participant should be considered highly speculative. 
All dollar amounts stated in this annual report are stated in United States dollars.

Our Krishna Godavari Basin Agreements 
KG Offshore Block 
We, along with our joint venture partners GSPC and Jubilant Oil & Gas Pvt. Ltd. ("Jubilant") are parties to a 
PSC dated February 4, 2003 which grants to the three parties the right to conduct exploratory drilling activities 
in the shallower waters of the Krishna Godavari Basin.  The PSC covers an area of approximately 1,850 square 
kilometers  ("sq  kms")  (457,145  acres)  and  was  awarded  under  NELP-III.    We  have  a  net  5%  CI  in  this 
exploration block.  The exploration phase for this PSC extends for a term of up to 6.5 years commencing on 
March 12, 2003.  The first two phases cover a period of 2.5 years each, and the last phase covers a period of 1.5 
years.  During the first exploration phase, the parties are to acquire, process and interpret 1,250 sq km of 3-D 
seismic data, reprocess 2,298.4 line kilometers ("LKMs") of 2-D seismic data and conduct a bathymetric survey, 
all of which has been completed.  In addition, we are to drill a total of fourteen exploratory wells between 900 to 
4,118  meters.    During  the  second  and  third  phases,  if  the  parties  elect  to  proceed  with  them,  in  addition  to 
bathymetric surveys in connection with each phase, the parties are to drill four exploratory wells between 1,100 
to 2,850 meters and two exploratory wells to 1,550 and 1,950 meters, respectively.   
KG Onshore Block 
We, along with out joint venture partner Oil India Limited ("OIL") are parties to a PSC dated March 2, 2007.  
The PSC covers an area of approximately 548 sq km (135,414 acres) onshore in the Krishna Godavari Basin, is 
located directly adjacent to and south-west of our KG Offshore Block and was awarded under NELP-VI.  We 
hold a 10% PI in this exploration block, while OIL, as operator, holds the remaining 90% PI.  On September 14, 
2006, prior to submission of our NELP-VI bid, we entered into an agreement with OIL to increase our PI up to 
25% in this exploration block, subject to the availability of sufficient net worth and GOI consent. 
The exploration phase for this PSC extends for a term of up to 7 years and will commence upon the date the 
Production Exploration Licence ("PEL") is issued.  The Phase I work commitment which covers a period of 4 
years, consists of reprocessing 564 LKM of 2-D seismic, conducting a gravity and magnetic and geochemical 
survey,  as  well  as  a  seismic  acquisition  program  consisting  of  548  sq  km  of  3-D  seismic.    This  Phase  I 
commitment further consists of the drilling of 12 exploration wells to various depths between 2,000 and 5,000 
meters.  The Phase II work commitment which covers a period of 3 years is to drill one exploration well to a 
depth of 4,600 meters. 
Our Krishna Godavari Basin Exploration Activities 
The KG Offshore Block 
As of April 13, 2007, GSPC as operator has completed the acquisition, processing and interpretation of a 1,298 
sq  km  marine  3-D  seismic  program  as  well  as  completed  an  additional  marine  3-D  seismic  program  of 
approximately 300 sq km.  This data has been processed and interpreted. 
GSPC  currently  has  contracted  with  Saipem  SPA,  part  of  ENI,  Italy,  for  the  Saipem  Perro  Negro  3  jack-up 
drilling rig to drill 10 exploratory wells, with an option of extending the contract for 2 additional exploratory 
wells.  As of April 13, 2007, the Saipem Perro Negro 3 drilling rig has drilled five exploratory wells and is 
currently drilling an additional exploration well that has been classified by the management committee as an 
appraisal well for the purposes of the PSC.  Two of the five exploratory wells, the KG#1 drilled in 2004 and the 
KG#11 drilled in 2005 have both been abandoned. 
GSPC  has  also  entered  into  a  25  month  contract  with  Atwood  Oceanics  Inc.,  a  Houston  based  International 
Offshore Drilling Contractor, for the Atwood Beacon jack-up drilling rig to drill additional exploration wells on 
the KG Offshore Block.  The Atwood Beacon drilling rig is currently drilling one exploratory well. 
The  KG#8  exploratory  well  was  drilled  to  a  depth  of  5,061  meters  and  10  meters  of  perforations  across  the 
interval from 4,747.5 to 4,777 meters were tested which resulted in a stabilized flow rate in excess of 10 million 
standard cubic feet per day ("MMSCFD") of gas at a wellhead flowing pressure of 4,500 psi. 
The KG#17 exploratory well was drilled from the KG#8 platform directionally to a location 1.81 kilometers to 
the  northeast  of  the  KG#8  wellhead  location  to  a  depth  of  5,601  meters  (5,223  meters  total  vertical  depth 
("TVD")).    Twenty  meters  of  perforations  across  the  interval  from  3,801  to  3,830  meters  was  tested  which 
resulted in a stabilized flow rate of 4.8 MMSCFD of gas plus 900 barrels per day ("BBLD") of condensate at a 
wellhead flowing pressure of 1,900 psi through a 24/64 inch choke. 
The KG#15 exploratory well was drilled also from the KG#8 platform directionally to a location 750 meters 
south southeast of the KG#8 wellhead location to a depth of 5,745 meters (5,669 meters TVD).  Thirty three
5
meters of perforations across the interval from 4,651 to 4,705 meters were tested which resulted in a stabilized 
flow rate of in excess of 14 MMSCFD of gas plus 300 BBLD of condensate at a wellhead flowing pressure of 
4,200 psi through a 28/64 inch choke.  An additional 33 meters of perforations across the interval from 4,464 to 
4,587  meters  were  tested  which  resulted  in  a  stabilized  flow  rate  of  8.5  MMSCFD  of  gas  plus  55  BBLD  of 
condensate at a wellhead flowing pressure of 3,893 psi through a 20/64 inch choke. 
On  February  6,  2007,  the  Saipem  Perro  Negro  3  rig  commenced  drilling  the  KG#28  well  from  the  KG#8 
platform.    The  KG#28  well  will  be  the  sixth  exploration  well  drilled  by  the  Saipem  Perro  Negro  3  jack-up 
drilling rig.  The KG#28 well, has been classified by the management committee as an “appraisal well” for the 
purposes  of  the  PSC  and  it  will  be  drilled  directionally  to  a  total  vertical  depth  (“TVD”)  of  5,500  meters 
deviating approximately 1,500 meters east of the KG#8 wellhead location. 
On January 3, 2007, the Atwood Beacon rig commenced drilling the KG#16 well.  This is the first exploratory 
well to be drilled using the Atwood Beacon rig.  The KG#16 well is situated approximately 5 kilometres east of 
the location where the Saipem Perro Negro 3 jack-up drilling rig is located.  The KG#16 well is being drilled 
vertically to an intended depth of 5,500 meters TVD in shallow waters of approximately 109 meters to further 
delineate the extent of the KG structure. 
GSPC has further entered into a contract with Essar Oilfield Services Limited (“EOSL”), a subsidiary of Essar 
Shipping & Logistics Ltd. of Cyprus, for a semi-submersible drilling rig named “Essar Wildcat”.  The Essar 
Wildcat is a self propelled drilling rig suitable for deployment in water depths of 400 meters and has a drilling 
depth capacity of 7,600 meters.  GSPC intends to commence drilling additional wells in the deeper water in the 
KG Offshore Block by the third quarter of 2007.  The initial term of the EOSL contract is for two years from the 
date of spud of the first well, with the option of two extensions, each for one year. 
The operating committee under the exploration contract relating to the KG Offshore Block has estimated that the 
total gross budget for the KG Offshore Block for the period April 2007 to March 2008 is $503.6 million.  We 
have a 5% net CI in the wells drilled on the KG Offshore Block.  See “Other Material Oil and Gas Agreements” 
below for a description of the Carried Interest Agreement. 
 
The KG Onshore Block 
OIL, as operator for this KG Onshore Block is in the process of applying for the PEL, which when issued will 
allow OIL to commence the Phase I work program commitments. 
We will be required to fund our 10% proportionate share of the costs incurred in these activities estimated to be 
approximately US$8.5 million over the four years of the first phase of the work commitment with respect to a 
10% participating interest in the block and, should we be successful in increasing our interest to 25%, we will be 
required to fund approximately US$21.3 million with respect to a 25% participating interest in the block..   
 
Matters Relating to Our KG Offshore Block PSC 
The first phase of the exploration period relating to the PSC for the KG Offshore Block has expired without the 
required minimum of at least fourteen exploration wells being drilled during the first phase.  GSPC, as operator 
and on behalf of the contracting parties, is engaged in seeking from the GOI its consent to an extension of the 
expiration date of the first phase of the exploration period and is also seeking to proceed to the second phase of 
the exploration period without relinquishing any of the contract area at the end of the first phase. In connection 
with  the  process  of  seeking  these  consents,  on  February  24,  2006,  the  management  committee  for  the  KG 
Offshore Block, which includes members representing the GOI, recommended a further extension of the first 
phase of twelve months to March 11, 2007.  On February 9 2007, GSPC proposed to the Directorate General of 
Hydrocarbons,  a  body  under  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  &  Natural  Gas  (“DGH”)  and  to  the  GOI  that  the 
contracting  parties  proceed  to  the  next  exploration  phase  (Phase  II)  upon  completion  of  Phase  I  which  was 
expiring on March 11, 2007.  It was also requested, on behalf of the contracting parties, to not relinquish any of 
the contract area at the end of Phase I.  On March 12, 2007 DGH noted the option of GSPC, on behalf of the 
contracting  parties,  to  enter  Phase  Two  and  advised  that  entry  into  Phase  Two,  effective  March  12,  2007,  is 
subject to the following conditions: (1) Any decision by the GOI on the substitution of the Work Program of 
Phase I will be binding on the contracting parties; and (2) Any decision by the GOI on relinquishment of the 
25% of original contract Area (ie. 462 sq. kms.) under the PSC would be binding on the contracting parties.  The 
extension of Phase I for the 18 months to March 11, 2007 would be deducted from Phase II.  As such the Phase 
II would have a term of one year and expire March 11, 2008.  As at April 13 2007, five exploratory wells have
6
been  drilled  and  one  exploratory  well,  the  KG#16  well,  is  currently  being  drilled  on  the  exploration  block 
leaving eight exploration wells to be drilled.  A seventh well, the KG#28 is also being drilled on the exploration 
block and has been classified by the management committee as an “appraisal well” for the purposes of the PSC. 
Approval  of  the  extension  and  the  entering  into  the  second  phase  of  exploration  under  the  PSC  without 
relinquishment of any portion of the contract area from the GOI is currently outstanding.  Unless this approval is 
granted, we may be liable for the consequences of non-fulfillment of the minimum work commitment in a given 
time frame under the PSC.  The PSC has provisions for termination of the PSC on account of various reasons 
specified  therein  including  material  breach  of  the  contract.    Termination  rights  can  be  exercised  after  giving 
ninety days written notice.  This failure to timely complete the minimum work commitment, though we have 
been advised by GSPC there is no precedence, may be deemed by the GOI to be a failure to comply with the 
provisions of the contract in a material particular.   
The termination of the PSC by the GOI would result in our loss of our interest in the KG Offshore Block other 
than  areas  determined  to  encompass  "commercial  discoveries".    The  PSC  sets  forth  procedures  whereby  the 
operator can obtain the review of the management committee under the PSC as to whether a discovery on the 
exploration block should be declared a commercial discovery under the PSC.  Those procedures have not been 
completed at present with respect to the discovery on the KG Offshore Block and, accordingly, as of April 13, 
2007,  no  areas  on  the  KG  Offshore  Block  have  been  determined  formally  to  encompass  "commercial 
discoveries" as that term is defined under the PSC. 
In the event the PSC for the KG Offshore Block is terminated by the GOI, or in the event the work program is 
not fulfilled by the end of the relevant exploration phase, the PSC provides that each party to the PSC is to pay 
to the GOI its participating interest share of an amount which is equal to the amount that would be required to 
complete the minimum work program for that phase.  We are of the view that GSPC, under the terms of our 
CIA, would be liable for our participating interest share of the amount required to complete the minimum work 
program for the phase. 
Our net 5% CI in the KG Offshore Block reflects our agreement to prospectively assign half of the original 10% 
interest under the PSC to Roy Group Mauritius ("RGM") a Mauritius corporation wholly owned by Mr. Jean 
Paul  Roy,  our  President,  CEO,  Director  and  principal  stockholder,  pursuant  to  a  Participating  Interest 
Agreement ("PIA") we entered into on March 27, 2003, which assignment is subject to GOI consent.  Absent 
such consent, the assignment will not occur and we are to provide RGM with an economic benefit equivalent to 
the interest to be assigned.  At April 13, 2007, we have not obtained the consent of the GOI to this assignment. 
 
Our Cambay Basin Agreements 
Mehsana Block 
On February 6, 2004, we, along with our joint venture partners GSPC and Jubilant, signed a PSC with respect to 
this onshore Mehsana Block.  This PSC covers an area of approximately 125 sq kms (30,888 acres) and was 
awarded under NELP-IV.  We hold a 10% PI, GSPC holds a 60% PI, and Jubilant, who is the operator, holds 
the remaining 30% PI.  The PSC provides that the exploration activities are to be conducted in three phases 
commencing  May  21,  2004  with  the  first  phase  covering a  period  of  2.5  years,  the  second  phase covering a 
period of 2.0 years and the last phase covering a period of 1.5 years, for a maximum total duration of 6 years for 
all three phases. 
During the first exploration phase on this exploration block, the parties are to acquire 75 sq kms of 3-D seismic 
data,  reprocess  650  LKM  of  2-D  seismic  data  and  conduct  a  geochemical  survey,  all  of  which  has  been 
completed.  In addition, we are to drill seven exploratory wells between 1,000 to 2,200 meters.  As at April 13, 
2007,  two  of  the  seven  exploration  wells  have  been  drilled;  the  CB-2  and  CB-3  to  2,500  and  2,350  meters 
respectively, both of which were abandoned.
7
The first exploration phase relating to the PSC for the Mehsana Block expired without the required minimum of 
seven exploration wells having been drilled.  In October, 2006 the management committee under the PSC for 
the Mehsana Block approved a proposal to seek from the GOI an extension of the first exploration phase for a 
six month period from November 21, 2006 to May 20, 2007 and on April 6, 2007 the members of the operating 
committee  under  the  Mehsana  Block  operating  agreement  resolved  to  submit  an  application  to  the  GOI  for 
extension for an additional six months to November 20, 2007 to complete the minimum work program under 
Phase I.  In seeking that extension, the joint venture partners agreed to provide a 100% Bank Guarantee and a 
10% cash payment to be agreed upon based on pre-estimated liquidated damages for the unfinished minimum 
work program as reasonably determined by DGH, which has not yet been determined.  As well, the contractor 
would  be  required  to  relinquish  25%  of  the  block  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  PSC.    The  period  of 
extension will be set off against the term of the Second Phase which would reduce Phase II to one year expiring 
November 20, 2008.  Final consent to this extension is awaiting GOI approval. 
During the second and third phases, if the parties elect to proceed, the parties are to drill two exploratory wells 
to 2,000 meters in each phase. 
Sanand/Miroli Block 
Also  on  February  6,  2004,  we,  along  with  our  joint  venture  partners  GSPC,  Jubilant  and  Prize  Petroleum 
Company Limited ("Prize") signed a PSC with respect to this onshore Sanand/Miroli Block.  This PSC covers 
an area of approximately 285 sq kms (70,425 acres) and was awarded under NELP-IV.  We hold a 10% PI, 
GSPC, who is the operator holds a 55% PI, Jubilant holds a 20% PI with the remaining 15% held by Prize.  The 
PSC provides that the exploration activities are to be conducted in three phases commencing July 29, 2004 with 
the first phase covering a period of 2.5 years, the second phase covering a period of 2.0 years and the last phase 
covering a period of 1.5 years, for a maximum total duration of 6 years for all three phases. 
During the first exploration phase on the Sanand/Miroli Block, the parties are to acquire 200 sq kms of 3-D 
seismic data, reprocess 1,000 LKM’s of 2-D seismic data, and conduct a geochemical survey all of which has 
been completed.  In addition, we are to drill twelve exploratory wells between 1,500 to 3,000 meters.  As at 
April  13,  2007,  two  of  the  twelve wells have been drilled or are in the process of being drilled to depths in 
excess of 2,500 meters.   
The  first  exploration  phase  relating  to  the  PSC  for  the  Sanand/Miroli  Block  expired  without  the  required 
minimum of twelve wells having been drilled.  On January 29, 2007 the management committee under the PSC 
for  the  Sanand/Miroli  Block  approved  a  proposal  to  seek  from  the  GOI  an  extension  of  the  first  exploration 
phase for a six month period from January 28, 2007 to July 28, 2007.  Final consent to this extension is awaiting 
GOI approval. 
During the second and third phases, if the parties elect to proceed with them, the parties are to drill three and 
two exploratory wells to 2,000 meters, respectively. 
Tarapur Block 
Pursuant to an agreement entered into with GSPC in April, 2005, we purchased a 20% PI in the onshore Tarapur 
Block in the Cambay Basin near our Mehsana and Sanand/Miroli Blocks which was awarded to GSPC under a 
Pre  NELP  round.    The  Tarapur  Block  is  in  Phase  III  under  the  PSC  and  currently  covers  an  area  of 
approximately 1,211 sq kms (299,245 acres).  GSPC as operator, owns the remaining 80% PI.  The assignment 
of the 20% interest was subject to obtaining the consent of the GOI which was received effective August 24, 
2006.  Agreements reflecting the completion of the assignment are in the process of being prepared for signature 
as  of  April  13,  2007.    As  a  condition  to  receiving  the  GOI  consent,  the  Company  provided  to  the  GOI  an 
irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of US$1,200,000 secured by a term deposit of the Company in the 
same amount.  This amount represents the Company’s performance guarantee for its 20% participating interest 
share (Rs. 5.3 crore) of the estimated exploration costs budgeted for the period April 1, 2006 through March 31, 
2007. 
Oil  and  Natural  Gas  Corporation  Limited  of  India  has  the  right  to  participate  into  the  development  of  any 
commercial  discovery  on  the  Tarapur  Block  by  acquiring  a  30%  participating  interest  as  provided  under  the

the first being CB-2 well to a TVD of 2,500 meters and the second, CB-3 well to a TVD of 2,350 meters.  Both 
these wells did not proceed into a testing program and were subsequently abandoned.  Results of these wells are 
currently being evaluated before proceeding to the next drilling location.   
Estimated total capital expenditures we will be required to contribute to the exploration activities on this block 
during the period April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008 based on our 10% PI will be approximately $2.3 million. 
Sanand/Miroli Block 
With  respect  to  the  Sanand/Miroli  Block,  GSPC  as  operator  completed  a  463  sq  km  onshore  3-D  seismic 
acquisition  program.    This  data  has  been  processed  and  interpreted.    Drilling  operations  using  the  DALMA 
MR#4 rig commenced on this block on November 15, 2006 with the drilling of the first of twelve exploration 
wells.    The  M1  well  was  drilled  to  a  TVD  of  2,300  meters  and  was  temporarily  suspended.    The  well  has 
subsequently been re-entered and drilled to a TVD of 2,463 meters.  As of April 13, 2007, the well is being 
logged and will undergo testing.  The same rig spud a second well, the M4 well, on February 24, 2007 which 
was drilled to a TVD of 2,226 meters.  This well was logged, cased and is currently being tested.  A third well, 
the M2 well, commenced drilling using the DRIPL 1500 HP rig on March 26, 2007 and as of April 13, 2007, the 
well, had not reached its anticipated TVD of approximately 3,300 meters.

during the period April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008 based on our 10% PI will be approximately $2.6 million. 
Tarapur Block 
With respect to the Tarapur Block, through April 13, 2007, GSPC has drilled eight wells on this block, of which, 
three wells have been abandoned. 
The Tarapur #G well was drilled in January 2006 to a total depth of 1,650 meters on the eastern portion of the 
Tarapur Block.  A gas/condensate reservoir was discovered in the Kalol formation with an estimated reservoir 
pressure  and  temperature  of  3,300  psi  and  225  degrees  Fahrenheit.  During  testing,  the  well  produced  2.5 
MMSCFD of gas and 106 BBLD of condensate at an approximate well head flowing pressure of 1,500 psi.  As 
of April 13, 2007, this well has been suspended.
9
The Tarapur #5 well was drilled to a total depth of 1,612 meters in October 2006.  The well was logged and 
cased for testing.  During testing, the well produced 118 mcf of gas and 264 BBLD of oil.  As of April 13, 2007, 
a  determination  is  being  made  whether  to  seek  to  stimulate  this  well  before  final  completion  and  put  on 
production at such time as a development plan has been prepared and approved by DGH. 
The Tarapur #7 well was drilled to a total depth of 1,642 meters in November 2006.  The well was logged and 
cased for testing.  During testing, two zones were tested without conclusive results and one zone flowed water to 
surface.  As of April 13, 2007, this well has been suspended. 
Two wells, the Tarapur #P well and the Tarapur #1 well were drilled to an approximate depth of 2,250 meters to 
the top of the Deccan trap and encountered oil in both the Kalol and Olpad formations.  Both of these formations 
were tight and tested non-commercial flows of oil.  Various stimulation techniques were assessed and a Hydro 
Fracturing  job  was  performed  on  the  Kalol  formation  in  the  Tarapur  #P  well  resulting  in  a  test  flow  of  150 
BBLS/day of oil at 300 psi WHFP.  A geological model is being prepared to establish production potential of 
both the Kalol and Olpad formations in these wells and evaluate further drilling opportunities in this block.   
The remaining three wells that were drilled on the western portion of the Mitrampura Anticline, the Tarapur D, 
E and F were all abandoned. 
It is the intention of GSPC to drill one additional well to delineate the extent of the Tarapur #G discovery before 
submission for a two-well appraisal program to the GOI under the terms of the PSC.   
Under the terms of our agreement with GSPC, we are to fund our 20% participating interest share of all past 
exploration  costs  incurred  on  the  Tarapur  exploration  block.    As  at  December  31,  2006,  the  amount  of 
US$3,972,765 has been included in Oil and Gas Interests, not subject to depletion on our Balance Sheet for our 
PI share of costs incurred in the previous drilling of eight exploration wells and a recently completed 500 sq km 
3-D  seismic  acquisition  program.    Estimated  total  capital  expenditures  we  will  be  required  to  contribute  to

Additional Terms of Our Production Sharing Contracts 
General 
Except for the size and location of the exploration blocks and the work programs to be conducted, the PSC’s 
contain substantially similar terms.  Under the PSCs, the GOI has granted to the parties the right to engage in oil 
and natural gas exploration activities on the exploration blocks for specified terms of years with each contract 
setting forth the exploration activities to be conducted over periods of years in two or three phases. 
The contracts contain restrictions on the assignment of a PI, including a change in control of a party, without the 
consent of the GOI, subject to certain exceptions which include, among others, a party encumbering its interest 
subject to certain limitations. 
Each  of  the  ventures  is  managed  by  a  management  committee  representing  the  parties  to  the  agreement, 
including the GOI.  The contracts contain various other provisions, including, among others, obligations of the 
parties  to  maintain  insurance,  the  maintenance  of  books  and  records,  confidentiality,  the  protection  of  the 
environment, arbitration of disputes, matters relating to income taxes on the parties, royalty payments, and the 
valuation of hydrocarbons produced.  The Indian domestic market has the first call on natural gas produced.  
The contracts are interpreted under the laws of India. 
Relinquishment on our Existing Blocks 
Under each of these contracts, if the parties elect to continue into the second exploratory phase, the contracts 
provide that the parties retain up to 75% of the original contract area, including any developed areas and areas of 
discoveries of hydrocarbons, and relinquish the remainder.  Similarly, if the parties elect to continue into the 
third  exploration  phase,  the  contracts  provide  that  the  parties  retain  up  to  50%  of  the  original  contract  area, 
including any developed areas and areas of discovery of hydrocarbons, and relinquish the remainder.  At the end 
of the third exploration phase, only developed areas and areas of discoveries shall be retained. 
Relinquishment on the Newly Awarded NELP-VI Blocks 
Under each of these contracts, if the parties elect to continue into the second exploratory phase, the contracts 
provide that the parties shall have the option to relinquish a part of area in simple geometrical shape, such area 
to  be  relinquished  shall  not  be  less  than  25%  of  the  original  contract.    At  the  end  of  the  second exploration 
phase, the parties shall retain the balance which includes any developed areas and areas of discoveries. 
Procedure for Allocation of Costs After a Discovery 
These  PSC’s  contain  provisions  relating  to  procedures  to  be  followed  once  a  discovery  of  hydrocarbons  is 
determined to have been made within the exploration block and for the further development of that discovery.  
Following  the  completion  of  a  development  plan  for  a  discovery,  the  parties  are  to  apply  to  the  relevant 
government entity for a lease with respect to the area to be developed with an initial term of 20 years for the 
lease.    The  GOI  and  the  other  parties  to  the  PSC  are  allocated,  after  deduction  of  the  costs  of  exploration, 
development, and production to be recovered, percentages of any remaining production with the GOI allocated 
between 20% to 40% of the production from the KG Offshore Block and Ankleshwar Block, 30% to 55% of the 
production from the Mehsana Block and Sanand/Miroli Blocks and 10% to 30% of the production from the DS 
03  Block.    The  GOI  allocation  of  the  newly  awarded  blocks  under  NELP-VI  is  between  91%  to  9%  of  the 
production from the KG Onshore Block, the RJ Block 20 and RJ Block 21 and between 85% to 15% for the DS 
04 Block.  The balance of the production is to be allocated to the other joint venture participants in proportion to 
their participating interests. 
Bank Guarantees 
The contracts contain provisions whereby the joint venture participants must provide the GOI a bank guarantee 
in  the  amount  of  35%  of  the  participant's  share  of  the  minimum  work  program  for  a  particular  Phase,  to  be 
undertaken  during  the  year.    This  work  program  to  be  undertaken  is  presented  annually  to  the  management 
committee for approval for the period April 1 through March 31.  The work programs for the year April 1, 2007 
through March 31, 2008 and their related budgets have been approved for our six existing PSCs, but have not 
yet been approved or the four newly awarded PSCs under NELP-VI to which we are a party and, accordingly, 
our estimates as to capital expenditures pursuant to these NELP-VI PSCs for the twelve months ended March 
31, 2008 and beyond are subject to revision when the budget is approved and thereafter during the twelve-month 
period.

Other Material Oil and Gas Agreements 
Our Carried Interest Agreement 
Pursuant to an agreement we entered into with GSPC dated August 27, 2002, we, along with RGM, a Mauritius 
corporation wholly owned by Mr. Jean Paul Roy, our President, CEO, Director and principal stockholder, have 
a carried interest ("CI") in the exploration activities conducted by the parties on the KG Offshore Block.  Under 
the terms of the Carried Interest Agreement, ("CIA") we, and RGM are carried by GSPC for 100% of our share 
of any costs during the exploration phase prior to the start date of initial commercial production.  However, our 
share and the share of RGM of any capital costs incurred during the development phase will be paid back to 
GSPC out of production without interest over the projected production life or ten years whichever is less.  We 
are not entitled to any share of production until GSPC has recovered our share and the share of RGM for the 
costs and expenses that were paid by GSPC. 
Our Participating Interest Agreement 
On  March  27,  2003,  we  entered  into  a  Participating  Interest  Agreement  (“PIA”)  with  RGM,  whereby  we 
assigned and hold in trust for RGM, subject to GOI consent, 50% of the benefits and obligations of the PSC on 
the  KG  Offshore  Block  and  the  CIA  leaving  us  with  a  net  5%  participating  interest  in  the  PSC  on  the  KG 
Offshore Block and a net 5% CI in the CIA.  Under the terms of the PIA, until the GOI consent is obtained, we 
retain the exclusive right to deal with the other parties to the PSC on the KG Offshore Block and the CIA and 
are entitled to make all decisions regarding the interest assigned to RGM and RGM agreed to be bound by and 
responsible for the actions taken by, obligations undertaken and costs incurred by us in regard to RGM's interest 
and to be liable to us for its share of all costs, interests, liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to the 
RGM interest.  RGM agreed to indemnify us against any and all costs, expenses, losses, damages or liabilities 
incurred  by  reason  of  RGM's  failure  to  pay  the  same.    Subject  to  obtaining  the  government  consent  to  the 
assignment,  RGM  is  entitled  to  all  income,  receipts,  credits,  reimbursements,  monies  receivable,  rebates  and 
other benefits in respect of its 5% interest which relate to the PSC on the KG Offshore Block.  We have a right 
of set-off against sums owing to us by RGM.  In the event that the Indian government consent is delayed or 
denied, resulting in either RGM or us being denied an economic benefit either party would have realized under 
the PIA, the parties agreed to amend the PIA or take other reasonable steps to assure that an equitable result is 
achieved consistent with the parties' intentions contained in the PIA.  As a consequence of this transaction we 
report our holdings under the PSC on the KG Offshore Block and CIA as a net 5% PI. 
 
Our Oil and Gas Interests 
We are engaged in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas reserves.  At December 31, 2006, 
we have not produced any oil or natural gas and we do not claim any proved reserves of oil or natural gas.  We 
have not reported any proved reserves of oil or natural gas to any United States Federal authority. 
We do not own any oil or natural gas wells as of April 13, 2007 and at that date we have not been granted any 
leases to properties under the terms of our PSCs. 
At December 31, 2006, we participated in the commencement of drilling eleven exploratory wells.  One in each 
of Mehsana and Sanand/Miroli and four in Tarapur in the Cambay Basin and five exploratory wells in the KG 
Offshore Block in the Krishna Godavari Basin. 
 
In the KG Offshore Block, two wells were abandoned.  Three wells were drilled and tested and resulted in the 
discovery of natural gas.  A sixth well, the KG#16 well is currently being drilled.  A seventh well, the KG#28 
well is also currently being drilled, but has been classified as an appraisal well by the management committee 
for the purposes of the PSC, and not an exploratory well.

At  April  13,  2007,  we  hold  no  interests  in  acreage  that  may  be  deemed  developed  or  acreage  assignable  to 
productive wells. 
Contract Interests in Undeveloped Acreage 
Under the terms of the ten PSCs to which we are a party, including the four newly signed PSCs on March 2, 
2007 which were awarded under the NELP-VI bidding round, we have an interest in approximately 3,409,313 
gross acres (1,769,471 net acres).  Substantial work commitments must be performed pursuant to each of these 
PSCs  before  we  will  have  any  leasehold,  concession  or  other  interest  in  such  acreage  and  there  can  be  no 
assurance that our exploration activities will result in leases being granted.  Failure to fulfill work commitments 
or the relinquishment of acreage upon the election to proceed to second and third phases of exploration phases, 
as applicable under the terms of our PSCs, would result in the loss of material amounts of this acreage pursuant 
to  the  relinquishment  provisions  of  the  PSC  (see  “Additional  Terms  of  Our  Production  Sharing  Contracts  – 
Relinquishment on our Existing Blocks”).  No leases as to any of such acreage have been granted and there can 
be no assurance that we will be granted a leasehold or other interest in the acreage in the future.  Under the 
terms of the PSCs, following the completion of a development plan for a discovery, the parties are to apply for a 
lease from the relevant government authority to the area to be developed.  Leases are to have an initial term of 
twenty (20) years.

Additional Plans for 2007 
Our business plans for 2007 include the possible participation in joint ventures bidding for the award of further 
PSCs for exploration blocks in India and elsewhere.  As of April 13, 2007, we have no specific plans to join 
with  others  for  any  specific  PSCs  in  India  and  elsewhere.    We  expect  that  our  interest  in  any  such  ventures 
would involve a minority PI in the venture.  In addition, as opportunities arise, we may seek to acquire minority 
PI in exploration blocks where PSCs have been heretofore awarded.  The acquisition of any such interests would 
be subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and obtaining the requisite government consents and other 
approvals.
15
Hedging Activities 
At December 31, 2006, we had not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments; as such term is defined in 
Item 305 of Regulation S-K, relating to our operations. 
 
Marketing 
Under the terms of our PSCs, until India’s total production of crude oil and condensate meets the Indian national 
demand,  we  are  required  to  sell  in  the  Indian  domestic  market  our  entitlement  to  crude  oil  and  condensate.  
When and so long as India attains self-sufficiency in the production of crude oil and condensate, our domestic 
sale obligation is suspended and we will have the right to export our entitlement. 
The PSCs provide that the Indian domestic market will have the first call on natural gas produced from the areas 
that are the subject of the contracts. 
The PSCs provide that the parties are to agree monthly on a price for crude oil which is intended to be on an 
import parity basis.  Prices of natural gas are intended to be based on Indian domestic market prices. 
Our  ability  to  market  any  production  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  will  be  dependent  upon  the  existence  and 
availability of pipeline or other gathering system, storage facilities and an ability to transport the hydrocarbons 
to market.  Such facilities are yet to be constructed. 
We are not a party to any agreements providing for the delivery of fixed quantities of hydrocarbons. 
 
Competition 
We  experience  competition  from  others  in  seeking  to  participate  in  joint  ventures  and  other  arrangements  to 
participate in exploratory drilling ventures in India.  In addition, the ventures in which we participate experience 
competition  from  other  ventures  and  persons  in  seeking  from  the  GOI  and,  possibly  others,  its  agreement  to 
grant  and  enter  into  PSCs.    Management  of  our  company  believes  that  competition  in  entering  into  such 
agreements with the GOI is based on the extent and magnitude of exploratory activities that the applicants will 
propose to undertake on the exploration blocks under consideration as well as the applicants available capital 
and technical ability of the applicants to complete such activities. 
 
Employees 
The services of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jean Paul Roy, are provided pursuant to the terms of 
a  Technical  Services  Agreement  ("TSA")  we  entered  into  with  Roy  Group  (Barbados)  Inc.  ("RGB"),  a 
corporation wholly owned by Mr. Roy.  The services of Allan J. Kent, our Executive Vice President and Chief 
Financial Officer are provided in the year 2006 through D.I. Investments Ltd., a corporation wholly owned by 
Mr.  Kent.    Messrs.  Roy  and  Kent  each  devote  substantially  all  of  their  time  to  our  affairs.    Neither  of  such 
persons are our direct employees. 
In addition to Messrs. Roy and Kent, we employ approximately ten additional persons at various times and in 
various capacities as part time consultants to us. 
As of December 31, 2006, we employed three persons and two full time consultants in Calgary, Alberta, Canada 
and employed four persons in Gandhinagar, Gujarat State, India.

Incorporation and Organization 
On August 29, 2003, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of GeoGlobal Resources (India) Inc. 
("GeoGlobal India") a corporation then wholly owned by Mr. Jean Paul Roy.  The completion of the acquisition 
resulted  in  the  issuance  and  delivery  by  us  of  34,000,000  common  shares  and  delivery  of  our  $2.0  million 
promissory note to Mr. Roy.  Of such shares, we issued and delivered 14.5 million shares at the closing of the 
acquisition  and  14.5  million  shares  were  released  from  escrow  on  August  27,  2004  upon  the  actual 
commencement  of  a  drilling  program.  The  remaining  5.0  million  shares  continued  to  be  held  in  escrow  at 
December 31, 2005. These 5.0 million shares held in escrow will be released only if a commercial discovery is 
declared on the KG Offshore Block. If a commercial discovery is not declared, the shares will not be released 
from escrow, but will be surrendered back to us. Common shares held during the term of the escrow retain their 
voting rights. As a result of this transaction, Mr. Roy held as of the closing of the transaction approximately 
69.3% of our issued and outstanding shares.  Mr. Roy was also elected our President and a Director on August 
29, 2003.  This transaction is considered an acquisition of GeoGlobal Resources Inc. (the accounting subsidiary 
and legal parent) by GeoGlobal India (the accounting parent and legal subsidiary) and has been accounted for as 
a  purchase  of  the  net  assets  of  GeoGlobal  Resources  Inc.  by  GeoGlobal  India.  Accordingly,  this  transaction 
represents a recapitalization of GeoGlobal India, the legal subsidiary, effective August 29, 2003. 
As a consequence of this transaction, a change in control of our company may be deemed to have occurred. 
Through late 2001, we were engaged in the creation, operation and maintenance of a World Wide Web-based 
community, known as Suite101.com, Inc.  At the end of 2001, management at that time determined to redirect 
activities and by mid-2002, the company was no longer engaged in the former Web-based activities. 
We are a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in December 1993.  From December 
1998  to  January  2004,  our  corporate  name  was  Suite101.com,  Inc.    At  a  meeting  held  January  8,  2004,  our 
stockholders  approved  an  amendment  to  our  Certificate  of  Incorporation  to  change  our  corporate  name  to 
GeoGlobal Resources Inc. 
 
Item 2.   Description of Property 
 
Our  corporate  head  office  is  located  at  Suite  #310,  605  –  1  Street  SW,  Calgary,  Alberta,  T2P  3S9  Canada.  
These premises are leased for a term of one year ending April 30, 2007 at an annual rental of $65,565 for base 
rent and operating costs.  These premises include approximately 2,927 square feet which we consider adequate 
for our present activities.  We are currently in negotiations to renew this lease at market prices for a further two 
year term to April 30, 2009. 
On November 21, 2006, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to acquire an office condominium of 
approximately 11,203 sq. ft located in Gandhinagar, India.  A deposit of US$28,090 was paid which is reflected 
in the December 31, 2006 financial statements as a deposit under property and equipment.  A formal agreement 
relating to the purchase of the condominium has not yet been executed. 
Our interests in oil and gas properties are described under Item 1 - Description of Business. 
 
Item 3.   Legal Proceedings 
 
There are no legal proceedings pending against us.  
 
Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders 
 
No  matter  was  submitted  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006  to  a  vote  of  our 
securityholders through the solicitation of proxies or otherwise.

18
Our Business Activities 
We are engaged, through subsidiaries and joint ventures in which we are a participant, in the exploration for and 
development of oil and gas reserves.  We initiated these activities in 2003.  Through December 31, 2006, our 
activities  have  been  undertaken  in  locations  where  we  and  our  joint  venture  participants  have  been  granted 
exploration rights pursuant to Production Sharing Contract's ("PSCs") entered into with the Government of India 
("GOI"). 
At April 13, 2007, we have not reported any proved reserves of oil or natural gas.  We have entered into ten 
PSCs.  Each PSC relates to a separate drilling block onshore or offshore India and each provides for multi-year 
and multi-phase exploration and drilling activities.  Exploration and development activities pursuant to the terms 
of these agreements are expected to continue throughout 2007. 
 
Statements of Operations  
Oil and Gas Operations 
Our oil and gas exploration activities commenced at our inception on August 21, 2002. We have not since our 
inception earned any revenues from these operations. 
Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005  
During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006,  we  had  expenses  of  $2,897,503  compared  with  expenses  of 
$1,011,601 during the year ended December 31, 2005.  This increase is primarily the result of the increased 
scale  of  our  participation  in  oil  and  gas  exploration  activities,  with  commensurate  additions  to  the  office 
infrastructure and the initial year of accounting for stock-based compensation expense. 
Our general and administrative expenses increased to $1,406,000 from $495,326.  Of this increase, $563,551 
reflects the adoption of FAS 123(R) pursuant to which we are is required to recognize compensation costs for 
stock-based  arrangements  with  employees  and  consultants  effective  January  1,  2006.    These  general  and 
administrative expenses include costs related to the corporate head office including administrative salaries and 
services, rent and office costs, insurance, American Stock Exchange listing and filing fees and transfer agent 
fees and services.  Our consulting fees increased to $1,190,919 during the year ended December 31, 2006 from 
$265,446 in the prior year.  Of this increase, $626,625 is attributable to the adoption of FAS 123(R) effective 
January 1, 2006.  These consulting fees include $70,000 (2005 - $62,000) paid under our Technical Services 
Agreement with a corporation wholly owned by Mr. Roy and other fees and expenses we incurred in employing 
various technical and corporate consultants who advised us on a variety of matters.  Professional fees increased 
to  $251,261  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006  from  $201,298  during  the  year  ended  December  31, 
2005.  Professional fees include those paid to our auditors for pre-approved audit, accounting and tax services 
and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports 
and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements.  In addition, costs associated 
with  initiating  the  modeling,  testing  and  documenting  internal  controls  as  required  by  Section  404  of  the 
Sarbanes Oxley Act were incurred during the latter part of the year.  This resulted in an increase of $49,963 in 
the fees paid to our auditors, accountants and legal counsel for additional work incurred during the year ending 
December 2006 as compared to 2005. 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, depreciation decreased slightly to $49,323 from $49,531 during the 
year ended December 31, 2005. 
Our  other  expenses and income during the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted in income of $1,746,813 
versus $530,621 for the same period in 2005.  Included in other expenses and income is a foreign exchange loss 
of  $4,737  compared  to  a  gain  in  2005  of  $319.    During  the  previous  year  ended  December  31,  2005,  we 
recovered fees and costs of $25,900 resulting from services provided and billed out to the GSPC and a gain on 
the sale of computer equipment of $42,228.  No such expense recoveries or asset dispositions occurred during 
the year ended December 31, 2006.  Our increase in interest income to $1,751,550 from $462,174 for the year 
ended December 31, 2005 is a result of the significant increase in the size of our cash balances we held during a 
full year in 2006 as compared to a partial year in 2005 as well as an increase in the US prime rate.
19
Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1,150,690 versus a net loss of $480,980 in 2005.  This 
result was mainly attributable to the adoption of FAS 123 (R) requiring the Company to recognize compensation 
costs for the stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and consultants effective January 1, 2006 
net of the increase in interest earned during the most recent year.   
We  capitalized  overhead  costs  directly  related  to  our  exploration  activities  in  India.    During  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2006, these capitalized overhead costs were $2,133,984 as compared to $469,268 during the year 
ended  December  31,  2005.    This  increase  includes  capitalized  stock-based  compensation  of  $766,689 
recognized for the first time in 2006, as a consequence of our adoption of FASB 123(R) effective January 2006, 
with  the  remaining  increase  being  consistent  with  the  increased  scale  of  our  participation  in  oil  and  gas 
exploration activities. 
Years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004  
During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005,  we  had  expenses  of  $1,011,601  compared  with  expenses  of 
$912,092 during the year ended December 31, 2004.  This increase is primarily the result of the increased scale 
of our participation in oil and gas exploration activities. 
Our  general  and  administrative  expenses  increased  to  $495,326  from  $451,788.    These  general  and 
administrative expenses include costs related to the corporate head office including administrative salaries and 
services, rent and office costs, insurance, American Stock Exchange listing and filing fees and transfer agent 
fees and services.  Our consulting fees increased to $265,446 during the year ended December 31, 2005 from 
$237,615 in the prior year.  These consulting fees reflect $62,000 (2004 - $50,000) paid under our Technical 
Services Agreement ("TSA") with Roy Group (Barbados) Inc. ("RGB"), a corporation wholly owned by Mr. 
Roy  and  other  fees  and  expenses  we  incurred  in  employing  various  technical  and  corporate  consultants  who 
advised us on a variety of matters.  Professional fees increased to $201,298 during the year ended December 31, 
2005  from  $161,381  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2004.    Professional fees include those paid to our 
auditors for pre-approved audit, accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for 
services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various 
oil and gas and other agreements.  The increase is attributable to an approximately $40,000 increase in our fees 
paid to our auditors for additional work incurred during the year ending December 2005 as compared to 2004. 
During  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005,  depreciation  decreased  to  $49,531  from  $61,308 during the year 
ended December 31, 2004. 
Our  other  expenses  and  income  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005  resulted  in  income  of  $530,621 
versus $44,596 for the same period in 2004.  Included in other expenses and income is a foreign exchange gain 
of $319 compared to a loss in 2004 of $3,495.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recovered fees 
and  costs  of  $25,900  (2004  -  $16,500)  resulting  from  services  provided  and  billed  out  to  the  GSPC.    Other 
expenses  and  income  include  a  gain  on  the  sale  of  computer  equipment  of  $42,228  during  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2005.  Our increase in interest income to $462,174 from $31,591 for the year ended December 
31,  2004  is  a  result  of  the  significant  increase  in  the  size  of  our  cash  balances  we  held  during  the  year  as 
compared to 2004 as well as an increase in the US prime rate. 
Reflecting the increase in our interest income during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year 
ended December 31, 2004, we reduced our net loss to $480,980 compared to a net loss of $867,496 in 2004. 
We  capitalized  overhead  costs  directly  related  to  our  exploration  activities  in  India.    During  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2005, these capitalized overhead costs were $469,268 as compared to $336,535 during the year 
ended December 31, 2004.  This increase is consistent with the increased scale of our participation in oil and gas 
exploration activities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 
Our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 was $245,071 as compared 
to $165,558 for the year ended December 31, 2005.  This increase is mostly the result of an increase in our 
exploration activities net of our interest earned on our cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2006 as 
compared to 2005.  
Cash  used  by  investing  activities  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006  was  $8,267,169  as  compared  to 
$1,679,352 during the year ended December 31, 2005.  This increase is a result of the increased scale of our 
participation in oil and gas exploration activities.  Funds of $6,739,386 were used for exploration activities and 
$142,924  for  the  acquisition  of  property  and  equipment  in  2006  as  compared  to  $1,578,124  and  $36,826  in 
2005.  These acquisitions included computer and office equipment totaling $114,835 plus a deposit on our office 
condominium in India of $28,090.  As well we incurred $6,739,386 as our share of exploration costs related to 
our  PSCs  for  our  oil  and  gas  interests  in  India.    The  increase  in  restricted  cash  of  $3,198,284  represents 
additional term deposits we made in 2006 as compared to $185,689 in 2005 which are used as collateral for 
letters of credit given to the GOI as minimum work commitment guarantees on a total of six exploration blocks 
at December 31, 2006. 
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $4,837,830 as compared to 
cash provided in financing activities of $33,462,700 during the year ended December 31, 2005.   This consisted 
of $4,922,640 from the issuance of 3,254,000 shares of common stock on the exercise of options and purchase 
warrants issued from our 2003 financing less share issuance costs of $74,010. 
At December 31, 2006, our cash and cash equivalents were $32,362,978 (December 31, 2005 - $36,037,388).  
The majority of these funds are currently held as US funds in our bank accounts and in term deposits earning 
interest based on the US prime rate. 
Years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004  
Our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 was $165,558 as compared 
to $1,075,637 for the year ended December 31, 2004.  This decrease is mostly as a result of our reduced net loss 
for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to 2004. 
Cash  used  by  investing  activities  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005  was  $1,679,352  as  compared  to 
$748,222  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2004.    This  increase  is  a  result  of  the  increased  scale  of  our 
participation in oil and gas exploration activities.  Funds of $1,615,000 were used for exploration activities and 
the  acquisition  of  property  and  equipment  as  compared  to  $547,357  in  2004.    The  property  and  equipment 
acquired included computer and office equipment totaling $36,876 with the balance of $1,578,124 incurred as 
exploration costs for our oil and gas interests in India.  The restricted cash of $185,689 represents additional 
term  deposits  we  made  in  2005  which  are  used  as  collateral  for  two  letters  of  credit  given  to  the  GOI  as  a 
minimum work commitment guarantee on the Cambay Blocks. 
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $33,462,700 as compared to 
cash used in financing activities of $786,450 during the year ended December 31, 2004.  As further described 
below, during the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the sale of 3,252,400 Units of our securities at 
$6.50 per Unit, together with a concurrent sale of an additional 1,000,000 Units on the same terms, for aggregate 
cash gross proceeds of $27,640,600.  This amount combined with cash of $7,352,985 which was provided from 
the  issuance  of  3,494,400  shares  of  common  stock  on  the  exercise  of  options,  purchase  warrants  and  broker 
warrants issued in our 2003 financing, less financing costs of $1,541,685 incurred in connection with the 2005 
financing accounts for the increase in our cash and cash equivalents.  Cash provided by financing activities for 
the year ended December 31, 2005 in the amount of $786,450 included the full repayment of $1,000,000 of the 
note payable, net of $213,550 realized from the issuance of 154,100 shares of common stock on the exercise of 
options and broker warrants.   
The sale of the 3,252,400 Units of securities was completed in September 2005.  The securities were sold at 
$6.50 per Unit, together with a concurrent sale of an additional 1,000,000 Units on the same terms, for aggregate 
gross cash total proceeds of $27,640,600.
21
Each Unit is comprised of one common share and one half of one warrant.  One full warrant ("2005 Purchase 
Warrant")  entitles  the  holder  to  purchase  one  additional  common  share  for  $9.00,  for  a  term  of  two  years 
expiring September 2007.  The 2005 Purchase Warrants are subject to accelerated expiration in the event that 
the  price  of  the  Company's  common  shares  on  the  American  Stock  Exchange  is  $12.00  or  more  for  20 
consecutive  trading  days,  the  resale  of  the  shares included in the Units and issuable on exercise of the 2005 
Purchase Warrants has been registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), and the 
hold period for Canadian subscribers has expired.  In such events, the warrant term will be reduced to 30 days 
from the date of issuance of a news release announcing such accelerated expiration of the warrant term.  
Costs of $1,541,685 were incurred in issuing shares in these transactions which included a fee of $1,268,436 
paid  to  Jones  Gable  &  Company  Limited  with  respect  to  the  sale  of  the  3,252,400  Units,  and,  in  addition, 
Compensation Options were issued to Jones Gable & Company Limited entitling it to purchase an additional 
195,144 Units at an exercise price of $6.50 per Unit through their expiration in September 2007.  Compensation 
Options are also subject to accelerated expiration on the same terms and conditions as the warrants issued in the 
transaction.  
At December 31, 2005, our cash and cash equivalents were $36,037,388 (December 31, 2004 - $4,419,598).  
The majority of these funds are currently held as US funds in our bank accounts and in term deposits earning 
interest based on the US prime rate. 
 
The KG Offshore Block and Our Carried Interest Agreement 
At December 31, 2006, GSPC, the Operator of the KG Offshore Block, has expended on exploration activities 
approximately  $26.1  million  attributable  to  us under the CIA as compared to $14.1 million at December 31, 
2005.  Of this amount, 50% is for the account of RGM.  Under the terms of the CIA, GeoGlobal and RGM are 
carried by GSPC for 100% of all our share of any costs during the exploration phase on the KG Offshore Block 
prior to the start date of initial commercial production. 
Under the terms of the PSC, GSPC is committed to expend further funds for the exploration of and drilling on 
the  KG  Offshore  Block.    Preliminary  estimates  were  that  these  expenditures  attributable  to  us  will  total 
approximately $22.0 million over the 6.5 year term of the PSC.  Additional drilling costs incurred in drilling to 
depths in excess of 5,000 meters versus shallower depths as originally anticipated, as well as the testing and 
completion costs of these wells, has resulted in our actual costs significantly exceeding our original budgeted 
expenditures.  The estimated annual budget for costs to be incurred by GSPC for the twelve month period April 
1, 2007 to March 31, 2008 attributable to us under the CIA is approximately $50.4 million.  Of this amount, 
50% is for the account of RGM.  We are unable to estimate the amount of additional expenditures GSPC will 
make attributable to us prior to the start date of initial commercial production under the CIA or when, if ever, 
any  commercial  production  will  commence.    As  provided  in  the  CIA,  we  will  be  required  to  bear  the 
expenditures attributable to us after the start date of initial commercial production on the KG Offshore Block. 
We will not realize cash flow from the KG Offshore Block until such time as the expenditures attributed to us, 
including those expenditures made for the account of RGM under the CIA have been recovered by GSPC from 
future  production  revenue.    Under  the  terms  of  the  CIA,  all  of  our  proportionate  share  of  capital  costs  for 
exploration and development activities must be repaid to GSPC without interest over the projected production 
life or ten years, whichever is less. 
 
KG Onshore Block Agreement 
Under the PSC for the KG Onshore Block, the Phase I work commitment consists of reprocessing 564 LKM of 
2-D  seismic,  conducting  a  gravity  and  magnetic  and  geochemical  survey,  as  well  as  a  seismic  acquisition 
program consisting of 548 sq km of 3-D seismic.  This Phase I commitment further consists of the drilling of 12 
exploration wells to various depths between 2,000 and 5,000 meters.  The Company will be required to fund its 
10% proportionate share of the costs incurred in these activities estimated to be approximately US$8.5 million 
over the four years of the first phase of the work commitment with respect to a 10%participating interest in the 
block and approximately US$21.3 million with respect to a 25% participating interest in the block.
22
Cambay Block Agreements 
We  originally  committed  to  expend  a  minimum  aggregate  of  approximately  $2.5  million  for  exploration 
activities under the terms of the PSCs on the Mehsana and Sanand/Miroli Cambay Blocks over a period of 6 
years.    At  December  31,  2006,  we  have  incurred  costs  of  approximately  $1.0  million  with  respect  to  the 
Mehsana Block and approximately $1.1 million with respect to the Sanand/Miroli Block.  We estimate that our 
expenditures  for  exploration  activities  during  the  2007  fiscal  year  will  be  approximately  $2.3  million  on  the 
Mehsana Block and approximately $2.6 million on the Sanand/Miroli Block based upon our 10% PI in these 
PSCs. 
At  December  31,  2006,  we  have  provided  to  the  GOI  three  irrevocable  letters  of  credit  totaling  $2,216,445 
(Mehsana  US$711,445,  Sanand/Miroli  US$905,000  and  Ankleshwar  US$600,000)  (December  31,  2005  – 
$392,485) secured by our term deposits in the same amount.  These letters of credit serve as guarantees for the 
performance  of  the  minimum  work  commitments  for  the  budget  period  April  1,  2006  to  March  31,  2007  of 
Phase I of these Cambay Blocks. 
As  the  holder  of  a  participating  interest  in  the  Tarapur  Block,  we  are  required  to  fund  a  20%  share  of  all 
exploration and development costs incurred on the exploration block.  To December 31, 2006, we have incurred 
costs of approximately $4.0 million under the terms of our agreement with GSPC.  We originally committed to 
expend an aggregate of approximately $1.2 million for exploration activities under the terms of the agreement 
entered into covering the Tarapur block over the period ending November 22, 2007.  It is expected however, that 
with the increase in GSPC’s current drilling activities, we have increased our estimated expenditures to $2.7 
million over the period April 1 to November 22, 2007.   
At December 31, 2006, we provided to the GOI an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of US$1,200,000 
for the Tarapur Block secured by a term deposit of the Company in the same amount.  This letter of credit serves 
as a guarantee for the performance of the exploration work commitment for the Tarapur Block for the budget 
period also ending March 31, 2007.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will be required to keep in 
force  a  Financial  and  Performance  Guarantee  in  an  amount  sufficient  to  secure  its  performance  under  the 
Tarapur PSC.  
Under  the  terms  of  our  PSC  for  the  Ankleshwar  Block,  we  have  committed  to  expend  approximately  $1.7 
million for exploration activities over a period of seven years.  As at December 31, 2006, we have incurred costs 
of approximately $400,000 on the Ankleshwar Block.  We estimate our expenditures for exploration activities 
during the period April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008 will be approximately $2.7 million on Ankleshwar Block. 
 
The Deccan Syneclise Block Agreements 
Under the terms of the PSC for the DS 03 Block, we have committed to expend approximately $9.6 million for 
exploration  activities  over  a  period  of  seven  years.    As  at  December  31,  2006,  we  have  incurred  costs  of 
approximately $50,000 on this block.  We estimate our expenditures for exploration activities during the period 
April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008 will be approximately $400,000 based upon our PI in this PSC. 
 
Under  the  PSC  for  the  DS  04  Block,  the  Phase  I  work  commitment  consists  of  conducting  a  gravity  and 
magnetic  and  geochemical  survey,  as  well  as  a  seismic  acquisition  program  consisting  of  325  LKM  of  2-D 
seismic.    We  further  committed  to  drill  10  core  holes  to  a  depth  of  approximately  500  meters.    We  will  be 
required  to  fund  our  100%  proportionate  share  of  the  costs  incurred  in  these  activities  estimated  to  be 
approximately US$1.2 million over the four years of the first phase of the work commitment. 
 
Rajasthan Block Agreements 
The  combined  Phase  I  work  commitments  under  the  PSCs  for  RJ  Block  20  and  RJ  Block  21  consist  of 
reprocessing of a total 926 LKM of 2-D seismic, conducting a gravity and magnetic and geochemical survey, as 
well as a seismic acquisition program consisting of 560 LKM of 2-D seismic and 1,311 sq km of 3-D seismic.  
The combined Phase I commitments further consist of drilling a total of 20 exploration wells over both blocks to 
various depths between 2,000 and 2,500 meters.  We will be required to fund our 25% proportionate share of the 
costs incurred in these activities estimated to be approximately US$18.3 million over the four years of the first 
phase of the work commitments.   
 
Plan of Operations in 2007
23
We  expect  our  exploration  and  development  activities  pursuant  to  the  PSCs  we  are  parties  to  will  continue 
throughout 2007 in accordance with the terms of those agreements.  In addition, we may seek to participate in 
joint ventures bidding for the award of further PSCs for exploration blocks expected to be awarded by the GOI 
in the future.  As of April 13, 2007, we have no specific plans to join with others in bidding for any specific 
PSCs in India.  We expect that our interest in any such ventures would involve a minority PI in the venture.  In 
addition, as opportunities arise, we may seek to acquire minority PI's in exploration blocks where PSCs have 
been heretofore awarded by the GOI.  The acquisition of any such interests would be subject to the execution of 
a definitive agreement and obtaining the requisite government consents and other approvals.  
We  may  during  the  year  2007  seek  to  participate  in  joint  venture  bidding  for  the  acquisition  of  oil  and  gas 
interests in other international countries.  As of April 13, 2007, we have not been awarded any such interests. 
Depending  upon  the  scope  of  our  activities  during  the  year  2007,  we  may  require  additional  capital  for  the 
possible  acquisition  of  further  minority  PIs  in  PSCs  in  drilling  blocks  heretofore  awarded  and  that  we  may 
hereafter propose to enter into in India and possibly elsewhere.  We believe it can be expected that our interest 
in such ventures would be a PI.  As of April 13, 2007, the scope of any possible such activities has not been 
definitively established and, accordingly, we are unable to state the amount of any funds that may be required 
for  these  purposes.  As the holder of a PI in any such  possible activities, it can be expected that we will be 
required to contribute capital to any such ventures in proportion to our percentage interest.  No specific plans or 
arrangements have been made to raise additional capital and we have not entered into any agreements in that 
regard.  We expect that if we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities.  As 
of April 13, 2007, we are unable to estimate the terms on which any such capital may be raised, the price per 
share or possible number of shares involved. 
We believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet all our expenses and cash requirements 
during the year ended December 31, 2007 for our present level of operations.  We do not expect to have any 
significant change in 2007 in our number of employees. 
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
The Company’s Significant Accounting Policies are outlined in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements 
in Item 7 of this Annual Report.  In the ordinary course of business, we have made a number of estimates and 
assumptions relating to the reporting of our consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of our 
operations and our cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Actual results 
could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.  We believe that the 
following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies. 
 
Property and equipment 
The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for its petroleum and natural gas operations.  Upon the 
commencement of economic production quantities of petroleum and natural gas, depletion of our exploration 
costs in India included in Property and Equipment, will be provided on a country-by-country basis using the 
unit-of-production  method  based  upon  estimated  proven  petroleum  and  natural  gas  reserves.    The  costs  of 
acquiring and evaluating our unproven properties in India will not be depleted until it is determined whether or 
not  proven  reserves  are  attributable  to  the  properties,  the  major  development  projects  are  completed,  or 
impairment occurs.  To date we are currently in the development stage and have not yet found any commercial 
reserves  in  India.    We  are  continuing  with  our  exploratory  drilling  programs  in  India  and  have  no  basis  for 
impairment of the costs incurred to date.  
 
Recent Accounting Standards 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
In  June  2006,  the  FASB  issued  FASB  Interpretation  No.  48,  “Accounting  for  Uncertainty  in  Income  Taxes” 
(“FIN 48”), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.  FIN 48 prescribes a 
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a 
tax  position  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.    The  Interpretation  requires  that  the  Corporation 
recognize  in  the  financial  statements,  the  impact  of  a  tax  position,  if  that  position  is  more  likely than not of 
being  sustained  on  audit,  based  on  the  technical  merits  of  the  position.    FIN  48  also  provides  guidance  on 
derecognition,  classification,  interest  and  penalties,  accounting  in  interim  periods  and  disclosure.    The 
provisions  of  FIN  48  are  effective  beginning  January  1,  2007  with  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  change  in
24
accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of deficit.  The Corporation is currently 
evaluating the impact FIN 48 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
Fair Value Measurements 
In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), which defines 
fair  value,  establishes  a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  and  expands  disclosures  about  fair  value 
measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 
15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and is applicable beginning in the first quarter of 2008. 
The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  that  FAS  157  will  have  on  its  consolidated  financial 
statements. 
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities  –  Including  an  amendment  of  FASB  Statement  No.  115”,  (“FAS  159”)  which  permits  entities  to 
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. A 
business entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has 
been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. This statement is expected to expand the use of fair 
value  measurement.  FAS  159  is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued  for  fiscal  years  beginning  after 
November  15,  2007,  and  interim  periods  within  those  fiscal  years,  and  is  applicable  beginning  in  the  first 
quarter of 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that FAS 159 will have on its consolidated 
financial statements.

Risk Factors 
An  investment  in  shares  of  our  common  stock  involves  a  high  degree  of  risk.    You  should  consider  the 
following  factors,  in  addition  to  the  other  information  contained  in  this  Annual  Report,  in  evaluating  our 
business and current and proposed activities before you purchase any shares of our common stock.  You should 
also  see  the  "Cautionary  Statement  for  Purposes  of  the  Safe  Harbor  Provisions  of  the  Private  Securities 
Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995"  regarding  risks  and  uncertainties  relating  to  us  and  to  forward-looking 
statements in this Annual Report. 
There can be no assurance that the exploratory drilling to be conducted on the exploration blocks in which we 
hold  an  interest  will  result  in  any  discovery  of  reserves  of  hydrocarbons  or  that  any  hydrocarbons  that  are 
discovered  will  be  in  commercially  recoverable  quantities.    In  addition, the realization of any revenues from 
commercially  recoverable  hydrocarbons  is  dependent  upon  the  ability  to  deliver,  store  and  market  any 
hydrocarbons  that  are  discovered.    The  presence  of  hydrocarbon  reserves  on  contiguous  properties  is  no 
assurance or necessary indication that hydrocarbons will be found in commercially marketable quantities on the 
exploration blocks in which we hold an interest. 
 
Risks Relating to Our Oil and Gas Activities 
Because We Are In the Early Stage Of Developing Our Activities, There Are Considerable Risks That We Will 
Be Unsuccessful 
We are in the early stage of developing our operations.  Our only activities in the oil and natural gas exploration 
and production industry have primarily involved entering into ten PSCs with the GOI.  We have realized no 
revenues  from  our  oil  and  natural  gas  exploration  and  development  activities  and  do  not  claim  any  proved 
reserves of oil or natural gas.  As of April 13, 2007, a venture in which we have a net 5% carried interest has 
drilled and abandoned two wells, has drilled, tested and cased three wells and is currently drilling two wells.  
Two ventures that we have a 10% participating interest have drilled and abandoned two wells, are in the testing 
phase of two wells and have suspended one well.  One venture that we have a 20% PI has drilled eight wells of 
which three have been abandoned and five that are either currently suspended or are being tested.
26
Our current plans are to conduct the exploration and development activities on the areas offshore and onshore 
India in accordance with the terms of the PSCs we are a party to.  There can be no assurance that the exploratory 
drilling to be conducted on the exploration blocks in which we hold will result in any discovery of hydrocarbons 
or that any hydrocarbons that are discovered will be in commercially recoverable quantities.  In addition, the 
realization  of  any  revenues  from  commercially  recoverable  hydrocarbons  is  dependent  upon  the  ability  to 
deliver, store and market any hydrocarbons that are discovered and as of April 13, 2007, there are no or limited 
facilities  for  the  delivery  and  storage  of  hydrocarbons  on  the  areas  covered  by  our  PSCs.    The  presence  of 
hydrocarbon reserves on contiguous properties is no assurance or necessary indication that hydrocarbons will be 
found  in  commercially  marketable  quantities  on  the  exploration  blocks  in  which  we  hold  an  interest.    Our 
exploration opportunities are highly speculative and should any of these opportunities not result in the discovery 
of commercial quantities of oil and gas reserves, our investment in the venture could be lost. 
Our business plans also include seeking to enter into additional joint ventures or other arrangements to acquire 
interests in additional government created and granted hydrocarbon exploration opportunities, primarily located 
onshore  or  in  the  offshore  waters  of  India  and  possibly  elsewhere.    Opportunities  to  acquire  interests  in 
exploration opportunities will be dependent upon our ability to identify, negotiate and enter into joint venture or 
other  similar  arrangements  with  respect  to  specific  exploration  opportunities  and  upon  our  ability  to  raise 
sufficient capital to fund our participation in those joint ventures or other exploration activities.  Our success 
will be dependent upon the success of the exploration activities of the ventures in which we acquire an interest 
and our ability to have adequate capital resources available at the times required. 
 
Our Interest In The Production Sharing Contracts Involve Highly Speculative Exploration Opportunities That 
Involve Material Risks That We Will Be Unsuccessful  
Our interests in the exploration blocks should be considered to be highly speculative exploration opportunities 
that  involve  material  risks.    None  of  the  exploration  blocks  in  which  we  have  an  interest  have  any  proven 
reserves and are not producing any quantities of oil or natural gas.  Exploratory drilling activities are subject to 
many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered.  There can be no 
assurance that wells drilled on any of the exploration blocks in which we have an interest or by any venture in 
which we may acquire an interest in the future will be productive or that we will receive any return or recover 
all or any portion of our investment.  Drilling for oil and gas may involve unsuccessful or unprofitable efforts, 
not only from dry wells, but from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a 
profit  after  drilling,  operating  and  other  costs.    The  cost  of  drilling,  completing  and  operating  wells  is  often 
uncertain. Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of numerous factors, many of 
which  are  beyond  the  operator’s  control,  including  economic  conditions,  mechanical  problems,  extreme 
downhole  pressures  and  temperatures,  title  problems,  weather  conditions,  compliance  with  governmental 
requirements and shortages or delays of equipment and services.  Drilling activities on the exploration blocks in 
which we hold an interest may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure may have a material adverse 
effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. 
 
Possible Inability of Contracting Parties to Fulfill Phase One of the Minimum Work Program for Certain of Our 
PSCs  
Our PSC relating to the KG Offshore Block provides that by the end of the first phase of the exploration phase 
the  contracting  parties  shall  have  drilled  at  least  fourteen  wells.    The  first  phase  of  the  exploration  period 
relating to the PSC for the KG Offshore Block has expired without the required minimum of at least fourteen 
exploration  wells  being  drilled  during  the  first  phase.    GSPC,  as  operator  and  on  behalf  of  the  contracting 
parties, is engaged in seeking from the GOI its consent to an extension of the expiration date of the first phase of 
the  exploration  period  and  is  also  seeking  to  proceed  to  the  second  phase  of  the  exploration  period  without 
relinquishing any of the contract area at the end of the first phase. In connection with the process of seeking 
these consents, on February 24, 2006, the management committee for the KG Offshore Block, which includes 
members representing the GOI, recommended a further extension of the first phase of twelve months to March 
11, 2007.  On February 9 2007, GSPC proposed to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, a body under the 
Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (“DGH”) and to the GOI that the contracting parties proceed to the next 
exploration phase (Phase II) upon completion of Phase I which was expiring on March 11, 2007.  It was also 
requested, on behalf of the contracting parties, to not relinquish any of the contract area at the end of Phase I.  
On March 12, 2007 DGH noted the option of GSPC, on behalf of the contracting parties, to enter phase two and 
advised  that  entry  into  phase  two,  effective  March  12,  2007,  is  subject  to  the  following  conditions:  (1)  Any
27
decision  by  the  GOI  on  the  substitution  of  the  Work  Program  of  Phase  I  will  be  binding  on  the  contracting 
parties; and (2) Any decision by the GOI on relinquishment of the 25% of original contract Area (ie. 462 sq. 
kms.) under the PSC would be binding on the contracting parties.  The extension of the first phase for the 18 
months to March 11, 2007 would be deducted from the next succeeding exploration phase.  As such the second 
phase would have a term of one year and expire March 11, 2008.  As at April 13, 2007, five exploratory wells 
have been drilled and one exploratory well, the KG#16 well, is currently being drilled on the exploration block 
leaving eight exploration wells to be drilled.  A seventh well, the KG#28 is also being drilled on the exploration 
block, but has been classified by the management committee as an appraisal well for the purposes of the PSC 
and not as an exploration well.  Approval of the extension and the entering into the second phase of exploration 
under the PSC without relinquishment of any portion of the contract area from the GOI is currently outstanding. 
 Unless  this  approval  is  granted,  the  Company  may  be  liable  for  the  consequences  of  non-fulfillment  of  the 
minimum work commitment in a given time frame under the PSC.  The PSC has provisions for termination of 
the PSC on account of various reasons specified therein including material breach of the contract.  Termination 
rights can be exercised after giving ninety days written notice.  This failure to timely complete the minimum 
work commitment, though the Company has been advised by GSPC there is no precedence, may be deemed by 
the GOI to be a failure to comply with the provisions of the contract in a material particular.   
The termination of the PSC by the GOI would result in the loss of the Company’s interest in the KG Offshore 
Block  other  than  areas  determined  to  encompass  "commercial  discoveries".    The  PSC  sets  forth  procedures 
whereby  the  operator  can  obtain  the  review  of  the  management  committee  under  the  PSC  as  to  whether  a 
discovery  on  the  exploration  block  should  be  declared  a  commercial  discovery  under  the  PSC.    Those 
procedures have not been completed at present with respect to the discovery on the KG Offshore Block and, 
accordingly,  as  of  April  13,  2007,  no  areas  on  the  KG  Offshore  Block  have  been  determined  formally  to 
encompass "commercial discoveries" as that term is defined under the PSC. 
In the event the PSC is terminated by the Government of India, or in the event the work program is not fulfilled 
by the end of the relevant exploration phase, the PSC provides that each party to the PSC is to pay to the GOI its 
participating interest share of an amount which is equal to the amount that would be required to complete the 
minimum work program for that phase.  We are of the view that GSPC, under the terms of our CIA, would be 
liable for our participating interest share of the amount required to complete the minimum work program for the 
phase. 
The  PSC  relating  to  the  Mehsana  Block  expired  without  the  required  minimum  of  seven  wells  having  been 
drilled. In October, 2006 the management committee under the PSC for the Mehsana Block approved a proposal 
to seek from the GOI an extension of the first exploration phase for a six month period from November 21, 2006 
to  May  20,  2007  and  on  April  6,  2007  the  members  of  the  operating  committee  under  the  Mehsana  Block 
operating agreement resolved to submit an application to the GOI for extension for an additional six months to 
November 20, 2007 to complete the minimum work program under Phase I.  In seeking that extension, the joint 
venture partners agreed to provide a 100% Bank Guarantee and a 10% cash payment to be agreed upon based on 
pre-estimated  liquidated  damages  for  the  unfinished  minimum  work  program  as  reasonably  determined  by 
DGH, which has not yet been determined.  As well, the contractor would be required to relinquish 25% of the 
block pursuant to the provisions of the PSC.  The period of extension will be set off against the term of the 
Second  Phase  which  would  reduce  Phase  II  to  one  year  expiring  November  20,  2008.    Final  consent  to  this 
extension is awaiting GOI approval. 
The  PSC  relating  to  the  Sanand/Miroli  Block  expired  without  the  required  minimum  of  twelve  wells  having 
been  drilled.    On  January  29,  2007  the  management  committee  under  the  PSC  for  the  Sanand/Miroli  Block 
approved a proposal to seek from the GOI an extension of the first exploration phase for a six month period 
from January 28, 2007 to July 28, 2007.  Final consent to this extension is awaiting GOI approval.
Because Our Activities Have Only Recently Commenced And We Have No Operating History And Reserves Of 
Oil And Gas, We Anticipate Future Losses; There Is No Assurance Of Our Profitability 
Our  oil  and  natural  gas  operations  have  been  only  recently  established  and  we  have  very  limited  operating 
history, oil and gas reserves or assets upon which an evaluation of our business, our current business plans and 
our  prospects  can  be  based.    Our  prospects  must  be  considered  in  light  of  the  risks,  expenses  and  problems 
frequently encountered by all companies in their early stages of development and, in particular, those engaged in 
exploratory oil and gas activities.  Such risks include, without limitation:
28
•  We will experience failures to discover oil and gas in commercial quantities; 
•
There are uncertainties as to the costs to be incurred in our exploratory drilling activities, cost overruns are 
possible and we may encounter mechanical difficulties and failures in completing wells; 
There are uncertain costs inherent in drilling into unknown formations, such as over-pressured zones, high 
temperatures and tools lost in the hole; and
•
•  We may make changes in our drilling plans and locations as a result of prior exploratory drilling. 
During the exploration phase prior to the start date of initial commercial production, we have a carried interest 
in  the  exploration  activities  on  the  KG  Offshore  Block.    Our  interests  in  our  other  exploration  blocks  are 
participating interests which require us to pay our proportionate share of exploration, drilling and development 
expenses on these blocks substantially as those expenses are incurred.  Unexpected or additional costs can affect 
the commercial viability of producing oil and gas from a well and will affect the time when and amounts that we 
can expect to receive from any production from a well.  Because our carried costs of exploration and drilling on 
the KG Offshore Block are to be repaid in full to the operator, GSPC, before we are entitled to any share of 
production, additional exploration and development expenses will reduce and delay any share of production and 
revenues we will receive.  
There can be no assurance that the ventures in which we are a participant will be successful in addressing these 
risks,  and  any  failure  to  do  so  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  prospects  for  the  future.    Our 
operations were recently established, and as such, we have no substantial operating history to serve as the basis 
to predict our ability to further the development of our business plan.  Likewise, the outcome of our exploratory 
drilling activities, as well as our quarterly and annual operating results cannot be predicted. Consequently, we 
believe that period to period comparisons of our exploration, development, drilling and operating results will not 
necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our stage of development or future 
prospects.  Through April 13, 2007, we abandoned two wells drilled on the KG Offshore Block, two wells on 
the Mehsana Block and three wells on the Tarapur Block and it is likely that in some future quarter our stage of 
development or operating or drilling results may fall below our expectations or the expectations of securities 
analysts and investors and that some of our drilling results will be unsuccessful and the wells abandoned.  In 
such event, the trading price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.  
 
We Expect to Have Substantial Requirements For Additional Capital That May Be Unavailable To Us Which 
Could  Limit  Our  Ability  To  Participate  In  Our  Existing  and  Additional  Ventures  Or  Pursue  Other 
Opportunities.  Our Available Capital is Limited 
In order to participate under the terms of our PSCs as well as in further joint venture arrangements leading to the 
possible  grant  of  exploratory  drilling  opportunities,  we  will be required to contribute or have available to us 
material amounts of capital.  Under the terms of our CIA relating to the KG Offshore Block, after the start date 
of initial commercial production on the KG Offshore Block, and under the terms of the nine other PSCs we are 
parties  to,  we  are  required  to  bear  our  proportionate  share  of  costs  during  the  exploration  phases  of  those 
agreements.  There can be no assurance that our currently available capital will be sufficient for these purposes 
or that any additional capital that is required will be available to us in the amounts and at the times required.  
Such capital also may be required to secure bonds in connection with the grant of exploration rights, to conduct 
or participate in exploration activities or be engaged in drilling and completion activities.  We intend to seek the 
additional  capital  to  meet  our  requirements  from  equity  and  debt  offerings  of  our  securities.    Our  ability  to 
access  additional  capital  will  depend  in  part  on  the  success  of  the  ventures  in  which  we  are  a  participant  in 
locating reserves of oil and gas and developing producing wells on the exploration blocks, the results of our 
management in locating, negotiating and entering into joint venture or other arrangements on terms considered 
acceptable, as well as the status of the capital markets at the time such capital is sought. 
There can be no assurance that capital will be available to us from any source or that, if available, it will be at 
prices  or  on  terms  acceptable  to  us.    Should  we  be  unable  to  access  the  capital  markets  or  should  sufficient 
capital  not  be  available,  our  activities  could  be  delayed  or  reduced  and,  accordingly,  any  future  exploration 
opportunities, revenues and operating activities may be adversely affected and could also result in our breach of 
the terms of a PSC which could result in the loss of our rights under the contract. 
As  of  December  31,  2006,  we  had  cash  and  cash  equivalents  of approximately $33.4 million.  We currently 
expect that our available cash will be sufficient to fund us through the budget periods ending March 31, 2008 
and through the balance of 2007 at our present level of operations on the ten exploration blocks in which we are
29
currently a participant including our newly acquired NELP-VI exploration blocks. Although exploration activity 
budgets are subject to ongoing review and revision, our present estimate of our commitments of capital pursuant 
to  the  terms  of  our  PSCs  relating  to  our  six  exploration  blocks,  excluding  our  newly  acquired  NELP-VI 
exploration blocks, totals approximately $12.7 million during the period April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008.  We 
anticipate total expenditures on the four newly acquired NELP-VI blocks for the first exploration phase which 
covers  four  years  to  be  approximately  $28  million.    Any  further  PSC's  we  may  seek  to  enter  into  or  any 
expanded  scope  of  our  operations  or  other  transactions  that  we  may  enter  into  may  require  us  to  fund  our 
participation  or  capital  expenditures  with  amounts  of  capital  not  currently  available  to  us.    We  may  be 
unsuccessful in raising the capital necessary to meet these capital requirements.  There can be no assurance that 
we will be able to raise the capital. 
India’s Regulatory Regime May Increase Our Risks And Expenses In Doing Business 
All phases of the oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in which we are participating 
are regulated in varying degrees by the Indian government, either directly or through one or more governmental 
entities.    The  areas  of  government  regulation  include  matters  relating  to  restrictions  on  production,  price 
controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, environmental protection and rig safety.  In 
addition, the award of a PSC is subject to GOI consent and matters relating to the implementation and conduct 
of operations under the PSC are subject, under certain circumstances, to GOI consent.  As a consequence, all 
future drilling and production programs and operations we undertake or are undertaken by the ventures in which 
we participate in India must be approved by the Indian government.  Shifts in political conditions in India could 
adversely  affect  our  business  in  India  and  the  ability  to  obtain  requisite  government  approvals  in  a  timely 
fashion or at all.  We, and our joint venture participants, must maintain satisfactory working relationships with 
the  Indian  government.    This  regulatory  environment  and  possible  delays  inherent  in  that  environment  may 
increase  the  risks  associated  with  our  exploration  and  production  activities  and  increase  our  costs  of  doing 
business. 
 
Our  Control  By  Directors  And  Executive  Officers  May  Result  In  Those  Persons  Having  Interests  Divergent 
From Our Other Stockholders 
As  of  April  13,  2007,  our  Directors  and  executive  officers  and  their  respective  affiliates,  in  the  aggregate, 
beneficially hold 32,523,667 shares or approximately 49.1% of our outstanding Common Stock.  As a result, 
these stockholders possess significant influence over us, giving them the ability, among other things, to elect a 
majority  of  our Board of Directors and approve significant corporate transactions.  These persons will retain 
significant control over our present and future activities and our other stockholders and investors may be unable 
to  meaningfully  influence  the  course  of  our  actions.    These  persons  may  have  interests  regarding  the  future 
activities and transactions in which we engage which may diverge from the interests of our other stockholders.  
Such share ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us, 
impeding  a  merger,  consolidation,  takeover  or  other  business  combination  involving  us,  or  discourage  a 
potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us which could have a 
material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.  Although management has no intention of 
engaging  in  such  activities,  there  is  also  a  risk  that  the  existing  management  will  be  viewed  as  pursuing  an 
agenda which is beneficial to themselves at the expense of other stockholders.
30
Our Reliance On A Limited Number Of Key Management Personnel Imposes Risks On Us That We Will Have 
Insufficient Management Personnel Available If The Services Of Any Of Them Are Unavailable  
We are dependent upon the services of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jean Paul Roy, and Executive 
Vice  President  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  Allan  J.  Kent.    The  loss  of  either  of  their  services  could  have  a 
material adverse effect upon us.  We currently do not have employment agreements with either of such persons 
or key man life insurance.  The services of both Mr. Roy and Mr. Kent are provided pursuant to the terms of 
agreements  with  corporations  wholly-owned  by  each  of  them.    At  present,  Mr.  Kent’s  services  are  provided 
through  an  oral  agreement  with  the  corporation  he  owns.  Accordingly,  these  agreements  do  not  contain  any 
provisions whereby Mr. Roy and Mr. Kent have direct contractual obligations to us to provide services or refrain 
from other activities. 
At present, our future is substantially dependent upon the geological and geophysical capabilities of Mr. Roy to 
locate oil and gas exploration opportunities for us and the ventures in which we are a participant.  His inability 
to do the foregoing could materially adversely affect our future activities.  We entered into a three-year TSA 
with  RGB  dated  August  29,  2003,  a  company  owed  100%  by  Mr.  Roy,  to  perform  such  geological  and 
geophysical  duties  and  exercise  such  powers  related  thereto  as  we  may  from  time  to  time  assign  to  it.    The 
expiration term of this contract has subsequently been extended to December 31, 2007.  We have no agreement 
directly with Mr. Roy regarding his services to us.  
 
Our Success Is Largely Dependent On The Success Of The Operators Of The Ventures In Which We Participate 
And  Their  Failure  Or  Inability  To  Properly  Or  Successfully  Operate  The  Oil  And  Gas  Exploration, 
Development And Production Activities On An Exploration Block, Could Materially Adversely Affect Us  
At present, our only oil and gas interests are our contractual rights under the terms of the ten PSCs with the GOI 
that  we  have  entered  into.    We  are  not  and  will  not  be  the  operator  of  any  of  the  exploration,  drilling  and 
production activities conducted on our exploration blocks, with the exception of the DS block in which we are 
the  operator.    Accordingly,  the  realization  of  successes  in  the  exploration  of  the  blocks  is  substantially 
dependent upon the success of the operators in exploring for and developing reserves of oil and gas and their 
ability to market those reserves at prices that will yield a return to us. 
Under the terms of our CIA for the KG Offshore Block, we have a carried interest in the exploration activities 
conducted  by  the  parties  on  the  KG  Offshore  Block  prior  to  the  start  date  of  initial  commercial  production.  
However, under the terms of that agreement, all of our proportionate share of capital costs for exploration and 
development activities must be repaid without interest over the projected production life or ten years, whichever 
is less.  Our proportionate share of these costs and expenses expected to be incurred over the 6.5 year term of the 
PSC for which our interest is carried was originally estimated to be approximately $22.0 million.  Additional 
drilling costs including the drilling to depths in excess of 5,000 meters, where higher downhole temperatures 
and  pressures  are  encountered,  versus  shallower  depths  as  originally  anticipated,  as  well  as  the  testing  and 
completion costs of these wells, has resulted in additional costs exceeding originally estimated expenditures.  As 
a consequence of these additional drilling costs incurred, as of April 13, 2007, the annual budget for the period 
April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008 submitted to the Management Committee under the PSC for the KG Offshore 
Block  estimates  that  GSPC  will  expend  approximately  $50.4  million  attributed  to  us  (including  the  amount 
attributable  to  RGM)  under  the  CIA  over  the  period  April  1,  2007  to  March  31,  2008.    Further  additional 
expenditures  may  be  required  for  cost  overruns  and  completions  of  commercially  successful  wells.    We  are 
unable to estimate the amount of additional expenditures GSPC will make as operator attributable to us prior to 
the start date of initial commercial production under the CIA or when, if ever, any commercial production will 
commence.  Of these expenditures, 50% are for the account of Roy Group (Mauritius) Inc. under the terms of 
the Participating Interest Agreement between us and Roy Group (Mauritius) Inc.  We are not entitled to any 
share of production from the KG Offshore Block until such time as the expenditures attributed to us, including 
those expenditures made for the account of Roy Group (Mauritius) Inc., under the CIA, have been recovered by 
GSPC  from  future  production  revenue.    Therefore,  we  are  unable  to  estimate  when  we  may  commence  to 
receive  distributions  from  any  production  of  hydrocarbon  reserves  found  on  the  KG  Offshore  Block.    As 
provided in the CIA, in addition to repaying our proportionate share of capital costs incurred for which we were 
carried, we will be required to bear our proportionate share of the expenditures attributable to us after the start 
date of initial commercial production on the KG Offshore Block.
31
Certain Terms Of The Production Sharing Contracts May Create Additional Expenses And Risks That Could 
Adversely Affect Our Revenues And Profitability  
The PSCs contain certain terms that may affect the revenues of the joint venture participants to the agreements 
and create additional risks for us.  These terms include, possibly among others, the following:
•  The venture participants are required to complete certain minimum work programs during the two or 
three phases of the terms of the PSCs.  In the event the venture participants fail to fulfill any of these 
minimum work programs, the parties to the venture must pay to the GOI their proportionate share of the 
amount  that  would  be  required  to  complete  the  minimum  work  program.    Accordingly,  we  could  be 
called upon to pay our proportionate share of the estimated costs of any incomplete work programs.  At 
April 13, 2007, we have failed to complete phase one work programs under three of our PSCs within the 
time periods agreed.  We have applied to the GOI for extensions of these allotted time periods and are 
awaiting the GOI response.
•  Until such time as the GOI attains self sufficiency in the production of crude oil and condensate and is 
able to meet its national demand, the parties to the venture are required to sell in the Indian domestic 
market  their  entitlement  under  the  PSCs  to  crude  oil  and  condensate  produced  from  the  exploration 
blocks.    In  addition,  the  Indian  domestic  market  has  the  first  call  on  natural  gas  produced  from  the 
exploration blocks and the discovery and production of natural gas must be made in the context of the 
government’s policy of utilization of natural gas and take into account the objectives of the government 
to develop its resources in the most efficient manner and promote conservation measures.  Accordingly, 
this provision could interfere with our ability to realize the maximum price for our share of production 
of hydrocarbons;
•  The  parties  to  each  agreement  that  are  not  Indian  companies,  which  includes  us,  are  required  to 
negotiate technical assistance agreements with the GOI or its nominee whereby such foreign company 
can render technical assistance and make available commercially available technical information of a 
proprietary nature for use in India by the government or its nominee, subject, among other things, to 
confidentiality restrictions.  Although not intended, this could increase each venture’s and our cost of 
operations; and
•  The parties to each venture are required to give preference, including the use of tender procedures, to 
the purchase and use of goods manufactured, produced or supplied in India provided that such goods are 
available on equal or better terms than imported goods, and to employ Indian subcontractors having the 
required skills insofar as their services are available on comparable standards and at competitive prices 
and terms.  Although not intended, this could increase the ventures and our cost of operations.
These provisions of the PSCs, possibly among others, may increase our costs of participating in the ventures and 
thereby affect our profitability.  Failure to fully comply with the terms of the PSCs creates additional risks for 
us. 
 
The Requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Require That We Undertake an Evaluation 
of Our Internal Controls That May Identify Internal Control Weaknesses. 
The  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  imposes  new  duties  on  us  and  our  executives,  directors,  attorneys  and 
independent  registered  public  accounting  firm.    In  order  to  comply  with  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act,  we  are 
evaluating  our  internal  controls  systems  to  allow  management  to  report  on,  and  our  independent  auditors  to 
attest  to,  our  internal  controls.    We  have  initiated establishing  the  procedures  for  performing  the  system  and 
process evaluation and testing required in an effort to comply with the management certification and auditor 
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  We anticipate being able to fully implement 
the  requirements  relating  to  reporting  on  internal  controls  and  all  other  aspects  of  Section  404  in  a  timely 
fashion.  If we are not able to implement the reporting requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with 
adequate compliance, our management and/or our auditors may not be able to render the required certification 
and/or  attestation  concerning  the  effectiveness  of  the  internal  controls  over  financial  reporting,  we  may  be 
subject  to  investigation  and/or  sanctions  by  regulatory  authorities,  such  as  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission or American Stock Exchange, and our reputation may be harmed.  Any such action could adversely 
affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock. 
 
Oil  And  Gas  Prices  Fluctuate  Widely  And  Low  Oil  And  Gas  Prices  Could  Adversely  Affect  Our  Financial 
Results
32
There is no assurance that there will be any market for oil or gas produced from the exploration blocks in which 
we hold an interest and our ability to deliver the production from any wells may be constrained by the absence 
of or limitations on collector systems and pipelines.  Future price fluctuations could have a major impact on the 
future  revenues  from  any  oil  and  gas  produced  on  these  exploration  blocks  and  thereby  our  revenue,  and 
materially affect the return from and the financial viability of any reserves that are claimed.  Historically, oil and 
gas  prices  and  markets  have  been  volatile,  and  they  are  likely  to  continue  to  be  volatile  in  the  future.    A 
significant decrease in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and profitability 
and would adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our operations.  In addition, because world 
oil prices are quoted in and trade on the basis of U.S. dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that affect 
world oil prices could also affect our revenues.  Prices for oil and gas fluctuate in response to relatively minor 
changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that 
are beyond our control, including:
the level of consumer demand;
the domestic and foreign supply of oil and gas;
•  political conditions and civil unrest in oil producing regions, including the Middle East and elsewhere;  
• 
•  quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries upon its members; 
• 
•  weather conditions;  
•  domestic and foreign government regulations;  
• 
the price and availability of alternative fuels;  
•  overall economic conditions; and  
• 
international political conditions.
In  addition,  various  factors  may  adversely  affect  the  ability  to  market  oil  and  gas  production  from  our 
exploration blocks, including:
• 
•
•
•
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
the capacity and availability of oil and gas gathering systems and pipelines;  
the ability to produce oil and gas in commercial quantities and to enhance and maintain production from 
existing wells and wells proposed to be drilled; 
the  proximity  of  future  hydrocarbon  discoveries  to  oil  and  gas  transmission  facilities  and  processing 
equipment (as well as the capacity of such facilities); 
the effect of governmental regulation of production and transportation (including regulations relating to 
prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, allowable production, importing and exporting of oil and condensate 
and matters associated with the protection of the environment);

the availability of drilling rigs and qualified personnel; and  
changes in demand.
Our Ability To Locate And Participate In Additional Exploration Opportunities And To Manage Growth May 
Be Limited By Reason Of Our Limited History Of Operations And The Limited Size Of Our Staff  
While our President and Executive Vice President have had extensive experience in the oil and gas exploration 
business,  we  have  been  engaged  in  limited  activities in the oil and gas business over approximately the past 
three  years  and  have  a  limited  history  of  activities  upon  which  you  may  base  your  evaluation  of  our 
performance.  As a result of our brief operating history and limited activities in oil and gas exploration activities, 
our success to date in entering into ventures to acquire interests in exploration blocks may not be indicative that 
we will be successful in entering into any further ventures.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful 
in growing our oil and gas exploration and development activities.  
Any future significant growth in our oil and gas exploration and development activities will place demands on 
our executive officers, and any increased scope of our operations will present challenges to us due to our current 
limited management resources.  Our future performance will depend upon our management and its ability to 
locate  and  negotiate  opportunities  to  participate  in  joint  venture  and  other  arrangements  whereby  we  can
33
participate in exploration opportunities.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.  
Our inability to locate additional opportunities, to hire additional management and other personnel or to enhance 
our management systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
Our Future Performance Depends Upon Our Ability And The Ability Of The Ventures In Which We Participate 
To Find Or Acquire Oil And Gas Reserves That Are Economically Recoverable 
Our  success  in  developing  our  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  development  activities  will  be  dependent  upon 
establishing, through our participation with others in joint ventures and other similar activities, reserves of oil 
and  gas  and  maintaining  and  possibly  expanding  the  levels  of  those  reserves.    We  and  the  joint  ventures  in 
which  we  may  participate  may  not  be  able  to  locate  and  thereafter  replace  reserves  from  exploration  and 
development activities at acceptable costs. Lower prices of oil and gas may further limit the kinds of reserves 
that can be developed at an acceptable cost.  The business of exploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is 
capital intensive. We may not be able to make the necessary capital investment to enter into joint ventures or 
similar  arrangements  to  maintain  or  expand  our  oil  and  gas  reserves  if  capital  is  unavailable  to  us  and  the 
ventures in which we participate.  In addition, exploration and development activities involve numerous risks 
that may result in dry holes, the failure to produce oil and gas in commercial quantities, the inability to fully 
produce discovered reserves and the inability to enhance production from existing wells.  
We  expect  that  we  will  continually  seek  to  identify  and  evaluate  joint  venture  and  other  exploration 
opportunities for our participation as a joint venture participant or through some other arrangement.  Our ability 
to  enter  into  additional  exploration  activities  will  be  dependent  to  a  large  extent  on  our  ability  to  negotiate 
arrangements with others and with various governments and governmental entities whereby we can be granted a 
participation  in  such  ventures.    There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  be  able  to  locate  and  negotiate  such 
arrangements, have sufficient capital to meet the costs involved in entering into such arrangements or that, once 
entered  into,  that  such  exploration  activities  will  be  successful.  Successful  acquisition  of  exploration 
opportunities  can  be  expected  to  require,  among  other  things,  accurate  assessments  of  potential  recoverable 
reserves, future oil and gas prices, projected operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and 
other factors.  Such assessments are necessarily inexact, and as estimates, their accuracy is inherently uncertain. 
 We  cannot  assure  you  that  we  will  successfully  consummate  any  further  exploration  opportunities  or  joint 
venture or other arrangements leading to such opportunities. 
 
Estimating  Reserves  And  Future  Net  Revenues  Involves  Uncertainties  And  Oil  And  Gas  Price  Declines  May 
Lead To Impairment Of Oil And Gas Assets 
Currently, we do not claim any proved reserves of oil or natural gas.  Any reserve information that we may 
provide in the future will represent estimates based on reports prepared by independent petroleum engineers, as 
well  as  internally  generated  reports.  Petroleum  engineering  is  not  an  exact  science.    Information  relating  to 
proved oil and gas reserves is based upon engineering estimates derived after analysis of information we furnish 
or furnished by the operator of the property.  Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of 
future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical 
production  from  the  area  compared  with  production  from  other  producing  areas,  the  assumed  effects  of 
regulations  by  governmental  agencies  and  assumptions  concerning future oil and gas prices, future operating 
costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, all of which may in 
fact vary considerably from actual results.  Oil and gas prices, which fluctuate over time, may also affect proved 
reserve  estimates.    For  these  reasons,  estimates  of  the  economically  recoverable  quantities  of  oil  and  gas 
attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and 
estimates  of  the  future  net  cash  flows  expected  therefrom  prepared  by  different  engineers  or  by  the  same 
engineers at different times may vary substantially.  Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect 
to  reserves  we  may  claim  will  likely  vary  from  estimates,  and  such  variances  may  be  material.    Either 
inaccuracies in estimates of proved undeveloped reserves or the inability to fund development could result in 
substantially reduced reserves.  In addition, the timing of receipt of estimated future net revenues from proved 
undeveloped  reserves  will  be  dependent  upon  the  timing  and  implementation  of  drilling  and  development 
activities estimated by us for purposes of the reserve report.   
Quantities  of  proved  reserves  are  estimated  based  on  economic  conditions  in  existence  in  the  period  of 
assessment. Lower oil and gas prices may have the impact of shortening the economic lives on certain fields 
because  it  becomes  uneconomic  to  produce  all  recoverable  reserves  on  such  fields,  thus  reducing  proved 
property reserve estimates. If such revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves occur, it will have the
34
effect of increasing the rates of depreciation, depletion and amortization on the affected properties, which would 
decrease  earnings  or  result  in  losses  through  higher  depreciation,  depletion  and  amortization  expense.  The 
revisions may also be sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties that would result in a further 
non-cash charge to earnings. 
 
Risks Relating To The Market For Our Common Stock 
Volatility Of Our Stock Price 
The public market for our common stock has been characterized by significant price and volume fluctuations.  
There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  market  price  of  our  common  stock  will  not  decline  below  its  current  or 
historic  price  ranges.  The  market  price  may  bear  no  relationship  to  the  prospects,  stage  of  development, 
existence  of  oil  and  gas  reserves,  revenues,  earnings,  assets  or  potential  of  our  company  and  may  not  be 
indicative of our future business performance. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide 
fluctuations.  Fluctuations in the price of oil and gas and related international political events can be expected to 
affect the price of our common stock.  In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price 
and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies which fluctuations have been 
unrelated  to  the  operating  performance  of  these  companies.  These  market  fluctuations,  as  well  as  general 
economic,  political  and  market  conditions,  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  market  price  of  our 
company's  common  stock.  In  the  past,  following  periods  of  volatility  in  the  market  price  of  a  company's 
securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Such litigation, if 
instituted, and irrespective of the outcome of such litigation, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of 
management's attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on our company's business, results of 
operations and financial condition.

Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table.   
On August 29, 2003, we entered into a TSA with RGB, a company organized under the laws of Barbados and 
wholly owned by Mr. Roy.  Under the agreement, RGB agreed to perform such geologic and geophysical duties 
as are assigned to it by us.  The term of the agreement, as amended, extends through December 31, 2007 and 
continues for successive periods of one year thereafter unless otherwise agreed by the parties or either party has 
given notice that the agreement will terminate at the end of the term.  On January 31, 2006, the terms of the 
agreement were amended to extend the term of the agreement from August 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 and 
amended the fee payable from $250,000 to $350,000 effective January 1, 2006.  RGB also is reimbursed for 
authorized travel and other out-of-pocket expenses.  The agreement prohibits RGB from disclosing any of our 
confidential information and from competing directly or indirectly with us for a period ending December 31, 
2007  with  respect  to  any  acquisition,  exploration,  or  development  of  any  crude  oil,  natural  gas  or  related 
hydrocarbon interests within the area of the country of India.  The agreement may be terminated by either party 
on  30  days’  prior  written  notice,  provided,  however,  the  confidentiality  and  non-competition  provisions  will 
survive the termination.   
D.I. Investments Ltd., a company controlled by Mr. Kent, is paid by us for consulting services.  The services of 
Mr. Kent are provided to us pursuant to the oral arrangement with D.I. Investments Ltd.  The oral agreement has

Item 12.   Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
 
On March 27, 2003, GeoGlobal entered into a Participating Interest Agreement (“PIA”) with RGM, whereby 
GeoGlobal assigned and holds in trust for RGM subject to GOI consent, 50% of the benefits and obligations of 
the PSC covering the Exploration Block KG-OSN-2001/3 ("PSC-KG") and the CIA leaving GeoGlobal with a 
net 5% participating interest in the PSC-KG and a net 5% carried interest in the CIA.  Under the terms of the 
PIA, until the GOI consent is obtained, GeoGlobal retains the exclusive right to deal with the other parties to the 
PSC-KG and the CIA and is entitled to make all decisions regarding the interest assigned to RGM.  RGM has 
agreed to be bound by and be responsible for the actions taken by, obligations undertaken and costs incurred by 
GeoGlobal  in  regard  to  RGM's  interest,  and  to  be  liable  to  GeoGlobal  for  its  share  of  all  costs,  interests, 
liabilities  and  obligations  arising  out  of  or  relating  to  the  RGM  interest.    RGM  has  agreed  to  indemnify 
GeoGlobal against any and all costs, expenses, losses, damages or liabilities incurred by reason of RGM's failure 
to pay the same.   
Subject to obtaining the government consent to the assignment, RGM is entitled to all income, receipts, credits, 
reimbursements, monies receivable, rebates and other benefits in respect of its 5% interest which relate to the 
PSC-KG.  GeoGlobal has a right of set-off against sums owing to GeoGlobal by RGM.  In the event that the 
Indian  government  consent  is  delayed  or  denied,  resulting  in  either  RGM  or  GeoGlobal  being  denied  an 
economic  benefit  it  would  have  realized  under  the  PIA,  the  parties  agreed  to  amend  the  PIA  or  take  other 
reasonable steps to assure that an equitable result is achieved consistent with the parties' intentions contained in 
the PIA.  In the event the consent is denied, neither party is entitled to assert any claim against the other except 
as  is  specifically  set  forth  in  the  agreement.    We  have  not  yet  obtained  the  consent  of  the  GOI.    As  a 
consequence of this transaction the Company reports its holdings under the PSC-KG and CIA as a net 5% PI.

Roy Group (Mauritius) Inc. further agreed in the Participating Interest Agreement that it would not dispose of 
any interest in the agreement, its 5% interest, or the shares of Roy Group (Mauritius) Inc. without first giving 
notice to GeoGlobal India of the transaction, its terms, including price, and the identity of the intended assignee 
and any other material information, and GeoGlobal India has the first right to purchase the interest proposed to 
be sold on the terms contained in the notice to GeoGlobal India. GeoGlobal India is now our wholly-owned 
subsidiary corporation. 
On August 29, 2003, we entered into a TSA with RGB, a company organized under the laws of Barbados and 
wholly owned by Mr. Roy.  Under the agreement, RGB agreed to perform such geologic and geophysical duties 
as are assigned to it by us.  The term of the agreement, as amended, extends through December 31, 2007 and 
continues for successive periods of one year thereafter unless otherwise agreed by the parties or either party has 
given notice that the agreement will terminate at the end of the term.  On January 31, 2006, the terms of the 
agreement were amended to extend the term of the agreement from August 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007 and 
amended the fee payable from $250,000 to $350,000 effective January 1, 2006.  RGB also is reimbursed for 
authorized travel and other out-of-pocket expenses.  The agreement prohibits RGB from disclosing any of our 
confidential information and from competing directly or indirectly with us for a period ending December 31, 
2007  with  respect  to  any  acquisition,  exploration,  or  development  of  any  crude  oil,  natural  gas  or  related 
hydrocarbon interests within the area of the country of India.  The agreement may be terminated by either party 
on  30  days’  prior  written  notice,  provided,  however,  the  confidentiality  and  non-competition  provisions  will 
survive the termination.  RGB received $350,000 from us during 2006 ($250,000 plus a bonus of $60,000 in 
2005, $250,000 in 2004 and $83,333 in 2003), under the terms of this agreement. 
RGB was also reimbursed for medical insurance and expenses, travel, hotel, meals and entertainment expenses, 
computer  costs,  and  amounts  billed  to  third  parties  incurred  by  Mr.  Roy  during  2006  totaling  $134,637.    At 
December 31, 2006, the Company owed RGB $29,976 for services provided and expenses incurred pursuant to 
the TSA which amount bears no interest and has no set terms of repayment. 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, D.I. Investments Ltd. a company controlled by Mr. Kent, was paid 
$185,000  ($120,000  plus  a  bonus  of  $30,000  in  2005,  $120,000  in  2004  and  $61,715  in  2003)  by  us  for 
consulting services of Mr. Kent which are provided to us pursuant to an oral arrangement amended effective 
January 1, 2006.  D.I. Investments Ltd. was also reimbursed $38,442 for office costs, including rent, parking, 
office  supplies  and  telephone  as  well  as  travel,  hotel,  meals  and  entertainment  expenses  incurred  throughout 
2006.  At December 31, 2006, the Company owed D.I. Investments Ltd. $nil as a result of services provided and 
expensed incurred on behalf of the Company. 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, Amicus Services Inc. a company controlled by Mr. Vincent Roy, a 
brother of Mr. Jean Roy, received from us $56,257 as consulting fees for services rendered.  Amicus Services

travel and hotel incurred throughout 2006.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Of 
GeoGlobal Resources Inc. 
 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of GeoGlobal Resources Inc., a development stage 
enterprise, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' 
equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, and for the cumulative period from 
inception  on  August  21,  2002  to  December  31,  2006.    These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the 
Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our 
audits. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  We were not engaged to perform an audit of the 
Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Our  audits  included  consideration  of  internal  control  over 
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated 
financial position of GeoGlobal Resources Inc. as at December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the consolidated results of 
its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, and for the cumulative 
period  from  inception  on  August  21,  2002  to  December  31,  2006  in  conformity  with  United  States  generally 
accepted accounting principles. 
 
As  discussed  in  note  6b  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  2005  and  2004  stock-based  compensation 
disclosures have been restated.

Nature of Operations
GeoGlobal Resources Inc.  
(a development stage enterprise) 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2006 
 
1. 
The  Company  is  engaged  primarily  in  the  pursuit  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  through  exploration  and 
development in India.  Since inception, the efforts of GeoGlobal have been devoted to the pursuit of Production 
Sharing Contracts (“PSC”) with the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation ("GSPC"), Oil India Limited ("OIL") 
and  the  Government  of  India  ("GOI")  and  the  development  thereof.    To  date,  the  Company  has  not  earned 
revenue from these operations and is considered to be in the development stage.  The recoverability of the costs 
incurred  to  date is uncertain and dependent upon achieving commercial production or sale, the ability of the 
Company  to  obtain  sufficient  financing  to  fulfill  its  obligations  under  the  PSC’s  in  India  and  upon  future 
profitable operations and upon finalizing agreements with GSPC and OIL. 
On August 29, 2003, all of the issued and outstanding shares of GeoGlobal Resources (India) Inc. ("GeoGlobal 
India") were acquired by GeoGlobal Resources Inc., formerly Suite101.com, Inc.  As a result of the transaction, 
the former shareholder of GeoGlobal India held approximately 69.3% of the issued and outstanding shares of 
GeoGlobal  Resources  Inc.    This  transaction  is  considered  an  acquisition  of  GeoGlobal  Resources  Inc.  (the 
accounting subsidiary and legal parent) by GeoGlobal India (the accounting parent and legal subsidiary) and has 
been  accounted  for  as  a  purchase  of  the  net  assets  of  GeoGlobal  Resources  Inc.  by  GeoGlobal  India.  
Accordingly,  this  transaction  represents  a  recapitalization  of  GeoGlobal  India,  the  legal  subsidiary,  effective 
August 29, 2003.  These consolidated financial statements are issued under the name of GeoGlobal Resources 
Inc. but are a continuation of the financial statements of the accounting acquirer, GeoGlobal India.  The assets 
and  liabilities  of  GeoGlobal  India  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  at  their  historical 
carrying amounts.  As a result, the stockholders' equity of GeoGlobal Resources Inc. is eliminated and these 
consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations of GeoGlobal Resources Inc. only from the 
date of the acquisition. 
GeoGlobal Resources Inc. changed its name from Suite101.com, Inc. after receiving shareholder approval at the 
Annual  Shareholders  Meeting  held  on  January  8,  2004.    Collectively,  GeoGlobal  Resources  Inc.,  GeoGlobal 
India  and  its  other  wholly-owned  direct  and  indirect  subsidiaries,  are  referred  to  as  the  "Company"  or 
“GeoGlobal”.

Significant Accounting Policies

b)  Oil and gas interests
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
i)
Capitalized costs 
The  Company  follows  the  full  cost  method  of  accounting  for  its  petroleum  and  natural  gas 
operations.  Under this method all costs related to the exploration for and development of petroleum 
and  natural  gas  reserves  are  capitalized.    Costs  include  land  acquisition  costs,  geological  and 
geophysical  expenditures,  costs  of  drilling  both  productive  and  non-productive  wells  and  related 
overhead  costs.    Proceeds  from  the  sale  of  properties  will  be  applied  against  capitalized  costs, 
without any gain or loss being realized, unless such sale would significantly alter the relationship 
between  capital  costs  and  proven  reserves  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  attributable  to  the  cost 
center.
ii)  Depletion
Upon  the  commencement  of  production  of  economic  quantities  of  oil  and  gas,  depletion  of 
exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment will be provided on a 
country-by-country  basis  using  the  unit-of-production  method  based  upon  estimated  proven 
petroleum and natural gas reserves.  The costs of acquiring and evaluating unproven properties and 
major development projects will be excluded from costs subject to depletion until it is determined 
whether or not proven reserves are attributable to the properties, the major development projects are 
completed,  or  impairment  occurs.    For  depletion  and  depreciation  purposes,  relative  volumes  of 
petroleum  and  natural  gas  production  and  reserves  will  be  converted  into  equivalent  units  based 
upon estimated relative energy content.
iii)  Ceiling test
In  applying  the  full  cost  method,  the  Company  will  be  calculating  a  ceiling  test  whereby  the 
carrying value of petroleum and natural gas properties and production equipment, net of recorded 
deferred income taxes is limited to the present value of after-tax future net revenues from proven 
reserves,  discounted  at  10%  (based  on  prices  and  costs  at  the  balance  sheet  date  calculated 
quarterly), plus the lower of cost and fair value of unproven properties.  Should this comparison 
indicate an excess carrying value, the excess will be charged against earnings as additional depletion 
and  depreciation.    Unproven  properties  are  assessed  quarterly  for  possible  impairments  or 
reductions in value.
iv)  Asset retirement obligations
The Company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period 
in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the related long-lived 
asset.    The  fair  value  is  determined  through  a  review  of  engineering  and  environmental  studies, 
industry guidelines, and management’s estimate on a site by site basis.  The liability is subsequently 
adjusted  for  the  passage  of  time,  and  is  recognized  as  accretion  expense  in  the  consolidated 
statement of operations.  The liability is also adjusted due to revisions in either the timing or the 
amount  of  the  original  estimated  cash  flows  associated  with  the  liability.    The  increase  in  the 
carrying value of the asset is amortized over the useful life of the related productive assets.
v)  Revenue recognition
Revenue associated with the production and sales of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids 
owned  by  the  Company  will  be  recognized  when  production  is  sold  to  a  purchaser  at  a  fixed  or 
determinable  price,  and  when  delivery  has  occurred  and  title  passes  from  the  Company  to  its 
customer, and if the collectibility of the revenue is probable.
c)
Property and Equipment 
Computer  and  office  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost,  with  depreciation  provided  for  on  a  declining-
balance basis at 30% per annum.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
Joint operations 
All  of  the  Company's  petroleum  and  natural  gas  activities  are  conducted  jointly  with  others.    The 
Company’s undivided interests in joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis.
e)  Net loss per share
Net loss per share is calculated based upon the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the 
period.    The  treasury  stock  method  is  used  to  determine  the  dilutive  effect  of  the  stock  options.    The 
treasury stock method assumes any proceeds obtained upon exercise of options would be used to purchase 
common shares at the average market price during the period.  There are no differences between net loss 
and  the  weighted-average  number  of  shares  used  in  the  calculation  of  the  basic  net  loss  per  share  and 
those used in the calculation of diluted net loss per share as the effect of the options and warrants on the 
diluted net loss per share calculations is anti-dilutive for all periods presented.
f)  Comprehensive loss
Comprehensive  loss  includes  all  changes  in  equity  except  those  resulting  from  investments  made  by 
owners  and  distributions  to  owners.    Comprehensive  loss  consists  only  of  net  loss  for  all  periods 
presented.
g)  Use of estimates
h)
i)
j)
The  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles 
generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and 
the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.    Actual  results  may  differ 
from these estimated amounts. 
Financial instruments 
The  Company  has  estimated  the  fair  value  of  its  financial  instruments  which  include  cash  and  cash 
equivalents,  restricted  cash,  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable  and  due  to  related  companies.    The 
Company used valuation methodologies and market information available as at period end to determine 
that  the  carrying  amounts  of  such  financial  instruments  approximate  fair  value  in  all  cases.    It  is 
management’s  opinion  that  the  Company  is  not  exposed  to  significant  interest,  currency  or  credit  risks 
arising from its financial instruments. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  include  cash  on  hand,  balances  with  banks  and  short-term  deposits  with 
original maturities of three months or less, earning interest based upon the US prime rate.  Interest earned 
during the year ended December 31, 2006 was US$1,751,550 (December 31, 2005 – US$462,174) which 
included  US$1,744,697  (December  31,  2005  –  US$454,887)  of  interest  earned  on  our  cash  and  cash 
equivalents held in term deposits representing an average rate of 4.81% (December 31, 2005 – 2.57%). 
Foreign currency translation 
The  Company  translates  integrated  foreign  operations  into  the  functional  currency  of  the  parent.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at rates of 
exchange  in  effect  at  the  date  of  the  balance  sheet.    Non-monetary  items  are  translated  at  the  rate  of 
exchange  in  effect  when  the  assets  are  acquired  or  obligations  incurred.    Revenues  and  expenses  are 
translated  at  average  rates  in  effect  during  the  period,  with  the  exception  of  depreciation  which  is 
translated at historic rates.  Exchange gains and losses are charged to operations.

Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
Income taxes 
The Company follows the liability method of tax allocation.  Under this method, assets and liabilities are 
determined based on differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying value using 
enacted  tax  rates  anticipated  to  apply  in  the  periods  when  the  temporary  differences  are  expected  to 
reverse. 
The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in income or 
loss in the period in which the change is enacted. 
Stock-based compensation plan 
In prior years, reporting of the impact of stock-based compensation, such as employee stock options, on 
the Company's net loss and net loss per share was required only on a pro-forma basis. 
In  December,  2004,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  a  revision  to  Standard  123, 
Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation.  The  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  123(R), 
Share-Based  Payment  ("FAS  123(R)"),  requires  the  recognition  of  compensation  cost  for  stock-based 
compensation arrangements with employees, consultants and directors based on their grant date fair value 
using  the  Modified  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  Compensation  expense  is  recorded  over  the 
awards' respective requisite service, with corresponding entries to paid-in capital. 
The Company adopted FAS 123(R) using the modified-prospective-transition method on January 1, 2006. 
The  impact  of  this  adoption  required  the  Company  to  recognize  a  charge  for  past  stock-based 
compensation  options  granted  of  US$367,596  over  the  subsequent  3  years  in  accordance  with  their 
respective vesting periods.

a)
Exploration costs – India 
The  exploration  costs  incurred  to  date  are  not  subject  to  depletion  and  cover  six  exploration  blocks, 
known as the KG Offshore Block, the Mehsana Block, the Sanand/Miroli Block, the Ankleshwar Block, 
the DS 03 Block and the Tarapur Block.  It is anticipated that all or certain of these exploration costs may 
be subject to depletion commencing in the year 2007.
b)  Capitalized overhead costs
Included  in  the  US$7,506,075  of  exploration  cost  additions  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006 
(year ended December 31, 2005 - US$1,578,124) are certain overhead costs capitalized by the Company 
in  the  amount  of  US$2,133,984  (year  ended  December  31,  2005  -  US$469,268)  directly  related  to  the 
exploration  activities  in  India.    The  capitalized  overhead  amount  includes  capitalized  stock-based 
compensation  of  US$766,689  (year  ended  December  31,  2005  –  US$nil)  (see  note  6b)  of  which 
US$323,283 (year ended December 31, 2005 – US$nil) was for the account of a related party (see note 
8c).  Further, the capitalized overhead amount includes US$1,000,705 (year ended December 31, 2005 - 
US$145,773) which was paid to third parties and US$nil (year ended December 31, 2005 - US$51,800) 
was recovered from third parties.  The balance of US$366,590 was paid to and on behalf of a related party 
(year ended December 31, 2005 - US$375,295) (see note 8c).  These costs are incurred solely by and on 
behalf of the Company in providing its services under the Carried Interest Agreement (“CIA”) and are 
therefore not reimbursable under the CIA (see note 4c).
c)  Carried Interest Agreement
On  August  27,  2002,  GeoGlobal  entered  into  a  CIA  with  GSPC,  which  grants  the  Company  a  10% 
Carried Interest (“CI”) (net 5% - see note 4d) in the KG Offshore Block. The CIA provides that GSPC is 
responsible for GeoGlobal's entire share of any and all costs incurred during the Exploration Phase prior 
to the date of initial commercial production. 
Under the terms of the CIA, all of GeoGlobal's and Roy Group (Mauritius) Inc.'s (“RGM”), a related party 
(note 8b) proportionate share of capital costs for exploration and development activities will be recovered 
by GSPC without interest over the projected production life or ten years, whichever is less, from oil and 
natural gas produced on the Exploration Block. GeoGlobal is not entitled to any share of production until 
GSPC has recovered the Company's share of the costs and expenses that were paid by GSPC on behalf of 
the Company and RGM.              
As at December 31, 2006, GSPC has incurred costs of Rs 114.96 crore (approximately US$26.1 million) 
(December 31, 2005 - Rs 63.31 crore (approximately US$14.1 million)) attributable to GeoGlobal under 
the CIA of which 50% is for the account of RGM.

Participating Interest Agreement 
d) 
On  March  27,  2003,  GeoGlobal  entered  into  a  Participating  Interest  Agreement  (“PIA”)  with  RGM, 
whereby GeoGlobal assigned and holds in trust for RGM subject to GOI consent, 50% of the benefits and 
obligations of the PSC covering the Exploration Block KG-OSN-2001/3 ("PSC-KG") and the CIA leaving 
GeoGlobal with a net 5% participating interest in the PSC-KG and a net 5% carried interest in the CIA.  
Under the terms of the PIA, until the GOI consent is obtained, GeoGlobal retains the exclusive right to 
deal with the other parties to the PSC-KG and the CIA and is entitled to make all decisions regarding the 
interest assigned to RGM, RGM has agreed to be bound by and be responsible for the actions taken by, 
obligations undertaken and costs incurred by GeoGlobal in regard to RGM's interest and to be liable to 
GeoGlobal for its share of all costs, interests, liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to the 
RGM  interest.    RGM  has  agreed  to  indemnify  GeoGlobal  against  any  and  all  costs,  expenses,  losses, 
damages  or  liabilities  incurred  by  reason  of  RGM's  failure  to  pay  the  same.    Subject  to  obtaining  the 
government consent to the assignment, RGM is entitled to all income, receipts, credits, reimbursements, 
monies receivable, rebates and other benefits in respect of its 5% interest which relate to the PSC-KG.  
GeoGlobal has a right of set-off against sums owing to GeoGlobal by RGM.  In the event that the Indian 
government  consent  is  delayed  or  denied,  resulting  in  either  RGM  or  GeoGlobal  being  denied  an 
economic benefit it would have realized under the PIA, the parties agreed to amend the PIA or take other 
reasonable  steps  to  assure  that  an  equitable  result  is  achieved  consistent  with  the  parties'  intentions 
contained in the PIA.  As a consequence of this transaction the Company reports its holdings under the 
PSC-KG and CIA as a net 5% participating interest ("PI").
e)  Deed of Assignment and Assumption
On April 7, 2005, the Company entered into a Deed of Assignment and Assumption with GSPC whereby, 
subject to the terms of the agreement, the Company agreed to acquire and assume and GSPC agreed to 
assign a 20% PI in the onshore Tarapur exploration block (CB-ON/2).  The assignment of the 20% PI was 
subject  to  obtaining  the  consent  of  the  GOI  to  the  assignment,  which  consent  was  received  effective 
August 24, 2006.  As a condition to receiving the GOI consent, the Company provided to the GOI an 
irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of US$1,200,000 secured by a term deposit of the Company in 
the same amount (see note 11a).  This amount represents the Company’s performance guarantee for its 
20%  PI  share  (Rs.  5.3  crore)  of  the  estimated  exploration  costs  budgeted  for  the  period  April  1,  2006 
through March 31, 2007. 
Under the terms of the Company's agreement with GSPC, the Company is to fund its 20% PI share of all 
past exploration costs incurred on the Tarapur exploration block.  As at December 31, 2006, the amount of 
US$3,972,765 has been included in oil and gas interests for our PI share of costs incurred in the previous 
drilling of eight exploration wells and a recently completed 500 sq. km. 3D seismic acquisition.

September 2005 Financing 
During September 2005, GeoGlobal completed the sale of 3,252,400 Units of its securities at US$6.50 per 
Unit, together with a concurrent sale of an additional 1,000,000 Units on the same terms, for aggregate 
gross cash total proceeds of US$27,640,600. 
Each  Unit  is  comprised  of  one  common  share  and  one  half  of  one  warrant.    One  full  warrant  ("2005 
Purchase Warrant") entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share for US$9.00, for a term 
of two years expiring September 2007.  The 2005 Purchase Warrants are subject to accelerated expiration 
in  the  event  that  the  price  of  the  Company's  common  shares  on  the  American  Stock  Exchange  is 
US$12.00  or  more  for  20  consecutive  trading  days,  the  resale  of  the  shares  included  in  the  Units  and 
issuable on exercise of the 2005 Purchase Warrants has been registered under the US Securities Act of 
1933, as amended (the “Act”), and the hold period for Canadian subscribers has expired.  In such events, 
the warrant term will be reduced to 30 days from the date of issuance of a news release announcing such 
accelerated expiration of the warrant term.  At March 23, 2007 since not all such events have occurred, the 
accelerated expiration of the warrant term was not triggered.  
Costs  of  US$1,541,686  were  incurred  in  issuing  shares  in  these  transactions  which  included  a  fee  of 
US$1,268,436 paid to Jones Gable & Company Limited with respect to the sale of the 3,252,400 Units, 
and, in addition, Compensation Options were issued to Jones Gable & Company Limited entitling it to 
purchase an additional 195,144 Units at an exercise price of US$6.50 per Unit through their expiration in 
September 2007.  Compensation Options are also subject to accelerated expiration on the same terms and 
conditions as the warrants issued in the transaction.
c)  December 2003 Financing
On  December  23,  2003,  GeoGlobal  completed  a  brokered  private  placement  of  5,800,000  units  at 
US$1.00 each, together with a concurrent private placement of an additional 200,000 units on the same 
terms, for aggregate gross cash total proceeds of US$6,000,000.   
Each  unit  is  comprised  of  one  common  share  and  one  half  of  one  warrant.    One  full  warrant  ("2003 
Purchase Warrant"), entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share for US$2.50, for a term 
of two years from date of closing.  The 2003 Purchase Warrants are subject to accelerated expiration 30 
days after issuance of a news release to that effect in the event that the common shares trade at US$4.00 or 
more for 20 consecutive trading days and if the resale of the shares has been registered under the 1933 Act 
and the hold period for Canadian subscribers has expired.  Also issued as additional consideration for this 
transaction were 580,000 Broker Warrants. 
The 580,000 Broker Warrants described above entitled the holder to purchase 580,000 common shares at 
an exercise price of US$1.50 per share which were fully exercised before they expired on December 23, 
2005 for gross proceeds of US$870,000.

As reported 
Pro-forma 
 
At January 1, 2006, the impact of the adoption of FAS123(R) required the Company to recognize a 
charge for past stock-based compensation options granted of US$367,596 over the next 3 years in 
accordance  with  their  respective  vesting  periods.    In  the  year  ended  December  31,  2006, 
US$301,028 of this charge was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as general 
and administrative expense resulting in an increase in the net loss and comprehensive loss for the 
period in the same amount and no impact on the net loss per share – basic and diluted for the period. 
ii)  At December 31, 2006, the total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized 
was  US$1,577,286  (December  31,  2005  –  US$367,596)  which  will  be  recognized  over  the 
remaining vesting period of the options.  The total fair value of all options vested during the year 
December 31, 2006 was $1,046,490. 
In prior years, the Company was required only to disclose the impact on net loss and net loss per 
share on a pro-forma basis.  The prior periods have been restated due to an error in the classification 
and calculation for modification of stock-based compensation.  The impact of this restatement in the 
year ended December 31, 2005 was a reduction of the net loss pro-forma from US$2,452,180 to 
US$1,080,303 (year ended December 31, 2004 – US$1,182,030 to US$1,094,259) and a reduction 
of  the  net  loss  per  share  –  basic  and  diluted  pro-forma  from  US$0.05  to  US$0.02  (year  ended 
December 31, 2004 – no impact and remained at US$0.02).  In addition, in December 31, 2005, 
$183,581  of  stock  based  compensation  was  reclassified  from  operating  expenses  to  capital 
expenditures (December 31, 2004 - $87,771 - From inception of August 21, 2002 to December 31, 
2003 - $53,354).

7. 
On August 29, 2003, pursuant to an agreement dated April 4, 2003 and amended August 29, 2003, the Company 
completed a transaction with Mr. Roy and GeoGlobal Resources (India) Inc. ("GeoGlobal India"), a corporation 
then wholly-owned by Mr. Roy, whereby the Company acquired from Mr. Roy all of the outstanding capital 
stock  of  GeoGlobal  India.    In  exchange  for  the  outstanding  capital  stock  of  GeoGlobal  India,  the  Company 
issued 34.0 million shares of its Common Stock.  Of the 34.0 million shares, 14.5 million shares were delivered 
to Mr. Roy at the closing of the transaction on August 29, 2003 and an aggregate of 19.5 million shares were 
held  in  escrow  by  an  escrow  agent.    The  terms  of  the  escrow  provide  for  the  release  of  the shares upon the 
occurrence of certain developments relating to the outcome of oil and natural gas exploration and development 
activities conducted on the KG Offshore Block.  On August 27, 2004, 14.5 million shares were released to Mr. 
Roy  from  escrow  upon  the  commencement  of  a  drilling  program  on  the  KG  Offshore  Block.    The  final  5.0 
million shares remaining in escrow will be released only if a commercial discovery as defined under the PSC is 
declared on the KG Offshore Block.  In addition to the shares of Common Stock, the Company delivered to Mr. 
Roy  a  US$2.0  million  promissory  note,  of  which  US$500,000  was  paid  on  the  closing  of  the  transaction  on 
August 29, 2003, US$500,000 was paid on October 15, 2003, US$500,000 was paid on January 15, 2004 and 
US$500,000  was  paid  on  June  30,  2004.    The  note  did  not  accrue  interest.    The  note  was  secured  by  the 
outstanding  stock  of  GeoGlobal  India  which  has  subsequently  been  released.    As  a  consequence  of  the 
transaction,  Mr.  Roy  held  as  of  the  closing  of  the  transaction  an  aggregate  of  34.0  million  shares  of  our 
outstanding  Common  Stock,  or  approximately  69.3%  of  the  shares  outstanding,  assuming  all  shares  held  in 
escrow are released to him.  The terms of the transaction provide that Mr. Roy has the right to vote all 34.0 
million shares following the closing, including the shares during the period they are held in escrow.  Shares not 
released from the escrow will be surrendered back to GeoGlobal. 
As  discussed  in  note  1,  the  acquisition  of  GeoGlobal  India  by  GeoGlobal  was  accounted  for  as  a  reverse 
takeover  transaction.    As  a  result,  the  cost  of  the  transaction  was  determined  based  upon  the  net  assets  of 
GeoGlobal  deemed  to  have  been  acquired.    These  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  results  of 
operations of GeoGlobal from the date of acquisition.  The net identifiable assets acquired of GeoGlobal were as

Income Taxes 
Income tax expense 
The  provision  for  income  taxes  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  differs  from  the  result  which 
would have been obtained by applying the combined Federal, State and Provincial tax rates to the loss 
before income taxes.  This difference results from the following items:

11.  Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (continued) 
c)  KG Offshore Block
The first phase of the exploration period relating to the PSC for the KG Offshore Block has expired, as 
extended on August 29, 2005 through March 11, 2006, without the required minimum of at least fourteen 
wells being drilled during the first phase.  On February 24, 2006, the management committee for the KG 
Offshore Block recommended a further extension of the first phase of twelve months to March 11, 2007.  
On February 9 2007 the parties to the PSC, through GSPC as operator, gave notice under Article 3 of the 
PSC to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, a body under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas 
(“DGH”) and to the GOI to proceed to the next exploration phase (Phase II) upon completion of Phase I 
which was expiring on March 11, 2007.  It was also requested to not relinquish any of the contract area at 
the end of Phase I.  On March 12, 2007 DGH issued its approval to enter into Phase II of the exploration 
program with an effective date of March 12, 2007 subject to the following conditions: (1) Any decision by 
the GOI on the substitution of the Work Program of Phase I will be binding on the contractor; and (2) Any 
decision by the GOI on relinquishment of the 25% of Original Contract Area (ie. 462 sq. kms.) as per 
Article 4.1 of the PSC would be binding on the contractor.  The extension of the first phase for the 18 
months to March 11, 2007 would be deducted from the next succeeding exploration phase.  As such the 
second phase would have a term of one year and expire March 11, 2008.  As at March 23, 2007, five 
exploratory wells have been drilled and one exploratory well, the KG#16 well, is currently being drilled 
on the exploration block leaving eight exploration wells to be drilled.  A seventh well, the KG#28 is also 
being drilled on the exploration block, but currently as an appraisal well and not as an exploration well.   
Approval  of  entering  into  the  second  phase  of  exploration  under  the  PSC  from  the  GOI  is  currently 
outstanding.    Unless  this  approval  is  granted,  the  Company  may  be  liable  for  consequences  of  non-
fulfillment  of  the  minimum  work  commitment  in  a  given  time  frame  under  the  PSC.    The  PSC  has 
provisions for termination of the PSC on account of various reasons specified therein including material 
breach of the contract.  Termination rights can be exercised after giving ninety days written notice.  This 
failure  to  timely  complete  the  minimum  work  commitment,  though  there  is  no  precedence,  may  be 
deemed by the GOI to be a failure to comply with the provisions of the contract in a material particular.  
The Company has been advised by GSPC, the operator, that it is unaware of any precedent for such an 
occurrence.   
The  termination  of  the  PSC  by  the  GOI  would  result  in  the  loss  of  the  Company’s  interest  in  the  KG 
Offshore Block other than areas determined to encompass "commercial discoveries".  The PSC sets forth 
procedures whereby the operator can obtain the review of the management committee under the PSC as to 
whether a discovery on the exploration block should be declared a commercial discovery under the PSC.  
Those procedures have not been completed at present with respect to the discovery on the KG Offshore 
Block and, accordingly, as of March 23, 2007, no areas on the KG Offshore Block have been determined 
formally to encompass "commercial discoveries" as that term is defined under the PSC. 
In the event the PSC is terminated by the GOI, or in the event the work program is not fulfilled by the end 
of the relevant exploration phase, each party to the PSC is to pay to the GOI its participating interest share 
of  an  amount  which  is  equal  to  the  amount  that  would  be  required  to  complete  the  minimum  work 
program for that phase. 
Certain exploration costs related to the KG Offshore Block are incurred solely by and on behalf of the 
Company in providing its services under the CIA and are therefore not reimbursable under the CIA.  As 
such,  these  costs  have  been  capitalized  in  the  Company's  accounts  under  Oil  and  gas  interests  and  at 
December 31, 2006 amount to US$3,111,676.

d)  Tarapur Block
As the holder of a participating interest in the Tarapur Block, the Company is required to fund its 20% share 
of  all  exploration  and  development  costs  incurred  on  the  exploration  block.    To  December  31,  2006, 
US$3,972,765 has been incurred under the terms of the Company's agreement with GSPC.  Of this amount, 
US$3,017,646 has been paid to GSPC and US$955,119 is in accounts payable at December 31, 2006.  The 
Company has budgeted to expend approximately US$2.7 million for exploration activities under the terms of 
the agreement over the period April 1, 2007 to November 22, 2007.  These activities include the drilling of 3 
exploration wells and the acquisition of 90 sq kms of 3-D seismic.  Under the terms of the agreement, the 
Company is required to keep in force a financial and performance guarantee securing its performance under 
the Tarapur PSC. 
Corporate Head Office 
Our corporate head office is located at Suite #310, 605 – 1 Street SW, Calgary, Alberta, T2P 3S9 Canada. 
These premises are leased for a term of one year ending April 30, 2007 at an annual rental of $65,565 for 
base rent and operating costs.  These premises include approximately 2,927 square feet which we consider 
adequate for our present activities.  We are currently in negotiations to renew this lease at market prices 
for a further two year term to April 30, 2009.

13.  Subsequent Event 
a)  NELP-VI Blocks
On  March  2,  2007,  the  Company  along  with  its  joint  venture  partners  executed  PSC's  with  the  GOI 
covering four new exploration blocks awarded under the sixth round of the New Exploration Licensing 
Policy (NELP-VI). 
The Company is required to fund its participating interest for Phase I exploration and development costs 
incurred  in  fulfilling  the  minimum  work  commitments  under  these  PSC's  as  outlined  below.    The 
Company's share of these costs is estimated to total approximately US$28.0 million for all four blocks 
over the four years of Phase I. 
i)
Exploration Block KG-ONN-2004/1 (KG Onshore Block) - Reprocess 564 LKM of 2-D seismic; 
conduct a gravity and magnetic and geochemical survey; acquire, process and interpret 548 sq kms 
of 3-D seismic; and drill 12 exploratory wells between 2,000 and 5,000 meters. 
Exploration Block RJ-ONN-2004/2 (RJ Block 20) - Reprocess 463 LKM of 2-D seismic; conduct a 
gravity  and  magnetic  and  geochemical  survey;  acquire,  process  and  interpret  250  LKM  of  2-D 
seismic and 700 sq kms of 3-D seismic; and drill a total of 12 exploratory wells between 2,000 and 
2,500 meters.

surveys; acquire, process and interpret 325 LKM of 2-D seismic; and drill 10 core holes to a depth 
of approximately 500 meters.
b)
Under  the  terms  of  all  the  PSC's,  the  Company  will  be  required  to  keep  in  force  a  financial  and 
performance guarantee. 
India office condominium 
On  November  21,  2006  the  Company  entered  into  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  Creative 
InfoCity Ltd of Gandhinagar, India to acquire an office condominium of approximately 11,203 sq. ft.  A 
deposit of US$28,090 was paid which is reflected in the financial statements in Property and Equipment 
(note 3).  As a formal agreement has not yet been executed, the preliminary costs and resulting liability in 
the amount of $365,880 is not yet reflected in these financial statements.
14.  Recent Accounting Standards 
a)  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
b)
c)
In  June  2006,  the  FASB  issued  FASB  Interpretation  No.  48,  “Accounting  for  Uncertainty  in  Income 
Taxes” (“FIN 48”), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.  FIN 
48  prescribes  a  recognition  threshold  and  measurement attribute  for  the  financial  statement  recognition 
and  measurement  of  a  tax  position  taken  or  expected  to  be  taken  in  a  tax  return.    The  Interpretation 
requires  that  the  Corporation  recognize  in  the  financial  statements,  the impact of a tax position, if that 
position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.  
FIN  48  also  provides  guidance  on  derecognition,  classification,  interest  and  penalties,  accounting  in 
interim periods and disclosure.  The provisions of FIN 48 are effective beginning January 1, 2007 with the 
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance 
of  deficit.    The  Corporation  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  FIN  48  will  have  on  its  consolidated 
financial statements.
Fair Value Measurements 
In  September  2006,  the  FASB  issued  FAS  No.  157,  “Fair  Value  Measurements”  (“FAS  157”),  which 
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair 
value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after 
November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and is applicable beginning in the first 
quarter  of  2008.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  that  FAS  157  will  have  on  its 
consolidated financial statements. 
 
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
In  February  2007,  the  FASB  issued  FAS  No.  159,  “The  Fair  Value  Option  for  Financial  Assets  and 
Financial Liabilities – Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”, (“FAS 159”) which permits 
entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified 
election dates. A business entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the 
fair  value  option  has  been  elected  in  earnings  at  each  subsequent  reporting  date.  This  statement  is 
expected  to  expand  the  use  of  fair  value  measurement.  FAS  159  is  effective  for  financial  statements 
issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years, 
and is applicable beginning in the first quarter of 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact 
that FAS 159 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

for, the periods presented in this report; 
 
4.  The small business issuer’s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure 
controls  and  procedures  (as  defined  in  Exchange  Act  Rules  13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e))  for  the  small  business issuer and 
have:
(a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures 
to  be  designed  under  our  supervision,  to  ensure  that  material  information  relating  to  the  small 
business issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those 
entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;
(b)    Evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  small  business  issuer’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and

business issuer’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or 
is  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the  small  business  issuer’s  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting; and
5.    The  small  business  issuer’s  other  certifying  officer(s)  and  I  have  disclosed,  based  on our  most  recent  evaluation  of 
internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  to  the  small  business  issuer’s  auditors  and  the  audit  committee  of  the  small 
business issuer’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
(a)  All  significant  deficiencies  and  material  weaknesses  in  the  design  or  operation  of  internal  control 
over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the small business issuer's 
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
(b)  Any  fraud,  whether  or  not  material,  that  involves  management  or  other  employees  who  have  a
significant role in the small business issuer's internal control over financial reporting
