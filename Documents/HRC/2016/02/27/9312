<p><b>Introduction</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance gives an account of the 
communications sent to Governments by the Special Rapporteur between 1 May 2007 and 31 
December 20071. It also contains in summary form the replies received from Governments to his 
communications during the same period, as well as observations of the Special Rapporteur 
where considered appropriate. Replies to communications which were received by the Special 
Rapporteur after 31 December 2007 will be reflected in his next communications report.

<p><b>SUMMARY OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
Australia 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 10 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences sent an allegation to the 
Government regarding the recent adoption of <b>the Northern Territory National Emergency 
legislation in response to the situation of child abuse in Aboriginal communities</b>. 
</p>
<p>3. According to information received, on 14 June 2007 the Northern Territory Board of 
Inquiry into the Protection of Aboriginal Children from Sexual Abuse released its final report 
Little Children are Sacred (Ampe Akelyernemane Meke Mekarle). The outcome of a research of 
eight months, the report provided a description of the situation of &#8220;common, widespread and 
grossly under-reported&#8221; sexual abuse of children, in particular of girls, in Northern Territory 
Aboriginal communities, which is depicted as a &#8220;reflection of historical, present and continuing 
social dysfunction&#8221;. The report contains a broad set of recommendations ranging from 
prevention (including education, health services, housing, and employment measures) to law and 
order, protection of children, and rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p>4. On 17 August 2007, following the proposals tabled by the Minister for Families, 
Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Senate passed a package of legislation 
integrated by the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007; the Social 
Security and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Northern Territory National 
Emergency Response and Other Measures) Bill 2007; and the Families, Community Services 
and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment 2007 (hereinafter &#8220;NTNER 
legislation&#8221;).The recently adopted NTNER legislation includes a number of extraordinary 
measures applicable only to Aboriginal communities of Northern Territory, including a system 
of alcohol restrictions, as well as offences for breaching these restrictions; the acquisition of 
townships through five year leases; the licensing of community stores; the audits of publicly 
funded computer, with offences for illicit use; a ban on pornographic materials, an income 
management system; and changes to the communities&#8217; permit system. These measures were 
coupled with a substantial increase in the funding required to put them in place in the first twelve

months after their entry into force. Concern was expressed at numerous reports alleging potential 
or actual contradiction between the new legislation and the international human rights standards 
which are binding upon Australia&#8217;s ratification.  
</p>
<p>5. In particular, reports received alleged that, in promoting the adoption of the Emergency 
Bill, the Government had failed to consult with indigenous peoples, either via community 
authorities or representative organizations, through effective and culturally appropriate 
mechanisms. According to reports, the proposed legislation was introduced by the Government 
in the House of Representatives on 6 August 2007, 47 days after the announcement of the 
Government&#8217;s emergency plan and less than 24 hours after drafts of the proposed legislation 
were shared with opposition parties and relevant stakeholders. The draft legislation was then 
referred to the Senate&#8217;s Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry. 
Even though more than 150 written submissions against the proposed legislation were received, 
the Committee held only a one-day public inquiry on Friday 10 August 2007. On Monday 13 
August 2007, the Committee recommended that the Senate pass the proposed legislation without 
further amendments.  It is alleged that this very short period of time did not permit for an in-
depth scrutiny of the serious concerns expressed by the organizations that took part in the 
hearing, including some of the most representative Aboriginal organizations as well as major 
human rights organizations. It is alleged that, despite the existence of a real urgent need to 
address the situation, the adoption of the new policy has violated the rights of the Aboriginal 
communities of Northern Territory to be consulted and to give their consent prior the adoption of 
any measures susceptible to affect them directly. These rights have been affirmed, inter alia, by 
the Committee for the elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD). 
</p>
<p>6. Furthermore, according to the allegations received, the NTNER legislation would include a 
number of extraordinary measures that would apply specifically to Aboriginal communities in 
Northern Territory, affecting a range of existing legislative scheme, including the Aboriginal 
Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (ALRA), the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (RDA); 
the Native Title Act 1995 and others. These measures would include restrictions in the exercise 
of individual rights of the members of Aboriginal communities, including in areas such as 
alcohol consumption or use of pornographic materials, as well as a number of limitations to 
vested communal rights. It is alleged that these measures would arbitrarily limit the exercise of 
their individual rights on an equal basis with other sectors of the national population, thus 
amounting to discrimination prohibited under international and domestic law/legislation. A 
number of provisions of the NTNER package would explicitly seek exemption from the 
application of the RDA, in connection to the permissibility of &#8220;special measures&#8221; provided for in 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). 
According to article 1 of ICERD, special measures are permissible under the Convention in case 
they are &#8220;necessary in order to ensure equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights and 
fundamental freedom&#8221; by groups of specific groups and &#8220;for the sole purpose of securing 
adequate advancements&#8221; of these groups. In this particular case, it is alleged that serious 
problems of child protection would not confined to indigenous communities living on 
indigenous-controlled land, the extraordinary measures adopted as a short-term strategy to 
combat child abuse would not reasonable and proportionate means of achieving the &#8220;adequate 
advancement&#8221; of the targeted communities.  
</p>
<p>7. Moreover, information received indicated that the NTNE legislation arbitrarily affects 
vested Aboriginal property rights on a number of fronts, in a way that would seem to contradict 
international and domestic standards concerning indigenous peoples&#8217; rights over their lands, 
territories, and natural resources. In addition, it was alleged that, in addition to the fact that the 
legal exceptions introduced by the NTNE legislation on land rights do not have a demonstrated </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 5 
</p>
<p> 
role in promoting children&#8217;s welfare, they would fail to meet the test required by ICERD for 
special measures. Part 4 of the Northern Territory Emergency Bill establishes a system of 
involuntary leases with regard to Aboriginal township land under Aboriginal Land Rights Act 
(ALRA) lands, Community Living Areas, and other lands, for a period of five years. Such leases, 
that would grant the Government exclusive possession and quiet enjoyment over approximately 
70 Aboriginal townships and settlements in the Northern Territory, can be approved without 
consultation with the concerned communities and without their consent. These leases further 
seem to be dispensed from the owner&#8217;s consent in cases of sublease and other dealings as 
required by the Land Rights Act. In addition, the compensation procedures established in the 
NTNER legislation would seem to compare unfavorably with the legal resources that non-
Aboriginal people enjoy in cases of compulsory acquisition of property rights.  
</p>
<p>8. Reportedly, the Government has justified the new system of compulsory acquisition by 
pushing forward the need to secure the unconditional access to Aboriginal land and assets during 
the emergency period, aiming at securing policing and social assistance, and at facilitating the 
early repair of buildings and infrastructure. However, allegations received claim that these 
objectives do not provide an adequate and proportionate justification to the new system of 
compulsory acquisition.  In this regard, according to information received, under the ALRA 
regulations any Government service, officer or agency would be able to enter Aboriginal 
townships without requiring a permit. It was further alleged that the system automatically works 
on the assumption that Aboriginal communities will not cooperate with the Government in the 
implementation of welfare policies, failing to limit compulsory acquisition as a measure of last 
resort and on at an ad-hoc basis. In this connection, reports indicate that the NTNE legislation 
weakens the Aboriginal lands permit system by depriving Aboriginal peoples of their power to 
remove unwanted elements for common areas and access roads in their communities, as 
provided for in ALRA.  
</p>
<p>9. In addition, according to the information received, the NTNE package legislation would 
contain provisions banning the consideration of the cultural background or customary laws of an 
offender in mitigation (or aggravation) of sentencing. These provisions mirror the provisions of 
the Crime Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Act 2006 &#8211; an act that has been the subject of 
concern in the past for its potential discriminatory implications, as it requires courts to treat 
Aboriginal Torres Strait Islanders, and other people with multicultural backgrounds, as if they 
did not belong to any specific cultural group. Information received indicated that that the impact 
of this measure in the Northern territory would be significantly worse, given the disproportionate 
numbers of Aboriginal peoples charged under State and Territory criminal law.  In addition, it 
was alleged that this measure would undermine the power and achievements of Aboriginal 
traditional courts, which have reportedly relied on flexible sentencing and bail options, as well as 
community involvement in order to strengthen compliance with the law while reducing rates of 
imprisonment and recidivism.  
</p>
<p>10. Reports received also expressed concern about the new income management regime 
included in the NTNER legislation. This system would include the linkage of welfare payments 
to children&#8217;s school attendance and to participating in clean up and repair activities. Concern was 
expressed that this new system, including the possible quarantining of up to 60% of welfare 
payments for food and other essentials, may increase the risk of violence against mothers and 
other caretaker women of Aboriginal communities, who could be &#8220;blamed&#8221; by the fathers of 
children for the quarantining of welfare payments.   
</p>
<p>11. Finally, concern had also been expressed about the termination of Community 
Development Employment Projects (CEDP) by the new legislation. The measure would include </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 6 
 
a period of transition payment in order to ensure the delivery of key services in force until 30 
June 2008. According to the reports, while 7,500 people currently depend of CEDP in the 
Northern Territory, only an estimated of 2,000 participants will be able to find an employment in 
the formal labour market after the end of the transition payment period. Concern has been 
expressed that the termination of CDEP, connected to the lack of alternative employment options 
in indigenous communities, could lead to increased social unrest in these communities and 
increased family violence and abuse.  
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 22 November 2007, the Government replied to the letter sent on 10 October 2007 
stating that the measures which comprise the Northern Territory Emergency Response (NTER) 
were both exceptional and necessary measures to enable all, particularly women and children, to 
live their lives free of violence and to enjoy the came rights to development, education, health, 
property, social security and culture that are enjoyed by other Australians. In this regard, the 
Government stressed that many of the provisions are time limited and designed to stabilize 
communities so that longer term action can be taken. 
</p>
<p>13. The Australian Government acknowledged that child abuse and neglect are not unique to 
Indigenous Australians and that while measures in the Northern Territory will impact more on 
Indigenous than on non-Indigenous people, they apply equally to all those living in the 
prescribed areas. The Government stated that the NTER implements Australia's obligations 
under human rights treaties such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child. While 
acknowledging that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
requires that such measures must not result in persons of a particular race being treated 
differently so as to diminish their equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, it 
further noted that this will not be the case where different treatment is based on objective and 
reasonable criteria that implement a legitimate purpose under relevant treaties, including the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government maintained that the legislation implementing NTER clarifies that certain 
measures are &#8220;special measures&#8221; for the purpose of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which 
implements Australia&#8217;s obligation under CERD. It was noted that such measures do not seek to 
take away rights and freedoms; rather, they provide the foundation for rebuilding social and 
economical structures and give meaningful content to Indigenous rights and freedom. 
</p>
<p>15. In addition, it was noted that the Australian Government has introduced broader changes to 
respond to child neglect in all Australian States and Territories. In this regard, it was indicated 
that State and Territory child welfare and authorities will be able to request the Government to 
income manage parents&#8217; welfare payments in circumstances where they consider it is necessary 
to ensure that parents meet their obligations to provide for their children&#8217;s basic needs. Parents 
and guardians receiving welfare payments will also be required to ensure children are enrolled at 
school and attend regularly. These measures will be progressively introduced over the next three 
years, with the school enrolment and attendance measures commencing in the Northern Territory 
as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>16. On the question of consultation with members of affected communities, the Government 
asserted that all prescribed communities had been visited by teams from the Operation Centre 
and that a series of regional community engagement workshops was underway with the objective 
of informing community members about the emergency response, providing an opportunity for 
discussion, building relationships and seeking their involvement in the implementation of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 7 
</p>
<p> 
response. It was also noted that the Government&#8217;s welfare payment delivery agency was meeting 
individually with those affected by the welfare reform measures. Furthermore, reference was 
made by the key role played by the appointed Government Business Managers in each 
community in working cooperatively, liaising with the local community and providing a direct 
point of contact for community members to discuss any issues and concerns they may have with 
the Australian Government.  
</p>
<p>17. In light of the consequences of widespread alcohol abuse for Indigenous Territorians, the 
Government noted that it had imposed alcohol restrictions - including a general ban on all people 
in prescribed areas possessing, selling, transporting and drinking alcohol- supported by extra 
policing during the emergency period that will help to track, investigate and prosecute any 
person bringing alcohol into vulnerable communities. Coupled with the new legislation, it was 
further indicated that the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing is 
implementing a package of measures which will provide alcohol withdrawal interventions, 
family support, referrals for withdrawal, rehabilitation and treatment and linkages with primary 
health care services Further, the Australian Government Department of Families, Community 
Services and Indigenous Affairs has been allocated an additional AUD$9.2 million in 2007-08 
for a new Alcohol Diversionary Activities initiative including rehabilitation services focused on 
providing activities to divert young people, living in remote Northern Territory Indigenous 
communities, away from alcohol and drugs. These services will provide intensive support in 
communities and will assist with the engagement of young people back into schools and 
employment (where appropriate). 
</p>
<p>18. Concerning the findings in the report that young children were being exposed to sexually 
explicit material in Indigenous communities and that this was having an adverse effect on the 
wellbeing and safety of these children, the Government indicated that it had banned both the 
possession of pornography within prescribed areas and the supply of pornography into those 
areas. The Government also introduced audits of publicly funded computers to identify illegal 
material. In addition the Australian Government is working with the Northern Territory 
Government on training needs for pornography education in Indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>19. Additionally, it was stated that the Government will compulsorily acquire leases over 
towns and communities specified by legislation for a period of five years, the area of the land 
being less than 0.1 per cent of all Indigenous land in the Northern Territory. The Government 
considers this as crucial to removing barriers to implementing the NTER in a timely fashion, 
allowing the Government to stabilize communities and ensure that children live in a cleaner 
environment with more sustainable housing. The Government, while noting that it cannot repair 
buildings and infrastructure in a crisis situation without access to the land and assets in question, 
indicated that the leases will only do what is necessary to address the current crisis and that  
underlying rights, title and interest of the Indigenous owners will be preserved and compensation 
will be provided whether payable. 
</p>
<p>20.  Furthermore, the Government noted that it has been considering changing the permit 
system &#8211; which in its view created closed communities which have hidden problems from public 
view and allowed some people to create a climate of fear and intimidation- since it announced a 
review in September 2006 and a discussion paper was released in October 2006. The 
Government noted that it decided to retain the permit system for 99.8% of Indigenous land in the 
Northern Territory. It added that public access will be allowed for common areas in major 
communities, that homes will remain private, sacred sites will continue to be respected, and that 
the Northern Territory Government will be able to legislate for the temporary closure of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 8 
 
common areas and access roads for cultural events including ceremonies and public health and 
safety.  
</p>
<p>21. The Government indicated that it has introduced welfare reforms in the NTER to stem the 
flow of cash being used to buy substances such as alcohol, drugs and pornography, and to ensure 
that money meant for children's welfare is used for that purpose. It was noted that in most cases 
up to 50% of welfare payments will be subject to income management. The level of individual 
entitlements will not be reduced, but rather redirected to ensure that the priority needs of the 
person, their partner, children and other dependants are met. These new arrangements apply to 
all people who receive welfare payments and live in prescribed communities in the Northern 
Territory. 
</p>
<p>22. Finally, the Government recalled that in 2006, the Council of Australian Governments 
(COAG) agreed that no customary law or cultural practice excuses, justifies, authorizes, requires 
or lessens the seriousness of violence or sexual abuse and that their laws would reflect this. In 
this regard, it noted that the Australian Government&#8217;s legislative amendments reflect this 
decision by providing that in the assessment of bail and sentencing decisions under Northern 
Territory law, the seriousness of criminal behaviour cannot be excused, lessened or aggravated 
because of customary law or cultural practice. The Government assured that, even if a court or 
bail authority will still be able to consider customary law in limited circumstances, legislation 
makes it clear that the decision to grant bail or impose a particular sentence should not be based 
on whether the criminal behaviour would be assessed as less, or more serious, due to customary 
law or cultural practice. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Australia for the detailed response 
provided to the allegation letter. The Special Rapporteur urges the Australian Government to 
revise the Northern Territory National Emergency legislation in order to ensure its compatibility 
with the relevant international human rights instruments. The Special Rapporteur recalls in 
particular General Recommendation No. XXIII on Indigenous Peoples adopted by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 1997 (A/52/18, Annex V), according 
to which States parties of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial 
Discrimination should provide indigenous peoples with conditions allowing for a sustainable 
economic and social development compatible with their cultural characteristics (para. 4, c); 
ensure that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation 
in public life and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without 
their informed consent (para. 4, d); and recognize and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to 
own, develop, control and use their communal lands, territories and resources.

protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression (see A/HRC/4/19/Add.1, par. 2-4),

<p> 
25. According to the information received, on 19 June 2006, activists and leaders of the Sama 
Adhikar Andolan (Chittagong Hill Tracks Equal Rights Movement), a political organization 
supported by the Government of Bangladesh and linked to Bengali settlers, violently intervened 
at a meeting o PCJSS (Chittagong Hill Tracts United Peoples&#8217; Party), a political organization 
linked to the indigenous peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, shouting communal slogans and 
attacking violently PCJSS members and supporters. It is alleged that the attackers were violent 
and destroyed chairs, tables, doors and windows of the hall. They subsequently set fire to the 
national flag, the party flag and the curtains of the building. Mr. <b>Poushe Thowai Marma</b>, Mr. 
<b>Kon Owai Mro</b>, Ms. <b>Sonari Tripura</b>, Ms. <b>Pongo Mro</b>, Mr. <b>Thowaimra Mro</b>, and Mr. <b>Mra 
Owai Marma</b> were injured during the attack. Mr. <b>Sadhuram Tripura</b> and Mr. <b>Chinghla Mong 
Chak</b>, leaders of the PCJSS, had to flee, as they were targeted by the offenders. Reports 
indicated that the local police and local army did not intervene during the attack. It was alleged 
that the deputy for security of the PCJSS conference, a Police Sub-Inspector, and a group of 
policemen were deployed in the Conference hall but didn&#8217;t react to the violence. The Special 
Rapporteurs expressed concern at what appeared to be related to a general situation of 
discrimination towards the indigenous peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

<p><b> 
Communication sent to the Government 
 
</b>26. On 10 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Independent expert on 
minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, sent an 
allegation letter to the Government of the Czech Republic concerning information received on 
the living conditions in socially excluded localities in the country affecting mainly persons 
belonging to the Roma minority. 
</p>
<p>27.  According to information received, a study conducted for the Ministry of Labour and 
Social Affairs of the Czech Republic identified 310 socially excluded Roma localities in the 
country, 35% of which would have emerged in the last 10 years. Reportedly, these localities 
possess a considerably sub-standard quality of housing, which in turn affects negatively the 
quality of life and related human rights of these individuals, such as access to work, health care 
and education services. According to reports, over 50% of Roma inhabit bare-walled apartments, 
otherwise known as &#8220;apartments of the lowest quality&#8221;, into which people with outstanding rent 
are relocated. In some cities this number reaches as much as 90%. 
</p>
<p>28. Even though it is acknowledged that the creation of Roma socially excluded localities 
arises from a mix of problems relating to high rates of unemployment and substandard education, 
it was alleged that they are often the result of racial discrimination and deliberate segregation 
policies within some municipalities. Reportedly, 90% of the municipalities where socially 
excluded communities are found do not have any concept or strategy of integration of Roma, 
while only 1% has an explicit one.  
</p>
<p>29. Furthermore, according to the information received, the system in place for providing 
public housing owned by municipalities would not be transparent, and the criteria would often 
indirectly discriminatory. This situation has reportedly aggravated by the attitude of some 
regional representatives towards issues of social exclusion, which can lead to the perpetuation of 
existing problems of those Roma localities, thus reinforcing their social exclusion and even their 
segregation.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 10 
 
30. As an illustration of this social exclusion, in the eastern town of Vset&#237;n, reportedly in an 
attempt to solve the problem of 42 (mostly Roma) families living in a big house in the centre of 
town which was in critical condition, the local government decided to demolish the house and 
resettle the inhabitants. It is alleged that most of the resettlements were carried out late at night, 
and without the families having prior knowledge of the housing conditions they were moving 
into. Some of the families were resettled in new flats on the outskirts of the town; however, these 
flats are allegedly situated next to the former waste dump in an area which is full of toxic 
substances and they are cut from the centre by an industrial zone. Furthermore, it is reported that 
the flats were built out of metal containers used for shipping, and shortly after the families 
moved in mould appeared inside given that the flats have inadequate air ventilation and are 
overpopulated. According to the information received, the rest of the families were moved some 
hundreds miles away into houses that have been described by experts and local public officials 
as uninhabitable, given that there is no potable water, roofs are full of holes, rafters are rotting, 
and the electricity distribution is unsuitable and even life-threatening. The former mayor of 
Vset&#237;n allegedly stated that: <i>&#8220;We chose this solution in necessity only because we do not want 
hundreds of homeless Roma wandering around the town and being a nuisance to their fellow 
citizens</i>&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>31. Furthermore, it is alleged that Roma children do not receive the same standard of 
education as other pupils. According to the information received, Roma children are segregated 
from regular schools in different ways: firstly, they have separated classes in regular schools; 
secondly, the schools they attend enjoy a bad reputation regarding the quality of education; 
finally, more than half of Roma children attend schools for children with disabilities (zvl&#225;&#353;tn&#237; 
pomocn&#225; &#353;kola), now renamed as ordinary basic schools (z&#225;kladan&#237; &#353;kola). It is alleged that one 
of the reasons why a number of Roma children attend special schools is that teachers and 
psychologists who are in charge of mental tests do not take into account that these children have 
some learning difficulties. In addition, it is reported that schools prefer to label Roma children as 
children with mental disabilities in order to obtain extra resources from the State It is reported 
that, for example, in Ivanovice na Han&#233;, a town with a population of approximately 30.000 
habitants, all Roma children were officially acknowledged as mentally handicapped. This is 
exacerbated by the fact that aliens are obliged to prove the lawfulness of their stay in the Czech 
Republic at the beginning of their school attendance at the latest under the new Education Act N. 
561/2004. This act establishes that the headmasters of elementary and secondary schools cannot 
enroll any foreign children without documentation that proves their legal status in the country. In 
addition, Roma children are allegedly excluded from certain advantages granted only to Czech 
and European Union citizens, for example, free educational services such as counseling and 
accommodation facilities.

proven fact. </p>

<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
 
</b>34. On 20 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with as Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the Independent expert 
on minority issues, sent an allegation letter regarding information received on forced evictions of 
persons belonging to minority Roma communities in various locations around the country, 
including the city of Patras. 
</p>
<p>35. According to reports received, since late July 2006, about 60 families, representing more 
than 400 persons, of the Riganokampos and Makrigianni Roma communities would have been 
evicted in Patras without being given prior notice, offered alternative housing or adequate 
compensation. Reportedly, the Roma in Makrigianni settled there in 1996, while the Roma in 
Riganokampos had living in that area for several decades going back to at least 1977. The order 
for these recent evictions was allegedly given by the deputy mayor of Patras and head of 
municipal social services unit. As a result, several Roma families allegedly have had no other 
option than to sleep and to live precariously in their cars, and in inadequate health and sanitation 
conditions, particularly for women and children. 
</p>
<p>36. It was reported that between 27 July and 25 August 2006, the Municipality of Patras 
demolished the homes of Roma families in the Makrigianni district while they were absent for 
seasonal work, served the remaining families with notices of emergency police measures of 
eviction, and without waiting for their confirmation by a prosecutor proceeded to implement the 
evictions. It was further reported that in June 2006, all Roma families of the Riganokampos 
district were referred to a criminal trial for illegal squatting on state land, and they were told to 
leave in August 2006 by a court order. These Roma families had allegedly never been provided 
with official documents attesting the legitimacy of their residences, and these evictions had 
reportedly been described by the authorities as &#8220;administrative acts of evacuation and expulsion 
in response to the unlawful occupancy of land and to arbitrary and illegal settlement of tracts of 
public land.&#8221; However, according to information received, these actions were taken without 
proper administrative or legal procedure in the first case and despite the fact that in October 
2005 magistrates had reportedly annulled as abusive such administrative protocols of eviction 
which were being requested at the time and the related criminal charges were dropped. 
Furthermore it was indicated that following his visit to the eviction sites in Patras in September 
2006, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights stated that in his view the 
&#8220;procedures&#8221; for eviction were in total contradiction to human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>37. Information received indicated that the Ministry of the Interior had secured a credit line of 
320,000 euros to be used for the purchase of adequate land and settlement of the Roma families 
of these two communities, and that in the context of the Integrated Action Plan for the social 
inclusion of Greek Roma (IAP), 47 housing loans had been allocated until now to Greek Roma 
registered in the municipality of Patras, under favourable terms and under the guarantee of the 
Greek state. Additionally, it was indicated that a Special Committee had been set up within the 
administration of Western Greece with the task of identifying a suitable site to set up a 
permanent settlement for the Roma families. However, this body would reportedly have not 
come up with any concrete solution for the permanent settlement of these families. While it was 
reported that the municipality is renting apartments for 18 to 22 of the evicted families until the 
Government approves loan applications for them to buy their own homes, concerns were 
expressed on the part of these families as to what will happen once the initial, financially 
subsidized period of rent is over, as they have no money to pay for the rent on their own. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 12 
</p><p> 
38. In addition, further reports indicated that most local Roma from these communities had left 
Patras or were looking for a home. Reportedly, these evicted families also face discrimination to 
access adequate housing, as landlords are reluctant to rent them houses, thus forcing them to 
constantly change their place of residence. Allegedly, the relocation plans foreseen for the Patras 
Roma communities has failed because of strong local community reactions against the 
settlement of Roma families in their neighbourhoods. Concerns have been expressed that the 
situation is not being dealt with adequately and in a sustainable manner by the authorities. In this 
context, information received indicated that in an interview in a weekly newspaper published on 
2 February 2007, the then Chief Appeals Prosecutor of Patras and now Deputy Supreme Court 
Prosecutor reportedly made discriminatory statements against Roma in connection with last 
year&#8217;s evictions and recommended similar eviction of immigrants who live in similar informal 
settlements in that city. 
</p>
<p>39. Concern is expressed at the possibility that evictions mentioned above seem to follow a 
pattern of forced evictions of Roma in Greece. In 1997, about 2,000 Roma were allegedly 
expelled from a rundown district of Thessaloniki. Reportedly, they camped on the banks of the 
Gallikos River for three years before being relocated to a former military barracks. Furthermore, 
in 2003, about 200 Roma were removed from the affluent Athens suburb of Maroussi to make 
way for the Olympic complex before the 2004 Games. Currently, about 200 Roma allegedly face 
eviction from a large site in Votanikos, central Athens, which is earmarked for the construction 
of a soccer stadium and the capital&#8217;s first mosque by 2009. While there are no official statistics 
available, it is estimated that there are 200,000 to 300,000 Roma in hundreds of settlements 
across the country, at least half of them living in extreme poverty and inadequate housing 
conditions.

from the Government of Greece at the time this report was finalized. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b> 
42. On 29 August 2007, the Government of Greece replied to the allegation letter sent on 2 
June 2006 by the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, concerning the case of Mr. <b>Theo Alexandridis</b>, legal 
counsel with the <i>Greek Helsinki Monitor (GHM)</i>, and other staff members of the GHM. The 
GHM is an organization that monitors and reports on human rights violations in Greece, 
including violations against the Roma community (see A/HRC/4/19/Add.1, par. 74-77).  
</p>
<p>43. In its reply, the Government indicated his sensitiveness on human rights issues and in 
particular regarding the Roma people. It stressed that Roma living in Greece are an integral part 
of the Greek population, they are Greek citizens and they are protected against all forms of 
discrimination by the Greek laws and the Constitution. It was further noted that they enjoy the 
same civic and political rights, they participate in the Greek society, they organize themselves in 
associations, political parties etc.<b> </b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 13 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>44. The Government noted that, due to their community particular lifestyle and needs, Roma 
are recognized as a socially vulnerable group of the Greek population and special measures and 
policies have been adopted to facilitate their integration in the modem Greek society. 
</p>
<p>45. Regarding the detention of Mr. Alexandridis, the Government indicated that at the 
beginning of the 2005 school year among the 360 Greek children attending the 10`h and 11th 
primary Schools of Aspropyrgos, there were 24 Roma children. A large number of parents had 
objected to the attendance of the Roma Children. 
</p>
<p>46. On October 13 2005 about 60 persons assembled to prevent the entry of 8 Roma pupils in 
the school, who were accompanied by the representative of the Greek Helsinki Monitor Mr. 
Theodoros Alexandridis. Half an hour later, following consultations between those assembled 
and the school Direction and the intervention of Greek police, the Roma pupils entered the 
schools and attended classes. 
</p>
<p>47. Later that day, Mr. Alexandridis went to the Police station of Aspropyrgos and filed 
charges against the President of the Parents and Guardians Association of the aforementioned 
Primary Schools, Mrs. Eleni Panda, who was consequently arrested. Charges were also filed 
against unnamed men, for violation of articles 330, 361 and 33 of the Greek Penal Code. Three 
persons were also arrested for violation of article 330 of the Penal Code (illegal violence), 
because along with others, they tried to prevent the access of pupils in the school. 
</p>
<p>48. At the Police Station of Aspropyrgos, Mrs. Eleni Panda filed charges, as well, against Mr. 
Theodoros Alexandridis, for insult and false complaints and, as a result of that action, Mr. 
Alexandridis was also arrested. Later that day, the Public Prosecutor of Criminal Proceedings 
was informed by phone and ordered the Police not to initiate the &quot;flagrante delicto&quot; procedure. 
Therefore, the arrested persons were released after registering their pleas. The brief was 
submitted to the Public Prosecutor of the Magistrate Court of Athens for follow up action. 
</p>
<p>49. The Government stressed that following that incident, the Officers of Aspropyrgos Police 
Station, whenever so requested by representatives of the Greek Helsinki Monitor, have always 
provided assistance so that registered Roma pupils could enter their schools and attend classes, 
despite reactions of some parents. Moreover, police officers have been at the school on a daily 
basis and took appropriate measures to protect Roma pupils when they enter and leave the 
schools. 
</p>
<p>50. Regarding the statement made by the Public Prosecutor at the Patras Court of Appeals 
(16/09/2004-4/09/2006), the Government&#8217;s reply indicated that Mr. Anastassios Kanellopoulos 
received numerous complaints and communications by inhabitants of the city of Patras and 
particularly those living in the areas of &#171;Makrygianni&#187; and &#171;Rodopoulou&#187; describing in details 
the &quot;deplorable&quot; living conditions they encountered due to the arbitrary settlement of the Roma 
population.  
</p>
<p>51. The Government noted that the Roma settled in those areas had been constructing shanty 
houses on the left bank of Glafkos River near the suburbs of the Municipality of Patras without 
fulfilling the appropriate and necessary sanitary conditions. As a result, the whole area has 
been transformed to a permanent infectious site with an elevated degree of pollution. Moreover, 
it was underlined that the inhabitants of Patras had also denounced the persistent climate of 
fear and insecurity, prevailing in their neighborhood as a result of unlawful acts allegedly 
committed by Roma. Specifically, it was noted that it was impossible for the children to play 
around as well as for the rest of the people to circulate at night. It was also indicated that the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 14 
 
local Authorities of Patras have been blamed of being unacceptably tolerant to the constant 
infringements of law committed by the Roma. Moreover, the Patras Public Prosecutor Office 
had also been receiving numerous complaints on the same matter, both orally and in writing, 
filed by the inhabitants of the abovementioned areas. 
</p>
<p>52. The Government also noted that in April 2006, 637 inhabitants living in the areas of 
Makrygianni and Rodopoulou filed a complaint and consequently the Patras Public 
Prosecutor's Office initiated criminal proceedings for nine misdemeanors, the majority of 
which was related to violation of sanitary provisions. At the same time, the Public Prosecutor 
ordered the initiation of preliminary investigation. According to the complaints, members of 
the Greek Helsinki Monitor had been inducing the Roma to commit punishable acts. Mr. 
Kanellopoulos as the Head of Patras Public Prosecutor's Office ought to examine those 
allegations, by ordering preliminary investigation. 
</p>
<p>53. Furthermore, the Government underlined that Mr. Anastassios Kanellopoulos denied that 
he ever stated that &#171;all Roma are criminals&#187; and considers those allegations groundless and 
unsubstantiated. Regarding the alleged involvement of the Greek Helsinki Monitor to the 
commitment of punishable acts, it was indicated that Mr. Kanellopoulos stated that nobody is 
above the law and since there was a complaint by 637 Greek citizens it was absolutely 
reasonable to initiate an investigation which should also include alleged activities of members 
of the Greek Helsinki Monitor. 
</p>
<p>54. The Government finally noted that it believed that the above mentioned facts clearly 
show that in the first case the Greek authorities did their utmost to facilitate the inclusion of 
Roma children in the Greek society and to protect them from any discrimination, whereas in 
the second case the Public Prosecutor's Office acted according to the Greek laws in order to 
investigate allegations made by other Greek citizens. A 2007 updated report on the Integrated 
Action Plan for the social inclusion of Greek Roma was attached to the reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Greece for its response. However, he 
wishes to express great concern at several reports alleging manifestations of discrimination not 
only against the Roma population in Greece but also against non European migrants. The Special 
Rapporteur intends to closely monitor the situation. <b>

</b>56. On 23 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal with the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding attacks on the <b>Dalit 
communities, particularly women</b>, in Somebhadra District, Uttar Pradesh, India. 
</p>
<p>57. It is reported that in Sonebhadra District, the poorest District in Uttar Pradesh with a large 
Dalit population, Dalit families have been cultivating and living in a Government&#8217;s waste lands, 
the Gram Sabha&#8217;s, for years. Reportedly, the land ownership has always been a conflicting issue 
between the Upper Caste controlling land resources and Dalits and tribes.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 15 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>58. Reports indicate that Dalits&#8217; reclaim of land has led to conflicts with forest officials and 
the Police, especially after the adoption of the &quot;Schedule Tribe and other Forest Dwelling 
Communities (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act of 2006&quot;. It is further alleged that since the Act 
is not yet operational, the forest department officials have been harassing the activists working 
for the rights of the forest dwellers and the tribes, with the aim to ensure that evictions take place 
before the clauses of the Act are enforced. Reportedly similar actions are taking place in other 
parts of the country including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.  
</p>
<p>59. In this context, on 3 August 2007, <b>Ms. Roma</b> and Ms. <b>Shanta Bhattacharya,</b> two 
members of the National Forum of Forest People and Forest Workers (NFFPFW) who had been 
working in the Sonebhadra District for the past seven to eight years, were allegedly arrested in 
Robertsganj under charges of provoking Dalits and Tibals to encroach forest lands. According to 
information received, they were arrested under section 120 (B) and 447 of Penal Code; they 
were in Mirzapur jail and their bail applications had been rejected at the Circle Judicial 
Magistrate. In addition, it was reported that on 5 August 2007, <b>Lalita Devi</b> and <b>Shyamlal 
Paswan </b>were arrested from a local market in Rangarh and were also held in Mirzapur jail. As a 
consequence of these imprisonments, people would have been staging a protest since 4 August in 
front of the District Magistrate (DM) office in Sonebhadra demanding immediate release of the 
activists. New charges would have been brought against Ms. Roma under article 4 of the 
National Security Act on 10 August.  
</p>
<p>60. Reports also indicate that on 10 August 2007, at around 9 p.m., the police attacked Dalit 
women in Chanduli Village, in Sonebhadra District, leaving fifteen women seriously injured. 
Two trucks loads of Police along with upper caste representatives of the locality descended on 
Chanduli village in Sonebhadra district. They were allegedly heavily armed, and demanded to 
see<b> Bachchalal</b>, an active member of the local organisation Kaimoor Kshetra Mahila Mazdoor 
Kisan Sangharsh Samiti (KKMMKSS). According to information received, when they did not 
find Bachchalal in the village, they started attacking women present in the village. Police and 
upper caste representatives barged into the house of Bachchalal and attacked his pregnant sister 
and sister-in-law; pulling them out and attacking them. In three hours, the police and upper caste 
representatives beat up around 15 women and destroyed their houses.  
</p>
<p>61. At the time of the incident, there were very few male members in the village as most of 
them were staging a protest in front of the DM's office in Sonebhadra against the arrest of Ms. 
Roma, Ms. Shanta Bhattacharya, Lalita Devi and Shyamlal Paswan.  
</p>
<p>62. This was allegedly the third attack of this kind against Dalits in less than two weeks and 
reportedly a consequence of the Dalits families&#8217; requests for land that started in the last two 
years, as a response to the forest department&#8217;s Government Resolution of 2002-3 to clear forest 
lands from any encroachments.  
</p>
<p>63. During the events, the police reportedly left the village giving an ultimatum to remove the 
bricks of the houses by 11 August 2007 and threatening them to come back with an 
administrative order to destroy the houses. 
</p>
<p>64. On 19 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Independent expert on 
minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences sent an allegation 
letter to the Government concerning allegations of <b>violence against Dalit women</b> in India. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 16 
</p><p> 
65. According to information received, Dalit women and men suffer descent based 
discrimination in various aspects of their lives; they are also victims of violence and 
untouchability practices (based on notions of Dalits&#8217; supposed impurity) arising out of the caste 
system. While both men and women are discriminated and suffer from social exclusion, Dalit 
women are confronted with discrimination, exclusion and violence to a larger extent than men. 
They are not only discriminated by people of higher castes but also by men of their own 
communities. Violence against women in India is generally structured by relationships of power 
set in systematic caste, class and gender discrimination.  
</p>
<p>66. The case of Dalit women is specific because of their socio-economic positioning at the 
bottom of the caste, class and gender hierarchies. Dalit women face violence in the community 
and in their family, from State and private actors alike, belonging to various castes and socio-
economic groupings, and of both sexes. The major forms of violence that Dalit women are 
subjected to are physical and verbal abuse, sexual harassment, abduction, and sexual violence, 
including rape.  
</p>
<p>67. It is alleged that on many occasions, cases of violence against Dalit women are not 
registered by the police, and opportunities for intervention in the legal system are inexistent due 
to a general lack of law enforcement. Women are unaware of the laws protecting their rights and 
their ignorance is easily exploited by perpetrators, and some members of the police and the 
judiciary. Allegedly, even when the cases are reported to the police and the perpetrators arrested, 
they are usually released on bail and women do not receive justice as a result.  
</p>
<p>68. The Indian government adopted the &#8220;Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes 
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act&#8221; in 1989, to prevent atrocities against Scheduled Castes and 
Tribes. According to this act, in cases of violence against Dalits, including physical or sexual 
violence against Dalit women, the police are obliged to register the complaints. However, 
according to information received, the police often refuse to register complaints under this act or 
register them under a different act, because the act imposes high prison sentences and fines and 
the police may not agree with the purpose of the act and may try to protect the perpetrators (who 
may be their fellow caste members).  
</p>
<p>69. If a case is not registered under the Prevention of Atrocities Act, it is possible for the 
perpetrator to receive anticipatory bail which, especially in rape cases, in practice means that the 
case is generally not examined and prosecuted further. This goes against a Supreme Court 
judgment that ruled that anticipatory bail should not be available in cases within the Prevention 
of Atrocities Act (Case 1995-1198, State of M.P. &amp; anr. vs. Respondent, Ram Krishna Balothia 
&amp; anr, judgment of 6 February 1995). The Supreme Court also ruled that anticipatory bail can be 
denied for the purpose of investigation (Case 2005-326), which would apply to most rape cases, 
but this is allegedly not implemented in practice (Appeal (crl.)  326 of 2005, Adri Dharan Das v. 
State of West Bengal, judgment of 21 February 2005). 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur presented to the Government allegations on specific cases of 
physical and sexual violence affecting 21 Dalit women or girls that occurred between August 
2004 and April 2007, and which outlined the impunity that allegedly prevails with respect to 
ensuring protection and redress.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
 
</b>71. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply to his communications had been received 
from the Government of India at the time this report was finalized. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p><p>72. The Special Rapporteur expresses his utmost interest in receiving responses in regard to 
the allegations submitted and would be particularly interested to know whether these cases have 
resulted in any prosecutions of alleged perpetrators. In the event that no response is received 
from the Government, he will no longer treat the cases as mere allegations but as proven facts. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur wishes to refer to the invitation he requested to the Government of 
India in 2004 and 2006, which has remained unanswered, and reiterates his interest in visiting 
the country. The Special Rapporteur considers the issue of caste-based discrimination to be an 
integral part of his mandate, in line with the CERD&#8217;s general recommendation XXIX which 
strongly reaffirms that &#8220;discrimination based on &quot;descent&quot; includes discrimination against 
members of communities based on forms of social stratification such as caste and analogous 
systems of inherited status which nullify or impair their equal enjoyment of human rights&#8221;. In 
this regard, he wishes to refer to the chapter on caste-based discrimination in his 2008 general 
report to the 7th session to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/7/19). 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
 
</b>74. In the absence of an answer from the Government concerning his allegation letters of 6 
March 2006,  8 March 2006, 8 December 2006 and 26 January 2007 (see A/HRC/4/19/Add.1, 
par. 80-84, 88-95),  the Special Rapporteur is forced to consider the following cases no longer as 
allegations but as proven facts. 
</p>
<p>75.  According to the information received, on 22 July 2005, eight police officers, all of them 
dressed in civilian clothing, approached <b>Sekar Arjunan (Rajasekar)</b>, aged 32 years, a 
shopkeeper from Raja Thottam, Peravallur, Chennai as he was standing near a fruit shop close to 
the Central Prison in Chennai. The officers beat him and kicked him with their boots in his 
abdominal region. They then took him by car to Sangeetha lodge near Permbur Railway Station, 
where they locked him in a room on the second floor. Later that day, they took him to Sembiam 
Police Station and locked him in a dark room until 26 July 2005. While he was there, he was 
beaten and deprived of food. On 26 July 2005, he was taken to K-5 Peravallur Police Station, 
where he was put in a room on the third floor. He was stripped naked and beaten with an iron 
pipe, which resulted in a fracture to his right knee. The officers also subjected him to oral caste-
related abuse and threatened to kill him by placing a pistol on his forehead.  
</p>
<p>76. Moreover, it was alleged that the police officers brought false criminal charges against him 
and he was remanded in custody by Judicial Magistrate&#8217;s Court No. Five, Egmore. He was sent 
to the central prison in Chennai. Sekar Arjunan&#8217;s mother had previously submitted a complaint to 
the State Human Rights Commission in Chennai requesting them to take action against the same 
police officials for killing her younger son, Ramesh. She had refused to withdraw the complaint, 
despite being pressured to do so by the alleged perpetrators. The names of the police officers are 
Sub-Inspector John Miller, Inspector Anbuselvam, Sub-Inspector Boopalan, Constable Koyilraj, 
Constable Vinod, Constable Paramasivam, Constable Vijayan and Constable Gunasekaran of K1 
Sembiam Police Station and K-5 Peravallur police station in Chennai. 
</p>
<p>77. According to information received, on 14 January 2006 at 1:00 a.m., four men from nearby 
Hinauti village allegedly came to the house of a <b>22 year-old woman</b> belonging to the indigenous 
Nut Community (a scheduled tribe) in Sirsi village, Chandauli District, Uttar Pradesh. All four 
men belong to the upper caste Singh community. Allegedly, the four men then forcibly took the 
victim to the pulse plants field, where they gang raped her for three hours. When she fell 
unconscious, they threw her onto a nearby railway line, where she was found hours later by 
another villager.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 18 
</p><p> 
78. The victim's family reported the incident to the Chandauli Police Station and lodged a First 
Information Report (FIR) against the four men under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and 
under Section 3(2) and Section 5 of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of 
Atrocities) Act 1989. Reportedly, however, the police tried to delay action against the alleged 
perpetrators. Under intense pressure from the Nut community, the police finally arrested the 
alleged perpetrators more than 40 hours after the rape allegedly took place.  
</p>
<p>79. According to information received, <b>Ms. S.B., wife of Mr. B.B., their daughter Ms. P. and 
their two sons, Mr. S. and Mr. R</b>., all belonging to the Dalit Community in the village of 
Khairlanji, Bhandara District, in Maharashtra, were reportedly murdered by upper caste men. 
</p>
<p>80. On 3 September 2006, a local Dalit policeman was allegedly beaten up by upper caste 
community members. Mr. B.B., S., P. and R. reportedly testified against alleged perpetrators 
leading to their arrest. It was reported that on the same day, a mob of two to three hundred upper 
caste villagers, many equipped with axes and ubhari (a stick with a metal spike), stormed their 
home, and dragged Ms. S. B. and her three children out of their house where they were stripped 
naked, beaten and driven to the main village square. Mr. B. B. was not at home at the time of the 
incident. Upper caste men then gang raped Ms. S.B. and her daughter Ms. P. for over an hour, 
while bystanders, including upper caste women, verbally incited the rapists and spurred them on. 
One of Ms. P.`s brothers was asked to have sex with Ms. P. and after he refused, his genitals 
were thrashed.  Ms. P. was hit on her breasts with an axe and thrashed and stabbed with ubhari in 
her genitals. All four persons were hacked to death and the bodies were thrown in a canal. As of 
30 November, although a First Information Report (FIR) had been filed, the vast majority of the 
perpetrators, including those who were allegedly complicit in the gang rape and murder, have not 
been arrested or charged. Many Dalit families in the village are afraid to testify and, reportedly, 
only one eyewitness has come forward to testify. 
</p>
<p>81. According to information received, on 2 January 2007, Mr. <b>Ravikumar</b>, member of the 
Legislative Assembly of the Kaaumannarkoil constituency, owing allegiance to the Vidudalai 
Chruthaiga, Dalit Panthers of India (DPI), in Sedapalayam village of Cuddalore District, in the 
State of Tamil Nadu, sustained injuries to his hands and legs during an alleged attack by a 
contingent of approximately 100 police officers, including Delta police personnel, in 
Sedapalayam village during a funeral procession for Mr. Siva, a Dalit youth murdered on 1 
January 2007. Twenty-eight other Dalit Panthers of India (DPI) members were also injured in 
the attack. Mr. Ravikumar was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College in Chennai on 
3 January 2007 and discharged three days later. 
 
82. According to reports, the funeral procession was attacked by police officers in response to 
an attempt by some individuals attending the funeral to set fire to houses belonging to the 
alleged perpetrators of Mr. Silva&#8217;s murder. Dalit youths who later attended the hospital for 
medical treatment were reportedly arrested by police on charges of attempted murder.  
 
83. Prior to the events of 2 January 2007, Mr. Ravikumar had reportedly been in contact with 
Mr. Gagandeep Singh Bedi, District Collector, Cuddalore, and Mr. M Karunanidhi, Chief 
Minister of Tamil Nadu urging them to ensure that an immediate investigation be carried out in 
relation to Mr. Silva&#8217;s murder on 1 January 2007, and that the perpetrators be brought to justice. 
He also made an appeal to the police and district administration to ensure that law and order be 
maintained during the funeral.  
 
84. Concern is expressed that the funeral procession of Mr. Silva was violently suppressed by 
authorities and that excessive police force may have been used against peaceful attendees of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 19 
</p>
<p> 
funeral. Concern is also raised that Mr. Ravikumar may have been targeted due to his high 
profile work in defece of the human rights of Dalits. The Special Rapporteurs do not condone the 
violence allegedly committed by members of the public, namely the attempt to burn the houses 
of those perceived to have been responsible for Mr. Silva&#8217;s death, and hope that impartial and 
thorough police investigations are carried out in relation to both alleged incidents.

Follow-up to previously transmitted communications  
</b></p>
<p>85. In the absence of an answer from the Government concerning his urgent appeal of 1 March 
2006, and his allegation letters of 22 May 2006 and 24 May 2006 (see A/HRC/4/19/Add.1, par. 
103-110),  the Special Rapporteur is forced to consider the following cases no longer as 
allegations but as proven facts. 
</p>
<p>86. According to the information received, on 13 February 2006, <b>173 members of the 
Nematollah Sufi Muslim community</b> were arrested due to their participation in a peaceful 
protest, which was reportedly violently suppressed by the security forces and members of the 
Hojatieh and Fatemiyon pro-government groups.  The protest was being held against an order by 
the security forces to evacuate the community's place of worship, known as Hosseiniye. At the 
time the urgent appeal was sent  was sent, the 173 individuals were reportedly being interrogated 
at Fajr prison in Qom and there were concerns that they were being tortured in order to force 
them to sign pre-prepared false confessions, stating that the protest had political motivations and 
was linked to anti-government groups. The relatives of the detainees had been unable to obtain 
official information about their whereabouts and the detainees had not had access to lawyers. 
Lawyer Bahman Nazari was arrested when he approached officials in an attempt to represent the 
detainees.  
 
87. Reports indicated that, on 13 February 2006, members of the Fatemiyon and Hojatieh 
groups also reportedly surrounded the place of worship, shouting slogans such as &#8220;Death to 
Sufis&#8221; and &#8220;Sufi-ism is a British plot&#8221;, and distributed leaflets alleging that Sufis are enemies of 
Islam. The next day, the Hosseiniye was demolished using bulldozers. Approximately 1,200 
protesters were arrested and taken away on buses to unknown locations. The detainees were 
interrogated and many were allegedly subjected to torture or ill-treatment. Most of them were 
subsequently released. According to the information received, those who were released were 
required to sign papers as a condition of their release agreeing not to attend any Sufi gatherings 
in Qom. Some were required to sign documents renouncing Sufism.  
 
88. It was also reported that arrest warrants had been issued for the main Sufi preacher in Qom, 
Seyed Ahmadi Shariati and the four lawyers who had previously been acting on behalf of the 
group. Their names are: Amir Eslami, Omid Behrouzi, Gholamreza Harsimi and Farshid 
Yadollahi. This incident occurred amid concerns about an increasing demonization of the Sufi 
Muslim group. In September 2005, a religious jurist in Qom, Ayatollah Hossein Nouri-
Hamedani, called for a crackdown on Sufi groups in Qom.  
 
89. According to information received, on 3 May 2006, <b>52 members of the Nematollahi Sufi 
Muslim community</b> and their two lawyers <b>Farshad Yadollahi</b> and <b>Omid Behroozi</b> were 
convicted on charges of &quot;disobeying the orders of government officials&quot; and &quot;disturbing public 
order&quot;. They are amongst 173 members of the Nematollah Sufi Muslim community, who were 
arrested on 13 February 2006, due to their participation in a peaceful protest against an order by </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 20 
 
the security forces to evacuate the community's place of worship, known as Hosseiniye. They 
were the subject of the communication sent on 1 March 2006. For the former charge, 25 
individuals were fined 10 million Iranian Rials (equivalent to more than US$1,000) and the rest 
were fined 5 million Iranian Rials (equivalent to more than US$500). For the latter charge, they 
were sentenced to one-year imprisonment and 74 lashes. After their release, they were obliged to 
report to the security officials every month for the period of 2 years. It was further reported that 
Farshad Yadollahi and Omid Behroozi were disqualified from their profession for five years. All 
of them were released on bail, and were given 20 days to appeal the judgment.  
 
90.  According to the information, <b>Azeri Turks</b> are mainly Shi'a Muslims, and are the largest 
minority in Iran, consisting around 25 to 30 percent of the population. They are mainly located 
in the north and north-west of Iran. Reports indicate that, as Shi'a muslims, they are generally 
not the main target of discrimination in Iran. However, there exists a growing demand for better 
recognition of their cultural and linguistic rights, including implementation of their right to 
education through the Turkish language. Those who actively seek Azeri Turkish cultural and 
linguistic identity can reportedly be viewed with suspicion by the authorities, and be accused of 
charges such as &quot;promoting pan-Turkism&quot;.  
 
91. Examples include the case of Mohammad Reza, Mostafa Evezpoor and Morteza, who were 
the subject of the joint communication sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
on 10 May 2006 and the case of Saleh Malla Abbasi, who was the subject of a communication 
sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders on 18 May 2006. According to the information, the &#8220;Iran 
Newspaper&#8221; published an article with a cartoon of cockroaches, describing Azeri Turks as 
&#8220;roaches&#8221;, speaking their own language, usually living in toilet holes, and whose food sources 
should be cut. This has reportedly triggered protests and hunger strikes in universities in Iran. 
 
</p>
<p><b> 
Italy 
</b></p>
<p> 
92. On 18 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and the Independent expert on 
minority issues <b>concerning incidents of evictions of Roma communities in Rome and Pisa</b> 
which allegedly would form part of a pattern of discrimination against Roma communities. 
 
93. According to the information received, on 19 July 2007, the Italian police in cooperation 
with the Romanian police forcibly evicted approximately 1,000 Roma from a settlement in Via 
dell&#8217;Imbarco, Magliana suburb, Rome. Earlier in July 2007, the police and the municipal 
wardens forcibly evicted approximately 100 Romanian Roma from a settlement in Bagno di 
Tivoli, near Rome. During both operations personal belongings and dwellings were allegedly 
destroyed.  
 
94. Following an official visit to Romania of the Rome&#8217;s mayor, Mr. Walter Veltroni, an 
agreement was signed between the Italian and Romanian governments whereby the police of 
these countries would collaborate concerning the eviction, identification and repatriation of 
Roma of Romanian origin living in settlements in the city of Rome. Despite the declaration that </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 21 
</p>
<p> 
this would be a plan for &#8220;voluntary return&#8221;, there are allegations that the intention is to repatriate 
Roma settlers forcibly.  
 
95. It was also reported that the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr. Franco 
Frattini, stated that &#8220;it is not true that European citizens cannot be repatriated&#8230; There is a very 
clear directive, valid for all citizens of the European Union that provides for the expulsion for all 
those who cannot prove to have adequate means of subsistence to live in a dignified way&#8221;. This 
statement has been allegedly used by politicians in anti-Roma speeches. For instance, the mayor 
of Verona, Mr. Flavio Tosi, who had previously been sentenced to two months imprisonment for 
racist propaganda against Roma, used the above statement to affirm that many of the Romanian 
Roma living in a &#8220;nomad camps&#8221; could be repatriated.  
 
96. The Special Rapporteur also received information concerning the case of four Romanian 
Roma children, Lenuca, Danchiu, Dengi and Eva, who, on 11 August 2007, died in a fire that 
burned down, for reasons yet unknown, in the hut where they were temporarily living with their 
parents in Livorno, following their forced eviction from Pisa in May 2007. According to 
information received, their parents would be currently in detention, charged with abandonment 
of minors and parental negligence. 
 
<b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>97. By letter dated 21 December 2007, the Government of Italy replied to the joint allegation 
letter sent on 18 October 2007 noting, in the first place, that the question of the living conditions 
of the Roma populations, as laid down in the Consolidated Text 286/1998 as amended and 
integrated by Act 189/2002, was a competence of Local Bodies and that local institutions were 
still proceeding with the adoption of all pertinent interventions. Within this framework, the 
Government indicated that several initiatives aiming at setting up small camps are in the process 
of being implemented in different part of the country as in Naples, Milan and Rovereto.  
 
98. More specifically, in the case of the Municipality of Rome, it was noted that actions aimed 
at the reception and integration of Roma communities have been increased and strengthened. 
The Government informed that thousands of Roma people were received in the &#8220;Pronta 
Accoglienza&#8221; (Welcome reception centers) while <i>ad hoc</i> structures had been realized specifically 
for mother and child groups.  
 
99. Concerning the removal of a Roma settlement located in &#8220;Magliana&#8221; &#8211; Via dell&#8217;Imbarco &#8211; 
Rome (July 19, 2007), the Government informed that the Rome police headquarters, in 
agreement with the Municipality of Rome, the &#8220;Nucleo Assistenza Emarginati&#8221; (Outcasts 
Assistance Nucleus) and the Municipal Police carried out the removal of a Roma illegal 
settlement located under an overpass of the Tiber river, in an area subjected to overflow and that 
was found in appalling hygienic and sanitary conditions. A decision to intervene had been 
previously agreed within the Provincial Committee for Public Order and Security and had been 
repeatedly requested by the Municipal Agency for Electricity and Water in order to allow urgent 
maintenance works close to the settlement. Evacuation of the area was carried out with medical 
units, charity institutions and sanitation experts. The Government informed that the removal 
affected about 500 (not 1,300) people belonging to a Romanian ethnic group 8many of whom 
were children) who, being informed about the impossibility to remain in an unsafe area, 
voluntarily moved away. Just a few of them, who did not intend to leave the premises, 
immediately received assistance from the Roman Social Service. Following the event, the police 
and social workers intervened in order to assist the more disadvantaged categories, like mothers 
and children.  </p>

</p><p> 
 
100. Concerning the removal of a Roma settlement in &#8220;Bagni di Tivoli&#8221;, former &#8220;Stacchini&#8221; 
powder warehouse (July 26, 2007), the Government reported that, according to a decision taken 
by the &#8220;Illegal Roma Settlement Issues Working Group&#8221; of the local &#8220;Prefettura&#8221;, police officers, 
the Carabinieri, the Civil Protection and other competent offices of the Tivoli Municipality 
carried out the removal of an illegal settlement within the private area of the former powder 
warehouse. This action had been made necessary as a consequence of requests by the owner of 
the site and other private citizens. During the intervention, 80 Romanian citizens had been 
requested to pick up their belongings and leave the place. At the end of the eviction procedure, 
the entire area was returned to the owners with the order of clearing it up by destroying the 
remaining buildings and fencing it off, in order to keep out future illegal settlements. 
 
101. Concerning the removal of a Roma settlement in Pisa (May 2007), the Government 
reported that the removal of a small community from the so-called &#8220;CEP&#8221; area had been planned 
and carried out by the Municipal Police of Pisa. Goods of subsistence and meal tickets were 
supplied and the only family with minors was offered an alternative accommodation at a nearby 
landlord in the area. The Government underlined that this family was not one of the families 
involved in the terrible episode occurred in Livorno.  
 
102. The Government indicated that in 2002 the city of Pisa started a specific programme called 
&#8220;Le Citt&#224; Sottili&#8221;, mainly aimed at the final closure of the Roma settlement. Four out of five 
Roma camps have been definitely closed. At the time the Government sent this communication, 
there were still two areas where some family groups had been temporarily accommodated and 
various housing possibilities had been already foreseen for them. In the area of Coltano, where 
the only authorized settlement was set up, the Government indicted that a building of a village 
has started in order to accommodate by the spring of 2008 about 15 family groups. The 
Government specified that out of 572 Roma citizens coming from various regions of the Balkans 
half benefited from the programme &#8220;Le Citt&#224; Sottili&#8221; and were offered an adequate housing, 
while another relevant number of Roma citizens were well-placed in temporary solutions. The 
Government also reported that each single family group was backed by a specific project in 
order to cope with the integration process autonomously and that all persons still staying within 
the settlement and in the transition areas were supported with targeted interventions. The 
Government also indicated that all the children in the age of compulsory education had entered a 
school and had a sufficient level of attendance. It was also noted that all of these projects have 
been approved by the social cooperative societies and local associations.  
 
103. As to the Roma from Rumania, during the summer 2004, after the removal of illegal 
settlement in Pisa, the authorities detected hazardous situations for the health of some minors 
and consequently five Romanian Roma family groups were resettled along the line drawn with 
&#8220;La Citt&#224; Sottile&#8221;. Two of these family groups then decided to move autonomously. In April 
2005, after the fire of a warehouse hosting several family groups, 11 families were 
accommodated in temporary facilities within the Municipality of San Giuliano Tm. In 
spring/summer 2006, the Municipality joined the programme and paid for those families who 
benefited from the above mentioned projects.  
 
104. In its reply the Government noted that after the arrivals of a number of Roma from 
Rumania, especially at the beginning of 2007, several situations of marginalization and poverty 
arose in the territory of Pisa. By the end of 2006, the &#8220;IRRMA&#8221; (&#8220;Regional Intervention against 
Marginality&#8221;) project started. This project was developed by the Tuscany Regional 
Administration in cooperation with the &#8220;CNCA&#8221; (Reception Communities National 
Coordination Board), managed within the Pisa territory by the social cooperative &#8220;Il Cerchio&#8221; </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 23 
</p>
<p> 
and aiming to taking care of the Romanian Roma. It was added that two family groups had been 
supported for housing projects along with a number of people looking for employment, and this 
with good results.  
 
105. Furthermore, the Government indicated that the Municipality of Pisa was committed to 
activating further interventions addressed to family groups with a sufficient income to guarantee 
an integration path, and/or family groups with a particular health situation. It was also reported 
that actions would be developed with the commitment to closing the illegal settlement and 
preventing the creation of new ones.  
 
106. Concerning the events of Livorno (August 11, 2007), the Government reported that around 
midnight, the Fire Brigade was requested to extinguish a fire in the outskirts of the town, where 
three huts made of wood and plastic were on fire. The charred corpses of four children were 
found and identified, according to their parents&#8217; statements, as Romanians of 4, 7, 8 and 11 years 
of age. Late in the night, the police arrested the parents of the victims who were questioned by 
the judge and finally they were considered guilty of child abandonment and consequently of 
their death. Following investigation, and despite the parents&#8217; allegations, any responsibility of a 
third person and the possibility of a racist or a xenophobic attack was been excluded. The 
authorities also specified that the victims were not living temporarily in Livorno because of their 
forced eviction from Pisa and that just the householder of one of the family groups could have 
been present in Pisa and been removed.  
 
107. Concerning non-discrimination, the Government recalls that besides article 3, c.2 of the 
Italian Constitution, Law decree No. 286/98 and subsequent modifications settle the procedures 
for civil action against discriminatory acts due to racial, ethnic, national or religious reasons 
committed by a private individual or by the public administration. It was noted that this decree 
establishes measures of social integration as the organization of training courses tailored for 
public officers and private corporations in charge of foreign citizens or working in the 
immigration field.  
 
108. The government also explained that the National Office against Racial Discrimination 
(UNAR) was offering free legal counsel to victims of discrimination who reported to competent 
jurisdictional authorities. In addition, periodical meetings with the Rom associations have 
permitted UNAR to have an exhaustive picture of the main critical profiles that characterize 
these people and play an intermediation role and to determine the main sectors of potential 
intervention by the State or by the local authorities, including housing, health and legal status. 
 
109.  Finally, the Government mentioned the very recent agreement signed in Bucharest, on 20 
December 2007, by the Italian Minister for Social Solidarity and the Romanian Minister of 
Labour. It was explained that this agreement aimed at establishing a partnership in order to 
reduce, in both countries, the level of poverty of Romanian citizens, in particular Roma people. 
It was noted that this agreement provides for the use of national and European funds for the 
implementation of joint projects in the fields of labour, education and housing. 
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>110. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Italy for its detailed reply to his 
communication of 18 October 2007. The Special Rapporteur continues to follow the situation 
closely, in particular the implementation of the agreements that have been signed.

111. The Special Rapporteur wishes to refer to the mission report on his visit to Italy in October 
2006, which was presented to the 4th session of the Human Rights Council 
((A/HRC/4/19/Add.4). He wishes to recall in particular the following recommendations: the 
recognition of the Roma and Sinti as national minorities, the adoption of a comprehensive 
national policy towards these communities, in particular to address their poor housing conditions, 
lack of documents, high dropouts of their children and their difficulties in accessing employment. 
The Special Rapporteur also refers to his recommendation that Roma and Sinti should be among 
the priority beneficiary groups of social inclusion policies. 
 
112. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to refer to his general report to the 7th session of the 
Human Rights Council (A/HRC/7/19), in particular the information concerning the follow-up of 
his to Italy. He notes with particular concern the adoption on 28 December 2007 of a decree 
allowing for the expulsion of European Union nationals accused of posing a threat to &#8220;public 
order&#8221; and &#8220;public security&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern that the decree, adopted 
in the wake of the murder of an Italian woman allegedly by a Romanian Roma man, may 
particularly target the Romanian citizens in the country.

</b>113. On 11 October 2007, the Government replied to an allegation letter sent on 3 February 
2006 by the Rapporteur concerning alleged <b>discriminatory legislations toward the Berber 
culture and identity</b>, such as the law number 24 of the year 1369 w.r. (1991), which would 
prevents people from using any other language than Arabic in the country (see 
A/HRC/4/19/Add.1, par. 120-122) Allegedly, these laws forbid all literature and writings which 
is not in Arabic, and therefore, the use of the Berber language. It was also alleged that it is 
forbidden to use names of Berber origin to name children and that the Libyan government 
deliberately withholds the development of regions with Berber communities. The information 
received also indicated that the Libyan education system and school books do not take into 
account the Berber component in Libya&#8217;s geography, history and culture. Allegations also 
reported the harassment and ill-treatment of persons working for the defense of the Berber 
community, culture and identity. 
 
114. In his reply, the Government notes that the information provided is an unreliable account 
devoid of objectivity and impartiality provided by some individuals. The Government further 
states that it is not true to claim that there is discrimination based on tribal, ethnic or religious 
status. It further stresses that Libyan society has a cohesive structure and all citizens enjoy their 
rights on the basis of equality, as provided in the Great Green Document on Human Rights in the 
Age of the Masses and the Promotion of Freedom Act. All citizens are equal before the law in 
respect of their rights and obligations. 
 
115. The Government further notes that it is untrue that people are prevented from using their 
tribal names. According to Decision No. 3 of 2007 issued by the Secretariat of the General 
People&#8217;s Committee and judgments handed down in implementation of Act No. (24) 1369 MWR 
[from the death of the Prophet], it is permitted to register the names of ascendants, names 
conveying meanings that are authentically Libyan or names that are passed down from 
ascendants to descendants in keeping with recognized Libyan traditions and customs.

</p>
<p> 
116. Finally, the Government underlines that the allegation that persons who work for the 
defense of the Berber community, culture and identity are harassed and ill-treated is groundless. 
If it were true, the names of those subjected to such treatment would have been provided and 
Libyan legislation would punish them.

<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>117. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response to his communication. 
However, with regard to the use of langue, he wishes to recall in particular article 2.1 of the UN 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic 
Minorities, which refer to the right by persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities to use their own language, in private and in public, freely and without 
interference or any form of discrimination.

<p><b>Communication sent to the Government 
 
</b>118. On 25 September 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, as Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression sent an allegation 
letter to the Government concerning <b>Ms. Uma Devi Badi</b>, the coordinator of the &#8220;Badi Adhikari 
Sangharsa Samiti&#8221; (Badi community Struggle Committee), <b>and women and male human 
rights defenders of the Badi community in Nepal</b>. 
</p>
<p>119. According to information received, on 22 August 2007, <b>three dozen women human 
rights defenders from the Badi community </b>were reportedly beaten and detained in custody. 
They were protesting in Singha Durbar, in Kathmandu. Allegedly, the aim of their protestation 
was the rehabilitation of women who have been forced to work as commercial sex workers, the 
right to own land, the equal representation of male and female candidates in the constituent 
assembly, and the establishment of legal bodies at all levels of the government addressing issues 
as racial discrimination, untouchability and legal identity for their children who are deprived of 
citizenship certificates.  All the protestors were released later on that day without being charged. 
</p>
<p>120. On 27 August 2007, <b>450 Badi women and men (225 of them were women from the 
Badi Community Struggle Committee and members of the Dalit Civil Society Movement</b>) 
protested to enter in Singha Durbar. They were beaten with truncheons by the police. Reportedly, 
the police tried to take off the clothes of Ms. Uma Devi Badi, the coordinator of the Badi 
community Struggle Committee. <b>120 protestors</b> were arrested by the police. Ms Uma Devi Badi 
and other women human rights defenders of the Women&#8217;s rehabilitation centre (WOREC) were 
taken to the Armed Police Battalion number-2 in Maharajgunj. They were released in the 
evening without charge against them. 
</p>
<p>121. On 7 September, members of the Badi Community protested again in front of Singha 
Durbar. They were severely beaten by the police. On 9 September, during another protest in 
Harihar Bhawan, members of the Badi community were beaten by the police with sticks and 
boots. The police also poked sticks into people&#8217;s organs. One of the victims is <b>Padma Badi,</b> 18 
years old, whose intestine was badly damaged. Altogether <b>140 persons</b> were arrested and taken </p>

without being provided any food or water. <b>

<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>122. The Special Rapporteur thanks the the Permanent Mission of Nepal to the United Nations 
and other International Organizations in Geneva for the letter sent on 31 October 2007 
acknowledging receipt of the communication and noting that the letter had been forwarded to 
Kathmandu with the request for information on this case. However, he regrets that, at the time 
this report was finalized, no reply to the communication had been received from the Government. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>123. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow up on this case.<b> </b>In the event that no response is 
received from the Government, he will no longer treat this case as a mere allegation but as a 
proven fact. 
</p>
<p>124. The Special Rapporteur wishes to refer to the invitation he requested to the Government of 
Nepal in 2004 and 2006, which has remained unanswered. The Special Rapporteur wishes to 
reiterate his interest in visiting the country, in particular to study the issue of caste-based 
discrimination, which he considers to be an integral part of his mandate, in line with CERD&#8217;s 
general recommendation XXIX. In this regard, he wishes to refer to the chapter on caste-based 
discrimination in his 2008 general report to the 7th session to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/7/19). 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to previously transmitted communications 
</b></p>
<p>125. In the absence of an answer from the Government concerning his allegation letter of 10 
October 2006 (see A/HRC/4/19/Add.1, par. 128),  the Special Rapporteur is forced to consider 
the following case no longer as an allegation but as a proven fact. 
</p>
<p>126. According to information received, on 26 August 2006, <b>Dalit women</b> were harassed by the 
Priest of Shivalaya Temple and some local men when they attempted to worship on the occasion 
of Teej, a Hindu festival. They were eventually barred from entering the temple. Reports 
indicated that, on 16 September 2006, the District Administrative Officer issued a formal notice 
that Dalits have the right to enter and worship at public temples, and that those who choose to 
discriminate on the basis of caste, in whatever form, will be prosecuted. However, when Dalit 
worshippers visited the Saileswori Temple of Dipayal in Silgadhi, Doti District on 17 September 
2006,  their worship was disrupted by upper-caste people, who physically attacked them with 
knifes and other weapons, alleging that the Dalit worshippers had been acting in an offensive 
manner.

<p><b>Communications sent to the Government 
 
</b>127. On 5 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning 
the attack on Ms. <b>Valentina Uzunova</b>, Director of the <i>Minority Rights Commission</i> in St. 
Petersburg.  
</p>
<p>128. According to the information received, on 19 June 2007, at approximately 18:00, Ms. 
Uzunova was brutally attacked by an unidentified female outside the family home of a former 
colleague, Mr Nikolai Girenko, in St. Petersburg. Mr Girenko, ex-Director of the <i>Minority </i></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.1 
Page 27 
</p>
<p> 
<i>Rights Commission</i>, professor of ethnology and prominent expert on ethnic and racial issues in 
the country, was shot dead on his doorstep in June 2004. The masked assailant allegedly 
demanded that Ms Uzunova turn over the documents she was carrying. However, when Ms 
Uzunova refused, the woman physically attacked her before absconding with the dossier 
containing the documents along with Ms Uzunova&#8217;s earrings. The assailant did not take Ms 
Uzunova&#8217;s purse. Ms Uzunova suffered concussion as a result of the attack and was treated at 
Alexandrovskaya Hospital.  
</p>
<p>129. According to reports, the attack took place the day before Ms Uzunova was due to testify 
against Mr Vladislav Nikolsky, a publisher of xenophobic literature who has been accused of 
inciting ethic hatred. Prior to the attack Ms Uzunova had allegedly received an anonymous 
phone call threatening her and her family with death if she did not assist in clearing Mr 
Nikolsky&#8217;s name. Ms Uzunova was apparently refused police protection on the basis that there 
was not enough evidence to support the threat. 
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>130. On 22 August 2007, the Government of the Russian Federation replied to the urgent appeal 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on 5 July 2007, indicating that the Vyborg district court in St. 
Petersburg was hearing criminal proceedings against V.I. Nikolsky, who was charged with the 
commission of offences covered by article 280, paragraph 3 (attempted commission of an 
offence), article 280, paragraph 1 (public incitement to extremist activities), and article 282, 
paragraph 1 (inflaming hatred or hostility and degrading treatment) of the Criminal Code of the 
Russian Federation.  
</p>
<p>131. The Government reply noted that the case file stated that  Nikolsky was the author of a 
pamphlet inciting its readers to perpetrate extremist acts and inflaming ethnic hatred, entitled 
&#8220;Russian national initiative: What we should do now (minimum programme for the Russian 
people), St. Petersburg, 2006&#8221;, which he was attempting to have run off in the printing company 
Profprint. An expert appraisal of the contents of the pamphlet was performed by V.I. Ms. 
Uzunova. On 4 June 2007, the court acceded to the request by Nikolsky&#8217;s defence counsel for 
the conduct of a second expert appraisal of the text of the pamphlet, which, once again, was 
entrusted to Ms. Uzunova. For the purpose of this expert appraisal, Ms. Uzunova was also given 
a copy of a book edited by Nikolsky, &#8220;Introduction to the Theory of National Security&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>132. The Government further informed that, on 19 June 2007, at around 6 p.m., in the vicinity 
of No. 18 Podkovarov Street, in the Petrograd district of St. Petersburg, an unidentified woman 
attacked Ms. Uzunova, striking her several times on the head and then fleeing, having snatched 
from her victim money, earrings and the above-mentioned book &#8220;Introduction to the Theory of 
National Security&#8221;. As a consequence of this attack, Ms. Uzunova suffered head injuries, 
concussion and contusions and was admitted to hospital No. 3 in St. Petersburg. According to 
testimony by Ms. Uzunova, the woman who attacked her did not utter any threats relating to her 
victim&#8217;s professional activity. 
</p>
<p>133. On the basis of the attack on Ms. Uzunova, the Petrograd Side internal affairs office in St. 
Petersburg instituted criminal proceedings under article 161, paragraph 2 (d) (Robbery) of the 
Criminal Code. The theory that &#8220;supporters&#8221; of V.I. Nikolsky were involved in the attack is 
being studied.The criminal proceedings in question are being specially monitored by the Office 
of the Procurator General of the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  </b></p>

</p><p> 
134. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for its reply to 
his urgent appeal. However, he wishes to express concern that the attack on Ms. Uzunova may 
be directly related to her legitimate work in defence of human rights in Russia, in particular, her 
activities in relation to the protection of minority rights, activism against extremism and 
incitement to racial hatred in Russia. The Special Rapporteur wishes to refer to one of his 
recommendations on his report on the Russian Federation establishing that &#8220;acts of racism and 
intolerance against foreigners, and in particular students, human rights defenders, witnesses in 
criminal investigations, intellectuals and activists engaged in the combat against racism should 
be firmly condemned and given utmost priority by law enforcement officials, amongst others, by 
offering effective protective measures from racially motivated attacks, especially by 
ultranationalist groups &#8220;(A/HRC/4/19/Add.3, par. 86). While noting an increase in the judicial 
and legal measures taken against the perpetrators of racist crimes, the Special Rapporteur 
continues to be seriously concerned about the high number of racially motivated attacks, in 
particular perpetrated by neo-Nazi groups. He intends to closely monitory the situation on the 
basis of his mission report.

March 2006 and 15 August 2006 (see A/HRC/4/19/Add.1, para. 197-199), the Special 
Rapporteur is forced to consider the following cases no longer as allegations but as proven facts. 
</p>
<p>136. According to information received, in the first week of November 2005, <b>an attack and 
looting on the market of the town of Shearia, Southern Darfur,</b> was carried out by Janjaweed 
militias working in collaboration with Government forces. It was reported that during this attack, 
persons from the Zaghawa tribe and shops belonging to persons from the Zaghawa tribe were 
specifically targeted. Subsequent to this attack, persons belonging to the Zaghawa tribe fled the 
town of Shearia to El Fahal, Otash and Dereig Internally displaced Camps. 
</p>
<p>137. According to information received, on 24 July 2006, approximately 25 armed militias, 
some wearing army uniforms, <b>attacked a group of twenty women</b> aged 19-42 outside Kalma 
Internally Displaced Camp, while they were collecting firewood. All women belong to the 
African Fur ethnic group. The militiamen beat the women with the butts of their guns and 
flogged them before raping seventeen of the women. There had been a steady gathering of armed 
militias, reportedly the Arab Janjaweed, in the surrounding areas of Kalma camp. These militias 
had previously attacked humanitarian workers and undertaken nightly armed incursions into the 
camp in order to loot property.

concernant <b>une nouvelle campagne du parti politique Union D&#233;mocratique du Centre

</p>
<p>139. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le parti politique Union D&#233;mocratique du Centre aurait 
lanc&#233; une nouvelle campagne pour promouvoir une proposition d&#8217;initiative populaire concernant 
le renvoi des citoyens &#233;trangers qui auraient commis un crime grave en Suisse. Dans le cadre de </p>

</p>
<p> 
cette campagne, une publicit&#233; visuelle ayant pour titre &#171;Pour plus de s&#233;curit&#233; &#187; aurait &#233;t&#233; publi&#233;e 
dans plusieurs journaux suisses, montrant trois moutons blancs sur un drapeau suisse basculant 
un mouton noir hors du drapeau. Ces images s&#8217;accompagneraient du texte suivant: &#171;Gr&#226;ce &#224; 
l&#8217;initiative sur le renvoi, nous pouvons enfin syst&#233;matiquement renvoyer les &#233;trangers qui 
commettent un crime grave en Suisse. Nous augmentons ainsi la s&#233;curit&#233; pour les enfants, les

</p>
<p>140. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a exprim&#233; sa vive inqui&#233;tude quant au fait que ce type d&#8217;images 
puisse utiliser intentionnellement des ambig&#252;it&#233;s li&#233;es &#224; la question de la couleur des moutons 
pour transmettre un message de nature raciste. Dans ce sens, il a rappel&#233; le Gouvernement suisse 
des informations dont il a fait &#233;tat dans son rapport de mission au Conseil des droits de l&#8217;homme 
(A/HRC/4/2007/19/Add.2) concernant des campagnes politiques pr&#233;c&#233;dentes de l&#8217;UDC, 
montrant entre autres des mains de couleur essayant d&#8217;attraper des passeports suisses dans un 
panier. En outre, comme constat&#233; dans son rapport de mission, il a exprim&#233; sa profonde 
pr&#233;occupation quant &#224; la possibilit&#233; que cette campagne puisse contribuer &#224; la tendance de 
banalisation et de l&#233;gitimation du racisme et de la x&#233;nophobie dans les milieux politiques et 
intellectuels en Suisse. Finalement, il a exprim&#233; son inqui&#233;tude quant &#224; la possibilit&#233; que ce type 
de publicit&#233; produise une augmentation de la discrimination et de la x&#233;nophobie dont souffrent 
majoritairement les membres des communaut&#233;s &#233;trang&#232;res et des minorit&#233;s nationales, 
notamment les Noirs. 
</p>
<p><b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement  
 
</b>141. Le 13 septembre 2006, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la communication du Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial du 27 juillet 2006.  
</p>
<p>142. Le Gouvernement a tout d&#8217;abord not&#233; que toutes les soci&#233;t&#233;s modernes doivent aujourd&#8217;hui 
faire face &#224; une acc&#233;l&#233;ration de la diversit&#233; dans tous les domaines et que, en Suisse, comme 
partout ailleurs en Europe, les dynamiques li&#233;es &#224; la globalisation peuvent conduire &#224; un climat 
de tension identitaire, susceptible d&#8217;&#234;tre exploit&#233; politiquement. Le Gouvernement a cependant 
indiqu&#233; que ces confrontations sont le signe d&#8217;une d&#233;mocratie vivante &#224; laquelle participent tous 
les groupes de la population. En Suisse, la d&#233;mocratie directe permet, par le biais de referendums 
lanc&#233;s contre des lois vot&#233;es par le Parlement et d&#8217;initiatives &#233;manant du people qui proposent 
des modifications constitutionnelles, que m&#234;me les th&#232;mes controvers&#233;s puissant &#234;tre discut&#233;s 
sur la sc&#232;ne publique. 
</p>
<p>143. Le Gouvernement a &#233;galement soulign&#233; qu&#8217;une grande transparence est assur&#233;e dans le 
d&#233;bat politique visant &#224; trouver des solutions pratiques et constructives, et que les campagnes 
li&#233;es a ce d&#233;bat, dans les phases initiales tout a moins, peuvent &#234;tre accompagn&#233;es d&#8217;expressions 
exag&#233;r&#233;es et regrettables. Le Gouvernement a toutefois observ&#233; que les auteurs de l&#8217;initiative 
doivent savoir, compte tenu de l&#8217;exp&#233;rience historique, qu&#8217;en caricaturant la r&#233;alit&#233;, ils 
compromettent leurs chances de succ&#232;s. 
</p>
<p>144. La d&#233;mocratie directe, finalement, oblige les citoyens actifs &#224; se d&#233;terminer concr&#232;tement. 
Il est d&#233;montr&#233; qu&#8217;elle n&#8217;a pas entraine d&#8217;abus de caract&#232;re raciste, m&#234;me aux moments les plus 
difficiles de l&#8217;histoire europ&#233;enne. 
</p>
<p>145. Dans sa r&#233;ponse, le Gouvernement a &#233;galement not&#233; que pour adh&#233;rer a la Convention 
pour l&#8217;Elimination de la Discrimination Raciale, en 1994, la Suisse a modifie son Code p&#233;nal en 
y inscrivant l&#8217;art 261 bis qui rend punissable toute incitation au racisme dans l&#8217;espace public. Cet 
article a &#233;t&#233; accepte par le peuple le 25 septembre 1994. </p>

146. En ce qui concerne la campagne de l&#8217;UDC, le Gouvernement a confirm&#233; qu&#8217;une initiative 
populaire visant le renvoi des citoyens &#233;trangers qui auraient commis un crime grave a &#233;t&#233; lanc&#233;e 
le 10 juillet 2007 et que des affiches conformes &#224; la description contenue dans la lettre 
d&#8217;all&#233;gation ont &#233;t&#233; placard&#233;es dans toutes les r&#233;gions de la Suisse. Le Gouvernement a pr&#233;cis&#233; 
que les actes a caract&#232;re potentiellement raciste commis dans l&#8217;espace public &#233;tant poursuivis 
d&#8217;office, il appartient, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, aux tribunaux de juger si ces affiches sont condamnables.  
</p>
<p>147. Le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que, &#224; ce jour, les tribunaux ont privil&#233;gie la confrontation 
politique ouverte plut&#244;t qu&#8217;une application rigoureuse de l&#8217;interdiction. Les arr&#234;ts rendus 
correspondent &#224; l&#8217;opinion du Conseil f&#233;d&#233;ral, selon laquelle la confrontation politique a plus 
d&#8217;impact, &#224; long terme, qu&#8217;une condamnation par le juge. Le Gouvernement observe que cette 
attitude est coh&#233;rente avec la jurisprudence constante de la Cour europ&#233;enne des droits de 
l&#8217;homme qui souligne l&#8217;importance particuli&#232;re de la libert&#233; d&#8217;expression dans une soci&#233;t&#233; 
d&#233;mocratique et qui n&#8217;accepte gu&#232;re des restrictions de cette libert&#233; dans le d&#233;bat politique. 
</p>
<p>148. Le Gouvernement a &#233;galement indiqu&#233; que la r&#233;colte de signatures et, si cette initiative 
aboutit, les d&#233;bats qui auront lieu avant la votation, permettrons de se confronter &#224; son contenu. 
Si l&#8217;initiative est accept&#233;e par le peuple et les cantons, les autorit&#233;s f&#233;d&#233;rales et cantonales 
devront veiller &#224; ce qu&#8217;elle soit mise en &#339;uvre de mani&#232;re conforme aux engagements 
internationaux de la Suisse. 
</p>
<p>149. Finalement, la r&#233;ponse indique que le Conseil f&#233;d&#233;ral a r&#233;it&#233;r&#233; a plusieurs reprises son 
engagement contre le racisme et qu&#8217;il continuera &#224; prendre clairement position contre toute 
forme de discrimination et de x&#233;nophobie. Le Conseil f&#233;d&#233;ral porte une attention particuli&#232;re aux 
questions migratoires et &#224; la politique d&#8217;int&#233;gration; c&#8217;est pour cela qu&#8217;il a d&#233;cid&#233;, le 22 aout 
2007, d&#8217;adopter un train de mesures visant &#224; favoriser l&#8217;int&#233;gration et &#224; combattre la 
discrimination. Ce projet a &#233;t&#233; &#233;labor&#233; en &#233;troite collaboration par tous les organes f&#233;d&#233;raux 
concern&#233;s. La contribution f&#233;d&#233;rale s&#8217;&#233;l&#232;ve &#224; plus de 50 millions de francs par an. Le Conseil 
f&#233;d&#233;ral est convaincu qu&#8217;un travail constructif de ce genre est la meilleure r&#233;ponse aux 
manifestations x&#233;nophobes.

&#233;lections au Conseil f&#233;d&#233;ral le 12 d&#233;cembre 2007 &#8211; illustre l&#8217;ancrage du d&#233;bat d&#233;mocratique au 
sein de la soci&#233;t&#233; suisse. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial tient &#224; souligner, dans ce contexte, l&#8217;engagement 
personnel et le degr&#233; &#233;lev&#233; de motivation et de sensibilit&#233; sur la question du racisme des 
responsables de certains services et commissions. Il souhaite tout particuli&#232;rement exprimer sa 
gratitude &#224; la Commission f&#233;d&#233;rale contre le racisme pour son initiative d&#8217;organiser, le 6 
d&#233;cembre 2007, une r&#233;union avec les d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s cantonaux et communaux &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;gration &#224; </p>

laquelle ont &#233;galement particip&#233; des responsables du Service de lutte contre le racisme. Cette 
r&#233;union a port&#233; non seulement sur un dialogue fructueux avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial mais surtout 
sur les enjeux, les avanc&#233;es et les obstacles &#224; la promotion d&#8217;un vivre ensemble r&#233;ciproquement 
enrichissant entre les communaut&#233;s, l&#8217;acceptation de la diversit&#233; et du multiculturalisme et le 
combat contre toutes les formes et manifestations de racisme et de x&#233;nophobie.
