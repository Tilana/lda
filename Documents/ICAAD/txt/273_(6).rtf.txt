IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT SUVA
MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTION

Cr. Misc. Case No: HAM0080 of 2004S

Between:

JOSUA RAITAMATA
Applicant

And:

THE STATE
Respondent

Hearing: 20th December 2004
Ruling: 20th December 2004

Counsel: Applicant in Person
Ms N. Tikoisuva for State

RULING

The Applicant was sentenced to 6½ years imprisonment in either June or August of this year. He has submitted correspondence to me which show that he made earnest attempts to communicate with the court from the 9th of September 2004 and to file an appeal.

In the light of the fact that he was making these attempts from prison and is unrepresented, I consider he has shown good cause.

Leave to appeal is granted.
