</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> By its resolution 2004/84 of 21 April 2004, the Commission on Human Rights decided to 
appoint an independent expert to provide assistance to the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo in the field of human rights, to study the evolving situation of human 
rights and to verify that obligations in that field were being fulfilled. The independent expert 
presented his preliminary report to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session.<b>2</b> 
He then presented a report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth, sixty-first and sixty-second 
sessions.<b>3</b> He had also prepared a report for the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-second 
session, which was to be examined by the Human Rights Council.<b>4</b> Like the special procedures 
and thematic mandates of the Commission on Human Rights, the mandate of the independent 
expert on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was extended 
by decision 1/102, adopted by the Human Rights Council on 30 June 2006. His report to the 
Human Rights Council at its fourth session<b>5</b> and this report were drawn up pursuant to that 
decision. 
</p>
<p> During his visits to both Geneva and New York, the expert held meetings about the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and his mandate. 
</p>
<p> The expert also visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 28 November 
and 5 December 2007. 
</p>
<p> In the light of the information that he gathered during 2007 and at the very beginning 
of 2008, the independent expert is in a position to make relevant observations and 
recommendations on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The 
situation continues to give concern: the lack of security remains worrying, especially in the 
regions in the east of the country, where militias and armed groups, as well as the Armed Forces 
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) commit serious human rights violations with 
impunity, and in Bas-Congo. The weakness of the judiciary and its lack of independence 
vis-&#224;-vis the executive, which has control over judicial decisions, are also deplorable. 
 The independent expert therefore recommends, inter alia, that: 
</p>
<p> (a) The &#8220;Acte d&#8217;engagement&#8221; signed in Goma on 23 January 2008 should be 
implemented; 
</p>

</p>
<p> (b) An effective policy should be implemented on the elimination of human rights 
violations and the prosecution and punishment of those responsible for human rights violations, 
as well as of any political and military actors guilty of interference in, or obstruction of, the 
administration of justice; 
 (c) The practice whereby military courts exercise jurisdiction over civilians should be 
ended and military criminal law should be amended to bring it into line with the Constitution and 
applicable international norms; 
</p>
<p> (d) Judicial independence should be promoted and the judiciary should be provided with 
the infrastructure and human resources needed to guarantee the sound administration of justice; 
 (e) The &#8220;Mapping Team&#8221; of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of 
Human Rights (OHCHR) should be supported in its efforts to draw up a map of the serious 
human rights violations committed between 1993 and 2003; 
</p>
<p> (f) Efforts to facilitate the taking of evidence in cases of sexual violence should be made 
by supporting the adoption and distribution of a standard medical certificate that could serve as 
evidence in trial proceedings. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. By its resolution 2004/84, the Commission on Human Rights decided to appoint an 
independent expert to provide assistance to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo in the field of human rights, to study the evolving situation of human rights and to verify 
that obligations in that field were being fulfilled. The independent expert presented his 
preliminary report to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session.<b>6</b> He then 
presented a report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth, sixty-first and sixty-second sessions.<b>7</b> 
He had also prepared a report for the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-second session, 
which was to be examined by the Human Rights Council (&#8220;the Council&#8221;).<b>8</b> Like the special 
procedures and thematic mandates of the Commission on Human Rights, the mandate of the 
independent expert on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
was extended by decision 1/102, adopted by the Human Rights Council on 30 June 2006. His 
report to the Human Rights Council at its fourth session<b>9</b> and this report were drawn up pursuant 
to that decision. 
</p>
<p>2. In preparation for the submission of his report to the Council at its seventh session, the 
independent expert on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Titinga Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Pac&#233;r&#233;, carried out a fourth fact-finding and working visit to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo over an eight-day period from 28 November to 5 December 2007. 
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert went to Kinshasa and to Bukavu in South Kivu. In Kinshasa, he 
held frank discussions with the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Speaker of the Senate, 
the Chief Justice of the Military High Court, the Chief Military Prosecutor, the ministers for 
justice, human rights, women, defence and humanitarian affairs and the deputy ministers for 
foreign affairs and human rights. He also met with representatives of: the United Nations 
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC); the United Nations 
system in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the diplomatic corps in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo; human rights organizations; members of the initiative to combat sexual 
violence; and civil society. In Bukavu, South Kivu, he met with the governor of the province, 
members of the Provincial Assembly, and the judicial, civil and military authorities. The expert 
also exchanged views with local MONUC officials, representatives of human rights NGOs and 
local civil society. 
</p>
<p>4. This report analyses the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
from June to December 2007, with updates on important developments at the Conference on 
Peace, Security and Development in the Provinces of North and South Kivu, held from 6

</p>
<p>to 24 January 2008 in Goma, North Kivu. A series of recommendations are made at the end of 
the report with a view to improving the human rights situation in the country. These 
recommendations are based on the information transmitted regularly to the independent expert 
by the United Nations Human Rights Integrated Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
consisting of the OHCHR office in the country, MONUC and representatives of public 
institutions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, NGOs, political parties and associations. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  IMPUNITY AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE 
</b></p>
<p>5. Despite the undertaking by President Joseph Kabila and the Congolese Government to 
prioritize efforts to combat impunity following the elections, little progress has been made to 
date with regard to the administration of justice and the fight against impunity, and thus it seems 
that a climate of virtually generalized impunity persists throughout the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. The manner in which several of the important investigations and trials mentioned 
below have (or have not) evolved over this period is particularly worrying. 
</p>
<p>6. The appointment or promotion of individuals who are suspected of serious human rights 
violations to senior ranks and positions in the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (FARDC) remains problematic because no vetting mechanism has been put in place by 
the Congolese authorities whereby officers suspected of involvement in such acts can be 
suspended with immediate effect, pending an in-depth investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Tentative progress in the fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>7. The fact that the convictions handed down in the trials for the Bavi massacre and the 
murder of two MONUC military observers were upheld constitutes the main progress in the fight 
against impunity during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>8. On 28 July 2007, the Kisangani Military Court of Appeal, in a circuit hearing held in 
Bunia, Ituri, returned its verdict on the Bavi case. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict handed 
down by the court of first instance against the main defendant, a captain of the FARDC, who 
was sentenced to life imprisonment for war crimes, rape and pillage. Another captain was 
sentenced to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment and the seven other defendants were sentenced to 15 years&#8217; 
imprisonment for murder. On 19 February 2007, the Bunia garrison military court had sentenced 
nine defendants, all members of the 1st integrated brigade, to life imprisonment for participating 
in the arbitrary execution of at least 32 civilians in Bavi (32 kilometres south of Bunia) between 
August and November 2006. The military court also awarded a large amount in damages to the 
families of the victims. 
</p>
<p>9. In the case of the murder of two MONUC soldiers, the appeal lodged by three of the 
five defendants was time-barred, the court rejected it and upheld the sentence of life 
imprisonment handed down at first instance. Furthermore, on 12 November 2007, the Bunia 
garrison military court upheld the life sentence handed down in absentia on 19 February 2007 to 
Ufoyuru, alias Kwisha, a former militiaman of the <i>Front des nationalistes et int&#233;grationnistes</i> 
(Nationalist and Integrationist Front) (FNI), for participating in the murder of two MONUC 
military observers in Mongbwalu in May 2003. Kwisha escaped from Bunia prison 
on 13 January 2007 and, after his capture on 6 October 2007, his lawyer obtained a retrial. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/25 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>10. Another step forward for international justice was the transfer of Germain Katanga, the 
militia leader of <i>Force de r&#233;sistance patriotique en Ituri</i> (Patriotic Resistance Front in Ituri) 
(FRPI), to the International Criminal Court (ICC) on the night of 16-17 October 2007, with the 
assistance of the Congolese authorities. Germain Katanga is accused of committing crimes 
against humanity and war crimes in Ituri in 2002 and 2003, including in Nyakunde in 
September 2002, when at least 1,<footnote name="2">6. On 30 September 2007, judge advocates serving at the Kisangani military prosecutor&#8217;s 
office, in Orientale Province, were subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by 
soldiers of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC), acting on the 
orders of the commander of the 9th military region. The judge advocates were arrested at their 
homes and subjected to grave acts of ill-treatment on several occasions during their detention. 
Most civil and military judges, first in Kisangani and then throughout the country, reacted by 
going on strike. In a memorandum dated 2 October 2007 addressed to the President of the 
Republic, they condemned repeated interference by high-ranking officials in the administration 
of justice. They also condemned the actions of the commander of the 9th military region and 
demanded that he be suspended and that legal proceedings be brought against him. MONUC also </footnote>00 civilians were massacred on his orders. Germain Katanga is 
suspected of having orchestrated many other massacres, including those in Bunia, Komanda and 
Bogoro, where thousands of civilians were tortured, enslaved and killed. 
</p>
<p>11. Lastly, the imminent deployment of the team of the United Nations Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights responsible for mapping the serious violations of human 
rights and international humanitarian law between 1993 and 2003 should make it possible to 
develop appropriate mechanisms to obtain justice for the victims of past crimes. 
12. Notwithstanding the aforementioned examples, impunity remains flagrant. The persistence 
of impunity has resulted in a failure to initiate judicial investigations into serious human rights 
violations, lack of progress on cases that have been opened (in particular when there is 
interference by political and military authorities - see paragraphs 13 and 14 below), or even sham 
trials. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Failure to initiate investigations:  the flagrant  
example of North Kivu 
</b></p>
<p>13. There are many cases of human rights violations that have not been investigated, despite 
the information sent to the judicial authorities by MONUC or local NGOs. Even when judicial 
cases are opened, investigations are rarely concluded. This phenomenon is particularly flagrant 
in North Kivu, where no trials have been held for cases of serious human rights violations. There 
is no shortage of cases, however; MONUC and several international and local NGOs regularly 
send information to the judicial authorities. MONUC has furthermore facilitated joint inquiry 
missions of the United Nations Human Rights Integrated Office and the military prosecutor&#8217;s 
office. In its public report of September 2007, the United Nations Human Rights Integrated 
Office, following a joint inquiry with members of the Goma military prosecutor&#8217;s office, 
confirmed allegations about three mass graves located at the former headquarters of the 2nd 
battalion of the FARDC Bravo Brigade in Rubare, in Rutshuru territory, 65 kilometres north of 
Goma. Joint verification missions were carried out by MONUC and the Congolese judicial 
authorities in Rubare, as well as in Katwiguru and Kiseguru, where other mass graves were 
discovered. The judicial investigation does not seem to have progressed since then. 
14. As regards the Buramba massacre committed during the night of 9-10 March 2007, the 
military prosecutor&#8217;s office sent a special investigation team to the scene in March 2007, but the 
case has not been followed up. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Stalling of many cases and trials 
</b></p>
<p>A/HRC/7/25 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>since February 2005, has yet to begin, even though the case has been referred to the Kamina 
military prosecutor in Katanga. The above-mentioned cases of Buramba and the mass graves in 
North Kivu are also among the many stalled cases. 
</p>
<p>16. There is a worrying tendency for military courts systematically to exercise jurisdiction over 
civilians, a practice which is contrary to the Constitution (art. 152), but which is still common. 
</p>
<p><b>D. The Kilwa and Serge Maheshe cases:  sham trials which  
have provoked international condemnation 
</b></p>
<p>17. During the reporting period, two landmark trials in the fight against impunity in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo provoked strong reactions from the international community 
and Congolese civil society and disappointment among the population. Fundamental fair trial 
guarantees were not afforded, there were instances of political and military interference and the 
judgements handed down were strongly criticized. 
18. On 28 June 2007, the Katanga Military Court pronounced its verdict in the Kilwa massacre 
case. None of the defendants was convicted of war crimes. Colonel Ad&#233;mar and another 
defendant were convicted of murder. The other FARDC soldiers were either given light 
sentences or acquitted, and the three expatriate employees of the Anvil Mining multinational 
company were also acquitted. In its judgement, the Military Court concluded that no massacre 
had taken place, and that the deaths of the 73 victims had been an accidental consequence of the 
fighting. In a statement issued on 4 July 2007, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights expressed her concern about the &#8220;court&#8217;s conclusions that the events in Kilwa 
were the accidental results of fighting, despite the presence at the trial of substantial eyewitness 
testimony and material evidence pointing to the commission of serious and deliberate human 
rights violations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>19. The High Commissioner urged the court of appeal &#8220;to fully and fairly weigh all the 
evidence before it reaches the appropriate conclusions that justice and the rights of the victims 
demand&#8221;. The appeal proceedings began on 6 December 2007 before the Military High Court, in 
a circuit court hearing held in Lubumbashi. However, from the very outset of the proceedings, 
there were protests at the scope of the appeal and the impartiality of the judges was called into 
question. 
</p>
<p>20. In the case of the murder of journalist Serge Maheshe, the Bukavu garrison military 
court sentenced four civilians to death on 28 August 2007, including two friends of the 
victim who were the only eyewitnesses to the murder. At the trial, which began on the evening 
of 14 June - less than 24 hours after the murder - the court neglected to follow up several 
important leads and relied almost exclusively on the statements of two civilians who claimed to 
have been hired by the victim&#8217;s friends to murder him. 
</p>
<p>21. When the trial started, two navy servicemen had been arrested and had been considered the 
main suspects until the announcement was made about the new suspects and their &#8220;confessions&#8221;, 
obtained in unexplained circumstances. Despite many inconsistencies in the statements of the 
two civilian suspects (taken by the court itself) and the other unanswered questions in the case, 
the court sentenced the four civilians to death without even considering the responsibility of the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/25 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>two military suspects, who were acquitted. MONUC and several local and international human 
rights organizations denounced the serious irregularities in the proceedings and the court&#8217;s 
refusal to investigate the events properly, as illustrated in particular by its refusal to order an 
autopsy on the victim and a ballistic analysis of the murder weapon. After they had been 
convicted, the two civilians who had made the confessions retracted their statements implicating 
the two eyewitnesses to the murder. 
</p>
<p>22. In a letter dated 8 September addressed to MONUC, they accused two members of the 
Bukavu military prosecutor&#8217;s office of having forced them to make false statements. Although 
MONUC reacted by urging the highest military justice authorities to investigate the allegations 
thoroughly and fully and to expedite the appeals process, no measures were taken and the four 
convicted civilians remain in detention in Bukavu prison. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Frequent obstructions of justice linked to interference  
by the political and military hierarchy 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Congolese judiciary is still subject to corruption and frequent obstructions of justice 
which are linked to political and military interference. Its independence, and its capacity, are 
seriously undermined by the failure of the Congolese State to provide it with sufficient financial 
resources to allow it to function and by a worrying use of the Constitution to reassert the 
executive&#8217;s control over the judiciary. 
24. Interference by the political and military authorities with the administration of justice was 
frequently denounced in most of the above-mentioned trials for serious human rights violations, 
as well as in other cases, as illustrated in the two examples below.  
</p>
<p>25. On 28 July 2007, the Kisangani Military Court acquitted the Ituri militia chief, 
Chief Kahwa, after quashing the verdict handed down by the Bunia garrison military court 
on 21 August 2006 sentencing him to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment for crimes against humanity 
and war crimes. This decision was not based on any valid legal argument and completely 
disregarded, for no good reason, the solid case which had been made at first instance, suggesting 
interference at the highest level to secure Kahwa&#8217;s acquittal. The prosecution filed an appeal 
with the Military High Court, but no ruling has been delivered as yet. Chief Kahwa was also 
sentenced to life imprisonment for murder by the Bunia regional court on 19 January 2006; here 
too, the Kisangani court of appeal has yet to pronounce its verdict. The developments in this case 
therefore remain a serious cause of concern. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/25 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>recommended that the commander of the 9th military region and his subordinates be suspended 
with immediate effect and brought to justice, and it urged the competent authorities to take all 
necessary measures to guarantee the independence of the judiciary in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Underfunding of the judiciary 
</b>27. In order to ensure the smooth administration of justice in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, the judiciary must receive adequate funding from the Government. Underfunding and 
lack of job security among all judicial staff play no small part in undermining the independence 
of the judiciary. The share of the budget allocated to the Congolese justice sector in 2007 was 
only 0.75 per cent of total public spending, a slight increase from 0.6 per cent in 2005 and 2006 
(in most countries this figure ranges between 2 per cent and 6 per cent). Only US$ 5,000 was 
made available for legal aid and about the same sum for compensation for damages caused by 
the State. This amount is far too small, considering that awards of damages against the 
Congolese State since January 2005 add up to US$ 1,<footnote name="30">. Despite some small progress between June and December 2007, the persistence of 
impunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is particularly worrying, given the lack of 
progress on, and the obstruction of, many cases involving serious human rights violations where </footnote>0,000. Given the lack of financial 
resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Government could establish an expert 
group to devise an appropriate timetable for payment of the sums owed and to find creative 
compensation solutions, whether symbolic, collective or low-cost (exemption from school 
enrolment fees, support for income-generating activities, etc.).  
</p>
<p><b>G. A worrying use of the Constitution that threatens  
the independence of the judiciary  
</b></p>
<p>28. According to the information provided in June 2007 by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy, the President of the Republic dismissed 
the Chief Justice of the Military High Court and the First Advocate-General of the military 
prosecutor&#8217;s office and replaced them with new judicial officers. Under the new Constitution, 
however, the President of the Republic may only dismiss and appoint members of the national 
legal service on the recommendation of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary (CSM), a body 
which guarantees the independence of the judicial system. In this case, as the Council had not yet 
been set up, the unilateral dismissal and appointment of judicial officers by the President of the 
Republic was a violation of the Constitution and compromised the independence of the country&#8217;s 
judiciary. 
29. More worrying still, a petition was submitted recently to the Bureau of the National 
Assembly seeking a revision of the constitutional provisions on the composition of the Supreme 
Council of the Judiciary. The 310 signatories petitioned for the inclusion of the President of the 
Republic and the Minister of Justice in the Council, in flagrant violation of the principle of the 
independence of the judiciary enshrined in the Congolese Constitution. Nevertheless, the Act on 
the Supreme Council of the Judiciary was eventually adopted without amendment by the 
National Assembly at its extraordinary session from 17 to 24 December 2007. The framework 
laws on the three new high courts (the Constitutional Court, the State Council and the Court of 
Cassation) have not yet been considered, however. 
</p>
<p>  A/HRC/7/25 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>suspects are often identified, but not apprehended. These persons therefore continue to act 
with impunity, sometimes at the highest levels of the political and military hierarchy, thus 
perpetuating the cycle of impunity.  
</p>
<p><b>H.  The International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>31. There are two cases awaiting trial before the International Criminal Court that have a 
bearing on the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thomas Lubanga, a former militia leader who 
allegedly committed atrocities in the Ituri district resulting in the death of at least 6,000 persons 
since 1999 and the displacement of several hundred thousand others, has been charged 
with recruiting and enrolling child soldiers into his militias. The trial is due to begin on 
31 March 2008. The second case concerns Germain Katanga, former leader of the <i>Force 
de r&#233;sistance patriotique en Ituri</i> (Patriotic Resistance Front in Ituri) (FRPI). The case is at 
the preliminary stage, awaiting confirmation of the charges. 
</p>
<p>32. It is clear that the International Criminal Court alone cannot try the thousands of crimes 
and serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo over almost a decade, especially because its jurisdiction is limited to acts 
committed since the entry into force of the Rome Statute (1 July 2002). 
</p>
<p>33. What is needed, therefore, is a mechanism that would guarantee not only the effective 
punishment of crimes covered by the Rome Statute which were committed prior to 1 July 2002, 
but also the administration of justice and an all-out campaign against impunity. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Establishment of a special international criminal tribunal or joint 
criminal chambers for the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>34. In order to combat impunity, which must be done if peace is to be restored to the country 
and further crimes are to be prevented, the independent expert recommends the creation of a 
special international tribunal for the Democratic Republic of the Congo or, failing that, joint 
criminal chambers to try crimes committed since 1993, the year when serious violations of 
humanitarian law are first taken up in United Nations resolutions. 
</p>
<p>35. Certain measures could be taken to reduce the costs of a special tribunal. It could sit in 
the country, somewhere near the centre, in order to keep down transport costs incurred for 
defendants and witnesses. The host State could provide premises and defray certain costs; at least 
half the judges and three quarters of the judicial personnel would be citizens of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo; and the host State could be responsible for the assignment of counsel.  
</p>
<p>36. Should it prove impossible to create an international tribunal, then, bearing in mind that it 
is essential to combat impunity and extremely serious crimes, consideration could be given to 
setting up joint criminal chambers in the appeal courts and establishing a right of appeal 
(preliminary and final appeal) before a chamber that would be competent in this matter but 
would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court: 
 (a) Chambers of first instance could be set up in five appeal courts, one in Kinshasa and 
the other four strategically located throughout the country, taking into account the size of the 
country and distances; </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/25 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p> (b) Chambers of first instance could be composed of three judges (two national and 
one non-national, or vice versa); 
</p>
<p> (c) The preliminary or final appeal court could be composed of three judges 
(two non-national and one national, or vice versa); 
</p>
<p> (d) The public prosecutor&#8217;s office would be organized and would function according to 
the same criteria. 
</p>
<p>37.  The name of the institution could be the &#8220;Joint Criminal Chamber&#8221; and it would be 
responsible for trying persons accused of acts of genocide or other serious violations of human 
rights and international humanitarian law committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
as well as citizens of the Democratic Republic of the Congo accused of committing such acts or 
violations in neighbouring States. 
</p>
<p>38.  Such an institution would be more flexible and less costly, should the creation of a special 
international criminal tribunal prove unfeasible. The new joint criminal chambers could also 
contribute to restoring the country&#8217;s judicial system in terms of staff, training, equipment and 
living and working conditions. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE SITUATION OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Sexual violence and impunity:  the crucial role  
of the judiciary in combating sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>39. The incidence of acts of sexual violence continues to increase at an alarming rate in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, with almost total impunity. Pregnant women, persons in 
detention, minors and even babies are victims of individual or gang rapes, committed, to a 
worrying extent, by members of the Congolese national police and FARDC. On 
14 September 2007, members of the Congolese national police in Yanonge (Orientale Province), 
acting on orders from their commanding officer, allegedly raped eight women, including three 
minors aged from 11 to 14 years and one pregnant woman.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>40. In the absence of a functioning judicial system, many out-of-court settlements are 
concluded on the initiative or under the authority of traditional chiefs or local administrative 
officials, sometimes even the police, in breach of the legislation of July 2006 increasing the 
penalties for sexual violence and reaffirming the prohibition on such out-of-court settlements. On 
9 October 2007, the commanding officer at the police substation in the village of Thedeja 
(Orientale Province) allegedly received a fee of US$ 58 from a rape suspect to thank him for 
mediating in settling the matter out of court. The commanding officer reportedly persuaded the 
victim&#8217;s family not to press charges and to accept a cow by way of compensation. 
</p>
<p>41. The underrepresentation of women among judicial personnel, the predominantly 
patriarchal culture and the tendency for acts of violence against women to become commonplace 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  This incident and the others that follow were reported by personnel of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Integrated Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (UNHRO). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/25 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>contribute to the proliferation of these &#8220;mediations&#8221; in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to 
the detriment of the victims&#8217; basic rights. The practice is often accompanied by acts of 
intimidation and, sometimes, even punishment of the victim. On 4 September 2007, a young 
female rape victim was detained for three days at the police station in the village of Kalima 
(Maniema Province) for refusing to accept such an arrangement. Fearing that she would press 
charges, the rape suspect, a local trader, used his influence with the police to have the young girl 
arrested and charged with defamation. The victim was released only after giving US$ 20 to the 
police officers. 
</p>
<p>42. This police meddling goes hand in hand with the growing interference of the political and 
military authorities in judicial proceedings in such cases. On 19 September 2007, in Kampemba 
commune (Katanga Province), two rape suspects, a sergeant major of the Republican Guard and 
a member of the Congolese national police evaded custody as a result of manoeuvring by their 
father, who threatened the military investigator in charge of the case, who was of a lower rank 
than him, and thus obtained their release. On 12 September 2007, in response to a report about a 
rape, a judge at the Lubumbashi garrison military prosecutor&#8217;s office issued an arrest warrant for 
the suspect, a captain of the Republican Guard. The suspect&#8217;s commanding officer reportedly 
continues to obstruct the investigation by refusing to make the arrest. 
</p>
<p>43. That refusal is a violation not only of the Military Criminal Code but also of the acts 
of 2006 making sexual violence a statutory crime and relieving the prosecutor of the need to 
inform a suspect&#8217;s hierarchical superior of his subordinate&#8217;s arrest. The judicial authorities 
likewise often disregard the law. The Bukavu regional court (province of South Kivu) recently 
bailed a suspect accused of rape on the grounds that the parents of the parties had reportedly 
agreed to give the victim to the accused in marriage. Such an arrangement is not one of the 
criteria for granting bail and could, furthermore, be considered tantamount to the crime of forced 
marriage. On 23 August 2007, in two separate cases, the Bandundu regional court sentenced two 
individuals accused of rape and sexual assault to only four months in prison, citing significant 
mitigating circumstances without however stating what those circumstances were; the prosecutor 
chose not to appeal.  
</p>
<p>44. The attitude of the courts in the province of South Kivu towards sexual violence shows the 
degree of impunity that perpetrators of sexual violence continue to enjoy, and proves that the 
new law is not being properly applied, because judicial personnel are either unwilling to do so or 
are simply unfamiliar with its provisions. Between 2005 and 2007, when 14,200 rapes were  </p>
<p>reportedly recorded by health-care establishments in the province in 2005 alone, only 287 cases,  </p>
<p>or less than 1 per cent of the total, led to the filing of a complaint with the local judicial  </p>
<p>authorities. Of those complaints, 56 per cent were still at the preliminary investigation stage after  </p>
<p>a year, whereas due process would require that the prosecutor take the case to court within five 
months. Of the 60 cases for which the investigation has been completed, more than 80 per cent  </p>
<p>have been awaiting trial for more than two years. Lastly, although 58 guilty verdicts have been  </p>
<p>pronounced by the courts, in criminal and civil proceedings, no victim has yet received the 
damages awarded. In order to guarantee due legal process, some countries have established 
specialized bodies for certain aspects of criminal procedure, in particular prosecutions and 
investigations. In that regard, it might be worth considering the idea of appointing, in each 
prosecutor&#8217;s office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an investigating judge who would 
specialize in cases of sexual violence. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/25 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>45. The high cost of legal proceedings relative to the average income of Congolese citizens 
and the lack of any clear procedure guaranteeing complainants exemption from costs in case of 
indigence, largely explain the low rate of execution of compensation payments for victims who 
sue for damages in criminal proceedings and the low number of rapes reported to the prosecuting 
authorities. Another factor that must be taken into account is the payment of compensation for 
damages caused by agents of the State; in 2007 the Government of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo set aside only 3 million Congolese francs, the equivalent of US$ 5,357, for that 
purpose. That money in fact was never disbursed, and in any case is less than the average award 
granted by the courts in a single case. For example, in the landmark case of the gang rapes 
committed in Songo Mboyo in December 2003, the State was ordered to pay 165,370 dollars to 
the victims; no payment was ever made.  
</p>
<p>46. The Government has however made welcome progress in regard to the taking of forensic 
evidence. In response to a suggestion from the United Nations Human Rights Integrated Office 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Government launched a process providing for the 
adoption of a standard medical certificate for use in doctors&#8217; examinations and the establishment 
of a minimum protocol for adequately documenting the physical and/or psychological effects of 
sexual violence on victims.<b>11</b> Given the difficulty that many victims face in proving that they 
have been attacked, it is to be hoped that the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Justice will 
urgently promote the systematic adoption and free issuance of the new model certificate, which 
will spare victims from having to apply first to a judicial officer for a doctor&#8217;s requisition.  
47. Although strict time limits are laid down in the legislation for the conduct of proceedings 
in cases of sexual violence, in practice they are rarely respected. In South Kivu, for example, 
nearly 80 per cent of rape cases have been under investigation for more than two years. With 
regard to coercive measures against accused persons, it is a source of concern that perpetrators of 
sexual violence are almost always left at large, even when there is strong evidence of their guilt 
and they pose a threat to the security of victims and witnesses. When the perpetrator is released 
on bail, very few conditions are imposed: in South Kivu 80 per cent of persons accused have not 
appeared before the investigating judge or a court since charges were laid. 
48. One positive development in the context of the fight against sexual violence was the 
declaration signed on 23 November 2007 in Bukavu, in which the provincial authorities and 
members of the South Kivu Provincial Assembly affirmed their determination to combat 
impunity for those responsible for sexual violence. The declaration was formally presented to 
Ms. Olive Kabila, the first lady of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the Speaker of the 
National Assembly and to the ministers present in Bukavu on the occasion of the International 
Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. The Speaker of the National Assembly 
expressed his support for the initiative and called on the members of the National Assembly to 
make a similar commitment. In Mbuji-Mayi, in Kasai, Orientale Province, similar declarations 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  The model certificate was developed with the assistance of the Integrated Office, following 
</p>
<p>wide consultations with Congolese organizations and institutions. It was formally approved in 
June 2007 by the joint initiative to combat sexual violence, an umbrella group of all local and 
international partners involved in the fight against sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/25 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>were signed on 29 November 2007 by the Speaker of the provincial assembly and the provincial 
chief inspector of the Congolese national police. The latter undertook to ensure that the men and 
women under his command would abide by and implement the declaration.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Influence-peddling, abuse of authority, harassment, abuse of power  
and other forms of sexual violence in schools and universities directed  
against pupils and students 
</b></p>
<p>49. According to reliable sources, many teachers and professors, who have a legal and moral 
obligation to educate and care for their pupils and students, abuse their authority and award 
marks, promotion into the next grade or diplomas with honours in exchange for sexual favours. 
That practice, which is taking on alarming proportions, is the subject of growing criticism on the 
part of certain NGOs and the media, which refer to it as &#8220;sexually-transmitted assessments&#8221;. As a 
result, the image of the school and university system, supposedly a place for the transmission of 
knowledge, civic education and the spreading of moral values, has been seriously damaged. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Child soldiers and street children 
</b></p>
<p>50. In spite of the commitments made by the parties to various conflicts, minors continue to be 
enlisted as combatants, in flagrant violation of international conventions and their optional 
protocols on protection of the rights of children. The reports of the MONUC child protection unit 
cite many cases of forced recruitment of minors, mostly schoolchildren in the province of 
North Kivu, in particular the Masisi and Rutshuru regions, in the last four months of 2008. Those 
mainly responsible are said to be the <i>Congr&#232;s National pour la Defense du Peuple</i> led by 
disgraced General Laurent Nkundu, and Mai-Mai groups. 
</p>
<p>51. The phenomenon of street children, or &#8220;<i>sh&#233;gu&#233;s</i>&#8221;, is a logical consequence of the unstable 
situation and economic decay in the country. When parents are unable to meet their children&#8217;s 
needs, many children choose to live in the streets. There is a growing number of such children, 
living in abject poverty, with no adult supervision. The consequences in the future could be 
serious, as these children are often recruited to carry out reprehensible acts. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  EXERCISE OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>52. The exercise and enjoyment of civil and political rights in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo remain a source of great concern. The recent, historic, election should have provided new 
impetus for change but to date there has been no concrete improvement in the situation of civil 
and political rights across the country. The post-election period was characterized by a certain 
degree of political intolerance, manifested in the violent repression of demonstrators and political 
opponents as well as the harassment, intimidation, physical abuse, arbitrary arrest and illegal 
detention of journalists, human rights defenders and opposition leaders. The following 
two examples illustrate that situation. 
</p>
<p>53. Ms. Marie-Th&#233;r&#232;se Nlandu, a lawyer and former candidate in the most recent presidential 
election, was arrested along with nine others, on 21 November 2006 by the &#8220;Special Services&#8221; 
Police at the Kin-Mazi&#232;re police station. They were all charged with organizing and participating 
in an insurrection, as well as illegal possession of weapons and war materials. The accused were 
subsequently acquitted by the Kinshasa military tribunal. Nevertheless, on 20 June 2007, 50 days </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/25 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>after the acquittal, the chief military prosecutor of Kinshasa appealed the decision. Such a 
manoeuvre, which is a total violation of judicial principles, suffices to show the inherent 
difficulties associated with the full enjoyment and exercise of civil and political rights in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo.  
</p>
<p>54. According to a report published in January 2008 by the United Nations Human Rights 
Integrated Office on its special investigation into the events of March 2007 (armed clashes in 
Kinshasa between FARDC and the members of the close protection team of former 
Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba, on 22 and 23 March 2007), approximately 300 people were 
killed during and following the clashes, including, as a result of summary executions, mainly by 
the Republican Guard. The report cites credible testimony relating to at least 40 summary 
executions, and 18 other cases were confirmed by visits to the scene of the executions and by 
corroborating testimony. 
</p>
<p>55. The investigation also documented more than 200 cases of arbitrary arrest and numerous 
incidences of intimidation and threats against individuals considered to be linked to 
Jean-Pierre Bemba or individuals from Equateur Province. The members of the security forces 
involved in these incidents have yet to be investigated or prosecuted, in spite of calls from 
MONUC for such action to be taken.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>56. The socio-economic situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains unstable, 
and is further exacerbated by the continued fighting in the east of the country between the State 
security forces and rebel groups. For most citizens, the exercise and enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights remain a distant dream. The 2008 budget, of US$ 3.6 billion, 
19.6 per cent of which is allocated for servicing the country&#8217;s external debt, limits the 
Government&#8217;s ability to implement its programme in the five priority areas of employment, 
education, health, water and electricity and infrastructure. Many observers believe that the 
budget does not clearly account for revenue from the mining and oil sectors, the management of 
which lacks transparency. Civil society as a whole has called for a review of all mining 
contracts, a number of which are viewed as one-sided. Poor management of these sectors 
deprives the country of significant income which could otherwise be used to improve the social 
conditions of rightful claimants.  
</p>
<p>57. Although the right to a basic education is guaranteed by the Constitution, many children 
still do not have access to education. The hopes raised when the Government proposed to take 
full responsibility for paying the salaries of teachers, thus making primary and secondary 
education free of charge, vanished with the allocation of only 5 per cent of the 2008 budget to 
the education sector. As a result, many children of school age will continue to be denied an 
education for a long time to come, jeopardizing their and the country&#8217;s future.  
58. To the average Congolese, the right to housing, food, a decent standard of living, indeed 
the full gamut of economic, social and cultural rights, are still a distant reality. At the first 
national forum on employment held in Kinshasa on 18-22 September 2007, it was revealed that 
less than 20 per cent of the working age population, estimated at 22 million, worked in the 
formal sector and that there was no real social security system. The protracted strikes by public </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/25 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>employees, including teachers, nurses, doctors and civil servants, which dragged on through 
most of 2007, testify to the precariousness of pay conditions, which, coupled with the lack of any 
credit or housing policy, deny almost 80 per cent of the population any hope of decent housing. 
That insecurity also explains the general climate of corruption and the poor functioning of public 
services.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  THE SITUATION OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS 
</b></p>
<p>59. According to a study on the humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo which was published in July 2007 by the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, there are 
currently approximately 6 million internally displaced persons, mostly from vulnerable groups 
such as children, women, and older persons, throughout the country. In the region of Petit Nord 
alone (Goma, Masisi, Rutshuru, Lubero and Kalehe), between December 2006 and 
December 2007, a total of 437,796 internally displaced persons from 93,384 households were 
identified. Those figures were provided by the Commission on Population Movements in 
North Kivu, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the 
World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), Solidarit&#233;s, 
Caritas and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  
</p>
<p>60. The situation is particularly alarming in the east of the country where clashes between 
FARDC and armed groups have led to massive new movements of populations living without 
resources and in complete insecurity (lacking medicine, health care, shelter, drinking water and 
food assistance). The number of internally displaced persons continues to grow because of the 
climate of insecurity in the provinces of North and South Kivu.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  THE GOMA CONFERENCE 
</b></p>
<p>61. A conference on peace, security and development in the provinces of North and 
South Kivu, sponsored by President Joseph Kabila, was held in Goma, the capital of North Kivu 
Province from 6 to 24 January 2008. The overall objectives of the conference were to put an end 
to war and insecurity in the provinces of North and South Kivu and to lay the foundations for a 
lasting peace and the full development of North and South Kivu. More than 1,000 individuals 
participated in the conference, including representatives from all the communities in those 
provinces, representatives of armed groups, members of the national and provincial parliaments 
who come from the two provinces and representatives of civil society and the international 
community.  
</p>
<p>62. On 23 January 2008, following two weeks of discussions, all the armed groups operating 
in the two provinces signed a peace agreement in the presence of the Head of State. The 
agreement provides for: a full and immediate cessation of hostilities throughout North and 
South Kivu; disengagement of the soldiers of the armed groups; the creation of demilitarized 
zones for the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC); &#8220;brassage&#8221;<footnote name="*">Reintegration and retraining of ex-combatants into one new national army. </footnote>; 
integration; and the implementation of the national programme for disarmament, demobilization 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/25 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>and reintegration; strict observance of the rules of international humanitarian law and human 
rights; return of refugees and internally displaced persons; and political and judicial guarantees, 
including the submission to Parliament by the Government of a draft amnesty law for acts of war 
and insurrection, and the establishment, by presidential decree, of a technical commission to 
finalize the disengagement plan and issues relating to ranks, integration and training of 
demobilized soldiers.  
</p>
<p>63. The independent expert commends the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo for that initiative and expects strict implementation of the commitments undertaken by all 
the signatories. The independent expert hopes that the conference will have helped lay the 
foundations for a lasting peace in that region of the country. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>With regard to the consolidation of peace, the independent expert recommends that 
all stakeholders in the national and political life of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
should: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Implement the peace agreement signed in Goma following the Conference on 
Peace, Security and Development in the Provinces of North and South Kivu; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Take fair and transparent measures to impose and consolidate the State&#8217;s 
authority over the entire territory and foster rapprochement among the political actors; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Continue to promote among the population a culture of peace, tolerance, 
reconciliation, forgiveness, fraternity, peaceful coexistence, integration and national unity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Recognize the need for all political actors and the media to foster a culture of 
dialogue, to reject violence and ethnic hatred, to accept democracy and the verdict of the 
ballot box, and to seek remedies, when necessary, through the law. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>With regard to the administration of justice and the fight against impunity, the 
independent expert reiterates his recommendations that the Government should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Implement an effective policy for the elimination of human rights violations and 
for the systematic prosecution and punishment of those responsible for human rights 
violations as well as of any political and military actors guilty of interference in, or 
obstruction of, the administration of justice; 
 (b) Ensure an exemplary and successful conclusion, as soon as possible, to 
outstanding cases and proceedings before the trial or appeal courts, with full respect for 
international due process norms;</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(c) Support the &#8220;Mapping Team&#8221; of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in its work of drawing up an objective map 
of the serious human rights violations committed between 1993 and 2003; </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/25

</p>
<p><b> (d) Implement a vetting procedure for the security forces with a view to ensuring 
that senior officers accused of having committed serious human rights violations are 
immediately suspended from their duties and replaced; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Put an end to the practice whereby military courts exercise jurisdiction over 
civilians and amend military criminal law to bring it into line with the Constitution and 
applicable international norms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Respect in practice and in all circumstances the independence of the judiciary, 
in particular by refraining from making amendments to the Constitution that tend to blur 
the dividing line between the powers of the executive and the judiciary; 
 (g) Increase substantially the allocations in the State budget for the justice sector; 
 (h) Take all necessary measures to guarantee the effective protection of victims, 
witnesses, human rights defenders and representatives of the media, who play an essential 
role in combating impunity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Establish an expert group to devise an appropriate timetable for the 
disbursement of unpaid compensation and to develop creative solutions, whether symbolic, 
collective or low-cost, to compensate victims (exemption from school enrolment fees, 
support for income-generating activities, etc.); 
 (j) Expedite the adoption of laws essential for the administration of justice, in 
particular the framework law on the three new high courts, a law implementing the 
Rome Statute and a law establishing a national human rights commission. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>With regard to sexual violence, the independent expert reiterates his recommendation 
that the Government should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Remind all judicial personnel of the provisions of the acts of 2006, for example 
by circulating a memorandum on that subject; 
 (b) Facilitate the taking of evidence in cases of sexual violence by supporting the 
adoption and distribution of a standard medical certificate that could serve as evidence in 
trials; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Increase the number of women and the level of specialization in the judiciary, 
by training designated specialized teams at each level of the judiciary, the police and the 
courts; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Promote victims&#8217; access to justice by exempting victims of sexual violence and, 
ultimately, all victims of serious offences committed by State agents, from payment of legal 
costs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Take responsibility for sexual violence committed by State agents by giving 
priority to compensation for victims who sued for damages in major trials such as the 
Songo Mboyo trial and by providing substantial funding for compensation of victims in the 
next budget law; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/25 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p><b> (f) Promote nationwide, in cooperation with Parliament, the signing of agreements 
similar to those signed in South Kivu and Kasai, Orientale Province, as evidence of a 
commitment to combating impunity for the perpetrators of sexual violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Consider appointing investigating judges in each prosecutor&#8217;s office in the
