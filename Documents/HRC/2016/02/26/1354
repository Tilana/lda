<p><i>Reiterating</i> the grave concerns expressed by the General Assembly in its resolutions 
66/164 and 68/181 and by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 22/6 with regard to 
the serious risks faced by human rights defenders due to threats, attacks, reprisals and acts 
of intimidation against them, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that States are under the obligation to protect all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all persons,  
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that respect and support for the activities of human rights defenders, 
including women human rights defenders, is essential to the overall enjoyment of human 
rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful </i>that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should 
facilitate the work of human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization, 
stigmatization, impediments, obstructions or restrictions thereof contrary to international 
human rights law, 
</p>
<p><i> Underscoring </i>that the legal framework within which human rights defenders work 
peacefully to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms is that of 
national legislation consistent with the Charter and international human rights law,  
</p>
<p><i> Gravely concerned </i>that, in some instances, national security and counter-terrorism 
legislation and other measures, such as laws regulating civil society organizations, have 
been misused to target human rights defenders or have hindered their work and endangered 
their safety in a manner contrary to international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the urgent need to address, and to take concrete steps to prevent and 
stop, the use of legislation to hinder or limit unduly the ability of human rights defenders to 
exercise their work, including by reviewing and, where necessary, amending relevant 
legislation and its implementation in order to ensure compliance with international human 
rights law,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work and takes note with appreciation of the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders,1 and strongly urges all 
States to take concrete steps to create, in law and in practice, a safe and enabling 
environment in which human rights defenders can operate free from hindrance and 
insecurity; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders for a period of three years in the same terms as provided for by the 
Human Rights Council in its resolution 16/5;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges</i> all States to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the 
performance of his/her tasks, to provide all information and to respond to the 
communications transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur without undue delay; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls upon</i> States to give serious consideration to responding favourably to 
the requests of the Special Rapporteur to visit their countries, and urges them to enter into a 
constructive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur with respect to the follow-up to and 
implementation of his/her recommendations so as to enable him/her to fulfil his/her 
mandate even more effectively;

their mandates, to provide all possible assistance and support to the Special Rapporteur for 
the effective fulfilment of his/her mandate, including in the context of country visits and 
through suggestions on ways and means of ensuring the protection of human rights 
defenders;
