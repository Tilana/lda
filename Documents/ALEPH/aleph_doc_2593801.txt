Devon Energy Announces Early Tender Results and Upsizing of Maximum Tender Offers
OKLAHOMA CITY—(BUSINESS WIRE)—Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN) (the “Company” or “Devon Energy”) today
announced the early tender results for its previously announced tender offers (the “Maximum Tender Offers”) to purchase for cash
up to an aggregate principal amount of the debt securities listed in the table below (collectively, the “Notes”) that would not result
in the aggregate amount that all holders of the Notes are entitled to receive, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, for their
Notes that are validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the Maximum Tender Offers, exceeding the Aggregate Maximum
Repurchase Amount (as defined below). In addition, the Company has amended the Maximum Tender Offers to increase the
previously announced Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount from approximately $535.4 million (which gives effect to the
Company’s purchase of certain of the 8.250% notes due 2018, issued by Devon OEI Operating, L.L.C., and the 6.300% notes
due 2019, issued by the Company, for total consideration of approximately $664.6 million in the Company’s previously
consummated tender offers for such notes) to such aggregate amount necessary to pay the Total Consideration (as defined
below) for all of the 2.250% notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Maximum
Tender Offers as of the Early Tender Date (as defined below) (as amended, the “Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount”). All
other terms of the Maximum Tender Offers, as previously announced, remain unchanged. The Maximum Tender Offers were
made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated August 4, 2016, and the related letter of
transmittal (the “Tender Offer Documents”).
As of the previously announced early tender date and time of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 17, 2016 (the “Early
Tender Date”), according to information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the tender and information agent for the Maximum
Tender Offers, a total of $639,548,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes, which have the highest acceptance priority
level, had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Maximum Tender Offers. Since the Total Consideration payable
with respect to such 2018 Notes will equal the Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount, none of the tendered Notes from any
other series will be accepted for purchase pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offers. Withdrawal rights for the Notes expired at
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 17, 2016. The table below sets forth the aggregate principal amount and percentage of
the 2018 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by the Early Tender Date that will be accepted for purchase by the
Company.

(b) The Total Consideration for the 2018 Notes validly tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase
will be calculated on the basis of pricing for the U.S. Treasury Reference Security as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on
August 18, 2016, and will be inclusive of the Early Tender Payment set forth in the table above.

(f) Notes from such series will not be accepted for purchase by the Company.
The “Total Consideration” for the 2018 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Maximum Tender
Offers will be determined in the manner described in the Tender Offer Documents at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on
August 18, 2016. Holders of the 2018 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date are
eligible to receive the Total Consideration for any such 2018 Notes accepted for purchase. Holders will also receive accrued and
unpaid interest on the 2018 Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the last interest payment date up to, but not
including, the date the Company makes payment for such 2018 Notes, which date is anticipated to be August 19, 2016.
The Maximum Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on August 31, 2016, unless extended or earlier
terminated. Because the Maximum Tender Offers have been fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, holders who tender
Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any of their Notes accepted for purchase. Any Notes tendered after the Early
Tender Date, together with all Notes (other than the 2018 Notes) tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date, will be returned to
the holders thereof as described in the Tender Offer Documents.
Devon Energy will fund the Maximum Tender Offers with the net proceeds from previously completed asset sales and financing
transactions. The Maximum Tender Offers are being made to reduce the Company’s outstanding debt, including the debt of its
subsidiaries.
