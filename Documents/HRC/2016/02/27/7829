<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 48/141, the General Assembly set out the mandate of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and decided that one of the responsibilities 
of the High Commissioner would be &#8220;to promote and protect the realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>development and to enhance support from relevant bodies of the United Nations system for 
this purpose&#8221;. The same resolution also stipulated that the High Commissioner should 
&#8220;recognize the importance of promoting a balanced and sustainable development for all 
</p>
<p>people and of ensuring realization of the right to development, as established in the 
Declaration on the Right to Development&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 67/171, the General Assembly reaffirmed its &#8220;request to the High 
Commissioner, in mainstreaming the right to development, to undertake effectively 
activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership for development among Member 
States, development agencies and the international development, financial and trade 
institutions and to reflect those activities in detail in her next report to the Human Rights 
Council&#8221;. In the same resolution, the General Assembly called upon &#8220;the United Nations 
funds and programmes, as well as the specialized agencies, to mainstream the right to 
development in their operational programmes and objectives&#8221;, and stressed &#8220;the need for 
the international financial and multilateral trading systems to mainstream the right to 
development in their policies and objectives&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 21/32, encouraged &#8220;the High 
Commissioner to pursue her efforts, in fulfilment of her mandated responsibility, to 
enhance support for the promotion and protection of the realization of the right to 
development, taking as reference the Declaration on the Right to Development, all 
resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human 
Rights Council on the right to development, and agreed conclusions and recommendations 
of the Working Group [on the Right to Development]&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>4. In the same resolution, the Human Rights Council requested &#8220;the Office of the High 
Commissioner to continue to submit to the Council an annual report on its activities, 
including on inter-agency coordination within the United Nations system with regard to the 
promotion and realization of the right to development&#8221;. Similarly, the General Assembly, in 
</p>
<p>its resolution 67/171, requested the Secretary-General &#8220;to submit a report to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and an interim report to the Council on the 
implementation of the present resolution, including efforts made at the national, regional 
and international levels in the promotion and realization of the right to development&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>5. The present report is submitted in accordance with the above-mentioned requests 
and provides information on the activities undertaken by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and United Nations human rights 
mechanisms during the period from July 2012 to May 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>6. The framework and strategy of the programme of OHCHR on the promotion and 
realization of the right to development is explained in the previous consolidated report of 
the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 
right to development (A/HRC/21/28, paras. 5 and 6). </p>


<p><b> A. Advocacy, outreach and communications 
</b></p>
<p>7. Enhanced awareness, knowledge and understanding of the right to development at 
all levels constitute one of the objectives of the OHCHR Strategic Framework (A/67/461, 
pp. 7&#8211;8). To this end, OHCHR participated in and provided substantive input and 
contributions to a number of initiatives, events and activities during this period.  
</p>
<p>8. They included a side event at the twentieth session of the Human Rights Council 
held in June 2012 on the role of non-governmental organizations in development. OHCHR 
highlighted the role of civil society in development and the role of free, active and 
meaningful participation. OHCHR participated in a side event at the twenty-first session of 
the Council held in September 2012 on the theme &#8220;International solidarity: from concept to 
action&#8221; with the participation of the Independent Expert on human rights and international 
solidarity, Virginia Dandan. OHCHR addressed the relationship between the right to 
development and international solidarity highlighting the duty to cooperate as an essential 
component of the right to development and for strengthening the global partnership for 
development.  
</p>
<p>9. In December 2012, OHCHR briefed representatives of the Arab NGO Network for 
Development. OHCHR participated in a conference on the theme &#8220;The South in the Global 
Economic Crisis and Reviewing Multilateral Negotiations&#8221; organized in January&#8211;February 
2013 by the South Centre. OHCHR drew attention to the impact of investment agreements 
on the right to development. OHCHR participated in the Sixth Joint Annual Meeting of the 
African Union Conference of Ministers of Economy and Finance and the Economic 
Commission for Africa Conference of African Ministers of Finance, Planning and 
Economic Development, held in March 2013. The OHCHR intervention focused on the 
right to development in the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>10. In January 2013, OHCHR participated in the first session of the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Multi-year Expert Meeting on 
Investment, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Productive Capacity-building and 
Sustainable Development, the theme of which was regional integration and foreign direct 
investment in developing and transition economies. OHCHR focused in particular on the 
impact of bilateral and international investment agreements on the enjoyment of human 
rights. Building on the Declaration on the Right to Development, OHCHR recommended 
that investment agreements should be negotiated transparently and with the participation of 
all potentially affected parties. In this regard, human rights impact assessments should be 
conducted before approving an agreement and continue throughout its implementation. 
Specific measures should be taken to mitigate any negative human rights impacts of the 
agreement. Investment agreements should provide sufficient human rights policy space for 
States to perform their protective and regulatory functions. This means that investment 
agreements should not protect investor&#8217;s rights at the expense of the State&#8217;s ability and 
obligation to protect human rights. International investment agreements should promote the 
accountability of investors as well as of States. The recently issued Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights offer useful direction in this area. Finally, international 
investment agreements should not permit opaque dispute settlement procedures. Instead, 
dispute settlement should be transparent, participatory and fully compliant with the rule of 
law and principles of due process. 
</p>
<p>11. With a view to strengthening the global partnership for development, OHCHR, as a 
member of the working group on the global partnership for development beyond 2015 of 
the United Nations System Task Team on the Post-2015 United Nations Development 
Agenda, advocated for integrating the right to development into policy documents and 
recommendations.   </p>


<p>12. OHCHR plans to launch in 2013 a publication entitled, <i>Realizing the Right to 
Development: Essays in commemoration of 25 years of the United Nations Declaration on 
</i></p>
<p><i>the Right to Development</i>. This publication presents for the first time a wide range of in-
depth analytical studies by more than 30 international experts covering the context, 
meaning and application of this right and its potential to shape human rights and 
development policy and practice. Together the experts support the concept of an enabling 
environment for development that would ensure freedom from want and freedom from fear 
for all people. The contributions to this publication illustrate the far-reaching potential of 
the right to development and its relevance more than 25 years after the adoption of the 
Declaration. They make the case for reinvigorating attention given to this right in order to 
realize its added value to advancing human rights, development and peace and security in 
an increasingly interdependent, fragile and changing world, including in the post-2015 
agenda for sustainable development. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Events and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>1.</b><i> <b></b></i><b>Support to relevant Human Rights Council mandate mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>13. In April 2013, OHCHR provided Secretariat support in the organization of the 
informal intersessional meeting of the Working Group on the Right to Development and of 
the fourteenth annual session of the Working Group which took place from 13 to 17 May 
</p><p>2013. At this session, the Working Group completed the first reading of the draft right to 
development operational sub-criteria under attribute 1. The Working Group recommended, 
inter alia, continuing, at its fifteenth session, its work on the consideration of the draft 
operational sub-criteria with the first reading of the remaining operational sub-criteria. 
</p>
<p>14.  The opening statement of the High Commissioner recalled the importance that the 
Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action placed on the right to development. It 
highlighted a number of fundamental challenges confronting the world: climate change, 
environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity impacted heavily on the human rights of 
present and future generations; rising inequalities still left vast numbers of people in abject 
poverty; demographic changes and the changing contours of geopolitical and economic 
relations, as well as multiple crises, placed new demands on governance at all levels and 
called for coherent and human rights-based policies. The Declaration on the Right to 
Development enshrined a comprehensive, human-centred development paradigm that 
aimed at the improvement of human well-being for all. It recognized that every human 
person was entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy a development process in 
which all human rights could be fully realized.1    
</p>
<p>15. From 1 to 3 October 2012, OHCHR organized the Social Forum of the Human 
Rights Council, which focused on people-centred development and globalization. Over the 
course of the Forum more than 35 experts and individuals participated in nine panel 
discussions and one round-table discussion which covered issues such as sustainable 
development, financing for development, social movements, women&#8217;s rights, democratic 
governance and participatory development. In a video message, Tawakkol Karman, 2011 
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, called on people to &#8220;make globalization into a positive 
</p>
<p>phenomenon that could benefit all people&#8221; and stated that &#8220;there is no peace without justice 
</p>
<p>and development&#8221;. The official proceedings of the Social Forum were supplemented by a 
full programme of side events which addressed such themes as youth advocacy, the 
solidarity economy and the participation of older persons in society. Discussions 
</p>
<p>

<p>emphasized the importance of participatory development and democratic governance, 
solidarity and democracy at all levels of society to promoting people-centred development. 
Participants made concrete proposals for the future development agenda, including 
recommendations for a financial transaction tax, financial regulatory reform and the 
elimination of tax havens, and more generally called for a holistic and rights-based 
approach to development.2  
</p>
<p>16. On 1 March 2013, OHCHR organized the second annual Human Rights Council 
high-level panel on human rights mainstreaming, with the participation of the Secretary-
General and other dignitaries. There has been significant progress at political level, with 
increased recognition of the importance of all human rights, including the right to 
development, in the outcomes of Rio+20 and the quadrennial comprehensive policy review 
(QCPR). The panel focused on the theme of post-2015 development agenda, with an 
emphasis on the right to education. OHCHR aims at ensuring that the next generation of 
international development agenda will be firmly grounded in international human rights 
standards and principles. The human rights framework can help to raise the level of 
accountability for the achievement of the development goals. For development to be truly 
effective and sustainable, all development actors need to embrace the principles embodied 
in the Declaration on the Right to Development, such as people-centred development, 
participation, non-discrimination and international cooperation.3  
</p>
<p>17. The High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the Human Rights Council panel 
discussion on the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human rights which 
OHCHR organized on 13 March 2013.4 Presentations were made by experts and 
representatives from the United Nations human rights machinery (Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights), national authority (Morocco), United Nations agencies (United 
Nations Development Programme, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), 
intergovernmental organizations (International Anti-Corruption Academy) as well as 
international and national civil society organizations (Transparency International, grass-
roots and women&#8217;s organizations from India and Nicaragua). The panel was well attended 
and heard some 30 statements from States and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
reflecting a consensus that corruption is an important obstacle to the realization of all 
human rights including the right to development and anti-corruption efforts would be most 
effective and sustainable when coupled with an approach that ensures respect for human 
rights and puts people at the centre.

<p><i> <b></b></i><b>2. Mainstreaming the right to development in the global partnership for development 
</b></p>
<p>18. In further mainstreaming the right to development and enhancing inter-agency 
coordination, OHCHR relies on the existing mechanisms, in particular the human rights

</p>
<p>on the enjoyment of human rights, A/HRC/23/26. </p>


<p>mainstreaming mechanism of the United Nations Development Group, the High-Level 
Committee on Programmes of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for 
Coordination and the human rights cluster of the Executive Committee on Economic and 
Social Affairs. For example, on 15 March 2013, the Deputy High Commissioner chaired a 
senior-level meeting of the mechanism. The meeting reviewed and approved the 
mechanism&#8217;s revised workplan for 2013&#8211;2014, which prioritizes the support to resident 
coordinators and United Nations country teams. The workplan was updated in the light of 
General Assembly resolution 67/226 on the QCPR of operational activities for development 
of the United Nations system and the new human rights commitments in the United Nations 
Development Group Strategic Priorities for 2014&#8211;2017. The QCPR recognizes the close 
linkages between the United Nations&#8217; normative and operational work, and the Strategic 
Priorities aim to improve United Nations support for the achievement of internationally 
agreed development goals and human rights treaty obligations. In May 2013, the Deputy 
High Commissioner chaired a policy retreat of the mechanism that looked at ways to 
strengthen inter-agency collaboration to support the integration of all human rights, 
including the right to development, in the United Nations development system and the post-
2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>19. In May 2013, OHCHR in cooperation with UNCTAD organized a side event during 
the fourteenth session of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on the Right 
to Development to discuss the UNCTAD Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable 
Development. The representative of UNCTAD explained the key characteristics of the 
framework, namely that it places sustainable development at the core, addresses all 
dimensions of investment policy and fosters interaction with relevant national and 
international policies. The framework also emphasizes the right to regulate and balance 
between investors&#8217; rights and obligations. Mr. Schrijver, member of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, pointed to several elements of human rights law that 
were relevant to international investment agreements, including the right to property, the 
right to self-determination and permanent sovereignty over natural resources and the social, 
cultural and participatory rights of individuals and groups. He underlined that investment 
regulation should be viewed in the context of the larger and increasingly normative 
international order. The representative of OHCHR underlined the correlation between 
several of the core principles of the framework and human rights principles contained in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, such as the emphasis placed on participation and the objective of promoting 
sustainable development.  
</p>
<p>20. On 6 March 2013, OHCHR organized a side event5 to the Human Rights Council on 
human rights considerations in national and international responses to financial crisis. 
Experts expressed concern at the negative impacts of austerity measures resulting in 
reduced government spending on social welfare programmes, public-sector layoffs and 
unemployment, growing risk of social unrest and increasing income and structural 
inequality which affected particularly the vulnerable and marginalized groups as well as 
women, who dominated certain public-sector and expert-manufacturing jobs. Bailing out 
the financial industry while imposing austerity and social cuts was tantamount to 
privatizing profits and socializing losses for banks. Calls were made for a shift in 
macroeconomic policies, a comprehensive and explicit human rights-based approach to the 
financial sector and the need for international cooperation in addressing the root causes of 
and responses to the financial crisis. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>April 2013. Available from www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/FinancialCrisis.aspx. </p>


<p>21. In April 2013, OHCHR, with support from the Center of Concern, organized an 
expert meeting in New York entitled &#8220;Rights in Crisis&#8221;. Participants from delegations, 
United Nations system organizations, development and economic institutions and 
academia, civil society organizations and NGOs discussed rights-based approaches to 
economic stabilization, recovery and growth.6 The objectives of the meeting were to: (a) 
promote accountability by clarifying the interrelationship between the enjoyment of human 
rights, including the right to development, and State policies related to issues such as 
macroeconomic crises and responses, government expenditures, financial sector 
development and regulatory frameworks; (b) examine the obstacles that the financial crisis 
and prevailing financial structures pose to the full enjoyment of all human rights including 
non-retrogression and the fulfilment of minimum core obligations with regards to 
economic, social and cultural rights; (c) solicit expert opinions on the causes of the global 
financial crisis and its impacts, particularly on women and marginalized groups; and (d) 
explore specific applications of a human rights framework to financial crisis prevention, 
response and recovery in order to develop guidelines for the mainstreaming of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>22. During the reporting period, OHCHR country offices provided substantive and 
technical assistance support to requesting Member States. For instance, in Uganda, 
OHCHR provided training and capacity-building support to the Uganda Human Rights 
Commission, civil society organizations and district authorities, including in such areas as 
monitoring and advocacy on economic, social and cultural rights, strengthening 
accountability and human rights awareness, and integration of a human rights-based 
approach in planning and budgeting. As a result, key human rights concerns have been 
reflected in several district plans and the participation of civil society in planning processes 
was strengthened. In addition, the Office provided comments to the National Planning 
Authority on the Vision 2040 launched by the President of Uganda in April 2013.  
</p>
<p>23. OHCHR participated in a side event to the fourteenth session of the Working Group 
on the Right to Development, organized by the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, entitled &#8220;Towards 
a Framework Convention on the Right to Development&#8221;. At the side event, a publication of 
Koen De Feyter with the same title was launched.7 Mr. De Feyter presented the idea of 
elaborating a framework convention as the best option for accommodating the concerns of 
the different political groups. The potential added value of a framework convention on the 
right to development was to complement the current human rights regime with a treaty that 
went beyond individual States&#8217; responsibility and took inspiration from principles derived 
from international development efforts, such as mutual accountability, alignment of policies 
among partner countries, and inclusive partnerships. The representative of OHCHR 
underlined the importance of human rights instruments to protection and the need to ensure 
that resources and support to those instruments was adequate.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities by United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>24. In July 2012, the Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and 
equitable international order sent four different questionnaires to Member States, 
intergovernmental organizations, national human rights institutions and civil society 
</p>
<p>  
 6  See OHCHR webpage &#8220;Human rights and the financial crisis&#8221;. Available from 
</p>

</p>

Geneva, 2013). </p>


<p>organizations. In the questionnaire sent to Member States, one of the questions specifically 
approached the right to development. It requested Member States to &#8220;describe the measures 
taken to contribute to the realization of Millennium Development Goal 8&#8221; and to what 
extent the respective Government had contributed to its achievement. Responses received 
will be reflected in the Independent Expert&#8217;s upcoming reports to the Human Rights 
Council and General Assembly. In October 2012, the Independent Expert participated in 
the Human Rights Council&#8217;s Social Forum on people-centred development and 
globalization and delivered a substantive paper on democratic governance and reform 
initiatives.  
</p>
<p>25. In September 2012, the Human Rights Council in resolution 21/11 adopted by 
consensus the guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights. The guiding 
principles deal in chapter VI with the obligations of international assistance and 
cooperation, highlighting inter alia the duty of States in a position to do so to provide 
international assistance to contribute to the fulfilment of human rights and poverty 
reduction as an element of the duty of international assistance and cooperation as well as 
the duty of States to take deliberate, specific and targeted steps, individually and jointly, to 
create an international enabling environment conducive to poverty reduction, including in 
matters relating to bilateral and multilateral trade, investment, taxation, finance, 
environmental protection and development cooperation. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights has emphasized the 
importance of participation in all her reports, including the conceptual framework outlined 
at the start of her mandate (then the independent expert on extreme poverty and human 
rights, A/63/274). The report examines the key human rights principles and standards that 
determine the content of the right to participation with regard to the poorest and most 
marginalized members of society. Drawing from these norms and standards, the report 
presents a human rights-based framework for meaningful, empowering participation and 
elucidates the necessary actions and enabling factors to support and enable such 
participation for people living in poverty. The Special Rapporteur has noted that, while the 
issue of participation of people living in poverty is a common theme in the literature of 
development and humanitarian aid, there has been little discussion of this topic from a 
human rights perspective.  
</p>
<p>27. In February 2013, the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on the Draft 
United Nations Declaration on the Right to Peace held its first session during which it 
considered the draft declaration on the right to peace prepared by the Advisory Committee. 
Article 9 of this draft document is devoted to the right to development and specifically links 
peace and security with development.8  
</p>
<p>28. In April 2013, a group of United Nations experts (extreme poverty, indigenous 
peoples, right to food and foreign debt) issued a press statement9 and called on the Word 
Bank to adopt human rights standards during the review of its environmental and social 
policies &#8211; also known as &#8220;safeguard policies&#8221; &#8211; which apply to project finance. The Special 
Rapporteur on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights underlined that the World Bank, as a development institution and a member 
of the United Nations family, and in line with the Declaration on the Right to Development, 
was obligated to ensure that its policies and activities did not undermine national

This requires that the Bank gives due weight to international human rights standards and 
related obligations of its member States. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>29.<b>  The year 2013 marks the twentieth anniversary of the World Conference on 
Human Rights in Vienna. The Conference adopted by consensus the Vienna 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration and Programme of Action which reaffirmed the right to development, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>established in the Declaration on the Right to Development, as a universal and 
</b></p>
<p><b>inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights. Three 
</b></p>
<p><b>overarching themes were at the heart of the World Conference: the universality of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights, the importance of democratic participation and the imperative of 
</b></p>
<p><b>development. 
</b></p>
<p>30.<b> The specific entitlement of the right to development is the right </b> &#8220;<b>to participate 
in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development</b>&#8221;<b><i>.</i> This 
</b></p>
<p><b>basic entitlement includes a number of constituent elements. Among them are: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) People-centred development: t</b>he Declaration identifies &#8220;the human 
</p>
<p>person&#8221; as the central subject, participant and beneficiary of development<b>;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) A human rights-based approach: the Declaration specifically requires 
</b></p>
<p>that development be carried out in a manner &#8220;in which all human rights and
