</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the International Commission of 
Inquiry to investigate all alleged violations of 
international human rights law in the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-15/1 of 25 February 2011, entitled 
&#8220;Situation of human rights in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya&#8221;, the President of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council established the International Commission of Inquiry, and appointed M. 
Cherif Bassiouni as the Chairperson of the Commission, and Asma Khader and Philippe 
Kirsch as the two other members. 
</p>
<p> In paragraph 11 of resolution S-15/1, the Human Rights Council requested the 
Commission to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law in the 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, to establish the facts and circumstances of such violations and of 
the crimes perpetrated and, where possible, to identify those responsible, to make 
recommendations, in particular, on accountability measures, all with a view to ensuring that 
those individuals responsible are held accountable. 
</p>
<p> The Commission decided to consider actions by all parties that might have 
constituted human rights violations throughout Libya. It also considered violations 
committed before, during and after the demonstrations witnessed in a number of cities in 
the country in February 2011. In the light of the armed conflict that developed in late 
February 2011 in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and continued during the Commission&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>operations, the Commission looked into both violations of international human rights law 
and relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, the <i>lex specialis</i> that applies 
during armed conflict. Furthermore, following the referral of the events in the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya by the Security Council to the International Criminal Court, the Commission 
also considered events in the light of international criminal law. 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p> The Commission established direct contact with the Government of the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya and the National Transitional Council, as well as with representatives of civil 
society and individuals throughout the country. It met with over 350 people during its field 
missions, including meetings with 113 people (doctors and other medical staff, patients and 
members of their families) in 10 hospitals, meeting with 30 people detained in two 
locations in the country (Tripoli and Benghazi) and meetings with 148 persons 
(individually or in groups) displaced either within the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya or in transit 
points or refugee camps outside it. 
</p>
<p> The Commission reviewed all allegations raised in connection with issues arising 
under its mandate. It studied a large number of reports, submissions and other 
documentation either researched of its own initiative or provided by others, amounting to 
more than 5,000 pages of documents, more than 580 videos and over 2,200 photographs.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate and methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 25 February 2011, the fifteenth special session of the Human Rights Council 
adopted resolution S-15/1 entitled &#8220;Situation of Human Rights in the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya&#8221; which inter alia, decided to dispatch an independent, international commission 
of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>2. Accordingly, on 15 March 2011, the President of the Human Rights Council 
established the International Commission of Inquiry and appointed its three members, 
M. Cherif Bassiouni (Egypt); Asma Khader (Jordan) and Philippe Kirsch (Canada). The 
President also designated M. Cherif Bassiouni as the Chairperson of the Commission. As 
requested by the Human Rights Council, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) established a secretariat to support the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>3. Paragraph 11 of resolution S-15/1 requested the Commission &#8220;to investigate all 
alleged violations of international human rights law in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, to 
establish the facts and circumstances of such violations and of the crimes perpetrated and, 
where possible, to identify those responsible, to make recommendations, in particular, on 
accountability measures, all with a view to ensuring that those individuals responsible are 
held accountable&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>4. Accordingly, the Commission determined that it was required to consider actions by 
all parties that might have constituted human rights violations throughout the territory of 
Libya. The Commission was also asked to consider the &#8220;facts and circumstances of such 
violations and of the crimes perpetrated&#8221;. Given the Security Council&#8223;s referral of events in 
Libya to the International Criminal Court, the Commission has also considered events in 
light of international criminal law.1 The Commission&#8223;s temporal mandate is not limited and 
therefore includes violations before, during and after the demonstrations witnessed in a 
number of cities in Libya in February 2011. With an armed conflict having developed in 
late February in Libya and continuing during the Commission&#8223;s operations, the 
Commission looked into both violations of international human rights law and relevant 
provisions of international humanitarian law, the <i>lex specialis</i> which applies during armed 
conflict.2 
</p>
<p>5. In view of the time frame within which it had to complete its work, the Commission 
necessarily had to be selective in the choice of issues and incidents for investigation. The 
report does not purport to be exhaustive in documenting the very high number of relevant 
incidents that occurred in the period covered by the Commission&#8223;s mandate. Nevertheless, 
the Commission considers that the report is illustrative of the main patterns of violations. 
</p>
<p>6. The Commission agreed at the outset that it would treat information it obtained on a 
confidential basis. In order to protect their safety and privacy, the names of the victims, 
witnesses and other sensitive sources are generally not explicitly referred to in the report 
unless explicitly agreed by the source and deemed appropriate by the Commission or the 
case has been otherwise well-publicized. It also decided to limit its contacts with the media 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Commission has used as its basis articles 6&#8211;8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
</p>
<p>Court. 
 2 See <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 2004</i>, p. 178, para. 106. </p>


<p>to providing factual information about its visits. On 9 April 2011, the Chairperson of the 
Commission, together with the two other members held a press conference in Geneva about 
its mandate and the planned visit to Libya. On 3 May 2011, the Commission issued a press 
statement informing about its field missions. 
</p>
<p>7. The Commission endeavoured to establish direct contact with the Government of the 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the National Transitional Council (NTC) as well as 
representatives of civil society and individuals throughout the country. The Commission 
gathered first-hand information with regard to the situation in Libya by conducting 
interviews with victims, community representatives, local authorities, members of non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and experts, Government officials and United Nations 
officials during its meetings in Geneva, Libya, Egypt and Tunisia. In Libya, the 
Commission and/or members of the Secretariat visited Benghazi, Al-Bayda, Tobruk, 
Tripoli and Az-Zawiyah; in Egypt, Cairo, Marsa Matruh and As-Sallum; and, in Tunisia, 
Tunis, Djerba, Ras Adjir, Sfax, Sousse, Tataouine and Zarzis. Details of its programme can 
be found in annex I. The Commission is grateful for all the assistance provided in 
connection with its work, in particular by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs, United Nations Children&#8223;s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development 
</p>
<p>Programme, United Nations Department of Safety and Security, Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Food Programme, and 
OHCHR staff for facilitation of the Commission&#8223;s field missions. 
</p>
<p>8. The Commission adopted an inclusive approach to receiving information and views 
on matters within its mandate during both its field missions and other investigations. 
Particular information-gathering methods have included: 
</p>
<p>(a) Interviews with victims, witnesses and other persons having relevant 
information. The Commission met with over 350 persons during its field missions. The 
interviews were conducted in person by members of the Commission and/or members of 
the Secretariat. In one case, the Commission was unable to conduct the meeting in person, 
but an interview took place by telephone.3 These included meetings with: 
</p>
<p>(i) 113 persons (doctors and other medical staff, patients and members of their 
families) in 10 hospitals (three in Cairo, one in Alexandria, two in Benghazi, one in 
Tataouine, two in Sfax and one in Sousse); 
</p>
<p>(ii) 30 persons detained at two locations in Libya (Tripoli and Benghazi); 
</p>
<p>(iii) 148 persons (individually or in groups) displaced either within Libya or in 
transit points or refugee camps outside Libya (one in Benghazi, one at Ramada, 
three at Ras Ajdir and one in As-Sallum); 
</p>
<p>(b) Meetings with a number of Government officials of Libya, Egypt and 
Tunisia, as well as representatives of NTC and officials of the United Nations including the 
Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Libya, Abdelilah al-Khatib; 
</p>
<p>(c) Site visits to specific locations where incidents had occurred. In this respect, 
the Commission was able to visit some sites in Benghazi and Tripoli, though its access was 
limited due to the ongoing armed conflict; 
</p>
<p>(d) Analysis of video and photographic images gathered by the Commission 
throughout the reporting period; 
</p>
<p>  
 3 This case was that of Iman al-Obeidi whose account of being raped has been widely publicized. A 
</p>
<p>Commission member also met with members of her family. During its visit to Tripoli, the 
Commission raised concerns about Ms. Al-Obeidi and requested she be given permission to leave the 
country. Ms. Al-Obeidi subsequently was able to leave Libya in early May 2011. </p>


<p>(e) Review of hospital and medical reports about injuries to victims and other 
relevant information such as death certificates and forensic reports; 
</p>
<p>(f) Meetings with a variety of interlocutors, including members of the diplomatic 
community, representatives of the parties concerned, NGOs, professional associations; 
military analysts, medical doctors and legal experts during its field mission and its other 
investigations; 
</p>
<p>(g) The review of reports of international organizations, including the United 
Nations; reports and other documentation produced by non-governmental and civil society 
organizations; media reports; and writings of academics and analysts on the conflict;4 
</p>
<p>(h) Invitations, through notes verbales to Member States of the United Nations5 
and United Nations agencies, departments and bodies and to regional organizations to 
provide information relating to the Commission&#8223;s investigations; 
</p>
<p>(i) The wide circulation of a public call for written submissions from NGOs and 
other organizations and individuals interested in bringing information to the attention of the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>9. The Commission reviewed all allegations raised in connection with issues arising 
under its mandate. It studied a large number of reports, submissions and other 
documentation either researched of its own motion or provided by others, amounting to 
more than 5,000 pages of documents, over 580 videos and over 2,200 photographs. The 
Commission&#8223;s records, including records of interviews, have been maintained and will be 
handed over to OHCHR at the end of its functioning, in accordance with established rules 
and procedures. 
</p>
<p>10. In establishing its findings, the Commission sought to rely primarily and whenever 
possible on information it gathered first-hand. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Challenges faced by the Commission 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Commission faced significant challenges in carrying out its mandate in the short 
period preceding this report: 
</p>
<p>(a) The Commission was given a broad mandate with a very tight deadline 
requiring it and the Secretariat to work intensively and under great time pressure. The 
President of the Human Rights Council appointed the three members of the Commission on 
15 March 2011 with a mandate to report back at the seventeenth session of the Council and 
to submit the report by 30 May 2011, allowing for a period of investigation of 
approximately two months; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Commission faced significant security considerations and logistical and 
administrative hurdles in arranging at very short notice visits to Benghazi and Tripoli; 
</p>
<p>(c) The Commission was not able to visit sites where the conflict was ongoing, 
such as Misrata and Ajdabiya, and other locations where incidents were reported. Security 
considerations limited the Commission&#8223;s ability to enjoy access to persons and places; 
</p>
<p>(d) The ongoing armed conflict and the particularly repressive conditions in 
certain areas significantly contributed to an atmosphere in which many victims and 
</p>
<p>  
 4 A list of Members States and organizations that submitted information to the Commission is 
</p>
<p>contained in annex III. 
 5 Eight Member States submitted information to the Commission of Inquiry in response to its note 
</p>
<p>verbale dated 3 May 2011. </p>


<p>prospective witnesses feared or may have feared speaking of their experiences given the 
ongoing risk to them or to their families. The Commission was also mindful of the need to 
avoid taking any actions which would endanger victims and witnesses. Furthermore, 
damage to systems of communication meant that it was difficult for the Commission to 
engage in extensive verification or follow-up of some of the information received; 
</p>
<p>(e) Given the ongoing nature of the conflict, violations have continued to be 
reported during the Commission&#8223;s operation leading to a massive increase in potential 
violations to be investigated. 
</p>
<p>12. Given all these circumstances, the Commission is of the view that more time is 
necessary to carry out further investigation within Libya for a comprehensive inquiry, 
followed by appropriate time for analysis and the writing of additional reports. 
</p>
<p>13. Notwithstanding these constraints, the Commission considers that it has been able to 
gather a substantial body of material with respect to violations of international human 
rights, humanitarian and criminal law that have occurred. Further investigation is critical in 
relation to fulfilling the mandate with respect to fully exploring the scope of the violations, 
identifying those with responsibility for the violations and crimes and making appropriate 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with Governments and other institutions 
</b></p>
<p>14.<b> </b>Through letters dated 21 March and 1, 9, 17 and 21 April, the Commission sought 
the cooperation of the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, requesting a visit to 
Tripoli and Az-Zawiyah. Furthermore, through letters dated 26 April, 5 May and 19 May, 
the Commission also requested the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to provide 
specific information and calling for the release of 18 detained journalists and a number of 
detainees with whom it met while in Tripoli. The Commission received a response from the 
Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on 25 May which contained details with 
respect to two of the journalists, but regrets that the Government of the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya did not respond with information on the whereabouts of the other individuals 
concerned. It notes nevertheless that of those 18 journalists, 4 have since been released. The 
Commission also regrets that the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya failed to 
inform it that one of the journalist included in the list was already dead at the time the 
Commission was inquiring about his fate. 
</p>
<p>15. By letter dated 9 April 2011, the Commission sought the cooperation of NTC, with 
respect to a visit to Benghazi, Al-Bayda and Tobruk. In a letter dated 18 May, it also asked 
further information on specific issues related to its mandate. The Commission is grateful for 
the responses received with respect to both letters. 
</p>
<p>16. The Commission also sought and obtained the cooperation of the Egyptian and 
Tunisian authorities in arranging field visits in their countries. 
</p>
<p>17. The Commission also wrote to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on 
18 May asking for information relating to its operations in Libya. To date, no response has 
been received from NATO. 
</p>
<p>18. The Commission has consulted with the Office of the Prosecutor of the International 
Criminal Court, whose office has been investigating alleged international crimes committed 
in Libya since 15 February 2011. Throughout this liaison, the Commission and the 
International Criminal Court have been committed to respecting appropriate confidentiality 
and independence requirements of each body. </p>


<p><b> D. Acknowledgments 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Commission is grateful to the numerous Libyans and other foreign nationals, 
especially victims and witnesses of violations, who have shared with it their stories and 
views. The Commission is also grateful to all the Member States, United Nations agencies, 
domestic and international NGOs that have supported its mandate and provided a vast 
amount of relevant and well-documented information. The Commission is appreciative of 
the dedicated work of the Secretariat to support its work. The Commission wishes to 
formally thank the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and representatives of NTC 
for their cooperation and readiness to accept the request for a visit. It also wishes to thank 
both the Egyptian and Tunisian authorities for facilitating the conduct of its programme at 
short notice. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The Commi</b>ssion&#8217;s findings of violations of international 
<b>human rights law and international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>20. In order to understand the current situation in Libya, it is important to place 
developments within the broader human rights context there. This includes the economic 
disparities and manner of governance and serious human rights issues. The Commission 
notes that a range of human rights concerns about Libya have been raised in international 
forums, in particular by United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special procedures 
mechanisms. The large number of documented enforced disappearances and cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has been noted by the Human Rights 
Committee in its concluding observations (CCPR/C/LBY/CO/4, para. 14), along with 
concerns expressed about the lack of information concerning effective investigation and 
redress. Unresolved cases of disappearance include those of Libyan opposition members 
Jaballa Hamed Matar and Izzat al-Megaryef (disappeared in 1990), and former Libyan 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Ambassador to the United Nations and later opposition 
figure Mansour Rashid El-Kikhia (disappeared in 1993). In 1978, Lebanese cleric Imam 
Musa Al-Sadr was also disappeared in Libya with two companions.6 The Human Rights 
Committee, in its concluding observations, also raised concerns regarding arbitrary arrest, 
the absence of judicial review of detention and the length of pretrial detention (para. 19) 
and the systematic use of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
(para. 15). Although torture is considered a crime under the Libyan Penal Code, the 
Committee against Torture, in its concluding observations, has been critical of the absence 
of prompt and impartial investigations into incidents of torture (A/54/44, paras. 176&#8211;189). 
</p>
<p>21. Freedom of speech and freedom to engage in public affairs have been significantly 
curtailed in law and in practice. Law No. 71/1972 prohibited the establishment of political 
parties and made associations undertaking &#8220;political activities&#8221; illegal. &#8220;Political activity&#8221; 
for this purpose is defined broadly to include any activity based on a political ideology 
</p>
<p>  
 6 The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has transmitted 14 cases to the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; of those, five cases have been clarified on the basis of 
information provided by sources, and nine remain outstanding (see A/HRC/13/31, para. 333). During 
its investigation, the Commission was also given information on the disappearances of many persons 
in the past, in particular from the Nafusa mountain region. </p>


<p>contrary to the principles of the Al-Fateh Revolution of 1 September 1969.7 As the Human 
Rights Committee has noted as a matter of concern in its concluding observations 
(CCPR/C/LBY/CO/4, para. 24), by virtue of this and article 206 of the Penal Code, the 
death penalty can still be imposed for the establishment of prohibited groups. Law No. 
20/1991 on enhancing freedom further significantly limits free speech by providing that 
&#8220;each citizen has the right to express his opinions and ideas openly in People&#8223;s Congresses 
and in all mass media, no citizen is questioned on the exercise of this right unless this has 
been abused in a way that prejudices the People&#8223;s Authority or is used for personal 
</p>
<p>interest&#8221;. The Committee has also expressed concerns about laws which prevent the 
exercise of the right to freedom of association and peaceful assembly (CCPR/C/LBY/CO/4, 
para. 25). 
</p>
<p>22. In relation to economic, social and cultural rights, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural rights noted with satisfaction in its concluding observations that Libya 
had the highest literacy and educational enrolment rates in North Africa and high rates of 
female students in schooling (E/C.12/LYB/CO/2, para. 6). The Committee on the Rights of 
the Child has also acknowledged in its concluding observations that education is free of 
charge, primary school attendance is nearly universal and health services are free for all 
children (CRC/C/15/Add.84, para. 4). The Committee in later concluding observations 
added, however, that many measures &#8220;reflect a predominantly welfare- rather than rights-
based approach&#8221; (CRC/C/15/Add.209, para. 7). The Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has also highlighted that, despite the country&#8223;s economic wealth, 28 per 
cent of the population did not have sustainable access to an improved water source 
(E/C.12/LYB/CO/2, para. 18). Several treaty bodies have raised concerns about the difficult 
situation of the Amazigh population, who are not recognized as a minority and are impeded 
from preserving and expressing their cultural and linguistic identity.8 
</p>
<p>23. In relation to women&#8223;s human rights, while there have been particular improvements 
(e.g. changes to nationality laws), Libyan society remains male-dominated, with gender-
based discrimination widespread. In addition to entrenched discriminatory norms within 
Libyan culture and stereotypes on women&#8223;s role in family and society (see concluding 
observations of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, CEDAW/C/LBY/CO/5, para. 21), the enforcement of 
laws itself displays discrimination. The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women regretted that legal provisions relating to personal status, in 
particular concerning marriage (including polygamy), divorce and inheritance, do not 
provide for equal rights for women and men (ibid., para. 17). 
</p>
<p>24. The Commission heard repeatedly during its investigation that some particular 
human rights violations in the past have had a deep psychosocial impact on the community. 
The first case relates to the extrajudicial killing of prisoners in Abu Salim prison in June 
</p><p>1996. Events began with a riot by prisoners calling for better conditions including access to 
health care, family visits and the right to have their cases heard before the courts. Libyan 
security officials headed by Abdullah al-Senusi and Nasr al-Mabrouk reached an agreement 
with representatives of the prisoners. The Commission was told by relatives of prisoners 
</p>

 7 See CCPR/C/LBY/CO/4, paras. 13 and 23. Amnesty International reported that in 2002, 86 persons 
</p>
<p>were prosecuted for their membership of the Muslim Brotherhood. In that case, 2 of the leaders were

<p>that, under the direction of Abdullah al-Senusi, some 1,272 persons were killed by 
machinegun fire by prison guards. Only many years later were family members informed of 
the deaths. One witness who spoke to the Commission indicated being notified only 10 
years after the events. In the intervening years, families of many victims had come on a 
weekly basis to the prison to bring food and clothing. The guards would accept the 
provisions, leaving relatives with the belief that their relatives were alive. In 2007, after 
receiving information from the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya that a 
commission was inquiring into the events at Abu Salim, the Human Rights Committee in 
its concluding observations expressed concern &#8220;that some eleven years after the event, the 
State party was unable to provide information on the status of the work of the Commission 
responsible for the inquiry into the events at Abu Salim prison in 1996&#8221; 
(CCPR/C/LBY/CO/4, para. 14). The second case reported to the Commission as having 
particular resonance related to the public hanging of university students accused of directly 
or indirectly opposing the regime at the university, with other students forced to watch. The 
Commission was told that one such hanging took place in Tripoli at the Faculty of 
Agriculture, Al-Fateh University,<b> </b>and another in Benghazi at the Faculty of Law, Ghar 
Yunis University, in 1985. 
</p>
<p>25. It is against this background of repression of rights that one has to assess the pent-up 
demand for democracy and the rule of law in early 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The events from February 2011 
</b></p>
<p>26. The events which prompted the convening of the fifteenth special session of the 
Human Rights Council and the subsequent establishment of the Commission began with 
mass demonstrations in Libya in February 2011, in which participants called for democratic 
reform and the toppling of the Qadhafi regime. Such uprisings seem to have been inspired 
in part by similar popular uprisings in neighbouring countries which had culminated in 
Tunisia with the resignation of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and in Egypt with the 
resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. The protestors claim that these demonstrations 
were peaceful. The Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has disputed this claim, a 
matter further examined by the Commission in chapter III, section A. The Government 
response to these demonstrations was to use significant force. This caused an escalation of 
the use of force until, by late February, a situation of civil war had developed in Libya. For 
present purposes, the major developments can be summarized as follows: Phase 1 
(demonstration phase) and Phase 2 (armed conflict). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Phase 1 
</b></p>
<p>27. Libyan authorities appear to have been keen to prevent mass demonstrations in 
Libya, taking steps such as arresting persons who called for such action.9 The arrest on 15 
February of Fathi Terbil, a well-known lawyer and human rights defender (who was 
representing many of the families of inmates killed in the Abu Salim prison)10 by Libyan 
internal security forces (<i>Jihaz al-Amn al-Dakhili</i>) sparked a mass protest in Benghazi. On 
16 February, protests spread to Al-Bayda, Al-Quba, Darnah and Tobruk. Authorities sought 
to scatter the protestors, utilizing various methods, including teargas and batons. Significant 
casualties were reported. Protests intensified on 17 February,<b> </b>the &#8220;Day of Rage&#8221;, 
commemorating the five-year anniversary since a Government crackdown on an Abu 
</p>
<p>  
 9 In addition to the arrest of Mr. Terbil, the Commission also notes some other high-profile arrests such 
</p>
<p>as of Jamal al Haji on 1 February 2011, and Farag, Al-Mahdi, Sadiq and Ali Hmeid in Tripoli on 16 
February 2011, all of whom had called for public demonstrations. 
</p>
<p> 10 As to the Abu Salim incident, see paragraph 24 of the present report. </p>


<p>Salim-related demonstration outside the Italian Embassy (these demonstrations were 
organized largely through social networks). The largest protest took place in Benghazi 
where thousands gathered in front of the courthouse, though protests were also held in a 
number of other towns including Al-Bayda, Tobruk, Tajurah, Tripoli, Misrata and Darnah. 
Security forces opened fire with live ammunition in several locations. 
</p>
<p>28. As news of these events spread, protests snowballed. Incidents of protestors being 
injured by Government forces were reported in Benghazi (in front of Al-Fadhil bin Omar 
<i>Katiba</i>), Ajdabiya and Al-Bayda (at the Al-Abraq airport) on 18 February, and Misrata on 
19 February amongst other locations. By this point, some demonstrators were taking more 
&#8220;offensive&#8221; action, including taking over the <i>Katiba</i> premises11 and the airport in Benghazi. 
Large-scale protests emerged in Tripoli on 20 February, leading to both Government use of 
significant force and protestors attacking Government buildings. In the following days, 
clashes intensified in Tripoli (for instance in the Green Square area). Media reported that 
security forces used fighter jets and live ammunition against protestors in the capital. The 
authorities disputed these reports, explaining that ammunition had been dumped in remote 
areas away from residential areas. Active fighting was also occurring in Az-Zawiyah,12 
Sabha and Sabratah. By 24 February, media reports indicated that protestors were in control 
of Tobruk, Benghazi, Misrata and Zuwarah.13 
</p>
<p>29. In the Government&#8223;s response to the Commission, the Government stated its 
position that the use of force had been necessary to counter attacks by the crowds. There 
appeared to be implicit threats in the language used, for instance, in the address by Saif al-
Islam Qadhafi (son of Colonel Qadhafi) on Libyan National Television on 21 February that 
&#8220;we will fight to the last man and woman and bullet&#8221;.14 Colonel Qadhafi on Libyan 
National Television on 22 February announced that he would lead &#8220;millions to purge Libya 
inch by inch, house by house, household by household, alley by alley, and individual by 
individual until I purify this land&#8221;. He blamed foreigners for the problems and called the 
protestors &#8220;rats&#8221; who needed to be executed. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Phase 2 
</b></p>
<p>30. By late February, an armed conflict had developed between armed opposition forces 
and Government forces.15 The armed conflict is continuing.<b> </b>Not all areas of the country 
have experienced the direct fighting. Battles have been focused on specific cities.16 In early 
March, Al-Brega and Ajdabiya were the particular focus of battles, with reports of aerial 
</p>
<p>  
 11 Al-Fadhil bin Omar <i>Katiba</i>. This is the major <i>Katiba</i> premises in Benghazi. 
 12 On 24 February 2011, there were reports of an attack by Government forces against a mosque in Az-
</p>
<p>Zawiyah where protestors were holding a sit-in.

Government also sought to allay unrest by proposing the release of 110 members of the Libyan 
Fighter Islamic Group. 
</p>
<p> 15 The legal significance of the development of an armed conflict is discussed in chapter II, section D, of 
the present report. 
</p>
<p> 16 Cities particularly affected include Ajdabiya, Al-Brega, Benghazi, Bin Jawad, Misrata, Ras Lanuf, 
Uqaylah and Az-Zawiyah. </p>


<p>bombing and Libyan forces sought to regain control of territory with fighting also 
continuing in Misrata. 
</p>
<p>31. On 2 March in Benghazi, NTC, led by Mustafa Abdul Jalil (the former Minister of 
Justice) was established by virtue of the Council issuing its first decree forming the Council 
and declaring itself to be the &#8220;sole representative of all Libya&#8221;. It has subsequently been 
recognized by France, Gambia, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Maldives and Qatar. 
</p>
<p>32. On 17 March, the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1973 (2011), 
establishing a no-fly zone over Libya and the taking of &#8220;all necessary measures&#8221; to protect 
civilians against Government forces. Airstrikes began on 19 March under initial leadership 
of the France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United 
States of America. NATO took control of the military operations on 31 March. 
</p>
<p>33. The conflict has already caused significant internal displacement and movement of 
persons into neighbouring countries.<b> </b>As of 20 May, some 814,022 persons were reported to 
have left Libya.17 Amongst this group, 322,26218 are estimated to be Libyan. A majority of 
those who have crossed borders are migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>34. <b>International statements and actions</b>: There has been a strong response from the 
international community in relation to the alleged violations of human rights occurring in 
Libya, with a particular focus on the protection of civilians. The Human Rights Council 
held a special session of the Human Rights Council on 25 February. On 26 February, the 
Security Council passed resolution 1970 (2011), imposing sanctions on the Qadhafi regime 
and referring the situation in Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the International Criminal Court 
before deciding on 17 March upon the imposition of the no-fly zone in resolution 1973 
(2011). The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was suspended from the Human Rights Council on 1 
March by General Assembly resolution 65/265. 
</p>
<p>35. On 6 March, former Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdelilah al-Khatib was appointed 
Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Libya. Statements of concern on various aspects 
of human rights and humanitarian law violations have been issued by a number of United 
Nations senior officials and mandate holders, including the Secretary-General,19 the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,20 the Chair of the Working Group on the 
Use of Mercenaries (speaking on behalf of all special procedure mandate holders at the 
fifteenth special session of the Human Rights Council),21 the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict,22 the Working Group on Enforced or 
</p>
<p>  
 17 Of these 402,981 persons have crossed into Tunisia, 286,515 into Egypt, 66,337 into Niger, 24,663 
</p>
<p>into Chad, 18,674 into Algeria and 2800 into Sudan. See OCHA, &#8220;Situation Report No. 38: Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya, Crisis&#8221;, 20 May 2011. Available from

significant numbers of persons fleeing from Libya. According to a communication received from the 
Italian Interior Ministry, dated 28 may 2011, 14,642 had arrived to Italy since the beginning of the 
Libyan crisis, mainly to the island of Lampedusa.

Violence in Conflict.26 The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on 16 May 
applied to the Pre-Trial Chamber of the International Criminal Court for arrest warrants for 
three named individuals, namely Colonel Qadhafi, Saif al-Islam Qadhafi and Abdullah al-
Senusi, for crimes against humanity in relation to events in February in Libya.27 
</p>
<p><b> C. Categories of security groups participating in the events 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>36. The security arrangements in Libya are complex with multiple entities empowered 
to use force, command structures difficult to ascertain and apparently little or no lateral 
command communication between the different security agencies. In short, the 
Commission has seen a number of different structures operating in different capacities at 
different times and at different places. The description below of the Government security 
forces is based on the Commission&#8223;s examination of the situation on the ground, secondary 
</p>
<p>sources and a number of interviews carried out with reliable sources during the 
Commission&#8223;s visits to Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. 
</p>
<p>37. <b>Government Armed Forces</b>:28<b> </b>The Libyan Armed Forces are comprised of the 
Army, the Air Force and the Navy. The Armed Forces are believed to be formally 
responsible for 61,500 active personnel.29 In recent years, it has reportedly been 
marginalized and not involved in internal security operations. Whilst there is a hierarchy 
within the army, other factors such as tribal membership and known loyalty to the 
Revolution are said to play an important role in the level of responsibility accorded to 
individuals within the Armed Forces.30<i> <b></b></i><b> 
</b></p>
<p>38. <b>The </b>Kata&#8217;eb play a much larger role in relation to internal security. Each <i>Katiba</i> has 
a name which has a political significance such as the name of its commander, for example, 
the Khamis <i>Katiba</i> is named after one of Colonel Qadhafi&#8223;s sons. Individual <i>Katiba</i> are said 
to number some 3,000 persons and be armed with heavy weaponry. Another named brigade 
is The Deterrence <i>Katiba</i> (<i>Liwaa al-Redah</i>) (stationed outside Tripoli). Membership in the 
Kata&#8217;eb is based on loyalty and family or tribal ties, with a division of personnel instituted 
so as to ensure loyalty by means of implicit threats to members of the family or tribe of any

<p>person who may be suspected of disloyalty. In general, it is difficult to ascertain how and 
why a given <i>Katiba</i> is organized and dissolved and under whose command it is at any given 
time. The Commission was informed by one witness that, before the February events, each 
<i>Katiba</i> was assigned to a particular area and given a specific responsibility.31 
</p>
<p>39. <b>The Revolutionary Committees</b> were set up in 1977 with a view to &#8220;safeguarding 
the Revolution&#8221;.32 Their members wear civilian clothes and are armed with small weapons 
(handguns and AK47&#8223;s). Sources to whom the Commission spoke estimated that the 
Revolutionary Committees have tens of thousands of members, possibly between 60,000 
and 100,000 members. According to information collected by the Commission, the 
Revolutionary Committees are tasked with police functions including the arrest of counter-
revolutionaries and the management of numerous detention centres in most cities and towns 
across the country. The Revolutionary Committees have been described as the &#8220;most 
important security organisations&#8221; and &#8220;remain[ing] the closest to Colonel Qadhafi 
himself.&#8221;33 
</p>
<p>40. <b>The Jamahiriya Security Organization</b> includes the Internal Security Agency 
(ISA) and the External (or Foreign) Security Agency (ESA). According to information 
provided to the Commission, ISA, under the leadership of Colonel Abdullah al-Senusi is 
tasked with monitoring anti-Qadhafi organizations, such as lawyers and doctors&#8223; unions and 
individuals to evaluate the extent of any threat to the regime.34 The Internal Security 
Agency reports directly to Colonel Qadhafi. ESA was formerly commanded by Musa Kusa 
(who defected from the regime in February).35 This agency reportedly planned, coordinated 
and provided support to military operations and terrorist activities abroad. External security 
dealt also with military intelligence and intelligence assessment overseas but was not 
usually directly involved in internal security affairs. While regular prisons fall under the 
authority of the General People&#8223;s Committee for Justice of the Ministry of Justice, it is ISA 
that has jurisdiction over the Abu Salim and Ain Zarah prisons.36 Members of both ISA and 
ESA wear civilian clothes and their vehicles are not marked with distinctive signs. 
</p>
<p>41. <b>Riot police force</b>: The Commission received reports concerning the involvement of 
a riot police<b> </b>force (<i>Quwat</i> <i>al-</i>Da&#8217;m al<i>-Markazi</i>) in suppressing demonstrations. Its 
command structure is unknown. Little is known either about the Public Security Agency 
(<i>Al-Amn Al-Am</i>). 
</p>
<p>42. <b>The Revolutionary Guard</b> is a structured political and paramilitary apparatus 
within the Armed Forces tasked with ensuring loyalty to the regime. Its members are 
believed to be the Revolutionary Committee members within the Armed Forces.37 
According to information provided to the Commission, the Revolutionary Guard (<i>Al-Haras 
</i></p>
<p>  
 31 The Commission was able to compile a list of Kata&#8217;eb with their geographic location and main 
</p>
<p>commanding officers.

 34 According to information received by the Commission, the ISA commander for the eastern region at 
</p>
<p>the time of the events in February was Senusi al-Wizri; and the commander for Tripoli, Brigadier 
General Tuhami Khaled. 
</p>
<p> 35 According to information received by the Commission, other officials as of February included the 
head of the Special Operations Unit, Abu Zayd Dorda.

<p><i>al-Thawri</i>) includes six brigades (the Special Forces Brigade, the Infantry Brigade, the 
Artillery Brigade and three tank brigades, all stationed on the outskirts of Tripoli). It is 
thought to be approximately 40,000 strong38 and &#8220;the real frontier protection force&#8221;.39 The 
force has access to battle tanks, armoured personnel carriers, helicopters and possibly 
antiaircraft artillery and guided weapons. A unit from the Guards, composed solely of 
female soldiers and known as the &#8220;Green Nuns&#8221; or &#8220;Revolutionary Nuns&#8221; serves as the 
</p>
<p>Colonel&#8223;s bodyguards. Members of the Revolutionary Guard are uniformed. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. An amorphous system 
</b></p>
<p>43. The structure, mandate and reporting lines of the country&#8223;s various security agencies 
described above, including the Kata&#8217;eb and the Revolutionary Committees remain unclear 
to outside observers. Transparency and accountability mechanisms are limited to an 
extreme. This amorphous system, in the Commission&#8223;s view, reflects a purposeful policy to 
obfuscate responsibility and minimize any threat to the central control of Colonel Qadhafi 
himself. The most important characteristic of these security organizations is that they are 
subject to neither institutional political control nor control by the public, but have been 
controlled exclusively by the Revolutionary Leadership led by Colonel Qadhafi. 
</p>
<p>44. All the information which the Commission received indicated that the agencies 
described above operate pursuant to direct orders of the Colonel. Lines of communication 
between the various security organizations are vertical and ultimately meet in the office of 
Colonel Qadhafi. Orders appear to be given by Colonel Qadhafi through satellite phone 
calls to commanders. It is also likely that some orders may have been issued by text 
message, but it is mostly personal communication based on voice recognition. This makes 
more difficult the task of tracing orders and commands. 
</p>
<p>45. Furthermore, according to information received by the Commission, some 
communications to security agencies may be given by code in public speeches. For 
example, before attacking Benghazi, Colonel Qadhafi said publicly: &#8220;I love you Benghazi&#8221;, 
which was interpreted by some who spoke to the Commission as meaning &#8220;I will come 
after you&#8221;. A former Libyan diplomat publicly stated on 23 February 2011, that Colonel 
Qadhafi&#8223;s speech of the night before (22 February) was a code for his forces to attack 
certain locations, including Az-Zawiyah, Sorman and Sabratah, which were subsequently 
attacked on 23 February.40 It has been contended that Colonel Qadhafi established a &#8220;one-
man rule&#8221; in which his officials &#8220;instantly promoted the Leader&#8223;s pronouncements to 
</p>
<p>dogma&#8221;.41 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The opposition armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>46. The forces on the opposition side of the armed conflict have formed recently and &#8211; 
at least according to information available to the Commission &#8211; do not appear to have the 
same level of organization as regular armed forces. Groups of supporters of the opposition 
came together in various cities and merged with defecting individual army soldiers and

<p>military units to form what is now variably known as the Free Libyan Army, the National 
Libyan Army or the rebels.42 Subsequently, volunteers from different cities, towns and 
villages in Libya joined the opposition forces. During its visit to eastern Libya, the 
Commission was able to observe young volunteers holding identity cards with barcodes. It 
was explained that the identity cards were distributed when the individuals were issued with 
a weapon. 
</p>
<p>47. Few details are available on the strength and organization of the opposition armed 
forces. Reports suggest the forces include &#8220;thousands of men&#8221; who are attending ad hoc 
training camps in 10 different locations in eastern Libya. Subsequent to this training, people 
are ready to be deployed in units of four or five to the frontline. Reports also suggest that a 
number of western countries are providing training to the troops. It has been reported that 
command structures within the armed opposition forces have been unclear. General Abdul 
Fatah Yunis, former Commander of an army special force and most recently Minister of 
Interior defected on 22 February 2011 and became the top field commander of the 
opposition forces, with General Khalifa Hufter becoming his deputy. A military council 
under NTC established on 5 March was set up to coordinate security matters, headed by 
Omar Hariri. International media has reported the creation of at least two brigades of 
opposition forces, the Omar al-Mukhtar Brigade in Ajdabiya and the Ali Hassan al-Jaber 
Brigade, named after the Al-Jazeera cameraman killed in March by forces loyal to Colonel 
Qadhafi. 
</p>
<p>48. According to information received by the Commission, the weapons and vehicles 
available to the opposition forces initially comprised equipment captured during battles 
with Government forces or taken from military posts and warehouses upon gaining control 
of such facilities, together with equipment belonging to the defecting military units. The 
opposition armed forces are also believed to be receiving equipment from foreign countries 
including uniforms and communication means. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. International forces 
</b></p>
<p>49. Following Security Council resolution 1973 (2011) authorising Member States and 
regional organisations to, enforce a no-fly zone and take &#8220;all necessary measures&#8221; to protect 
civilians in Libya, an initial coalition of States led by the France, the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America resorted to employ 
military means with a view to enforcing the resolution. According to NATO, as at 31 May, 
the coalition included the following countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, 
France, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Netherlands, Norway, Qatar, Romania, Spain, Sweden, 
Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States. On 31 March, NATO 
assumed full command of military operations against Libya. 
</p>
<p><b> D. International legal framework for the Commi</b>ssion&#8217;s <b>analyses 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal classification of the situation 
</b></p>
<p>50. The escalation of the situation in Libya has particular consequences in terms of the 
application of international law. In legal terms, the periods in this escalation can be 
demarked as: (a) peacetime; (b) non-international armed conflict; and (c) coexisting 
international armed conflict. For the purposes of the application of relevant legal standards, 
it is necessary to define more closely the relevant time periods involved. </p>
<p>  
 42 The term &#8220;rebels&#8221; is used by both NTC and its military commander, General Abdul Fatah Yunis to 
</p>
<p>refer to the totality of the opposition forces. It has also been used by some Government officials. </p>


<p>51. <b>Peacetime Libya</b>: Before the demonstrations began in mid-February, Libya could 
be classified as being in a normal state of peace. 
</p>
<p>52. <b>Non-international armed conflict</b>: The precise date for determining when this 
change from peace to non-international armed conflict occurred is somewhat difficult in the 
current circumstances. The Commission notes that other organizations that have been 
examining this question such as the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have not put forward a particular date.43 
</p>
<p>53. The Commission notes the definition of non-international armed conflicts in 
Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the 
Protection of Victims in Non-International Armed Conflict (Protocol II) (to which the 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a party), namely conflicts &#8220;which take place in the territory of a 
High Contracting Party between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other 
organized armed groups which, under responsible command, exercise such control over a 
part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military 
operations and to implement this Protocol&#8221;. The situation must constitute more than either 
isolated acts of violence or a mere internal disturbance or riot and involve protracted 
violence, engaging both the Government forces and an organized armed group. No 
definition of non-international armed conflict is provided for in the four Geneva 
conventions (which includes the provisions of common article 3). Jurisprudence has 
developed, however, defining non-international armed conflict as whenever there is 
&#8220;protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups 
or between such groups within a State&#8221;.44 
</p>
<p>54. In determining whether a non-international armed conflict exists, the Commission 
has thus had to consider the intensity of the conflict, the extent of relevant control of 
territory and the nature of the armed group in opposition to the Government. Examining the 
nature of the armed group involves considering such factors as whether there is a 
hierarchical command structure, the extent to which it is able to carry out organized 
operations (e.g. organizes into zones of responsibility, means of communication); discipline 
systems; the nature of logistical arrangements; and how the group presents itself (e.g. 
whether it is capable of involvement in negotiations). 
</p>
<p>55. Information on the intensity of the conflict and how the opposition forces have 
gained territorial control is more readily available than on many aspects of the organization 
of the armed opposition forces. On 19 February, Government opponents assumed control 
over the <i>Katiba</i> premises in Benghazi45 and took control of the airport there. On the same 
day in Tobruk, Government opponents took over Omar al-Mukhtar <i>Katiba</i> and confiscated 
weaponry. On 20 February, demonstrators controlled the town of Shahat, in the east of 
Libya and reportedly &#8220;arrested&#8221; persons fighting with the Qadhafi forces. By 24 February, 
anti-Government forces appear to have taken control of Tobruk and Misrata. On 26 
February, Security Council resolution 1970 (2011) welcomed various institutions&#8223; 
condemnation of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Libya 
</p>
<p>  
 43 The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in his report to the Security Council, for instance, 
</p>
<p>referred to there being an armed conflict in Libya &#8220;since the end of February&#8221;, see International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court, Office of the Prosecutor, &#8220;First Report of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal 
Court to the UN Security Council Pursuant to UNSCR 1970 (2011)&#8221; (2011), para. 37. Jakob 
Kellenberger, President of ICRC, stated on 10 March 2011 that a non-international armed conflict 
existed in Libya but without stipulating the commencement date. See ICRC, &#8220;Libya: urgent to apply 
</p>
<p>the rules of war&#8221; News Release 11/53, 10 March 2011. 
 44<i> Prosecutor v Tadic</i>, Jurisdiction Decision, ICTY (Appeals Chamber), Decision of 2 October 1995, 
</p>
<p>para. 70. A similar formulation was adopted in the Rome Statute (art. 8, para. 2 (f)). 
 45 This was the Al Fadhil bin Omar <i>Katiba</i> premises, the major such premise in Benghazi. </p>


<p>(preambular para. 3).46 While the Commission lacks full information concerning several 
aspects of the opposition forces&#8223; organization, it has reached the preliminary view that by or 
around 24 February, a sufficient non-international armed conflict had developed to trigger 
the application of Protocol II and common article 3 of the Geneva conventions. 
</p>
<p>56. <b>Coexisting international armed conflict</b>:<b> </b>The airstrikes to enforce the no-fly zone 
imposed by the Security Council through resolution 1973 (2011), which began on 19 
March, brought into being an international armed conflict between the States participating 
in this military action and the State of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. The Commission has 
noted that the objective of this international military action is to enforce Security Council 
resolution 1973 (2011). It is also satisfied that the actions of NATO and other foreign States 
involved are not exercising control over the military actions of either of the parties to the 
non-international armed conflict. As such, it concludes that the international armed conflict 
is legally separate to the continuing non-international armed conflict, and is thus a 
coexisting international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Bodies of applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>57. There are three major bodies of international law most relevant to the situation in 
Libya from February to the present: international human rights law, international 
humanitarian law and international criminal law. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) International human rights law 
</i></p>
<p>58. International human rights law continued to apply throughout the period being 
examined by the Commission, albeit with potential variation during the period of armed 
conflict.  
</p>
<p>59. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a party to major United Nations human rights 
treaties: the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of Child, the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
Crime of Genocide. It has also a ratified a number of related Optional Protocols, including 
most relevantly for the current context, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. The Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya is also a party to the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory 
Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity. At a regional level, the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya is a party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights and the 
Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa. As a State party to these treaties, the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya is bound to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the human rights of all 
persons within its jurisdiction. This includes the right to afford an effective remedy to those 
whose rights have been violated (including the provision of reparations) as well as the 
responsibility of the State to investigate and bring to justice perpetrators of particular 
violations.47 The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is also bound by relevant rules of international 
human rights law which form a part of customary international law. 
</p>
<p>  
 46 Note also Security Council press statement on Libya (SC/10180 AFR/2120), 22 February 2011, 
</p>
<p>which also speaks of international humanitarian law. 
 47 See Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 31 (2004) on the nature of the general legal 
</p>
<p>obligation imposed on State Parties to the Covenant, paras. 15&#8211;19. In this general comment, the 
 </p>


<p>60. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has not notified the Secretary-General of any state of 
emergency and subsequent derogations made to its obligations under the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 4 of the Covenant permits State parties to 
derogate from obligations &#8220;in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the 
</p>
<p>nation and the existence of which is officially proclaimed&#8221;. Derogations are only 
permissible to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, and the measure 
must not be inconsistent with their other obligations under international law or involve 
discrimination solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin. 
Article 4 also clearly stipulates the provisions which are non-derogable, which include but 
are not limited to the right to life, the prohibition of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
punishment, and freedom of thought, conscience and religion.48 
</p>
<p>61. International human rights law applies both in peace and times of armed conflict. As 
the International Court of Justice has concluded, &#8220;the protection offered by human rights 
conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict&#8221;.49 Instead, it applies alongside 
international humanitarian law which is the <i>lex specialis</i> during times of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>  Non-State actors and international human rights law 
</p>
<p>62. Non-State actors in Libya, in particular the authorities and forces of the National 
Transitional Council, cannot formally become parties to the international human rights 
treaties and are thus not formally given obligations under the treaties. Although the extent 
to which international human rights law binds non-State actors remains contested as a 
matter of international law,50 it is increasingly accepted that where non-State groups 
exercise de facto control over territory, they must respect fundamental human rights of 
persons in that territory.51 The Commission has taken the approach that, as NTC has been 
</p>
<p>  
Human Rights Committee considered that the duty to bring perpetrators to justice attaches in 
particular to violations that are criminal under domestic or international law, torture and similar cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment, summary and arbitrary killing and enforced disappearance. See 
also the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of 
Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law, adopted by the General Assembly in December 2005, and the Updated Set of 
Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights through Action to Combat Impunity 
(which were recognized in a consensus resolution of the former Commission on Human Rights in 
2005). 
</p>
<p> 48 Note also the further rights which the Human Rights Committee has explained are non-derogable: 
including the right of all persons deprived of their liberty to be treated with humanity and with respect 
for the inherent dignity of the human person, the prohibition against taking hostages, abductions or 
unacknowledged detention, certain elements of the right of minorities to protection, the prohibition of 
deportation or forcible transfer of population and the prohibition of propaganda for war and advocacy 
of national, racial or religious hatred that would constitute incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence, as well as procedural rights necessary for the protection of non-derogable rights. These 
subsidiary obligations include the right to take proceedings before a court to enable the court to 
decide on the lawfulness of the detention and remedies such as habeas corpus. Human Right

<p>exercising de facto control over territory akin to that of a Governmental authority, the 
Commission will examine also allegations of human rights violations committed by NTC 
forces. The Commission notes that NTC has made a public undertaking in which it 
committed to &#8220;build a constitutional democratic civil State based on the rule of law, respect 
for human rights and the guarantee of equal rights and opportunities for all its citizens 
including full political participations by all citizens and equal opportunities between men 
and women and the promotion of women empowerment&#8221;.52 
</p>
<p><i> (b) International humanitarian law  
</i></p>
<p>63. International humanitarian law binds all parties to an armed conflict. The Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya is a party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 as well as the Protocols 
I and II Additional thereto. It is also a party to a range of other international humanitarian 
law instruments concerning weaponry.53 The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is also a party to the 
Organization of African Unity Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa 
and the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries. It has not, however, ratified the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on 
the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to Be Excessively 
Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects; the Convention on Cluster Munitions; or the 
Convention on the Prohibition, Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-
Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is also a party to 
the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. 
</p>
<p>64. In relation to the non-international armed conflict which developed in Libya, of 
particular significance are the provisions of Protocol II together with the provisions of 
common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions (&#8220;common article 3&#8221;). The parties to the 
conflict are also bound by the provisions of customary international humanitarian law.54 
</p>
<p>65. As a result of some additional treaty action by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, some of 
the standards applicable to the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya are higher. In 
particular, by ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has agreed to 
take all feasible steps to ensure that members of its Armed Forces under 18 years of age do 
not take a direct part in hostilities and that persons under 18 are not compulsorily recruited 
into its Armed Forces. By virtue of making a declaration under article 3, the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya has declared 18 years of age as the age of voluntary recruitment. The Optional 
Protocol also obliges the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to take all feasible measures to prevent 
armed groups from recruiting and using in hostilities those under 18 (art. 4). 
</p>
<p>66. In relation to the international armed conflict, the full provisions of the four Geneva 
Conventions of 1949, as well as customary international humanitarian norms relating to 
international armed conflict apply to engagements. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and most 
of the States involved in the military intervention have also ratified Protocol additional to 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>on 29 March, see http://web.1libya.org/2011/03/31/ntc-press-release-a-vision-of-a-democratic-libya/. 
 53 Libya is a party to the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other 
</p>
<p>Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, the Convention for the Protection of Cultural 
Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their 
Destruction, the Convention on the Prohibition on the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use 
of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.

international armed conflicts (Protocol I).55 
</p>
<p>67. As the Security Council has underlined in its resolution 1325 (2011), it is important 
for all States to apply fully the relevant norms of international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law to women and girls, and to take special measures to protect 
women and girls from gender-based violence during armed conflict.56 
</p>
<p><i> (c) International criminal law 
</i></p>
<p>68. International criminal law provides the means of enforcement at the international 
level of egregious violations of international human rights law and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law which are recognized at international law as attracting 
individual criminality. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is not party to the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. However, pursuant to the Rome Statute, the Security Council 
referred the situation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the Prosecutor of the Court in 
resolution 1970 (2011). The Court can exercise jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against 
humanity and genocide as defined in the Rome Statute.57 There have been no allegations of 
genocide in the context of Libya thus far. However, there have been allegations of facts 
which may constitute war crimes and/or crimes against humanity under the Statute. 
</p>
<p>69. <b>War Crimes</b>: A detailed listing of which actions constitute war crimes under the 
Rome Statute is contained in article 8 of the Statute. In the context of non-international 
armed conflict, this comprises serious violations of common article 3 and other serious 
violations of the laws and customs of international law applicable in non-international 
armed conflict. In the context of an international armed conflict, these actions comprise 
grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and acts which constitute serious violations of 
the laws and customs of international law applicable in international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>70. <b>Crimes against humanity</b> are crimes that shock the conscience of humanity. 
According to the definition provided in the Rome Statute, crimes against humanity occur 
where certain acts are undertaken as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any 
civilian population with knowledge of the attack (art. 7).58 The individual crimes committed 
in this context may include murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forced 
transfer of population, imprisonment, torture, rape, persecutions against any identifiable 
group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender or other 
grounds, enforced disappearance, apartheid, or other inhumane acts of a similar character 
intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical 
health. There is no necessity for a nexus with an armed conflict in order to demonstrate that 
a crime against humanity has been committed. 
</p>
<p>  
 55 The only States participating or providing support functions for the military intervention, which are 
</p>
<p>not party to Protocol I are Turkey and the United States of America.

<p><b> III. Violations 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Commission has received information concerning a wide range of violations of 
international human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under 
international criminal law. In this section, the Commission evaluates a number of the key 
violations, beginning with violations alleged during the demonstration period, before 
moving to ones specific to an armed conflict. Several categories of violations took place in 
both periods and so have been integrated into more than one section. In relation to the 
armed conflict period, the vast majority of information received has been related to the non-
international armed conflict, so that chapter III, sections A&#8211;K, focus on this aspect, with 
violations alleged in the course of the international armed conflict addressed in chapter III, 
section L. Conclusions in this section are limited to referring to violations of international 
human rights and international humanitarian law. Discussion of the commission of 
international crimes is dealt with in the assessment section. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Excessive use of force against demonstrators 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>72. The catalyst for establishment of this Commission of Inquiry was concern over the 
use of force against demonstrators in mid&#8211;late February. The Human Rights Council in 
resolution S-15/1 expressed &#8220;deep concern at the deaths of hundreds of civilians&#8221;, referring 
also to &#8220;indiscriminate armed attacks against civilians&#8221; and &#8220;extrajudicial killings&#8221;. The 
particular circumstances, leading up to the use of force by security forces against 
demonstrators, have been contested by the demonstrators and the Government. The 
Government has stated that its security forces refrained from using live ammunition and 
instead used instead tear gas on 15 February. The Government has further stated that 
demonstrators&#8223; violent actions, in attacking police stations, necessitated the use of force by 
authorities. Protestors have reiterated the peaceful nature of their demonstrations. Estimates 
of those killed and injured also vary. On 20 February, human rights groups estimated that 
approximately 233 persons had been killed.59 Saif al-Islam Qadhafi made reference to 98 
persons having been killed during an interview on the same day.60 The Office of the 
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has estimated that 500&#8211;700 persons had been 
killed in February (though this estimate would take into account some of the armed conflict 
period).61 It is accepted by both the Government and the demonstrators that Government 
forces used significant force, including the use of firearms and other weaponry against 
persons participating in demonstrations in various locations within Libya during the period 
studied by the Commission. 
</p>
<p>73. In examining the response to the demonstrations, in particular claims of excessive 
use of force, the Commission met with a variety of Government and NTC officials and 
spoke with over 80 persons regarding the incidents during the demonstrations, particularly

<p>persons who had taken part in demonstrations, persons wounded, medical staff members 
and other persons with relevant information. The Commission also had access to a variety 
of reports prepared by other organizations in relation to recent events. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>74. International human rights law prohibits arbitrary deprivation of life (article 6 of the 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), guarantees security of persons (article 9 of the 
Covenant) and prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of persons 
(article 7 of the Covenant). Excessive use of force by law enforcement officials (whether 
police or military or other members of State security forces) impinges on these fundamental 
guarantees. Specialized soft law standards, in particular the Code of Conduct for Law 
Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials provide further guidance on this subject. Non-violent means are to 
be used as far as possible before resorting to the use of force (principle of necessity), and 
any use of force must be limited to that which is proportionate to the seriousness of the 
offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved (principle of proportionality). Firearms 
are to be used only in self-defence or in defence of others against imminent threat of death 
or serious injury; to prevent a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life; or to 
</p>
<p>arrest a person posing such a threat and who is resisting efforts to stop the threat, or to 
prevent that person&#8223;s escape. Before using firearms, law enforcement officials must identify 
themselves as law enforcement officials and give a clear warning that firearms will be used. 
Further, sufficient time must be provided for the warning to be observed, unless this would 
unduly create a risk of death or serious harm to the officer or other persons, or would be 
clearly inappropriate or pointless in the circumstances.62 Explicit guidance is also provided 
by the Basic Principles in relation to respecting persons&#8223; right to participate in lawful and 
peaceful assemblies in accordance with article 21 of the Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.63 Depending on the circumstances, particular violations might also amount to 
constituent acts of a crime against humanity (e.g. murder or persecution) if committed as 
part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of 
that attack (art. 7, para. 1 (a) and (h), of the Rome Statute). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Commission has concluded that the Government&#8223;s reaction, in seeking to 
repress the demonstrations, involved the use of lethal force and that, in the early days of the 
protest, there was little evidence to suggest that the protestors were engaged in anything 
other than peaceful assembly. The Commission has not been able to determine the exact 
numbers of casualties during the demonstration phase, in part because its access to places 
and persons was limited, but also due to specific Government action taken in the aftermath 
of the demonstrations which has limited available physical and documentary evidence. The 
Commission received specific information concerning events in the following locations.64 
</p>
<p>  
 62 See article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and Basic Principles on the Use 
</p>
<p>of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials<i>.</i> 
 63 If an assembly is unlawful but nonviolent, law enforcement officials must avoid using force, or where 
</p>
<p>this is not practicable, must restrict force to the minimum extent necessary. In the case of violent 
assemblies, law enforcement officials may use firearms only when less dangerous means are not 
practicable and only to the minimum extent necessary (principles 13 and 14, Basic Principles on the 
Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials). 
</p>
<p> 64 This listing of locations relates to places or events on which the Commission has gathered the most 
information, in part due to the locations it was able to visit. However, this should not be taken to be 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>76. <b>Benghazi</b>: The Commission received information that 20 demonstrators were killed 
in Benghazi on 17 February65 with a further 20 killed on 19 February and 60 on 20 
February.66 According to Benghazi Medical Centre, of the fatalities registered at that 
location on 17 February (estimated at 11), 90 per cent were shot in the upper part of the 
body, most often in the chest and head. Doctors and nurses at the Benghazi Medical Centre 
indicated that a significant number of fatalities arrived in the following days. 
</p>
<p>77. <b>Tripoli</b>: The Commission interviewed persons with information concerning 
demonstrations in Tripoli on 17 February. Persons spoke of security forces using force to 
disperse demonstrators in Green Square and Algeria Square, leaving several protestors 
dead. On 21 February, there were indications of some violent actions by protestors with the 
burning of Government buildings, such as police stations on Omar al-Mukhtar Street and 
the People&#8223;s Hall on Andalus Street and the Friday market area. However, the Commission 
received information that even if security forces were justified in using some sort of force, 
the use of force was indiscriminate. One example given was that of a 21-year-old woman 
who was killed while watching the scene in Sidi Khalifa Street in the city. 
</p>
<p>78. Human Rights Watch stated that at least 62 corpses were brought to the morgues in 
Tripoli between 20 and 22 February after protestors had been fired at randomly by Libyan 
forces.67 In relation to demonstrations in the Fashlum, Tajurah and Al-Dibri 
neighbourhoods of Tripoli, the Commission received information that, on 20 February, 
Government forces shot at demonstrators, leaving an estimated 15 persons dead and many 
others injured. The Commission received further information that the repression of the 
demonstrations continued on 23 and 25 February.68 
</p>
<p>79. The Commission was told by several witnesses that security forces of the 
Government collected the corpses of persons from streets and hospitals. There were also 
accounts of bodies being exhumed by bulldozers after being buried. Security forces were 
also said to have raided hospitals to remove injured persons. It was also reported to the 
Commission that a number of wounded were denied access to hospitals, while others did 
not seek medical treatment for fear of being detained by the security forces. 
</p>
<p>80. <b>Darnah</b>: The Commission received information that six persons were killed in 
Darnah on 17 February when security forces opened fire at approximately 150 persons 
protesting against the regime. No tear gas or warning shots were said to have been 
employed before the use of live ammunition. A number of those who were killed had been 
shot in the upper part of the body. In one case, an individual was said to have been shot six 
times in the head and chest by a member of ISA. One witness, explained: 
</p>
<p>  
an exhaustive list, since confrontations between demonstrators and Government forces happened in 
other locations.

<p> 68 A medical practitioner interviewed by the Commission stated that, following the repression of 
demonstrations in Tajurah, he saw 15 persons killed and 10 wounded on 20 February 2011 and that 
most were hit at the head, chest and abdomen. He also saw 35 who had received wounds to the head 
and chest on 25 February 2011. </p>


<p>&#8220;We went to peaceful demonstration [on 17 February] and were attacked by 
</p>
<p>security. Six were killed during the 30 minutes demonstration. I was hit &#8230; Children 
are targeted in the face, without differentiating. Six people were hit in face on 17th 
in Darnah &#8230; Snipers were on top of buildings shooting. Not a <i>Katiba</i> but people 
from internal security, instructed to do so, to target people, no tear gas used, they 
targeted us with live bullets.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>81. <b>Tobruk</b>: The Commission collected information regarding the demonstration in 
Ash-Shuhada Square (previously known as Al-Jamahiriya Square) in Tobruk which 
triggered an intervention, according to witnesses, from joint Government security agencies, 
including ISA, riot police, and revolutionary committees. Witnesses reported that several 
security personnel were stationed on the roofs of nearby buildings and were firing at 
demonstrators. The Commission has established that live ammunition was used, killing at 
least four demonstrators and injuring 51 others. 
</p>
<p>82. <b>Al-Bayda</b>: According to medical records provided to the Commission, at least 40 
persons were killed during peaceful demonstrations between 16 and 19 February. On 16 
February, members of Al-Bayda Internal Security Agency fired live ammunition at a 
demonstration in Al-Salhi Square and the Commission has verified that several 
demonstrators had been killed. On 17 February, according to information received by the 
Commission from forensic and prosecutorial authorities, security forces of Khamis <i>Katiba</i> 
were deployed in Al-Bayda where they shot at demonstrators without prior warning, 
resulting in the deaths of 11 other demonstrators. Other witnesses spoke specifically of 
actions of ISA and revolutionary committees in shooting at persons during demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>83. On 18 February, at the demonstrations near Al-Abraq Airport69 (east of Al-Bayda 
town), the Commission received information that 11 persons were killed by security 
personnel of Khamis <i>Katiba</i>, including the Commander of Husein al-Jiwiki <i>Katiba</i>. 
According to several sources, the Commander was shot as a result of his refusal to shot at 
demonstrators. Witnesses noted that an 11-year-old child was shot in the head while sitting 
inside a house close to the place of incident. 
</p>
<p>84. Medical sources and forensic specialists in Al-Bayda mentioned that the vast 
majority of those killed had been shot in the upper part of their bodies. They estimated that 
80 per cent had been shot in the head and another 10 per cent had been shot in the chest, 
neck, or mouth. According to the same sources, the vast majority of those killed were shot 
with only one bullet. 
</p>
<p>85. <b>Misrata</b>: The Commission received information relating to Misrata and 
demonstrations held there between 19 and 22 February. The Commission heard evidence 
that riot-control police shot live ammunition at demonstrators killing at least one person, 
Khaled Abu Samah, on 19 February. On 20 February, following the funeral of Mr. Abu 
Samah, thousands of people gathered on Tripoli Street, Misrata, to protest and met with 
security forces again shooting live ammunition. In addition to the riot-control police, 
members of the <i>Baltajiyah</i>70 were also said to be present and to have taken part in shooting 
at demonstrators. The Commission has also been informed that AK47&#8223;s and anti-aircraft 
weapons were used against demonstrators. On 21 and 22 February, demonstrators attacked 
revolutionary committee offices, police stations and military barracks, taking arms and 
weapons from these locations. 
</p>
<p>  
 69 The event is commonly known among Libyans as &#8220;Al-Abraq Airport battle&#8221;. 
 70 In describing these <i>Baltajiyah</i>, witnesses referred to armed young men acting as groups in a &#8220;gang-
</p>
<p>like&#8221; fashion to disrupt the demonstration. </p>


<p>86. The Commission was told that when the demonstrations erupted, instructions were 
given to security forces to withdraw from police stations and security premises.71 The 
Government has stressed that the live ammunition was only employed in response to 
demonstrators&#8223; violent actions. The Government also noted that demonstrators attacked 
police stations, destroying approximately 17 stations several of them in various cities and 
towns of Libya, and that demonstrators took up arms against the security forces. The 
Government was thus of the view that any use of force had been justifiable. 
</p>
<p>87. The majority of information collected by the Commission, however, indicates that 
the Government forces used live ammunition against unarmed peaceful demonstrators in 
many instances. While in some locations, in particular after 19 February, demonstrators 
increasingly took violent actions, the Commission concludes that the early days of the 
demonstration were peaceful. This conclusion is based upon information received from 
participants in the demonstration, but has also been corroborated by information collected 
from some security personnel. One member of security personnel, currently in detention, 
stated that he was among 250 soldiers deployed by the regime to &#8220;contain demonstrators&#8221; 
in Benghazi on 17 February. Interrogation records provided to the Commission by the 
Benghazi General Prosecutor&#8223;s Office state that members of the security forces were given 
orders, by their commanding officers, to use force against demonstrators. In at least one 
transcript, there is an admission of involvement by a member of the security forces in the 
random shooting of protestors in Benghazi on 20 February. Similar information was 
provided in relation to the deliberate deployment of members of Kata&#8217;eb to violently 
disperse demonstrations in Al-Bayda. In one case a former security director who has since 
joined with opposition forces disclosed that he sought to gain approval for the 
redeployment of officers outside Al-Bayda from the highest levels of ISA and senior 
political figures. He did not receive authorization and was told to take instructions only 
from Khamis Qadhafi. The Benghazi Prosecutor&#8223;s Office has also collected information 
relating to orders being given to fire at demonstrators on 17 February in Ras Lanuf and that 
security personnel had complied with said orders by utilizing anti-aircraft weaponry. 
</p>
<p>88. The Commission has not been able to determine if all participants in the 
demonstration were unarmed. However, from the information it has received, together with 
the videos and photos it has examined, it considers it likely that in the early days of the 
protest, the protestors were engaged in peaceful assemblies. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>89. The Commission considers that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the 
Government forces engaged in excessive use of force against demonstrators, at least in the 
early days of the protests, leading to significant deaths and injuries. The nature of injuries 
inflicted in several locations (with a high proportion of those wounded or killed shot in the 
head or upper body) is indicative of &#8220;shoot-to-kill&#8221; operations. From the common style of 
response by the forces in many parts of the country, it would appear likely that the forces 
were given orders to engage in the harsh crackdown of demonstrators. Such actions 
represented a serious breach of a range of rights under the Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights including the right to life, the right to security of person, as well as freedom of 
assembly and freedom of expression. In relation to the latter days of protests as the situation 
escalated, more investigation would be required to assess the security forces&#8223; use of force,

</p>
<p>Rights Violations&#8221; report submitted to the Commission by Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on 16 
May 2011 in Geneva. This was confirmed in discussions with representatives of NTC. The 
Government ascribed this action to a desire to minimize civilian casualties, a position with which 
NTC did not agree. </p>


<p>in particular more detail concerning the actions taken by demonstrators in these days in 
order to assess the response by Government authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>90. Claims have been made of hundreds of arbitrary detentions of persons and/or their 
enforced disappearance as part of a Government repression of dissent. Particular groups 
who have been said to be subject to such treatment include those associated with the 
protests and journalists. The Human Rights Council in its resolution S-15/1 expressed its 
&#8220;deep concern&#8221; at the &#8220;arbitrary arrests, detention and torture of peaceful demonstrators&#8221;. 
The Commission held over fifty interviews with persons (including detainees, their families 
and eyewitnesses in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia) who referred to cases of arbitrary detention 
and disappearance both during the demonstration and armed conflict periods. The 
Commission has also been provided with information from a variety of human rights 
organizations. The Commission has not been in a position to verify the hundreds of cases 
put to it by other organizations, however, it has sought to investigate whether a pattern of 
arbitrary arrests and/or detentions occurred. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Arbitrary detention 
</i></p>
<p>91. Article 9 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits arbitrary arrest or 
detention of individuals. It provides that &#8220;no one shall be deprived of liberty except on such 
grounds and in accordance with such procedures as are established by law&#8221;. Persons 
arrested are to be informed at the time of arrest of the reasons for the arrest and promptly 
informed of any charges (art. 9, para. 2). Anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge 
is to be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise 
judicial power and is entitled to trial within a reasonable period or release (art. 9, para. 3). 
Persons have a right to take proceedings before a court for the purposes of reviewing the 
lawfulness of detention and to be released if the detention is unlawful (the Covenant also 
provides for a right of compensation for unlawful arrest or detention). Lawfulness of 
detention is to be considered as both lawfulness under domestic law and lawfulness under 
international law.72 The term &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; needs to be considered in terms of appropriateness, 
proportionality and reasonableness.73 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Enforced disappearance 
</i></p>
<p>92. While the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is not a party to the International Convention for 
the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, it is a party to the Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, provisions of which are infringed by enforced disappearance. 
Such action violates a person&#8223;s right to recognition as a person before the law (art. 16 of the 
Covenant), and to liberty and security and freedom from arbitrary detention, including the 
right to be brought promptly before a judge or other official for review of the lawfulness of 
</p>
<p>  
 72 See, for instance, Human Rights Committee, <i>A. v. Australia</i>, communication No. 560/1993, 
</p>
<p>CCPR/C/59/D/560/1993, para. 9.5. 
 73 Ibid., para. 9.2. In considering unlawful remand, the Committee has also highlighted that factors of 
</p>
<p>inappropriateness, injustice and lack of predictability that may render arbitrary an otherwise lawful 
detention; see Human Rights Committee, <i>Van Alphen v. The Netherlands</i>, communication No. 
305/1988. </p>


<p>detention (art. 9 of the Covenant). Disappearance may also be associated with torture and 
other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and extrajudicial execution, in 
violation of the right to life and torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment.74 
</p>
<p>93. Under international humanitarian law, persons taking no active part in the hostilities 
are entitled to be treated humanely (art. 4, para. 1, of Protocol II, and common article 3). 
Customary international humanitarian law rules also include a prohibition on arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty75 and require parties to the conflict to keep a register of persons 
deprived of their liberty,76 respect detainees&#8223; family life, permit detainees to receive 
visitors, especially near relatives to the degree practicable77 and allow correspondence 
between detainees and their families.78 Parties to a conflict must take all feasible measure to 
account for persons reported missing as a result of the conflict and efforts must be made to 
provide family members with any information the party has on their fate.79 The practice of 
enforced disappearance also may be a gateway to other violations such as torture, murder or 
extra judicial executions. The combined effect of particular international humanitarian law 
obligations leads to the conclusion that the practice of disappearance is prohibited by 
customary international humanitarian law.80 
</p>
<p>94. Furthermore, &#8220;imprisonment or other severe deprivation of liberty in violation of 
fundamental rules of international law&#8221; and enforced disappearance are acts recognized in 
the Rome Statute as potentially giving rise to a crime against humanity if committed as part 
of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population, with knowledge of the 
attack (art. 7, para. 1 (e) and (i)).81 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>95. In a number of cities visited, the Commission has been able to observe posters on 
public buildings, courthouses and hospitals containing the pictures and names of 
disappeared persons. Family members had placed such posters in the hope that someone 
would be able to provide them with information as to the whereabouts or death of their 
relatives. 
</p>
<p>96. The Commission received considerable information concerning the detention of 
persons by Government forces. The information received by the Commission, indicated that 
Government forces arrested or detained hundreds of civilians in many cities and towns 
</p>
<p>  
 74 The Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 20 (1992) on article 7, para. 11, recognized 
</p>
<p>that safeguards against torture included having provisions against incommunicado detention, granting 
detainees suitable access to persons such as doctors, lawyers and family members, ensuring detainees 
are held in places that are officially recognized as places of detention and for their names and places 
of detention, as well as for the names of persons responsible for their detention, to be kept in registers 
readily available and accessible to those concerned, including relatives and friends. 
</p>
<p> 75 Rule 99, ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, p. 344. 
 76 Rule 123, ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, p. 439. 
 77 Rule 126, ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, p. 438. 
 78 Rule 125, ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, p. 445. This right is also 
</p>
<p>explicitly protected in article 5, paragraph 2 (b), of Protocol II. 
 79 Rule 117, ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, p. 421. 
 80 Rule 98, ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, p. 340. 
 81 Enforced disappearance is further defined in article 7, paragraph 2 (i), as &#8220;the arrest, detention or 
</p>
<p>abduction of persons by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence of, a State or a political 
organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information 
on the fate or whereabouts of those persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection 
of the law for a prolonged period of time.&#8221; </p>


<p>across Libya, in an organized fashion, utilizing various brigades and other security forces. 
Interviewees reported that the authorities&#8223; repression of demonstrations was followed by 
</p>
<p>reprisals against individuals having organized or participated in demonstrations. Numerous 
reports were received of persons being taken to &#8220;informal&#8221; places of detention. Following 
their release, a number of persons gave information concerning their being held along with 
others in such unofficial places of detention maintained by Government forces. 
</p>
<p>97. When persons were detained, they were not informed of the basis for the deprivation 
of liberty. Many persons arrested, in the aftermath of the demonstrations, have not been 
brought before a competent, independent and impartial court or other authority to have the 
lawfulness of their detention reviewed. Instead, they have been held beyond the reach of the 
law, without the possibility of recourse to legal procedures. Consistent testimonies received 
by the Commission indicate that Government forces stopped civilians at checkpoints or in 
the streets, regularly verified identity cards of travellers, arrested and detained persons 
according to their place of origin or residence, each being used as proxies to indicate that 
persons were supporters of the opposition. While some were released after being 
questioned, others were taken by authorities and are suspected to be held in detention 
facilities or prisons in Tripoli, or transferred to Ianzana, Al-Jdaydah and Abu Salim 
detention facilities. Two persons from Nalut, for instance, stated to the Commission that: 
they had been arrested by Government forces and later transferred to an unknown military 
location. They were detained alongside other persons, some of whom are still missing.  
</p>
<p>98. The Commission received information about a large number persons missing or 
disappeared, both during the demonstrations and during the armed conflict. Reports were 
forthcoming from several cities in the east including Ajdabiya, Al-Bayda, Darnah, Misrata, 
Ras Lanuf, Sirte and Tobruk, as well as cities in the west including in Tripoli Az-Zawiyah, 
Zuwarah and the Nafusa Mountains. Interviewees noted that hundreds of persons 
disappeared in the first days of demonstrations, as well as after the conflict started. 
Witnesses told the Commission that some Government forces specifically communicated 
threats that abductions would continue unless their community aligned with the Qadhafi 
regime. Interviewees stated that the majority of persons who disappeared during the conflict 
were civilians who had been travelling within the country or had encountered checkpoints 
run by Government forces. Some were simply walking in the streets or buying groceries 
when they were last seen. 
</p>
<p>99. It is difficult to ascertain the exact number of disappearances. The Commission 
received a list of 10 names of persons reported to have disappeared during the second half 
of February in Tobruk, and of 110 disappeared persons who disappeared from the Nafusa 
Mountain area. The Fondation Alkarama submitted to the Commission a list of 740 names 
of persons who had been reportedly arrested, detained or abducted by Government forces 
and were believed to have been disappeared. Human Rights Watch documented 72 possible 
disappearance cases based on interviews with family members or witnesses to the arrest of 
missing persons. According to Human Rights Watch, the Libyan Red Crescent Society in 
Benghazi has recorded 370 missing person cases from Benghazi and Al-Bayda.82 
</p>
<p>100. The Commission collected considerable information relating to the disappearances 
of persons from the Nafusa Mountain area in particular.83 According to several interviews 
</p>
<p>  
 82 Human Rights Watch, &#8220;Libya: At Least 370 Missing From Country's East; Fate of Libyans in 
</p>
<p>Government Custody Unknown&#8221;, 30 March 2011. Available from 
</p>
<p>www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/30/libya-least-370-missing-countrys-east. 
 83 As indicated earlier, the Commission has received reports of disappearances from many geographical 
</p>
<p>locations. The inclusion of particular cases from Nafusa Mountain area reflects the nature of the 
Commission&#8223;s field investigations only. </p>


<p>conducted by the Commission with eyewitnesses and families of victims in refugee camps 
in Tunisia, a large number of persons have been disappeared since mid-February. 
</p>
<p>101. An interviewee from Zintan District reported to the Commission that Government 
forces started stopping travellers as of mid-March on their way to the mountain to check 
their identity cards, detaining them if they were residents of districts supporting the 
opposition. They were then taken away to unknown places. The interviewee also noted that 
the Government forces restricted the locations where fuel was available in the outskirts of 
Yafran and Zintan districts and would then capture persons from those locations.  
</p>
<p>102. Witnesses referred to the failure of the authorities of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to 
acknowledge detention and failure to respond to requests for information about those 
missing. In several interviews, the Commission heard that relatives called a missing 
person&#8223;s mobile phone and ended up speaking with someone who they believed to be from 
the Government&#8223;s security forces. The Commission met with persons who had reappeared 
after being held incommunicado, tortured or ill-treated over a number of days. 
</p>
<p>103. One interviewee told the Commission that hundreds of residents of the Nafusa 
Mountain area have disappeared as of mid-February throughout March and April 2011. He 
stated that his cousin from Yafran District and his friend from Jado District disappeared in 
March 2011. None of them had been carried weapons. Their families have not heard from 
them since. Another interviewee noted that Government forces abducted his civilian cousin 
from Nalut District on 18 March 2011. He reported that his cousin had been detained for 
expressing pro-opposition views, and that he had not taken part in the hostilities. His 
whereabouts remain unknown. 
</p>
<p>104. In some cases documented by the Commission, persons who had been disappeared 
appeared subsequently on Al Libya television channel, a channel which is owned by Saif 
al-Islam Qadhafi. They were reportedly forced to state their allegiance to the regime during 
a live transmission in an attempt to send a message to the opposition that their followers are 
traitors. During the broadcast, some others confessed to being members of Al-Qaida group 
in Libya while having visible signs of torture or ill-treatment on their faces and bodies. 
</p>
<p>105. Interviewees from the Nafusa Mountain, for example, stated that three residents of 
Nalut District disappeared in Tiji District around 6 March 2011, 40 kilometres away from 
Nalut, while travelling to Tripoli to buy car spare parts. Two days later, the Al Libya 
television channel broadcast them voicing their allegiance and support to Colonel Qadhafi. 
Signs of beating were evident with their faces swollen and blue bruises marked their 
eyeballs. 
</p>
<p>106. The Commission documented cases of the disappearance of at least 14 medical 
personnel by Government forces from hospitals in Az-Zawiyah, Benghazi and Tripoli. An 
Egyptian physician told the Commission that his colleague, a Libyan physician disappeared 
together with an Egyptian practitioner in the beginning of March, in Ras Lanuf. His 
colleague was later seen on Al Libya TV wearing military uniform and confessing that he 
belonged to Al-Qaida. This case was also referred to in the submission of the Fondation 
Alkarama to the Commission, along with the details of six other cases of disappearances of 
doctors in western Libya since the beginning of the uprising. Another physician told the 
Commission about the disappearances of four anaesthetic surgeons in Az-Zawiyah between 
February and March 2011. The Commission received further information concerning the 
arrest of a physician from Misrata with his 3 children and his 18 years old daughter in 
Tripoli. Their whereabouts remain unknown. 
</p>
<p>107. Reports indicate that journalists who were covering events were also subject to 
arbitrary arrests and disappearance. As a result of international pressure, some have been 
released but others are still missing or unaccounted for. At least a dozen journalists and 
other media professionals, including foreign nationals, went missing in Libya. These cases </p>


<p>(and the Commission&#8223;s specific interventions in these cases) have been further explored in 
</p>
<p>chapter III, section E, of the present report. 
</p>
<p>108. Foreign nationals also reported to the Commission that a number of migrants had 
disappeared in Tripoli. Interviewees in refugee camps in Tunisia noted that migrant workers 
had disappeared since the uprising had begun, mainly in raids conducted by Government 
forces in migrants&#8223; camps in Tripoli. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Several 
interviewees mentioned that Saif al-Islam Qadhafi&#8223;s <i>Katiba</i> had entered workers&#8223; 
compounds, ill-treated residents, robbed them of their belongings and had taken people 
away. They also told the Commission that migrants had been abducted in the streets, taken 
from their homes, ill-treated and/or blackmailed against their release. While some had 
succeeded in finding a way out by paying ransoms, others remain in custody. 
</p>
<p>109. The Commission has received very little information on violations committed by the 
armed opposition in relation to arrest, detention of abduction or any form of deprivation of 
liberty or disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>110. The Commission concludes that Government forces have arbitrarily detained a 
significant number of persons in many towns and cities across Libya. In addition to not 
affording persons proper legal protections, that the Government forces&#8223; arrests and 
detentions appear to have been carried out in a &#8220;blanket&#8221; fashion, targeting suspected 
opposition supporters or regions viewed as being against the regime, rather than those 
suspected of criminal responsibility or other security-related reasons associated with the 
armed conflict. The Commission has also documented a range of cases of persons who have 
been disappeared, many of whom remain unaccounted for. On the basis of its investigation, 
the Commission is satisfied that the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has 
engaged in a pattern of enforced disappearances of persons in violation of its obligations 
under international human rights and international humanitarian law. The Commission has 
received very little information on violations committed by the armed opposition in relation 
to arbitrary arrest, or other forms of deprivation of liberty or disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>111. Reports concerning the use of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment by both Government and opposition authorities have 
been received by the Commission. Both entities have denied their involvement in such 
violations. As part of its investigation, the Commission visited two detention facilities, one 
each in Benghazi and Tripoli, and interviewed a total of 30 detainees. The Commission also 
interviewed other witnesses and alleged victims of torture and ill-treatment in the course of 
its field mission. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>112. Under international human rights law, there is a clear prohibition of torture and other 
forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in article 7 of the Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. A fuller definition of torture is provided for in the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment: &#8220;torture&#8221; means 
any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally 
inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information 
or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected 
of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason </p>


<p>based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the 
instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting 
in an official capacity (art. 1, para. 1). International humanitarian law explicitly prohibits 
the torture and cruel treatment of persons taking no active part in hostilities (including 
members of armed forces who have laid down their arms or been rendered <i>hors de combat</i>) 
(art. 4, para. 2 (a), of Protocol II and common article 3). Such conduct constitutes a war 
crime and torture is an act which can form part of a crime against humanity (see article 8, 
paragraph 2 (c) (i), and article 7, paragraph 1 (f), of the Rome Statute). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Violations committed by Government forces 
</i></p>
<p>113. The Commission received information from many persons of their torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>114. One man who spoke with the Commission related that he had been arrested by 
members of the Public Security Agency and ISA in Benghazi on 17 February and taken to 
the Benghazi police station. At that point, he and the other 26 persons arrested were all 
beaten by security personnel. Clubs and rifles were used to inflict the beating. About 15 
minutes after the beating finished, the group were transported to ISA premises in Sidi Jaber, 
in central Benghazi, where they were tortured with electricity shocks on their sexual organs. 
The man also reported seeing ISA forcibly removing the nails and teeth of another detainee. 
When the Commission visited Al-Jdaydah detention centre in Tripoli, two detainees of the 
five interviewed, told the Commission that they had been subjected to severe beating during 
the first days of their detention. </p>
<p>115. Another man arrested on 25 February in connection with a demonstration in Tajurah, 
reported that he was blindfolded and taken to an unknown destination where he was beaten 
with electric wires. His arms were tied behind his back while he was repeatedly hit with a 
Kalashnikov on his forehead and the back of his head. He stated that he was detained for 10 
days and beaten by batons. During his detention, he could also hear the voices of other 
persons screaming and moaning from pain. On the fifth day, the abusive treatment led to 
the inflammation of his wounds, causing him to faint due to the pain. When he woke up, he 
was beaten again. He was threatened with being beaten again if he did not go on Al Libya 
TV channel saying that he was supportive of Colonel Qadhafi and confess to being part of 
the Al-Qaida group. 
</p>
<p>116. A Jordanian migrant reported that he was stopped by Khamis <i>Katiba</i> soldiers on his 
way to a nearby shop in his neighbourhood in Maya area in Tripoli. He stated that after 
being beaten on all parts of his body, he was taken to a nearby detention facility, where he 
was held and beaten for a week on the head, face, fingers, hands and legs with batons and 
rifles. He was stripped and &#8220;forced to perform like a dog&#8221;. He noted that he fainted many 
times under torture. The Commission could see bruises on his fingers while interviewing 
him, several weeks after his detention. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Violations committed by opposition armed forces 
</i></p>
<p>117. On 20 April, the Commission visited Benghazi Detention Centre, a facility run by 
Opposition forces. The Commission met with 25 detainees of the 72 held at the Centre at 
that time. Detainees interviewed included five foreign nationals from Algeria, Chad, Niger 
and the Syrian Arab Republic. The majority of interviewees said that they had not been 
beaten during their detention. However, some reported, being beaten with clubs at the time 
of their capture. </p>


<p>118. Information was also received that foreign nationals had been tortured or subject to 
other forms of ill-treatment by opposition forces. One Palestinian man stated that on 22 
March 2011 approximately 50 armed men raided his house in Az-Zawiyah and arrested him 
along with five other male members of his family. According to information received by 
the Commission, armed men in green uniforms blindfolded him and took him to a hospital 
being used as a detention facility in Az-Zawiyah. During the three days of his detention, he 
reported that he was repeatedly kicked and beaten with batons and was subjected to 
inhuman treatment. Physical abuse was said to be a daily routine in the facility. He 
witnessed other people in the detention centre being subjected to inhuman treatment. He 
reported that many of them were perceived to be pro-Qadhafi and included both Libyans 
and migrants. He noted that detainees were kept in very poor conditions and had been 
regularly threatened with death<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>119. The Commission concludes that torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment was committed by both the Government and the opposition forces in 
violation of obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law. Violations 
were most common with respect to persons held in detention (including incommunicado 
detention) and persons perceived to be supporters of &#8220;the other side&#8221; to the conflict. The 
cases involving Government responsibility occurred both in peacetime (against persons 
detained in relation to the demonstrations) and (subsequently) during the armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Denial of access to medical treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>120. The Commission received numerous reports in its investigation that Government 
forces prevented persons from gaining access to medical treatment in the aftermath of the 
demonstrations. This prevention took the form of refusing to facilitate medical assistance, 
blocking access to medical facilities or in the most extreme cases, allegedly attacking 
persons or abducting persons in hospital viewed as associated with the protests. During the 
course of its investigation, the Commission spoke to over 40 persons who raised topics 
related to being hindered in their attempts to access health care, primarily following the 
demonstrations.84 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>121. Under article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is bound to respect the right to everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. As the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights highlighted in its general comment 
No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest attainable standard of health (art. 12 of the 
Covenant), this includes an obligation not to prevent access to health services as a punitive 
measure. While the specific example provided by the Committee relates to where medical 
services are prevented as a punitive measure in times of armed conflict contrary to 
international humanitarian law, this obligation applies at all times (general comment, para. 
34). 
</p>
<p>  
 84 This section deals primarily with impeding access to health care in the aftermath of the 
</p>
<p>demonstrations. The subject of attacks on medical personnel and facilities and failure to fulfil 
obligations with respect to tending the wounded and sick during the armed conflict are dealt with 
separately under chapter III, section F.  </p>


<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>122. The Commission repeatedly heard of cases in which persons were either denied 
access to medical care or faced obstacles imposed by security forces in accessing health 
care after having been wounded in demonstrations. In one case reported to the Commission, 
a protestor in Al-Bayda on 18 February<b> </b>received three gun shots and was provided with no 
medical care despite calls for the security forces to provide assistance. He was left bleeding 
from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m. when he died, as a result of the lack of medical attention. In a 
separate case, another man from Al-Bayda also spoke of the lack of medical attention: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those in the airport came out on to us firing arms and I was shot along with Sharah 
</p>
<p>Albal who died later in the evening without medical care.85 I was shot on my right 
thigh on the left side &#8230; We requested medical emergency because we were 
wounded and no one responded. We asked for water they refused and searched us. 
On Saturday 19 February afternoon, we were then moved from the hall and literally 
thrown into a truck after blindfolding us and whoever moved was hit. We were put 
on board a military airplane on the floor and we arrived to Tripoli at night. We could 
hear them say &#8222;this one is dead, this one is alive&#8223;. We landed in Mateigha airport and 
were taken to the military hospital there. There the doctors took the blindfold off and 
put me in a bed for half an hour then they took me into surgery.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>123. Another witness from Benghazi who had been shot while participating in a 
demonstration on 17 February reported hearing instructions that no medical help was to be 
given and that a debate ensued amongst the military before he was taken to Benghazi 
Medical Centre: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could hear the crowd around me say this one is still alive, I heard another reply 
don&#8222;t touch anyone. Someone said to put me in the dumpster. I could hear a quarrel 
among them. One said: one is still alive, another said I will take him for medical 
help in the ambulance, another replied no, another replied I will take him in my 
personal car so the one who said no told them to disarm and take off their military 
uniform. They put me in the back seat and took me out of the military camp from the 
back gate and handed me to the Benghazi Medical Centre.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>124. The Commission also received information from medical professionals that the 
entries and exits to hospitals and accident centres had been closed by Government forces to 
prevent people from entering to receive treatment. A doctor in Tripoli reported: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ambulances full of mercenaries or Qadhafi forces did not let me out of hospital and 
prevented all exit and entry. I spoke with colleagues at Abu Salim accident centre 
and Az-Zawiyah and they also said no one could enter.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>125. The Fondation Alkarama also reported that border guards and Colonel Qadhafi&#8223;s 
security services were preventing injured individuals from crossing into Tunisia to seek 
medical assistance. 
</p>
<p>126. The Commission also heard several reports of attacks on wounded persons and 
abductions from hospitals. According to one person interviewed by the Commission, in 
Benghazi in the early days of the protest, an employee at Al-Jalaa&#8223; hospital let alleged 
mercenaries enter through a back door &#8220;in order to kill the injured demonstrators&#8221;. Another 
person reported having heard similar accounts and that a fight erupted inside the hospital as 
friends and relatives of the injured banded together to protect them from being taken or 
killed. A nurse in Benghazi speaking to the British television network Channel Four said 
that on the evening of 17 February, armed men wearing &#8220;military or police&#8221; uniforms 
</p>
<p>  
 85 This may be a reference to the person who died in the previous witness&#8223;s account. </p>


<p>entered the hospital at which she was working at around 2.00 a.m. and carried away three 
patients who had been injured during the protest on the same date. The nurse added that 
staff were ushered into a room and kept there until the patients had been loaded into a 
vehicle outside.86 
</p>
<p>127. An interviewee from Zintan in the west stated that, on the night of 21 February, 
Government forces invaded hospitals, abducted patients and killed others on the spot. 
Medical personnel who tried to protect patients were abducted. 
</p>
<p>128. In Tripoli, a doctor serving at the Medical Centre reported witnessing members of 
the <i>Kata</i>&#8217;<i>eb</i> abducting the wounded from his hospital. Reports of such abductions were said 
to have had a chilling effect on persons accessing hospitals. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>129. The Commission considers that a range of actions taken by Government forces have 
had the effect of impeding or preventing altogether access to medical care. This has taken 
the form of refusing assistance in the immediate aftermath of demonstrations, later 
interrupting access to hospitals, taking action against medical personnel and allegedly 
abducting persons from hospitals. In such actions, there have been clear violations of the 
right to adequate standard of health, as well as other serious violations involved in the 
particular actions undertaken against medical personnel or patients.87 
</p>
<p><b> E. Freedom of expression  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>130. Both the Human Rights Council (in its resolution S-15/1) and the Security Council 
(in its resolution 1970 (2011)) have made specific reference to concern regarding issues 
surrounding freedom of expression. The Council called upon the Government of the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya to cease intimidation, persecution and arbitrary arrests of individuals, 
including journalists (Council resolution S-15/1, para. 3), while the Security Council 
condemned acts of violence and intimidation committed by the Libyan authorities against 
journalists, media professionals and associated personnel (Security Council resolution, 
para. 6).88 The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented more than 80 attacks on 
the press between 16 February and 20 May, which includes 5 fatalities, at least 3 serious 
injuries, 50 detentions, 11 assaults, 2 attacks on news facilities, the jamming of Al-Jazeera 
and Alhurra transmissions, at least four 4 of obstruction of journalists&#8223; activities and 
expulsion of 2 international journalists.89 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>131. International human rights law expressly provides for freedom of expression, which 
includes the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, 
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any 
other media of choice. While it can be subject to restrictions, these are to be only such as

<p>are provided for by law and are necessary for respect for the rights or reputations of others, 
for the protection of national security, public order, public health or morals (art. 19 of the 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). The Human Rights Committee has referred to the 
role of journalists in disseminating information and the way in which attacks on journalists, 
whether in the form of arbitrary arrests, torture, killings or other means are incompatible 
with article 19.90 Under international humanitarian law, journalists are civilians and thus 
entitled to the range of protections for civilian personnel,91 as underlined in Security 
Council resolution 1378 (2001). While the Rome Statute does not refer specifically to 
attacks against journalists, particular actions can be considered within the existing 
framework of war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>132. Reports received by the Commission indicate that Libyan authorities frequently 
resorted to action aimed at restricting the dissemination of information including cutting off 
landlines, Internet access and media outlets. A significant number of interviewees informed 
the Commission of an extensive media blackout implemented by authorities, particularly in 
the eastern part of the country. Social networking and mobile phones used by groups to 
rally support for demonstrations were also reportedly blocked. Internet connections were 
slowed down in major cities and various websites were blocked, in particular those that 
relayed views that were not sympathetic towards the Government. According to several 
media sources, around 18 February, Twitter, Facebook and Al-Jazeera websites were 
blocked.92 According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO), the authorities also jammed the signal of foreign media.93 
</p>
<p>133. Persons who were using mobile phones to take photograph or to film the 
demonstrations were allegedly arrested and had their phones seized by security forces. One 
man interviewed by the Commission reported that persons were prevented from filming 
injured persons in Tajurah on 25 February by security forces. The Commission also 
received information suggesting that the Government forces continued to confiscate 
electronic equipment, including mobile phones, cameras, computer and memory sticks, 
from persons leaving Libya in order to prevent the transmission of information outside the 
country.94 </p>
<p>134. Media activists based in Tripoli reported restrictions on means of communication 
and reported remaining under persistent Government surveillance. Some foreign journalists 
faced expulsion. Several received warnings from the authorities to leave the country.95

</p>
<p> 94 The Commission interviewed several foreign nationals and Libyans fleeing the fighting towards 
Tunisia who reported that their SIM cards were broken and phones taken away by Government forces 
at checkpoints to conceal evidence they may possess. 
</p>
<p> 95 On 30 March 2011, Libyan authorities expelled, without justification, Michael Georgy, a Reuter&#8223;s 
correspondent who had been covering the conflict since 28 February. See Reuters, &#8220;Libyan

</p>
<p> </p>


<p>Specific actions by Government forces were taken to restrict reporting. On 4 March, for 
instance, authorities prevented international journalists from reporting on a Government 
crackdown on protesters in Tajurah District. 
</p>
<p>135. According to media reports, on 16 February, Libyan security forces reportedly 
arrested four persons being interviewed by a journalist in Al-Izba al-Khadrah, Tripoli. The 
detainees were subsequently transferred to an undisclosed location. One person interviewed 
by the Commission reported that he was forced to flee Libya upon receiving threats of 
attack or arrest by Government forces after having spoken with international media<i>. </i>The 
treatment of journalists at the event in which Iman al-Obeidi shared her account of being 
gang-raped by Government forces has been well-publicized. Security guards were said to 
have physically assaulted some journalists who attempted to protect her and destroyed the 
cameras and recording equipment of those who had recorded her statement.96 
</p>
<p>136. Journalists and media personnel have themselves been subject to arbitrary detention 
and disappearance. Foreign journalists were constantly watched by Government officials 
and routinely detained by security forces. Staff working for eight news outlets, including 
the Los Angeles Times, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Agence France-
Presse, were detained on 5 March outside Az-Zawiyah for nearly seven hours.97 During a 
visit to Al-Jdaydah Detention Centre, the Commission interviewed a Tunisian-Canadian 
journalist and correspondent of the Canadian newspaper, who had been arrested on 17 
March 2011 after crossing into Libya from the Al-Dehiba crossing point, south-east of 
Tunisia. This journalist was eventually released on 19 May, after spending over 60 days in 
prison.98 The journalist informed the Commission that, upon his entry into Libya, the 
Libyans took him to prison. Although he did not report ill-treatment while inside the prison, 
there were concerns about his psychological and physical integrity. He was not brought 
before a competent court nor were charges levelled against him. He was allowed once to 
make a phone call. 
</p>
<p>137. Attacks against journalists and media professionals continue to be reported and are 
escalating. This has included killings, expulsion and enforced disappearances. There have 
been reported cases of the authorities being viewed as inciting violence against 
journalists.99 On 24 February, in an interview with Al-Jazeera, Saif al-Islam attacked the 
Arab media for broadcasting what he referred to as &#8220;lies&#8221;, adding that it was a media war. 
He stated &#8220;the conspiracy does not come from Libyans but from your Arab brothers who

</p>
<p>138. The Commission has received reports that at least five journalists have been killed, 
while others have endured harassment, torture and detention incommunicado. In one of the 
incidents, the Commission received information that, on 12 March, Ali Hassan Al Jaber, a 
cameraman for the Al-Jazeera television network was killed and his colleague injured in an 
ambush on the outskirts of Benghazi. The team was on their way back to Benghazi from a 
trip to Slough where they had been conducting interviews with demonstrators. Two masked 
assailants opened fire on their car in the middle of the road between Al-Nuwagia and Al-
Hawari. </p>
<p>139. On 20 April, photojournalist and film-maker Tim Hetherington101 and photographer 
Chris Hondros102 were killed and two other non-Libyan co-workers were injured in what 
appears to be a mortar attack in the city of Misrata.103 According to information received, 
Mr. Hetherington and Mr. Hondros were among other journalists reporting from Tripoli 
Street in Misrata when the incident occurred. 
</p>
<p>140. On 5 April on the outskirts of Al-Brega, Anton Hammerl was with three other 
journalists104 covering the fighting when he was shot and killed by Government forces. One 
of his colleagues present at the time, James Foley, was quoted in the Globalpost as saying 
that they witnessed two armoured Libyan military trucks carrying pro-Qadhafi troops who 
were firing AK-47s over their heads: &#8220;We thought we were in the crossfire. But eventually, 
we realized they were shooting at us. You could see and hear the bullets hitting the ground

<p>clothes.&#8221; One man grabbed her breasts and another punched her in the face. Others 
explained that they were repeatedly beaten with punch, rifle butts and continuously told 
they were going to die. They were transported into a vehicle, which stopped repeatedly at 
checkpoints, each time allowing for a new group of soldiers to land a fresh punch or a rifle 
butt in their backs.108 </p>
<p>142. A three-person BBC news team was detained on 7 March at an army roadblock and 
taken to a military barrack in Tripoli. They reported that they were blindfolded, beaten with 
fists, knees and rifles, hooded and subjected to mock executions by members of the Libyan 
army and secret police. One of the three, Chris Cobb Smith was quoted saying that the 
situation inside the detention centre was horrendous, with people being handcuffed with 
swelling hands and broken ribs. He stated that at one point a guy in plainclothes with a 
small sub-machine gun, walked up to him, putting his gun next to his neck and pulling the 
trigger twice. The bullet whisked past his ear. The soldier just laughed. The second member 
of the team, Feras Killani, a correspondent of Palestinian descent, was particularly singled 
out for repeated beatings and was accused of being a spy. At some point, they were all 
convinced they were going to die.109 
</p>
<p>143. There have also been a significant number of disappearances of journalists reported. 
The Commission drew the attention of the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to 
the cases of at least 18 journalists and other media professionals, including both Libyans 
and foreigners, who went missing in Libya and whose whereabouts remains unknown. The 
Commission wrote to the Libyan authorities on 26 April and 5 May, registering concerns 
with regards to the cases of 18 missing journalists and requested thorough investigations of 
these cases. Among the cases referred by the Commission to Libyan authorities were six 
Libyan journalists, who have been missing since February. On 19 May 2011, the 
Commission, in a letter to the Libyan authorities, welcomed the release of four journalists110 
and urged them to look into the cases of the remaining detained journalists with a view to 
releasing them. The Commission also renewed its appeal for the release on humanitarian 
grounds of the two detained journalists Lotfi Ghars and Mohamed Ali Abdelrahman, with 
whom the Commission met during the visit to Al-Jdaydah detention centre in Tripoli. The 
Commission received guarantees by the Libyan authorities, who vowed to investigate the 
cases of missing journalists and assured the Commission that they would be released before 
June 2011. On 25 May 2011, the Libyan authorities informed the Commission through a 
letter that Mr. Ghars had been released, but that Mr. Abdelrahman remained in detention 
awaiting trial on charges including the dissemination of incorrect information. The 
Commission has been disturbed by reports of the killing of one of the journalists that the 
Commission inquired about, Anton Hammerl, who had been killed on 5 April at the 
outskirts of Al-Brega (see paragraph 140 above). 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>144. During its investigations, the Commission has established that Government forces 
were responsible for attacks on journalists and other media professionals, designed 
primarily to stifle coverage of the Government response to the demonstrations, the ongoing 
armed conflict and/or to retaliate for perceived or feared criticisms of the regime. Media 
professionals have been subject to arbitrary arrest, torture, ill-treatment, harassment, 
intimidation, enforced disappearances and in some cases have been the object of targeted

<p>attacks. In addition, authorities took specific action to impede the flow of information 
(within as well as outside the country), including cutting landline telephone 
communications, Internet access and other means of communication. Such actions 
represent violations of the Government&#8223;s obligation under international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Attacks on civilians, civilian objects, protected persons and objects  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>145. During the armed conflict which has emerged in Libya, there have been a range of 
reports made concerning attacks on civilians and civilian objects, either alleging intentional 
targeting or indiscriminate attacks or attacks having a disproportionate impact on civilian 
populations. Limited access to cities where fighting was ongoing and the fluid dynamics of 
the conflict limited the collection of accurate data and hindered the Commission&#8223;s ability to 
verify information received. Thus, the Commission has not had full access to information 
regarding the relevant military targets in particular locations, nor indeed was able to verify 
the status of all affected persons. It has received, however, significant information 
concerning the impact of the conflict on civilians and civilian objects and certain general 
contextual information through speaking to over 115 persons and reviewing other material. 
In this section, the first part deals with intentional or indiscriminate attacks on civilians and 
civilian objects in general, with the latter part examining allegations with respect to persons 
and objects enjoying an explicit protected status under international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law  
</b></p>
<p>146. In times of armed conflict, international humanitarian law is the <i>lex specialis.</i> 
International humanitarian law prohibits the intentional targeting of civilians111 and 
indiscriminate attack on civilians.112 Forces are to distinguish between civilian and military 
persons.113 Forces must also distinguish between civilian and military objects. Deliberate 
attacks on civilian objects are prohibited. The notion of &#8220;civilian objects&#8221; embraces all 
objects (e.g. houses, private dwellings, orchards, schools, shelters, hospitals, churches, 
mosques, synagogues, museums and works of art) that neither serve nor are used for 
military purposes. Attacks on places where both civilian and combatants may be found are 
prohibited if they are not directed at a specific military objective or if they use methods or 
means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective. It is prohibited 
to launch an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to 
civilians, and/or damage to civilian objects which would be excessive in relation to the 
anticipated concrete and direct military advantage.114 
</p>
<p>147. In order to protect civilians, customary international law requires parties to take 
precautions including to: 
</p>
<p>(a) Do everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives; 
</p>
<p>  
 111 See Protocol II, article 13, paragraph 1: &#8220;The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy 
</p>
<p>general protection against the dangers arising from military operations.&#8221; See also paragraph 2: &#8220;The 
civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack&#8221;. Common 
</p>
<p>article 3 prohibits &#8220;violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds&#8221; against persons 
taking no active part in hostilities. 
</p>
<p> 112 See rule 11, ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, p. 37. 
 113 Implicit in article 13, paragraph 2, of Protocol II and rule 1, ICRC Study on Customary International 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Law, p. 3.  
 114 See rule 14, ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, p 46. </p>


<p>(b) Take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of combat 
with a view to avoiding and in any event to minimizing incidental loss of civilian life, 
injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects; 
</p>
<p>(c) Do everything feasible to assess extent to which the attack may be expected 
to cause incidental damage and refrain from launching attacks which may be expected to 
cause incidental loss of civilian life or injury to civilians or civilian objects, which would be 
excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated; and to 
cancel/suspend an attack should it become apparent that the target is not a military 
objective or that the incidental damage would be excessive; 
</p>
<p>(d) Give effective advance warning of attacks which may affect the civilian 
population unless circumstances do not permit, for example, where a surprise attack is 
necessary to the success of an operation; 
</p>
<p>(e) When a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a 
similar military advantage, the objective to be selected must be that the attack on which 
may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.115 
</p>
<p>148. International humanitarian law also incorporates specific protections for persons or 
objects. Of particular relevance in the current conflict are the following rules. It is 
prohibited to commit an act of hostility directed against historic monuments, works or art or 
places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples (art. 16 of 
Protocol II). Attacking, destroying, removing or otherwise rendering useless objects which 
are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population is prohibited (article 14 of the 
Protocol II). Sieges must still allow for vital foodstuffs and other essential supplies to be 
delivered to the civilian population.116 Parties to a conflict are obliged to allow and facilitate 
the unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need.117 Humanitarian relief 
personnel must be respected and protected as well as objects used for humanitarian relief 
operations.118 
</p>
<p>149. Detailed international humanitarian law provisions deal with the protection of 
medical personnel and associated topics. Medical personnel and medical units and transport 
must be respected and protected in all circumstances. This rule is implicit in common 
article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which requires that wounded and sick be collected and 
cared for. It receives more explicit recognition under Protocol II which requires respect and 
protection of medical personnel, medical units and medical transport, which must not be the 
object of attack (arts. 9, para. 1, and 11, para. 1),119 which also provides specific rules 
regarding tending to the wounded and sick (see, for instance, article 8). The distinctive 
emblem of the red cross/red crescent is to be displayed by medical units and on medical 
transports and is to be respected in all circumstances. It is not to be used improperly (art. 
12). 
</p>
<p>150. There are also a range of guarantees under international human rights law of 
particular relevance for this topic. This includes not only the prohibition of arbitrary 
</p>
<p>  
 115 See rules 15&#8211;21, ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, pp. 51&#8211;67. 
 116 While sieges to achieve a military objective are permitted, sieges that cause starvation are not (see 
</p>
<p>article 14 of Protocol II). The passage of foodstuffs and other essential supplies must be permitted: 
see rules 53 and 55 of the ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, pp. 186 and 
</p><p>193. 
</p>
<p> 117 See rule 55 of the ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, p. 193. 
 118 See rules 31&#8211;32 of the ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, pp. 105and 109. 
</p>
<p>Note also article 8, paragraph 2 (e) (iii) of the Rome Statute. 
 119 Medical personnel, units and transport lose their protection if they are being used, outside their 
</p>
<p>humanitarian function, to commit acts harmful to the enemy: see article 11, para. 2 of the Protocol. </p>


<p>deprivation of life (art. 6 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), but the right to the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (art. 12 of the Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), the right to an adequate standard of living (art. 11 
of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), freedom of religion (art. 18 of 
the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) and cultural rights (art. 15 of the 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and art. 27 of the Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights). 
</p>
<p>151. Under the Rome Statute, there are a variety of war crimes that correspond to 
breaches of many of the international humanitarian law guarantees. These include the war 
crimes of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against 
individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities, intentionally directing attacks 
against civilian buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science or charitable 
purposes, historic monuments, hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are 
collected, provided they are not military objectives, intentionally directing attacks against 
medical units and transport, and personnel using the distinctive emblems of the Geneva 
Conventions in conformity with international law (art. 8, para. 2 (e)) in addition to the war 
crimes representing serious violations of Common Article 3 (art. 8, para. 2 (c)). Particular 
type of attacks against civilians (including medical personnel) may also amount to a crime 
against humanity if committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any 
civilian population, with knowledge of the attack. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Intentional or indiscriminate attacks on civilians 
</i></p>
<p>152. The Commission received considerable information from witnesses concerning 
intentional or indiscriminate attacks on civilians or attacks having a disproportionate impact 
on civilians. During its field missions, civilian witnesses raised examples in three locations 
in particular: Ajdabiya, Nafusa Mountain and Misrata.120 
</p>
<p>153. <b>Ajdabiya</b>:<b> </b>The Commission received information about heavy fighting in Ajdabiya 
where artillery and rocket-propelled grenades were reportedly used. One witness referred to 
the case of a family whose car was hit by a rocket exploding 10 meters away while they 
were fleeing the fighting in Ajdabiya. As a result, three family members were killed and 
two others were injured, including an 8-year-old boy treated in the Benghazi Medical 
Centre. A doctor working in Ajdabiya noted to the Commission that the wounds of the 
injured persons treated in this city were consistent with the use of arms with high calibre 
and missiles. 
</p>
<p>154. <b>Nafusa Mountain area</b>: One person interviewed from the Kikla District of Nafusa 
Mountain, informed the Commission that Government forces had been firing mortars and 
Grad rockets into residential areas of the Nafusa Mountain since 13 April 2011, leading to 
many casualties and causing fear and panic within the community. The Grad rockets, he 
added, had been fired in a random and indiscriminate manner towards the mountainous area 
and had landed over a wide residential area, inflicting large-scale civilian casualties. Other 
witnesses confirmed that the Nafusa Mountain area had been under bombardment since the 
beginning of April 2011 with little apparent distinction being made between civilian and 
military targets. One witness referred to a bombardment in Kikla District, causing the death 
of at least 11 civilians, including women and children. 
</p>
<p>  
 120 There have been reports of attacks on civilians in many locations in Libya. The choice of the two 
</p>
<p>areas featured in this report is based upon locations where the Commission gathered first-hand 
information and should not be taken as indicative of allegations being limited to these areas. </p>


<p>155. 165. Borders and crossing points were identified as a particular site of 
indiscriminate shelling, including firing from the Libyan-Tunisian border towards the Al-
Dehiba crossing point. Medical staff from Zintan reported the killing of four shepherds by 
members of the Sahab <i>Katiba</i>. The doctor reported that most of the seriously injured 
coming to the clinic where he worked in Zintan, suffered wounds from heavy weaponry 
such as anti-aircraft weapons, tank shells, Katyusha and Grad missile.  
</p>
<p>156. <b>Misrata</b>: The Commission received a number of accounts of indiscriminate attacks 
on civilians in Misrata. The exact number of civilian casualties is unconfirmed. In a 
statement on 11 April, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa 
stated that the Fund had verified at least 20 deaths and many more injuries due to shrapnel 
from mortars and tanks and bullet wounds. A senior medical doctor and an administrator of 
the city&#8223;s main hospital was quoted in the media as stating that as of 18 April, about 1,000 
people had been killed and 3,000 injured, with some 80 per cent of the deaths being 
civilian.121 Following an inter-agency assessment mission to Misrata on 21 and 22 May, the 
World Health Organization stated that &#8220;although medical records were very much affected 
during the conflict, figures collected suggest that an average of 70 people were injured and 
12 killed everyday&#8221;.122 In many of the cases, while the Commission was able to establish 
that many civilians (including children) have been killed or injured, the Commission was 
not able to determine the full circumstances of the attacks in order to be able to evaluate 
whether the attacks were intentional, indiscriminate and/or disproportionate. There were 
numerous cases of shells hitting houses causing fires and persons being killed when shots 
entered their cars. Many persons from Misrata reported that they had suffered injuries at 
check points as a result of rounds launched by Government forces. Reports were also 
received of snipers taking aim and shooting at any and all persons who left their homes near 
the Bu Minyar building, which was one of the three tall buildings utilized by snipers 
supporting the efforts of Government forces in Misrata. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Attacks on cultural objects and places of worship 
</i></p>
<p>157. In Libya, mosques are not just places of worship for Muslims, who constitute the 
overwhelming majority of the population, they also have become, by default, the only 
gathering place of the population that is not under full control of the authorities. During the 
demonstration period, there were occasions in which authorities fired on persons as they 
came out of the mosque, after Friday prayers or after religious ceremonies for those who 
had died during the crisis. The Commission received credible reports, supported by 
photographs, that mosques were damaged by shelling during attacks by Government forces 
on inhabited areas. More investigation would be required to determine if the attacks were 
intentional or incidental. Witnesses from the Nafusa Mountain told the Commission that 
mosques were intentionally targeted, with particular reference made to Takut Mosque, Al-
Baruni Mosque in Yafran, Zintan Mosque, Kikla Mosque and Kut Mosque between March 
and April 2011. Human Rights Watch stated that Government attacks hit four mosques in 
Zintan as of 21 April, namely, the Al-Khalil, Ali Hdibah, Al-Aswad and Rahmah Mosques, 
as well as a Ghasro Mosque in Takut. Amnesty International reported that on 17 April 
rocket and mortar attacks in Misrata were ongoing and there was extensive damage to 
Omar Abdel Aziz al-Senusi Mosque.123 The Commission did not receive any information 
suggesting the use of mosques for military purposes. Human Rights Watch, in their report

<p>on attacks on mosques, stated that the rebels had never used nor been present in the 
mosques or the surrounding neighbourhoods.124 
</p>
<p>158. The Commission also received specific information about a site considered of 
cultural importance by the Amazigh community of the Nafusa Mountain area, The Ben 
Niran Palace (Ghasrow Majar in Tamazight language). The Palace was destroyed by 
Government forces, with one witness putting the date as 2 or 3 April 2011. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Destruction of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population 
</i></p>
<p>159. The Commission received numerous accounts, particularly in the Nafusa Mountain 
area, of the destruction of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population. In 
some cases, the allegation was of deliberate destruction. In others, it would appear that the 
damage may have been collateral. One witness spoke of livestock being deliberately killed 
with small firearms and agricultural land being burnt down. Another witness in the same 
area noted that &#8220;shelling has spared neither livestock nor agriculture lands, with reports of 
burning fields, and killing of livestock&#8221;.125 A witness from Yafran also spoke of &#8220;livestock, 
farms, and crop growing have been hit intentionally in Zintan in particular to ensure that 
people under the siege would be deprived of food leading to malnutrition and ultimately to 
starvation&#8221;. </p>
<p>160. Another testimony referred to &#8220;Qadhafi forces entering villages, robbing belongings 
of residents, and burning down houses after killing what remains of the livestock&#8221;. Two 
witnesses mentioned the contamination of wells by Government forces. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Impeding access to humanitarian relief and attacks on humanitarian personnel 
</i></p>
<p>161. There has been a long-term siege of cities or entire areas by the Government forces 
in the Nafusa Mountain area and Misrata and more briefly in Ajdabiya, Az-Zawiyah and 
Zuwarah. The Commission heard from witnesses particularly from the Nafusa Mountain 
area and Misrata that the effect of such sieges has been to prevent food and other vital 
supplies being received. The blockading of cities, in particular the cutting of power and 
water supplies, and the limiting of food supplies has particular implications for the 
population&#8223;s human rights, including their right to an adequate standard of living (art. 11 of 
the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). The Secretary-General of the 
United Nations and the Executive Director of the World Food Programme called on 11 and 
12 May respectively for a ceasefire to allow humanitarian access to Misrata and the western 
area but these calls have not been heeded by the Government.126 On 27 May, the medical 
NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres announced it was withdrawing from Zintan, where it had 
been working for four weeks, due to the intensity of the fighting and the fact that &#8220;several 
rockets [had been] landing just 100 to 200 metres from the hospital&#8221;.127

<p><i> (e) Attacks on humanitarian personnel and transport 
</i></p>
<p>162. In Misrata, one boat on which humanitarian activities were being conducted was 
shelled by Government forces.128 A number of humanitarian organizations conducting 
resupply (food and non-food items, medical supplies and equipment) and evacuation 
missions by boat to Misrata129 have been endangered by actions of Government forces. 
There have been reports of fire coming from the mainland on 25 April,130 anti-vehicle 
mines being dropped from shells over the port on 29 April and 5 May and sea mines being 
placed without notice.131 Reuters reported that the Government of the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya acknowledged the aforesaid shelling on local television, but justified it by 
stating that the boats were breaching the arms blockade and carrying fighters.132 
</p>
<p>163. The Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya transmitted information to the 
Commission which had been prepared originally at the request of the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. In the 21-page report received on 12 May, negative 
consequences of the implementation of Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 
(2011) on food production and import of foodstuff to Libya are detailed. The report points 
to difficulties in paying for the import of food, other imported goods and spare parts owing 
to the imposition of financial sanctions. It also refers to the mass departure of foreign 
labour from the farming, fishing and industrial sectors (producing fertilizers, pesticides and 
animal feed) leading to the mass death of uncared-for livestock and the impossibility of 
flying small aircrafts used in agriculture due to the no-fly zone. The Government also refers 
to the breakdown of communication between regions of the country preventing transport of 
inputs and food stuff, and to loss of access to water and suspension of work on several 
water supply projects. The report provides preliminary data on the drop in food production 
and makes alarming forecasts on the upcoming grain harvests. 
</p>
<p><i> (f) Attacks on protected medical personnel, transport and facilities 
</i></p>
<p>164. The Commission notes that the deteriorating security situation has had a deleterious 
effect on the health sector, as it has led to the exodus of many foreign medical workers 
from Libya. Major areas, including much of eastern Libya, Misrata and the Nafusa 
Mountain area progressively lost access to the network of medicines for chronic disease 
distributed by the Ministry of Health. The Commission has also received reports of the 
intentional targeting of protected medical personnel, transport, units and facilities. Several 
cases from Misrata were related to the Commission. A volunteer ambulance staff member 
in Misrata told the Commission that, &#8220;his ambulance team went out to collect two wounded 
persons who required assistance near the medical clinic compound. When he stepped out 
from the ambulance, shootings started and he said that &#8220;a sniper&#8221; shot the driver at the head 
</p>
<p>and killed him. Another volunteer in the ambulance and himself were injured. A second

<p>ambulance arrived to rescue them, raising a white flag and negotiating the possibility to 
approach the wounded persons through a microphone&#8221;.133 </p>
<p>165. On 17 May, ICRC stated that &#8220;the Libyan Red Crescent reports that in the past four 
days, three of its ambulances have been hit in three separate incidents, resulting in the death 
of a nurse and injuries to a patient and three volunteers&#8221;.134 The responsible party in these 
three incidents can not be ascertained by the Commission without further investigation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>166. Reports from eastern Libya also mention ambulances being shot at. One witness told 
the Commission of seeing an ambulance being targeted at Ajdabiya, with another witness (a 
fighter with NTC) reporting on the shooting of the ambulance carrying him and wounded 
fighters. A former fighter with NTC in Yafran also stated that Government forces hit 
ambulances. 
</p>
<p>167. Attacks on hospitals<b> </b>have been repeatedly reported to the Commission. A fighter 
with the opposition forces from Yafran told the Commission that a mortar round had hit 
Yafran hospital in March 2011, leading to the destruction of main parts of the medical 
facility. A witness from Al Hikma Clinic in Misrata told the Commission that it had been 
targeted twice by Government forces but was still functioning. A doctor from Misrata told 
media that the Misrata hospital had been targeted by Government tanks.135 In another media 
account on 6 March, it was reported that in Az-Zawiyah pro-Qadhafi forces attacked the 
forecourt of the hospital where injured were being treated. On 23 March, Reuters reported 
that Qadhafi forces bombarded the main hospital in Misrata as doctors were trying to move 
the wounded away from the hospital: &#8220;The snipers are shooting at the hospital and its two 
entrances are under heavy attack. No one can get in or out&#8221;, a Misrata resident, told Reuters 
by telephone. Amnesty International, in its report on the siege of Misrata, noted that on 16 
April, the surroundings of a clinic were shelled at least three times according to 
eyewitnesses, who were themselves wounded.136 The Commission also received 
information from several witnesses concerning the destruction of hospital supplies 
including medications. 
</p>
<p>168. Similar to reports received during the demonstration period outlined in chapter III, 
section A, the Commission also received information concerning the abduction of patients 
from hospitals. On 16 March, the Fondation Alkarama stated in a press release that &#8220;injured 
rebel forces and innocent civilians are being kidnapped from hospitals, risking torture, even 
death. As a consequence, the wounded are refusing to seek medical assistance for fear of 
being kidnapped or killed.&#8221;137 In Zintan, a doctor mentioned that the wounded treated at his 
hospital were not registered as there was a fear that the Government would regain control 
and detain the injured.

<p><i> (g) Misuse of the red cross/red crescent emblem 
</i></p>
<p>169. The Commission heard evidence of several instances of misusing the Red Cross/Red 
Crescent emblem. In Nalut in the Nafusa Mountain area, for instance, a witness told the 
Commission of ambulances being used &#8220;as a trick, to enter towns carrying soldiers, and 
</p>
<p>then shoot at civilians in the street&#8221;, raising also the issue of perfidy. Similar stories 
emerged from Yafran. The Commission also notes the widely reported case on 8 May 
relating to sightings of one or several helicopters over Misrata port dropping mines in 
violation of the no-fly zone on 5 May. The helicopters, according to some, but not all media 
sources, carried either the red cross or the red crescent. In a statement issued on 9 May, 
ICRC expressed its concern at what it considered &#8220;recent allegations of the red cross or red 
crescent emblem being used for military purposes in Libya&#8221; and added that &#8220;the alleged 
practices, if true, represent a serious misuse of the emblem&#8221;.138 On 17 May ICRC issued 
another statement on the dire situation in Misrata and mentioned receiving &#8220;allegations 
</p>
<p>concerning the misuse of the red cross and red crescent emblems to support military 
operations and the use of ambulances to transport arms and weapon bearers&#8221;.139 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>170. Due to the circumstances of the current conflict, the Commission has not had access 
to full information allowing it to definitively evaluate allegations of all of these violations 
of international humanitarian law.140 However, the Commission has received consistent 
information concerning the level of injuries and type of victims to suggest that there have 
been at least indiscriminate attacks against civilians by Government forces and a failure to 
take sufficient precautionary steps to protect civilians. Further investigation would be 
necessary to determine whether there was intentional targeting of civilians. Protected 
objects such as mosques and cultural objects have certainly been damaged during conflict. 
The Commission at this point is unable to determine whether attacks on such objects were 
intentional. The Commission is able to establish that there have been instances of the 
deliberate destruction of objects indispensable to the civilian population. The Commission 
considers that there have been some attacks on medical transports and facilities which 
appear to have been targeted attacks, with some other attacks requiring further 
investigation. It is also considers that Libyan authorities have failed to facilitate access for 
humanitarian agencies to address the needs of civilian populations in Libya. It considers 
that there have been attacks on humanitarian units, although it is not able to establish 
whether these were intentional or not without further information. The Commission does 
conclude that there has been a failure to take precautionary steps to minimize damage to 
civilian/protected objects. The Commission is also satisfied that there has been misuse of 
the Red Cross/Red Crescent emblem by Government forces in Libya during the conflict. 
The Commission did not receive any first-hand information concerning violations by the 
armed opposition force and as such is not in a position to determine whether any relevant 
violations occurred.

<p><b> G. Prohibited weapons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>171. Available information suggests that over the past few decades Colonel Qadhafi has 
acquired and stockpiled a large arsenal of weapons.141 There have been allegations made 
about the use of weapons in a manner contrary to international law. The Commission has 
only had access to a limited number of victims and has not been able to access sites 
involved in reports of prohibited weapons to collect forensic evidence or to collect evidence 
from victims&#8223; wounds or other medical records in a comprehensive manner. However, the 
Commission&#8223;s preliminary investigations indicate matters of concern worthy of further 
</p>
<p>consideration. In this section, the Commission considers both weapons prohibited as a 
matter of international law and lawful weapons allegedly used in a manner so as to be 
unlawful under international law. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>172. International humanitarian law prohibits the use of means and methods of warfare 
which are of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering.142 As the ICRC 
publication <i>Customary International Humanitarian Law</i> highlights, there are differing 
views as to whether this rule renders a weapon illegal or whether a weapon is illegal only if 
a specific treaty or customary rule prohibits its use (p. 242). The International Court of 
Justice in the <i>Nuclear Weapons</i> case, however, undertook its analysis on the basis of the 
rule itself,143 without requiring treaty law and this approach has been adopted by the 
Commission here. Other rules of general application in this area include the prohibition of 
the use of weapons which are by their nature indiscriminate, arising out of the duty to direct 
hostilities to legitimate military objectives. 
</p>
<p>173. As noted in paragraph 63 of the present report, Libya has ratified certain weapons 
conventions, but is not a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, 
Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, 1977, or to the 
Convention on Cluster Munitions, 2008. The general norms from customary international 
humanitarian law must thus be applied to these situations. In addition to the general 
principles noted above, there are some other specific rules of customary international 
humanitarian law relating to for instance, landmines (requiring particular care to minimize 
their indiscriminate effects),144 and expanding bullets.145

 145 Rule 77 of the ICRC Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law states that the use of 
</p>
<p>bullets which expand or flatten easily in the body is prohibited in both international and non-
international armed conflict. In 2010, the Rome Statute was amended to include article 8, paragraph 2 
(e) (xv), specifically prohibiting the use of &#8220;employing bullets which expand or flatten easily in the 
human body, such as bullets with a hard envelope which does not entirely cover the core or is pierced 
with incisions&#8221;. This amendment is not yet in force, but will enter into force for a State party one year 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>174. <b>Expanding bullets</b>: Three doctors interviewed by the Commission in Benghazi and 
one in Al-Bayda gave accounts of wounds that they had treated, whose cause may be 
consistent with the use of &#8220;expanding&#8221; bullets. Doctors and victims have described small 
entry wounds and larger exit wounds, a circle of 7 or 10 cm in diameter in some cases.146 
Doctors have also described small entry wounds with various internal organs shredded by 
the bullet. Further investigation, including military and forensic pathologist expertise is, 
however, required to confirm or deny the usage of expanding bullets. 
</p>
<p>175. <b>Cluster munitions</b>: The Commission is aware of reports of the use of cluster 
munitions by pro-Government forces in their attempt to regain control of the besieged city 
of Misrata. On 15 April 2011, Human Rights Watch reported that Government forces had 
fired cluster munitions in residential neighbourhoods of Misrata further specifying that the 
cluster munitions were the Spanish-produced MAT-120mm mortar projectile, which open 
in mid-air and release 21 submunitions over a wide area.147 Other independent sources 
including Amnesty International have confirmed the incident and stated that Spain sold 
such munitions to Libya in 2007. Further investigation, including military and forensic 
pathologist expertise is, however, required to confirm or deny the usage of cluster 
munitions. 
</p>
<p>176. <b>Mines</b>: The Commission notes the rule of customary international humanitarian law 
requiring that where landmines are used, particular care must be taken to minimize their 
indiscriminate effects.148 Information collected from various sources including Human 
Rights Watch indicates that anti-tank mines in Colonel Qadhafi&#8223;s hands are made mostly 
out of hard-to-detect plastic and can be armed with an anti-lifting device that causes the 
mine to explode when attempts are made to remove it from the ground, making them 
particularly dangerous. On 24 March, Human Rights Watch confirmed the discovery of this 
type of anti-vehicle mines in the area around Ghar Yunis University in Benghazi. A United 
Nations demining expert located 12 warehouses filled with tens of thousands of anti-vehicle 
mines.149 Though landmines in border areas are a legacy of the past150 it has also been 
reported that anti-personnel and anti-vehicle landmines have been newly laid by 
Government forces, particularly in the outskirts of Ajdabiya151 and in Benghazi.152 Human 
Rights Watch reported that 24 anti-vehicle mines and roughly three dozen anti-personnel 
</p>
<p>  
after ratifying the amendment. There remains some debate as to whether customary international law 
includes a blanket prohibition on the use of expanding bullets in non-international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p> 146 The accounts of at least five injured persons interviewed in Alexandria match the description of 
wounds that may have been caused by expanding bullets. 
</p>
<p> 147 Upon exploding on contact with an object, each submunition disintegrates into high-velocity 
fragments to attack people and releases a slug of molten metal to penetrate armoured vehicles. Human

</p>
<p>1980&#8211;1987. 
 151 It was reported by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International that on 28 March 2011 two 
</p>
<p>antipersonnel mines detonated, 1 km from Ajdabiya town, when a truck of Eastern Libya Electricity 
Company was passing by. After the incident, a clearance operation was conducted by a civil defence 
team which reported having disarmed 24 anti-vehicles mines and more than 30 plastic anti-personnel 
mines. 
</p>
<p> 152 Human Rights Watch reported that during the retreat of Government forces on 19 March 2011 in 
Benghazi, anti-vehicle mines were left behind in the area around Ghar Yunis University. </p>


<p>mines were found on the eastern outskirts of Ajdabiya, a town that was held by 
Government forces between 17 and 27 March 2011. Human Rights Watch said that the 
mines, because of their location, posed a direct threat to civilians. </p>
<p>177. <b>Use of phosphorous weapons</b>: The Commission received some information 
pertaining to the possible use of phosphorous weapons. A doctor in Benghazi who met with 
the Commission described injuries that might be consistent with those produced by 
explosive ordinances containing phosphorus. At Al-Jalaa&#8223; Hospital, Benghazi, the 
Commission was provided with photos of the bodies of nine persons who had been brought 
to the hospital during the second half of February. The bodies were burnt but were shrunk 
in such a way that may be consistent with the use of phosphorous weapons. A Human 
Rights Watch report refers to the Government forces having access to white phosphorous 
artillery projectiles.153 Further investigation, including military and forensic pathologist 
expertise, would be required to verify the usage of such weapons.  </p>
<p>178. <b>Mortars</b>: Based upon the facts available to it, the Commission believes that 
Government forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya utilized mortars in their attacks on 
Misrata and Zintan. Mortars are weapons that kill or maim whoever is within the impact 
zone after they explode and they are unable to distinguish between combatants and 
civilians. A decision to deploy them in a location where a large number of civilians is likely 
to be present, is a decision that a commander should know will result in the death and/or 
and injuries of some of those civilians. </p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>179. From the information available to it, the Commission is concerned that the Libyan 
authorities have not been undertaking appropriate and precautionary assessments which 
would, in the Commission&#8223;s view, militate against the use of weapons, such as mortars, in 
</p>
<p>densely urban areas. The Commission is also concerned about reports of the use of weapons 
such as expanding bullets, cluster munitions or phosphorous weapons within highly 
populated areas.<b> </b>Further investigation, however, including forensic analysis would be 
needed to confirm the usage of these ammunitions. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Use of mercenaries 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>180. Allegations concerning the use of mercenaries during the armed conflict in Libya 
have been widely reported.154 The Security Council, in its resolution 1973 (2011), deplored 
</p>

<p> 154 For instance, Ali al-Essawi, former Libyan Ambassador to India, told Al-Jazeera that &#8220;People say

<p>the continued use of mercenaries by Libyan authorities (preambular para. 16). The 
Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has referred to the Al-Qaida mercenaries 
operating within the ranks of opposition armed forces. As the Commission carried out its 
investigation, it also received reports of the use of mercenaries, including violations 
committed by mercenaries. In many cases, the term appears to be being used in a general 
term to refer to fighters on either side who are foreign nationals. While there is strong 
evidence of the participation of foreign nationals in the armed conflict, the precise route by 
which such persons came to be engaged remains unclear. In particular, the Commission has 
not had sufficient information as to whether foreign nationals were previously resident in 
Libya, whether they were engaged as part of an existing foreign military exchange, and the 
timing of their recruitment (e.g. if they were recruited in 2011, whether this was for the 
purpose of suppressing the demonstration or to take part in the armed conflict). These 
factors have an obvious importance for the classification of persons as &#8220;mercenaries&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>181. The use of mercenaries is prohibited under two treaties that Libya has ratified: the 
International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries and the Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa. The 
definition of mercenary is very specific. Under article 1 of the International Convention 
against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, a mercenary is any 
person who: 
</p>
<p>(a) Is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; 
</p>
<p>(b) Is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private 
gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a party to the conflict, material 
compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar rank 
and functions in the armed forces of that party; 
</p>
<p>(c) Is neither a national of a party to the conflict nor a resident of territory 
controlled by a party to the conflict;  
</p>
<p>(d) Is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict; and 
</p>
<p>(e) Has not been sent by a State which is not a party to the conflict on official 
duty as a member of its armed forces. 
</p>
<p>182. Situations other than armed conflict fall within a second part of the definition of that 
Convention. However, in these cases, there are additional requirements to show that the 
person is recruited for the purpose of participating in a concerted act of violence aimed at 
overthrowing a Government or otherwise undermining the constitutional order of a State or 
</p>

former Libyan army official has given details of the recruitment of 450 fighters from the disputed 
Western Sahara region with each of them paid $1,000 to fight for the Government forces for two 
months. Con Coughlin, &#8220;Libya: Col Gaddafi &#8222;has spent &#163;2.1m on mercenaries&#8223;&#8221;, <i>The Telegraph</i>, 20

www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8464254/Libya-Col-Gaddafi-has-
spent-2.1m-on-mercenaries.html. <i>The New York Times</i> reported how Libya recruited mercenaries 
from poor communities in Mali as well as in the nomadic Tuaregs, who live cross borders among 
Algeria, Libya, Mali and Nigeria, paid 1,000 US$ a day. Jeffrey Gettleman, &#8220;Libyan Oil Buys Allies

<p>undermining the territorial integrity of a State. Under the Convention for the Elimination of 
Mercenarism in Africa, the definition of mercenaries is narrower: it is restricted to the 
armed conflict situation (art. 1), and has a further restriction in defining the crime of 
mercenarism as committed &#8220;by the individual, group or association, representative of a 
State and the State itself who with the aim of opposing by armed violence a process of self-
determination stability or the territorial integrity of another State&#8221; that practises specific 
acts (art. 1, para. 2). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>183. The Commission received confirmation from the Government of the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya that before the conflict, foreign military personnel were present in Libya 
through bilateral military cooperation arrangements with other countries, particularly in the 
area of air-force training. It has also received numerous accounts which indicate the 
participation of foreign fighters in the conflict, mostly on the side of Government forces. 
</p>
<p>184. In areas under the control of the opposition forces, the Commission found that the 
term &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; was most commonly used to connote persons with dark skin who had 
</p>
<p>taken part either in the conflict, or in actions suppressing the demonstrations. Witnesses 
spoke of mercenaries as coming from sub-Saharan countries and referred both to the skin 
colour and inability to speak Arabic. In a minority of cases, it was suggested that some 
fighters had come from Eastern European countries. 
</p>
<p>185. In Benghazi, the Commission was provided documents by the Office of the 
Prosecutor containing some transcripts of interrogations of alleged mercenaries who had 
not yet been brought to trial According to the transcripts of interviews with one individual 
of Libyan nationality, &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; were used as snipers firing at demonstrators on 17 
February. The transcript of another individual, a Nigerian-born Libyan disclosed that he 
was member of Khamis <i>Katiba</i>, and was transported on 2 March to Ras Lanuf military 
base. He stated that a military officer provided him with a military uniform as well as a 
rocket-propelled grenade weapon. Documents collected by the Prosecutor&#8223;s Office from 
those questioned concerning involvement in events included some 24 photocopies of 
passports from four sub-Saharan countries. 
</p>
<p>186. The Commission visited a detention centre in Benghazi where some of the detainees 
were said to have been arrested during hostilities, while others had allegedly carried out 
missions in support of the Governmental forces. The majority of the 21 detainees were 
Libyan nationals. Only three were foreign nationals: one Syrian, one Algerian and one 
Ghanaian. However, the Commission was not able to verify further the background of these 
foreign nationals. Two of the foreign nationals interviewed denied any involvement with 
the security forces: One referred to instead having been a worker at a construction firm in 
Benghazi for several years. 
</p>
<p>187. Sixteen of the interviews conducted by the Commission included explicit reference 
to the use of mercenaries; in particular in Al-Bayda, Benghazi, Az-Zawiyah and Misrata. 
Doctors working at the Al-Bayda hospitals reported that out of 1,300 injured persons 
received by the hospital during the period 17 to 21 February, 26 were identified as 
&#8220;mercenaries&#8221;. The doctors reported receiving information from a colleague at the hospital 
that mercenaries had been paid 7,000 dinars each (found in their pockets) and that he had 
heard the mercenaries had come from African countries. One doctor told the Commission 
that some foreign identity cards had been collected from persons received at Al-Jalaa&#8223; 
hospital in Benghazi. 
</p>
<p>188. The Commission also received information from participants in demonstrations in 
Az-Zawiyah that they had seen &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; from bordering countries who carried foreign </p>


<p>currency including dollars, euros and old Libyan money being captured by opposition 
forces. 
</p>
<p>189. One witness stated to the Commission that the &#8220;Governmental forces established 
voluntary recruitment offices across Sirte and continue to recruit newcomers in their ranks. 
Foreigners particularly are offered certain entitlements and privileges including provision 
of nationality. Those recruited receives Libyan citizenship, arms and 200 dinars at the spot. 
In addition to cigarettes, food and other things, they are also entitled to receive 250 dinars 
on a daily basis. They also promised them an apartment, a car and 30,000 dinars at the end 
of the conflict.&#8221; He noted that &#8220;many people who volunteered were already awarded cars 
but the risk of being killed is however very high. Governmental forces routinely deploy the 
new recruits to the frontline, particularly to Benghazi and Misrata, where the fighting has 
entered its intensified phase. Meanwhile some autonomous groups, apparently separate 
from Qadhafi and rebels, have also set-up parallel voluntary desks in Az-Zawiyah, inviting 
people to join the military campaign. These groups offer cash and arms to the volunteers.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>190. The Commission has also received considerable information regarding serious 
violations committed against sub-Saharan Africans as a result of a generalized equation of 
these groups with &#8220;mercenaries,&#8221; a subject discussed further in chapter III, section I. The 
Government of Chad has issues a series of statements in February and April expressing its 
concern about reports of allegations of the involvement of Chadians in the conflict and the 
backlash against Chadians remaining in Libya.155 </p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>191. The Commission considers that it has established that foreign nationals have taken 
part in the conflict, including perpetrating human rights violations, particularly on the side 
of the Government forces. However, further investigation would be required to determine 
whether those armed individuals fall into the category of &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; within the 
provisions of international law. In particular, there is a need to receive more information 
concerning the residential status of foreign nationals and the means and purposes for which 
they were recruited.

<p><b> I. Migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>192. A majority of those who have fled Libya since February are migrant workers who 
have left due to insecurity, conflict and economic hardship.156 There have been a variety of 
allegations made concerning the mistreatment of migrant workers: whether in the form of 
arbitrary arrest or detention, o arbitrary interference with privacy, beatings or other forms of 
cruel and inhuman treatment. Reports of extrajudicial killings were received by the 
Commission. In carrying out its investigation into this topic, the Commission has had 
access to first-hand information from 35 migrant workers or members of their families,157 
</p>
<p>  
 155 An information note thereon was issued by the Permanent Mission of Chad to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Office in Geneva on 5 April 2011. 
 156 The Commission received information regarding the economic difficulties faced by migrant workers 
</p>
<p>where contracts were terminated at short notice, sometimes without salaries due being paid, and the 
impact of loss of benefits associated with the jobs. 
</p>
<p> 157 Interviews were conducted with persons from Sudan (11), Chad (10), Palestine (5), Nigeria (3), 
Bangladesh (3), Ethiopia (1), Eritrea (1) and Iraq (1). In addition, group discussions were held with 
large numbers of foreign nationals, including Moroccans, Philippines, Malians and Somalis. All 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>meetings conducted with United Nations partners, in particular UNHCR and the Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and analysis of various reports.158 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>193. The term &#8220;migrant worker&#8221; refers to any person who &#8220;is to be engaged, is engaged 
or has been engaged in a remunerated activity in a State of which he or she is not a 
national&#8221; as defined by article 2 of the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. This Convention contains a 
range of human rights protections including general rights such as the right to life (art. 9), 
the prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (art. 10), 
the right to liberty and security of person (art. 16), and the right to be treated with humanity 
when deprived of liberty (art. 17), as well as rights of more particular application to migrant 
workers.159 The Convention explicitly includes an obligation for the State to protect migrant 
workers and their families from &#8220;violence, physical injury, threats and intimidation, 
whether by public officials or by private individuals, groups or institutions&#8221; (art. 16, para. 
2). Importantly, obligations owed under international human rights law apply to migrant 
workers, including rights against racial discrimination under the Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination.160 Migrant workers are also civilians entitled to the protections afforded to 
civilians under international humanitarian law and international criminal law.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Factual findings</b>161<b> 
</b></p>
<p>194. The Commission received information reporting that both Government forces and 
armed opposition forces raided houses of sub-Saharan migrants, threatening them and 
giving them deadlines to leave Libya. The Commission also received information that 
armed civilians entered into private houses at night, mistreating and harassing the sub-
Saharan population. Migrant workers trying to leave Libya to the east and to the west 
reported facing the same difficulties, including being regularly stopped and violently 
harassed at multiple checkpoints.162 Some reported being beaten and many stated they had 
property (such as mobile phones) taken from them at gunpoint.163<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
interviews were adults and five were women. Many accounts were second-hand, with a smaller 
number of interviewees giving information of their personal experience. 
</p>
<p> 158 In particular, see OCHA Report,<i> Initial Assessment of Migrant Workers from Libya in Tunisia</i>, 
OCHA, Tunisia, 18 March 2011. Available from 
http://northafrica.humanitarianresponse.info/Portals/0/Reports/Assessment/IA%20Assessment%20Re
port-%20Choucha%20Camp%20%20March%2022,%202011(f).pdf. 
</p>
<p> 159 Such specialized rights include the right not to be subject to unauthorized confiscation or destruction 
of identity cards (art. 21) or to be subject to collective punishment or expulsion (art. 22). The 
Convention also includes provisions with respect to equality of treatment with respect to a range of 
economic rights and additional rights for those who are documented or in a regular situation (see part 
IV). 
</p>
<p> 160 A minority of human rights are not applicable to non-citizens, such as political rights under the 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p> 161 This section of the report is focused on cases where the source identified the violation as being 
motivated by the person&#8223;s identity as a foreign national. Other cases of violations against migrant 
</p>
<p>workers are included in other sections of the report. 
 162 The number of checkpoints is reported to be much higher in the west. An OCHA report has revealed 
</p>
<p>that on average migrant workers were stopped 10 times during their travel and reported at up to 100 
checkpoints between Tripoli and Zuwarah on the way to Tunisia. OCHA,<i> Initial Assessment of 
Migrant Workers from Libya in Tunisia</i>. No similar data is available for the eastern part of Libya. 
</p>
<p> 163 This matter has also been addressed in chapter III, section E, of the present report. </p>


<p>195. Of the accounts received, Chadian nationals seemed to be particularly targeted, 
suspected of being mercenaries. It was reported to the Commission that isolated incidents 
were intended to convey a message, to the broader sub-Saharan African community, as to 
what would happen if they supported Government forces. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Violations committed by opposition groups</b>164<b> 
</b></p>
<p>196. The Commission received several accounts of attacks on migrant workers carried 
out by armed opposition groups. The majority of the cases took place in the immediate 
aftermath of the opposition taking control of Benghazi on 19 February.165 In one case, it 
was reported that on 19 February armed supporters of the opposition took one of the 
persons &#8220;arrested&#8221; as a suspected mercenary and hung him by his feet, pulling him out of 
the window of the court house in Benghazi and hitting him with weapons and machetes.166 
Another case reported to the Commission related to the extrajudicial killing of five Chadian 
nationals who had been arrested on the basis of their nationality, and taken to the military 
barracks in Benghazi. Dozens of armed persons either in military style or civilian clothing 
were said to have poured kerosene on their bodies and burned them to death on 21 
February.167 A secondary source told the Commission that two Chadian nationals were 
victims of extrajudicial killing when they were shot by the sons of their employee who had 
joined the armed opposition forces on 21 February.168 Another case of physical abuse and a 
mock execution of a Sudanese national was reported to have taken place on 24 February at 
a checkpoint in Misrata controlled by armed opposition forces.169 
</p>
<p>197. There were a number of cases received in which the attacks were carried out by 
civilians with no affiliation in areas under the control of the opposition forces. Health 
practitioners in As-Sallum referred to the case of four Chadian nationals with gunshot 
wounds (from close distance firing) who reported that they had been attacked in Benghazi 
after having been accused of being mercenaries.170 Health workers also reported that a 
Chadian worker had recounted that his brother and two colleagues were &#8220;slaughtered&#8221; in 
</p>
<p>the outskirts of Benghazi. Apparently the four of them were taken by armed civilians by 
</p>
<p>  
 164 This term &#8220;opposition groups&#8221; is being used to connote both supporters of the opposition in the period 
</p>
<p>before an armed conflict was established, as well as the opposition armed group operating during the 
conflict. 
</p>
<p> 165 Given the preliminary view of the Commission in paragraph 55 of the present report, these cases may 
predate the date at which an armed conflict started nationally. However, they have been included in 
the report as, even if this is the case, the Commission notes the responsibility of Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya under the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families to protect migrant workers and their families from attacks from private 
actors (see article 16, paragraph 2, of the Convention). 
</p>
<p> 166 Information received by an eyewitness of the incident reported to have happened on 19 February. The 
witness believes that the victim died as a consequence of the attack. 
</p>
<p> 167 Information received by an eyewitness who was with the group of arrested persons and was able to 
escape the incident reported to have happened on 21 February. 
</p>
<p> 168 The incident was reported to have taken place on 21 February on the main street of Guarsha, 
Benghazi South. The witness mentioned that the killing of the men was motivated by the general 
animosity towards sub-Saharan nationals who were believed to be mercenaries. 
</p>
<p> 169 It was reported that the incident occurred on 24 February, when the victim was leaving Misrata for 
Zliten. 
</p>
<p> 170 The cases were presented to the Commission by secondary sources which could not provide further 
details. Wounded persons arriving at the border were evacuated to other locations, meaning that they 
were not present at the transit point. </p>


<p>force, cuffed and severely beaten before being killed.171 One Chadian woman reported 
having been raped by armed civilians in Benghazi on 26 February.172 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Violations committed by Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>198. A smaller number of attacks were reported as having taken place at the hands of 
Government forces. The current conflict appears to have exacerbated pre-existing 
discriminatory attitudes within the society. Reports of the ill-treatment include one case of 
arbitrary arrest and ill-treatment of a Nigerian national by Government forces in Misalata 
(Arba Area).173 The enforced disappearance of his wife in the same incident was reported. 
The incident allegedly occurred on 30 March when heavily armed Government forces 
violently entered the victim&#8223;s house, smashing him to the ground and beating him. He 
reported that he was handcuffed, blindfolded and taken in a military car to a place of 
detention. Another case concerned attacks by Government forces in Tripoli, including one 
case of a Sudanese man having been beaten by the <i>Katiba</i> of Saif al-Islam when they 
entered the camp of Sudanese and Egyptian workers in Tripoli.174 One Palestinian source 
from Az-Zawiyah reported ill-treatment of migrant workers following a speech by Saif al-
Islam Qadhafi calling them &#8220;traitors&#8221;. However, overall, it is not clear to the Commission 
whether attacks by Government forces were motivated by race or by perception of political 
allegiance with the opposition forces. 
</p>
<p>199. The Commission received a range of information regarding abuses suffered by sub-
Saharan Africans at the hands of civilians without apparent affiliation to one of the parties 
to the conflict in areas remaining under the control of the Government. In Tripoli, for 
instance, the Commission was told an Eritrean national had been ill-treated and 
subsequently denied medical treatment in the main hospital of the capital city.175 The man 
reported having being attacked with arms and metal tools on 16 March by a group of 
civilians in the streets of Tripoli, causing a fractured leg, aggravated by the denial of 
medical care. 
</p>
<p>200. In the face of such threats posed, many sub-Saharan Africans have faced a 
particularly difficult time accessing necessities of life (such as food and water).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 6. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>201. Consistent information was received by the Commission that migrant workers, in 
particular those from sub-Saharan Africa, were subject to mistreatment, contrary to 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law. Mistreatment took many 
forms, including having their houses subject to arbitrary search, being beaten and being 
subject to other cruel and inhuman treatment. The most serious attacks on migrant workers 
appear to have been linked to a suspicion that such persons were &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; on the basis 
</p>
<p>of their national origin or skin colour. Attacks were most frequently undertaken by persons 
associated with the opposition forces. There have also been cases of Government forces 
</p>
<p>  
 171 The witness was able to escape, suffered from post-traumatic stress and was transferred to psychiatric 
</p>
<p>care in Marsa Matruh, Egypt. No further details on the circumstances of the report incident were 
documented. 
</p>
<p> 172 The case is addressed in paragraph 208 of the present report. 
 173 The witness mentioned having being in different detention places in Ziniti and Tripoli for seven days 
</p>
<p>and alleged ill-treatment. 
 174 In the first incident, the victim reported that he was stabbed in the right leg when he was walking in 
</p>
<p>the streets of Tripoli on 25 February 2011. In the second case, the victim alleged being beaten on 22 
February 2011 by the <i>Katiba</i> of Saif al-Islam when they entered the camp of Sudanese and Egyptian 
workers in Tripoli. 
</p>
<p> 175 It was reported that medical care had been denied because of discrimination based on nationality. </p>


<p>subjecting migrant workers to human rights violations including arbitrary arrest, physical 
attacks and other ill-treatment, which require further investigation. In many locations there 
have been reports of attacks by unaffiliated armed civilians. The failure of authorities to 
protect migrant workers from such attacks raises separate issues of responsibility. Further 
investigation is required on the reports received by the Commission of extrajudicial killings 
of migrant workers. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>202. Reports of rape committed by Government forces have been recounted by numerous 
persons with whom the Commission met. The Commission had the opportunity to speak 
with only one victim of rape, Iman al-Obeidi whose case of gang-rape by Government 
forces has been well-publicized by the media. Allegations of rape committed by armed 
opposition forces and armed civilians were made to the Commission by other persons, 
including in some cases, family members. The number of cases reported was small. 
However, the Commission recognizes the difficulties in collecting evidence in cases of 
sexual violence, including a victim&#8223;s reluctance to disclose information due to the trauma, 
shame176 and stigma linked to reports of sexual assault. In Libya, the fact that Libyan 
criminal law punishes by flogging sexual relations outside a lawful marriage177 also 
increases the reluctance of victims to report sexual violence. These factors thus need to be 
taken into account in evaluating the information received. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>203. Rape violates the prohibition on torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
and also impairs other human rights including the right to the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health under the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It 
is also expressly prohibited in armed conflict, with Protocol II prohibiting &#8220;rape, enforced 
prostitution and any form of indecent assault&#8221; (art. 4, para. 2 (e)). Common article 3 to the 
Geneva Conventions also covers the conduct through its prohibition of &#8220;violence to life and 
person, in particular &#8230; cruel treatment and torture&#8221; and &#8220;outrages upon personal dignity, in 
particular, humiliating and degrading treatment&#8221;. Rape constitutes a war crime under the 
Rome Statute (art. 8, para. 2 (e) (vi))178 as well as potentially constituting a crime against 
humanity if it is part of a widespread or systematic attack on civilians (art. 7, para. 1 (g), of 
the Statute). The Security Council has urged parties to armed conflict to protect women and 
children from sexual violence. Its resolution 1325 (2000) calls on all parties to the conflict 
to take special measures to protect women and girls from rape and others forms of sexual 
abuse and its resolution 1820 (2008) stresses that &#8220;sexual violence, when used or 
commissioned as a tactic of war in order to deliberately target civilians or as part of a 
widespread or systematic attack against civilian populations, can significantly exacerbate 
situations of armed conflict&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>  
 176 Rape in a conservative and religious society, such as Libya is considered an affront to family honour. 
 177 Article 2 of Law No. 70 of 1973 provides for the flogging penalty of 100 lashes for adultery (or zina) 
</p>
<p>which is defined as sexual intercourse of a man and a women who are not bound to each other by 
marriage (art. 1 of Law No. 70 of 1973). 
</p>
<p> 178 The Rome Statute was the first international criminal law treaty to explicitly include rape as a &#8220;war 
crime&#8221; though it had been recognized as a matter of customary international law and in jurisprudence 
</p>
<p>relating to the ad hoc tribunals. </p>


<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Violations committed by Government forces 
</i></p>
<p>204. The Commission received several reports of rape committed by Government forces. 
The Commission spoke with Iman al-Obeidi, whose case has received international media 
attention. She reported that, after being stopped at a check-point, she was raped over two 
days by 15 Government security force members, and subject to further degrading treatment. 
Journalists present at the media conference in which she first recounted her story noted that, 
&#8220;she displayed a broad bruise on her face, a large scar on her upper thigh, several narrow 
and deep scratch marks lower on her leg, and marks from binding around her hands and 
feet&#8221;.179 In Benghazi, the father of a 30-year-old Libyan woman informed the Commission 
that his daughter was detained in her house in Misrata for two days and raped by 
Government forces. She had returned to check on the safety and whereabouts of her brother 
when Government forces &#8220;came and restrained them for two days, keeping them in 
separated rooms. They were raping her, while trying to extract information from my son 
about the &#8222;rebels&#8223;&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>205. In another case, a relative of a Libyan woman informed the Commission that a 
woman was raped in Ajdabiya by Government forces trying to abduct her brothers. The 
woman was beaten and raped in front of them. A female photographer working for the <i>New 
York Times</i> was arrested on 15 March at a check point near Ajdabiya and detained for six 
days, during which period she was subjected to sexual assault by Government forces.180 
The Commission received accounts indicating that minors have been subject to sexual 
assault in Misrata, Ajdabiya and Ras Lanuf.181 Several sources, for instance, spoke about a 
10-year-old girl raped in Misrata by Government forces who was later treated at Al-
Jamahiriya Hospital in Benghazi. More speculative information repeated was that members 
of the Kata&#8217;eb were found with condoms and Viagra pills, leading those recounting these 
occurrences to suggest that troops were given instructions to engage in rape and that they 
were supplied with both the pills and the condoms. A psychologist in Benghazi informed 
the Commission that out of 60,000 persons responding to a survey, 259 reported cases of 
sexual abuse.182 However, the Commission has no further details of the methodology or the 
findings of this study. 
</p>
<p>206. Reports of the threat and fear of rape by Government forces were frequently raised 
by interviewees. Libyan interviewees in Tunisia, for instance, noted that they had received 
phone calls from their relatives in Az-Zawiyah and Zuwarah reporting collective rape of 
residents by Government forces and &#8220;alleged mercenaries&#8221; as well as some unidentified 
</p>
<p>armed men. Other interviewees coming from Misrata, told the Commission that the main 
reason for fleeing was to safeguard family members from rape, whilst at least one witness

</p>
<p>26 March 2011. Available from www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/world/middleeast/27tripoli.html?_r=2. 
 180 This case is addressed in paragraph 141 of the present report. 
 181 A number of Sudanese persons interviewed by the Commission mentioned that several women and 
</p>
<p>minors (7&#8211;10 years old) were raped in Ajdabiya by Government forces, without providing further 
details. Moreover, an international NGO which conducted interviews with 200 children and 40 adults 
in four IDP camps in Benghazi reported that minors as young as 8 years were subject to sexual abuse. 
These reports were unconfirmed. 
</p>
<p> 182 Psychologist Siham Sergewa was interviewed by CNN on 23 May 2001. Sara Sidner and Amir 
Ahmed, &#8220;Psychologist: Proof of hundreds of rape cases during Libya&#8223;s war&#8221; CNN, 23 May 2011.

The Commission has not yet been able to receive further details of the methodology used in the 
survey and its results. </p>


<p>from Nalut referred to threats being given on 18 February, by Government forces patrolling 
the streets, to the effect that residents of the district would face serious consequences, 
including rape, if they did not ally themselves with the regime. Media reports mention that 
there were a number of video recordings of rapes by Government soldiers recorded on their 
mobile phones being circulated in Misrata.183 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Rape by opposition armed forces 
</i></p>
<p>207. The Commission also received reports of rape during raids conducted by armed 
opposition forces in Ajdabiya and Al-Marj area. One Iraqi and one Libyan woman spoke of 
being raped by armed opposition forces in Al-Tulatat Street in Ajdabiya during the raid of 
their houses in early March. The Commission collected other information, that a Syrian 
woman in the Benghazi area was also raped by armed opposition forces during the second 
half of February. 
</p>
<p>208. The Commission also received some reports of rapes being carried out by armed 
civilians in areas controlled by the armed opposition force, raising issues of failures to 
protect from non-State violence. In one case, it was reported that eight heavily armed 
civilians gang raped a Chadian women on 26 February, &#8220;eight armed civilians with 
grenades, AK47s and knives entered into the compound he was living with his family and 
with many other Chadian families in Majuri neighbourhood in Benghazi. It was midnight 
and they entered in the compound, beaten the people with machetes and threaten people 
with their arms, asking them to leave the country and robbing their belongings. That night 
they entered into the room of his neighbour, a Chadian woman, 28 years old. Her husband 
was in Tripoli so she was alone that night. The eight armed civilian entered into her room, 
took her by force, took her clothes away and raped her, one after the other.&#8221; </p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>209. The Commission received but was unable to verify individual accounts of rape. 
However, the Commission notes there was sufficient information received to justify further 
investigation to ascertain the extent of sexual violence including whether cases were linked 
to incitement by the command of either side. It is evident that the reports of the rapes have 
had a major psychological and social impact and have spread fear among the population. 
Given accounts that rape was committed as part of a policy to spread such fear, further 
investigation would be warranted. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>210. In its inquiry, the Commission has sought to investigate the situation of children 
within the conflict. As previous sections have demonstrated, children have often been 
among the victims of the armed conflict (through death and injury of themselves or their 
family members) and displacement. The Commission has also received allegations 
concerning the use of child soldiers by both sides to the conflict. The Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict has spoken of 
having evidence of the recruitment and use of child soldiers.184 The Commission has

 184 See United Nations press release, &#8220;Press Conference to Launch Secretary-General&#8223;s Annual Report 
</p>
<p>on Children and Armed Conflict&#8221;, 11 March 2011. Available from 
www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2011/110511_Children.doc.htm. </p>


<p>received accounts of the presence of children, but would need to undertake further 
investigation to verify the claims and evaluate the extent of such usage. Information 
received from other United Nations agencies and in particular the office of the Secretary-
General&#8223;s Special Representative on Children in Armed Conflict also raises significant 
</p>
<p>protection concerns relating to children affected by the ongoing conflict in Libya. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>211. All parties to a non-international armed conflict are under an obligation to provide 
children with the care and aid they require (art. 4, para. 3, of Protocol II). Measures are to 
be taken, if necessary, and whenever possible with the consent of their parents of persons 
responsible for their care, to remove children temporarily from the area in which hostilities 
are taking place to a safer area within the country (art. 4, para. 3 (e), of Protocol II). Parties 
are under specific obligations not to recruit children who have not attained the age of 15 
years into the armed forces or groups or allowed to take part in hostilities. Children are to 
be afforded special protection even if they take a direct part in hostilities and are captured 
(art. 4, para. 3, of Protocol II). Similar provisions are found within article 38 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child.185 By ratifying the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the involvement of children in armed conflict, and making a declaration, 
Libya has declared 18 years of age as the age of voluntary recruitment. The Optional 
Protocol also obliges Libya to take all feasible measures to prevent armed groups (separate 
from the armed forces) recruiting and using in hostilities those under 18 (art. 4). 
</p>
<p>212. The Rome Statute also includes as a war crime the offence of conscripting or 
enlisting children under the age of 15 years into armed forces or groups or using them to 
participate actively in hostilities (art. 8, para. 2 (e) (vii)). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Use of child soldiers by Government forces 
</i></p>
<p>213. Eyewitnesses informed the Commission that many checkpoints controlled by the 
Government are currently manned by child soldiers. A report of the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also contains reference to child soldiers having been 
reported to be patrolling in the streets, stopping people and asking for the identity cards of 
those travelling in the west towards the Tunisian borders.186 According to those who have 
fled Libya, Government forces have distributed a large number of weapons to a wide range 
of civilians, including children. A 16-year-old wounded soldier who spoke to the United 
Kingdom-based television company, Channel 4, stated that about 90 young boys between 
the ages of 15 and 19 had been called to military barracks in Tripoli &#8220;for training&#8221; as early 
as on 17 February, when the anti-Government uprising began. Another young soldier 
captured by the armed opposition stated to the broadcaster that &#8220;we were kept locked in the 
camp and trained a little and then they took us to the battalion&#8221;.187 
</p>
<p>214. The presence of children among the opposition forces in both the west and east of 
the country also continues to be reported by different sources including United Nations 
staff, international NGOs and migrant workers who have fled Libya since late February 
</p>
<p>  
 185 States are inter alia required to take all feasible measures to ensure persons under 15 do not take a 
</p>
<p>direct part in hostilities, to refrain from recruiting those under 15, and within the age group 15&#8211;18, to 
give priority to the oldest (art. 38 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child).

<p>2011. One wounded member of the armed opposition force informed the Commission that a 
number of children from the ages of 15 to 18 have been trained by rebel fighters in the 
mountains. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Children as victims of armed conflict 
</i></p>
<p>215. The Commission received numerous accounts of children being killed and injured in 
the ongoing fighting in Libya, particularly in the context of attacks committed by 
Government forces. The situation for children, in the besieged Misrata, during the reporting 
period has been particularly dire, with children featured amongst the civilian victims of 
heavy shelling and bombardment, snipers and attacks on hospitals. As noted in chapter III, 
section F, some injuries suffered appear to be consistent with Government forces 
undertaking indiscriminate attacks. Witnesses reported that on 11 March near Al-Abrak 
airport close to Tobruk, a girl under 10 years of age was killed while sleeping on the upper 
bed of a double deck-bed while her little brother was asleep on the lower bunk. She had 
been shot in the head by a single bullet, which may have been a stray round. On 4 May, 
media reports stated that at least three members of a family, including two children, were 
hit and killed by a missile while they waited for their evacuation from Misrata.188 
</p>
<p>216. The Commission has also had concerns brought to its attention regarding the 
practice of the Government to systematically use children to participate in the organized 
pro-Government demonstrations in Tripoli through payments to the family. Given the 
security situation in Tripoli, such a practice exposes children to additional risk within the 
conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>217. The Commission notes that the ongoing conflict is having a significant negative 
impact on the rights of children. In relation to the use and recruitment of child soldiers, the 
Commission considers that more investigation and research is required in close cooperation 
with relevant United Nations agencies, notably UNICEF and the Office of the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, as well as other 
NGOs.

<p><b> L. NATO use of force 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>218. The Commission received reports stating that NATO military action has involved 
indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Media reports have also referred to a few instances 
where NATO operations have resulted in the death of civilians. On 18 May 2011, the 
Commission wrote to NATO Headquarters asking for specific information about its 
operations in Libya. As the Commission is awaiting the response from NATO, this section 
reflects information gathered from other sources. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Applicable law 
</b></p>
<p>219. The international humanitarian law rules applicable in international armed conflict 
govern international States&#8223; use of force in Libya. This comprises the four Geneva 
Conventions, plus Protocol I thereto in addition to norms of customary international

<p>humanitarian law. The base principles of needing to distinguish between civilian and 
military persons and objects, not directing attacks against civilians and civilian objectives, 
taking precautions related to ensuring appropriate targeting and not engaging in attacks 
which involve loss of civilian life disproportionate to the concrete military objective apply 
both in international and non-international conflicts and have been outlined in chapter III, 
section F.189 The Rome Statute includes a detailed listing of war crimes applicable in 
international armed conflict, including listed grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions 
and other serious violations of the laws and customs of war applicable in international 
armed conflict (art. 8, para. 2 (a) and (b)). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Factual findings 
</b></p>
<p>220. As of 30 March 2011, NATO has been in control of all military operations for 
Libya, that is, for the three components of: an arms embargo, a no-fly-zone and actions to 
protect civilians from attack or the threat of attack. Accordingly and on a daily basis, 
NATO conducts reconnaissance, surveillance and information-gathering operations to 
identify those forces which present a threat to civilians and civilian-populated areas. Acting 
on this information, NATO air and maritime assets engage targets on the ground or in the 
air. 
</p>
<p>221. Based on figures shown on NATO website, since the beginning of its operations up 
to 28 May 2011, a total of 8,729 sorties, including 3,327 strike sorties have been conducted. 
Targets struck to date have included command and control bunkers, tanks, armoured 
personnel carriers, air-defence systems and artillery around and approaching key civilian 
areas such as Misrata and Al-Brega. With respect to arms embargo activities, a total of 20 
ships under NATO command are actively patrolling the central Mediterranean. Since the 
beginning of the arms embargo operations, a total of 954 vessels have been hailed, with 41 
boardings and 5 diversions conducted. 
</p>
<p>222. While in Tripoli, the Commission met with a Government health official who stated 
that 64 civilians have been killed by NATO bombardments. The Commission also received 
written reports from the authorities stating that NATO launched about 3,000 airstrikes on 
several civilian and military targets in Libya. According to the same reports, these strikes 
resulted in the death of 500 civilians and 2,000 injured. The same reports stated that NATO 
had targeted schools, universities, mosques, and others civilian locations. According to the 
same sources, 56 schools and three universities were directly hit by these strikes. 
Furthermore, it is claimed that NATO airstrikes have resulted in the closure of 3,204 
schools, leaving 437,787 students without access to education. 
</p>
<p>223. Despite the reports received, while in Tripoli, the authorities did not show to the 
Commission any evidence of civilian areas targeted by NATO forces. Libyan officials in 
charge of coordinating the visit explained that some of the NATO attacks occurred within 
the premises of the Bab al-Aziziyah compound, without providing the possibility to enter 
the compound. The Commission also notes that the Government of the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya did not provide the details of or show concrete evidence of alleged incidents, 
such as civilian objects which had been destroyed (e.g. schools). 
</p>
<p>224. Although statistics and information provided by NATO do not refer to air strikes 
resulting in the killings of civilians, numerous press articles and media reports have referred 
to specific incidents in which NATO air strikes resulted in the death of civilians. A NATO

<p>precautions. </p>


<p>airstrike resulted in the killing of at least 13 rebels near Al-Brega on Friday 4 April 2011.190 
Another incident reported by Reuters on 13 May 2011 and shown on Libya TV indicated 
that a NATO air strike killed at least 16 civilians and wounded up to 40 civilians at a 
guesthouse in the eastern Libyan city of Al-Brega. It was reported by the State television 
that the attack occurred at dawn and that most of the victims were clerics who had gathered 
for a religious ceremony. Following the departure of the Commission from Tripoli, it was 
further reported that on 1 May, NATO air strike in Tripoli resulted in the killing of Sayf al-
Arab the youngest son of Colonel Qadhafi, his wife and three grandsons. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>225. The Commission is not in a position at this stage to assess the veracity of the 
information received. Furthermore, the Commission has not seen evidence to suggest that 
civilian areas have been intentionally targeted by NATO forces, nor that it has engaged in 
indiscriminate attacks on civilians. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Assessment and findings 
</b></p>
<p>226. The Commission has been able to accomplish much in a relatively short period of 
time and particularly during the period of an ongoing conflict. However, much more needs 
to be done, particularly because the conflict continues and alleged violations of 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including those 
amounting to international crimes, continue to be reported. 
</p>
<p>227. The quality of the evidence and information obtained by the Commission varied in 
its accuracy and reliability. The Commission opted for a cautious approach in the present 
report by consistently referring to the information obtained as being distinguishable from 
evidence capable of being used in criminal proceedings, whether national or international. 
It was also careful to distinguish between information and reports received and testimony it 
heard first-hand, as well as facts that it observed first-hand. This cautionary approach 
should not, however, be read as an indication that the allegations of international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law violations contained in this report are not 
credible or sufficient in quality and quantity to warrant the concern of the international 
community. 
</p>
<p>228. It should be noted that the reports received by NGOs were useful and, apparently, 
reliable. The reports received from the Government sources and those of NTC did not, 
however, reflect the same evidentiary qualitative standard. Government reports contained 
mainly either general denials or specific allegations not supported by evidence. Both sides 
supplied the Commission with broad statements based on unconfirmed reports, allegations 
or public rumours. The Commission informed all sides of its evidentiary standards and met 
with officials and NGOs on both sides, informing them of these standards and advising 
them on reporting requirements. Nevertheless, all such information, notwithstanding 
qualitative differences, was taken into account. 
</p>
<p>229. Since the beginning of this situation in February 2011, the media, including the 
international media, have been active in producing reports on events, including videotaped 
materials. Similarly, a large number of videos and still pictures have been given to the 
Commission by individuals, NGOs, the Government, and NTC. While the Commission

<p>took these visual documentary sources into account, their authenticity will need to be 
ascertained once the sources, such as the details with respect to time and place, can be 
obtained. In time and with resources, one could reconstitute a visual/photographic record of 
certain events by establishing a database project linking the visual imagery with written 
reports. Nevertheless, the large number of videos and pictures, as well as of similar pictures 
obtained from different sources, tends to give credibility to the accuracy and genuine nature 
of these images, which in many cases amount to clear indications of violations of 
international human rights law, humanitarian law and criminal law. 
</p>
<p>230. The present situation has to be viewed contextually in light of the regime&#8223;s 42 years. 
The <i>jamahiriya</i> system of Government instituted by Qadhafi&#8223;s regime is a very particular 
one. By its very nature, it is not susceptible to systems of governance based on the rule of 
law and whose aims include the protection of human rights. Such fundamental rights as the 
right to freedom of association, the right to freedom of expression and association have 
been criminalized and are subject to penalties, including the death penalty and life 
imprisonment. The regime also prohibited private ownership and certain forms of retail 
trade, banned a free press and, to all practical purposes, subverted the civil service, the 
police, military and paramilitary organizations to the achievement of the regime&#8223;s purposes. 
In addition, the regime&#8223;s record of disregard of international law and the human rights of 
others in respect of its sponsorship and support of international terrorism and subversive 
groups in different countries of the world over a prolonged period of time is indicative of 
how the regime views both international law obligations and respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>231. The historical background outlined in the report reveals a unique form of 
government which is dominated by a rule by who has governed by fear, intimidation and 
incentives based on loyalty. The repressive climate which has been established, coupled 
with the ability of the ruler to provide strong economic incentives to those supporting him 
and disincentives to those who do not, has also created opportunities for abuses of power 
leading to international human rights law violations, which in turn have led to the protests 
that escalated into the ongoing civil war. Moreover, the absence of an effective rule of law 
system and an independent judiciary, as well as the dominance of a number of paramilitary 
and security apparatuses, have also led to the consolidation of a climate of fear and 
oppression. 
</p>
<p>232. The Commission met protagonists on both sides of this conflict who are not 
motivated by ethnic, tribal or religious causes. They also do not wish to see their country 
break up. On both sides of the conflict, the common goal is to see a unified modern and 
progressive Libya with democracy, rule of law and human rights prevailing. 
</p>
<p>233. The events that have occurred since February have produced a traumatic impact on 
society as a whole. It is against this background that the patterns of violations outlined in 
this report are to be assessed. The ongoing Libyan conflict, which is characterized by a 
relatively small number of victims, has nonetheless produced a significant socio-
psychological impact on the society as a whole, particularly in relation to reports of sexual 
violence. Moreover, previous violent experiences, such as those involving the Abu Salim 
prison and the hanging of students (see paragraph 24 of the present report) deemed to have 
views opposing those of the Government, as explained, have also been traumatic for Libyan 
society. 
</p>
<p>234. What started as a series of peaceful demonstrations aiming at achieving reforms in 
governance and more particularly seeking to see the regime evolve into a democratic form 
of government subject to the rule of law and upholding human rights was met with the 
opposition of the Government and of those supporting it. Within a relatively short period of 
time, this initial phase escalated into a civil war in which opposing forces fought battles in 
cities for the control of territory. The conflict thus acquired the legal characteristics of a 
conflict of a non-international character under international humanitarian law. Thus the </p>


<p>initial phase, which was subject to international human rights law, was transformed in the 
second phase, in which international humanitarian law applied alongside international 
human rights law. 
</p>
<p>235. The combination of the factors mentioned in the report has not only led to the 
impunity of those who committed violations of international law identified in the report but 
has also led them to feel emboldened in the continuation of their abuses against the civilian 
population. This, in turn, explains why during the two phases of this conflict, namely the 
phase of peaceful protests and demonstrations followed by the civil war phase, those on the 
Government side have committed many violations of international human rights and 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>236. The estimated number of violations committed by Government forces is an 
indication of certain patterns of behaviour which can logically be inferred to be either the 
product of established policies or the product of a single person directing multiple 
paramilitary and security organizations and groups for the accomplishment of the results 
referred to above and identified throughout this report. The assumption that these patterns 
of violence would have continued had they not met with opposing force was realistic. 
Certainly the resulting consequences in terms of human harm would have been significantly 
higher than what is estimated at the present stage of the conflict. It is not certain what the 
cumulative number of persons killed or injured has been to date, with Government officials, 
NTC and NGOs providing estimates ranging from 10,000 to 15,000 persons killed. 
</p>
<p>237. In relation to the Government&#8223;s response to the demonstrations beginning on 15 
February 2011, the Commission has concluded that there is sufficient evidence to suggest 
that the Government forces used excessive use of force against demonstrators, at least in the 
early days of the protests, leading to significant deaths and injuries. Such actions 
represented a serious breach of a range of rights under international human rights law 
including the right to life, the right to security of person, freedom of assembly and freedom 
of expression. In relation to the latter days of protests as the situation escalated, more 
investigation would be required to assess the security forces&#8223; use of force, in particular 
</p>
<p>more detail concerning actions taken by demonstrators to assess the response by 
Government authorities. 
</p>
<p>238. The Commission has also established that many persons were incarcerated by the 
Government without it being publicly known how many, for what reasons, where they were 
kept, in what conditions and how they were being treated. Numerous allegations have been 
made concerning disappearances by the Government were received by the Commission 
either directly or through NGOs. The precise number of such cases cannot currently be 
assessed. Access to medical treatment was impeded in the aftermath of the demonstrations 
and freedom of expression was significantly curtailed by the Qadhafi regime including 
through suppression of communication and attacks on journalists and other media 
professionals. Torture and inhuman and degrading treatment can be considered to have 
been committed on numerous occasions by both Government and opposition actors. 
</p>
<p>239. In relation to the conduct of hostilities, the Commission has noted violations of 
international humanitarian law including attacks on protected medical staff, transport and 
facilities, the misuse of the Red Cross/Red Crescent emblem, and a failure to take sufficient 
precautionary steps to minimize damage to civilians and civilian objects. Further 
investigation is required in determining if attacks on civilians (in general and in relation to 
specifically protected persons) and civilian objects (including mosques and humanitarian-
related objects) have been intentional or indiscriminate. The Commission did not receive 
any first-hand information concerning violations by the armed opposition force and is 
therefore not in a position to determine whether any relevant violations occurred. Other 
areas requiring further investigation include allegations concerning the use of child soldiers 
on both sides of the conflict. </p>


<p>240. In relation to the use of weaponry, the Commission is concerned that the Libyan 
authorities have not been undertaking appropriate and precautionary assessments which 
would, in the Commission&#8223;s view, militate against the use of weapons such as mortars in 
densely populated areas. The use of munitions that are either unlawful or are being 
employed in an unlawful method, such as expanding bullets, phosphorus shells and cluster 
munitions, needs to be confirmed, together with information as to whether any use was 
ascertained as either being part of a governmental policy or the result of individual 
combatants or commanders&#8223; decision-making. 
</p>
<p>241. While it is clear that foreign nationals have participated in the conflict in Libya, 
more investigation is required to determine whether these persons qualify as &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; 
within the meaning of the relevant international conventions. Considerable mistreatment of 
migrant workers has occurred. Those coming from sub-Saharan countries have been 
particularly targeted, due to a perception that they were &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; because of the 
colour of their skin and/or nationality. These attacks were most often attributed to members 
of opposition forces. 
</p>
<p>242. Sexual violence is an area which requires further investigation to ascertain the extent 
of these violations, including whether cases involved incitement by the command of either 
side. It is evident that reports of rape have had a major psychological and social impact, 
spreading fears amongst the population. Given the sensitive nature of the subject, the 
Commission considers it important that further investigation employ specifically tailored 
methodologies that take into account the stigmatization of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>243. The Commission is concerned with respect to reports of ongoing violations &#8211; not 
only in relation to new instances of violations, but also the continuing effect of past 
violations, in particular regarding victims who have been disappeared and whose fate 
remains unknown. 
</p>
<p>244. The Commission is also concerned by a lack of apparent action to address the 
violations which have been the subject of considerable attention to date. Although some 
progress has been made in relation to the release of some persons from detention, including 
journalists and other media professionals, it has not received information about the many 
persons unaccounted for, nor did it receive information indicating that credible 
investigations are being instituted into violations which have occurred. 
</p>
<p>245. The Security Council in its resolution 1970 (2011) referred the situation in Libya to 
the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court pursuant to the Rome Statute. It has 
therefore vested primary jurisdiction with respect to the determination of criminal 
responsibility with the Court. It is in that light that the Commission has consulted the Court 
(see paragraph 18 of this report), but has not to date shared information about its findings. 
At this point, however, the Commission feels that it is not in a position of identifying 
individual criminal responsibility or command responsibility for international humanitarian 
law violations or other potential violations of international criminal law. This is due 
essentially to the need to complete and confirm the information and data that it has received 
from various sources.  
</p>
<p>246. Nonetheless, the Commission has identified a number of violations which have led 
to its reaching the conclusion that international crimes, specifically crimes against humanity 
and war crimes, have been committed in Libya. 
</p>
<p>247. <b>Government forces</b>: In relation to crimes against humanity<b>, </b>the Commission has 
found that there have been acts of murder, imprisonment or other severe deprivation of 
physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law, torture, persecution, 
enforced disappearance committed by Government forces within the context of a 
widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population, with knowledge of the attack. </p>


<p>248. The Commission has found that there have been many serious violations of 
international humanitarian law by Government forces which amount to war crimes. Within 
the listing of war crimes applicable to non-international armed conflict in the Rome Statute, 
the Commission has identified in chapter III violations involving violence to life and 
person, outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment 
and intentionally directing attacks against buildings, materials medical units and transport 
using the distinctive emblems of the Geneva Conventions. 
</p>
<p>249. It has also received a considerable quantity of information concerning possible 
indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian objects (including protected objects such as 
mosques, buildings of cultural significance and hospitals) and attacks on humanitarian-
related personnel and transports. Nevertheless, further investigation would be required to 
determine if these attacks on civilians and civilian objects amounted to &#8220;intentional 
</p>
<p>targeting&#8221; within the meaning of the Rome Statute. Further investigation would also be 
</p>
<p>required in relation to whether there has been conscription or enlistment of children under 
the age of 15 years into armed forces or groups, or using them to participate actively in 
hostilities and in relation to the commission of rapes during the conflict. 
</p>
<p>250. The consistency of patterns of violations creates an inference that they were carried 
out as a result of policy decisions by Colonel Qadhafi and senior leadership. Further 
investigation is required in definitively establishing who is responsible for the crimes 
committed. The Commission has received some information concerning individual 
perpetrators of crimes, but more investigation is required on this topic. 
</p>
<p>251. <b>Opposition armed forces</b>: The Commission received fewer reports of facts which 
would amount to the commission of international crimes by forces connected with the 
opposition than connected to the Government forces. It has established that some acts of 
torture and cruel treatment and some outrages upon personal dignity in particular 
humiliating and degrading treatment have been committed by opposition armed forces, in 
particular against persons in detention and migrant workers. Those which occurred during 
the period of armed conflict constitute war crimes under the Rome Statute. 
</p>
<p>252. Further investigation would be required into acts of rape and whether there has been 
conscription or enlistment of children under the age of 15 years into armed forces or 
groups, or using them to participate actively in hostilities. On the basis of the information 
currently before the Commission, it is not of the view that the violations committed by the 
opposition armed forces were part of any &#8220;widespread or systematic attack against&#8221; a 
</p>
<p>civilian population such as to amount to crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>253. Notwithstanding the cautious approach taken by the Commission as reflected in this 
report, it should be clear that a significant number of international human rights law 
violations, war crimes and crimes against humanity have occurred, as described above. 
These violations and crimes have been committed in large part by the Government of the 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in accordance with the command and control system established 
by Colonel Qadhafi through the different military, paramilitary, security and popular forces 
that he has employed in the pursuit of a systematic and widespread policy of repression 
against opponents of his regime and his leadership. There have also been violations by the 
opponents of the regime, which are also described in the present report. The Commission 
has expressed its concerns to both sides, urging them to cease and desist from these 
practices and to ensure their respective conduct conforms to international law. 
</p>
<p>254. The Commission is aware of the challenges that lie ahead for Libya in responding to 
the violations that have occurred. It is as yet unknown when or how the conflict will come 
to an end. The prospective transition to democracy, introduction of the rule of law, 
equitable allocation of national resources, restoration of public safety, reconstruction of 
public administration, reinforcement of social cohesion across clans and provinces, </p>


<p>strengthening civil society and opening the country to a new peaceful and democratic Libya 
will necessarily have to take into account the historic baggage left behind by Qadhafi 
regime, including the situation described in the present report. 
</p>
<p>255. The present report should also be viewed in light of future post-conflict justice and 
transitional justice mechanisms designed to provide justice and reconciliation among the 
people of Libya in order to sustain peace in that country and peace between Libya and the 
international community. While post-conflict justice and transitional justice are not within 
the scope of the present report, its fact-finding work will nevertheless be useful in of the 
work to ensure post-conflict justice and transitional justice. 
</p>
<p>256. Although the contemporary political situation is unrelated to the Commission&#8223;s 
mandate, it has a bearing on the continuation of the conflict and as a consequence on the 
ability of the Commission or any succeeding body&#8223;s ability to continue the necessary 
investigations into the human rights and humanitarian law situations in that country. In 
addition, it should be noted that identifying violations, how they occurred, and why they 
have occurred will necessarily have a bearing on post-conflict justice (transitional justice) 
after the conflict has ended. 
</p>
<p>257. The Commission has been able to accomplish its mandate in a relatively short period 
of time and particularly during the period of an ongoing conflict. It considers that further 
work needs to be done to fully investigate the numerous allegations it continues to receive 
at a time when the conflict is still ongoing. Future work would also permit the assessment 
the veracity of the allegations received particularly with respect to the use of mercenaries, 
the use of child soldiers, sexual violence and violations against migrant workers. Lastly, the 
Commission feels that it is not at this stage in a position to identify those responsible, as 
requested in the resolution establishing its mandate.
