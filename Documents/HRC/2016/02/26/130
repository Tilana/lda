</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> articles 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the important work of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Organization to promote and protect the right to freedom of expression, including 
</p>
<p>in the form of art, and cultural diversity, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the effective exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression, as enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is essential for the enjoyment of other human 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms and constitutes a fundamental pillar for building a democratic society 
</p>
<p>and strengthening democracy, bearing in mind that all human rights are universal, 
</p>
<p>indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> the work on this topic conducted by the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and other 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders, 
</p>
<p><i>Condemning</i> any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
</p>

</p>
<p>audiovisual or electronic media, or any other means, including in the form of art, 
</p>

</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that artistic creativity is important for the development of vibrant cultures 
</p>
<p>and contributes to the functioning of democratic societies, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that arts education can instil respect for and appreciation and 
</p>
<p>understanding of creative and artistic expression, and can awaken the ability to be 
</p>
<p>artistically creative, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging</i> States to create an enabling environment for artists to exercise their 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of expression, including in the form of art, while acknowledging the 
</p>
<p>importance of cultural, social and economic benefits of art, including as a means of 
</p>
<p>expression and livelihood, 
</p>

</p>
<p>expression, including in the form of art, both online and offline, for all individuals; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative 
</p>
<p>activity; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To take all measures necessary to put an end to violations of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression, and to create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by

</p>
<p>obligations and is effectively implemented; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To ensure that victims of violations of the right to freedom of expression 
</p>
<p>have an effective remedy, to investigate effectively threats and acts of violence, and to 
</p>

</p>
<p>education, particularly regarding children; </p>

</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Invites</i> special procedures mandate holders, and in particular the Special 
</p>

</p>
<p>of expression in the form of art and the effects of obstacles in this regard.
