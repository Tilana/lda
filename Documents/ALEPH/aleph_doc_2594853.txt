Cautionary Note Forward Looking Statements Certain statements and information in this
presentation constitute "forward-looking statements." Certain expressions including "believe,"
"expect," "intends," or other similar expressions are intended to identify Arc Logistics Partners
LP’s (the “Partnership” or “Arc Logistics”) current expectations, opinions, views or beliefs
concerning future developments and their potential effect on the Partnership. While management
believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, there can be no
assurance that future developments affecting the Partnership will be those that it anticipates. The
forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond
the Partnership's control) and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from
the Partnership's historical experience and its present expectations or projections. Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include
but are not limited to: (i) adverse economic, capital markets and political conditions; (ii) changes
in the market place for the Partnership's services; (iii) changes in supply and demand of crude oil
and petroleum products; (iv) actions and performance of the Partnership's customers, vendors or
competitors; (v) changes in the cost of or availability of capital; (vi) unanticipated capital
expenditures in connection with the construction, repair or replacement of the Partnership's
assets; (vii) operating hazards, unforeseen weather events or matters beyond the Partnership's
control; (viii) inability to consummate acquisitions, pending or otherwise, on acceptable terms
and successfully integrate acquired businesses into the Partnership's operations; (ix) effects of
existing and future laws or governmental regulations; and (x) litigation. Additional information
concerning these and other factors that could cause the Partnership's actual results to differ from
projected results can be found in the Partnership's public periodic filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including the Partnership's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 11, 2016 and any updates
thereto in the Partnership's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on
Form 8-K. These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements
contained herein. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also have material adverse
effects on the Partnership’s future results. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof. The Partnership undertakes
no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are
made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The Partnership does
not, as a matter of course, disclose projections as to future operations, earnings or other results.
However, the Partnership may include herein certain prospective financial information, including
estimated EBITDA. To the extent prospective financial information is included herein, such
information was not prepared with a view toward disclosure, but, in the view of the Partnership’s
management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates
and judgments and presents, to the best of the Partnership’s knowledge and belief, the expected
course of action and expected future financial performance of the Partnership’s assets. However,
this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being indicative of future results, and
readers of this presentation are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective
financial information.

Service-Oriented Business Model Built a customer base of major oil companies, marketers and
retail outlets, and independent refiners by supporting their strategic objectives and by aligning
our assets with their commercial opportunities Arc Independent Refiners Major Oil Companies
Traders and Marketers The Partnership has the capability to support a wide range of customers
who enter into varying contract lengths and volume commitments Major oil companies generally
require proprietary infrastructure to support operations and provide long-term ratable volumes
Retail outlets buy directly from refineries or marketers and require ratable and long term volumes
Producers enter into long-term agreements in support of their downstream supply agreements
Marketers’ and independent refiners’ activity is driven by underlying third-party agreements and
market dynamics
Contracted, Stable Cash Flow Profile The Partnership’s contract portfolio generates cash flows
through committed activity levels, while providing for upside exposure to throughput and ancillary
services fees Historical Revenue Composition (in millions) Quarterly Cash Distributions to Arc
Logistics from Gulf LNG(1) (in millions) Contribution of cash distributions represents the
Partnership’s 10.3% limited liability company interest in Gulf LNG. As of December 31, 2015, the

an arbitration proceeding seeking to terminate its terminal use agreement. See the Partnership’s
disclosures regarding this arbitration matter and its investment in Gulf LNG in its annual report for
the period ended December 31, 2015 and its quarterly reports for the periods ended March 31,
2016 and June 30, 2016. Storage & Throughput Services Fees The Partnership seeks to enter

GAAP measure. Please see the reconciliation pages in the appendix to this presentation.
Appendix
Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Partnership defines
Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and
amortization expense, as further adjusted for other non-cash charges and other charges that are
not reflective of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that
management and external users of the Partnership's consolidated financial statements, such as
industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess (i) the performance
of the Partnership's assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or
historical cost basis of the Partnership's assets; (ii) the viability of capital expenditure projects
and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; (iii) the Partnership's ability
to make distributions; (iv) the Partnership's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital
expenditures; and (v) the Partnership's ability to incur additional expenses. The Partnership
believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in
assessing its financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly
comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as
an alternative to net income. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool
because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income. Readers should not consider
Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Partnership's results as
reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by
other companies in the Partnership's industry, its definitions of Adjusted EBITDA may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.
Please see the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA in the accompanying table. A-1

$0.440 $1.760 The depreciation and amortization have been adjusted to remove the non-
controlling interest portion related to the Partnership’s co-investor’s ownership interest in Arc
Joliet. The long-lived asset impairment relates to the Chillicothe, IL Terminal. The Partnership re-
evaluated the Chillicothe Terminal and based upon the inability to enter into a service agreement
with a new or existing customer, the Partnership recognized a non-cash impairment loss of
approximately $6.1 million at December 31, 2014. The one-time non-recurring expenses relate to
amounts incurred as due diligence expenses from acquisitions and other infrequent or unusual
expenses incurred. The non-cash charges relate to deferred rent expense associated with the
Portland, OR terminal lease transaction and non-cash compensation associated with the
Partnership’s long-term incentive plan. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as a non-GAAP measure. A-
