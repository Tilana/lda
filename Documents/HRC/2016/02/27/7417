<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the request of the Government of Honduras, the Special Rapporteur made an 
</p>
<p>official follow-up visit to the country between 21 and 25 April 2014. The aim of the visit 
</p>
<p>was to assess the progress made by Honduras in combating and preventing the sale and 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation of children since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s first official visit between 30 
</p>
<p>August and 7 September 2012. A particular aim of the visit was to assess the level of 
</p>
<p>implementation of the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur, to follow up on 
</p>
<p>the measures taken by the Honduran authorities to improve the protection of children from 
</p>
<p>sale and sexual exploitation, to identify the obstacles that have been encountered, and to 
</p>
<p>provide technical assistance to overcome them. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the 
</p>
<p>Government of Honduras for helping to arrange the meetings with the pertinent State 
</p>
<p>agencies and for the cooperation shown before, during and after the visit. 
</p>
<p>2. The follow-up visit was organized around technical working meetings with 
</p>
<p>representatives of the State, civil society, the donor community and United Nations 
</p>
<p>agencies, which took place in Tegucigalpa. The Special Rapporteur met with the 
</p>
<p>Undersecretary for Justice and Human Rights, the Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion, the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Education and the Ministry of Health, the Director of the Honduran Institute for Children 
</p>
<p>and the Family, the National Institute for Women, the Directorate for Youth, the Ministry 
</p>

</p>
<p>Development, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the Ministry of Governance and 
</p>
<p>Decentralization (Directorate General for Migration and Foreign Nationals), the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Office of the Special Prosecutor for 
</p>

</p>
<p>Children, and the University Institute for Democracy, Peace and Security (Monitoring 
</p>
<p>Centre for Violence in Honduras). 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited two centres for children in need and child victims of 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation,1 where she had the opportunity to speak with the children. During her 
</p>
<p>visit, the Special Rapporteur also met with various representatives of civil society, NGOs 
</p>
<p>and child protection agencies.2 At the end of her visit, she organized a feedback meeting for 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, at which representatives of the Honduran Tourist Board and the international 
</p>
<p>community 3  were also present. The Special Rapporteur met with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>country team 4  and would like to thank, in particular, the staff of the Office of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The centre for street children run by the Casa Alianza charity and the Casitas Kennedy regional 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> B. Context 
</b></p>
<p>4. The new President of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hern&#225;ndez of the National Party, took 
</p>
<p>office on 27 January 2014, after winning the presidential elections held on 24 November 
</p>
<p>2013. The principal goal of the new Government is to reduce crime, insecurity, poverty and 
</p>
<p>migration. In the early months of his term of office, President Hern&#225;ndez restructured his 
</p>
<p>Government cabinet to reduce the number of ministries. As a result of the restructure, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, created under the previous Government, became 
</p>
<p>part of the Ministry of Human Rights, Justice, Governance and Decentralization, which in 
</p>
<p>turn reports to the Sector Cabinet for Governance and Decentralization. 
</p>
<p>5. According to the UNICEF report The State of the World&#8217;s Children 2014 in 
</p>
<p><i>Numbers</i>, which incorporates available data to August 2013, adolescents (persons aged 
</p>
<p>between 10 and 19 years old) make up 23 per cent of the population of Honduras, the child 
</p>
<p>labour rate is 16 per cent, and the rate of early marriage is 8 per cent.5 Children aged under 
</p>
<p>18 years&#8217; old account for 44.5 per cent of the population and 49 per cent of them live in 
</p>
<p>rural areas.6 According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), based on 
</p>
<p>data for 2012 Honduras ranks 120th out of 186 countries in human development terms, a 
</p>
<p>position unchanged from the previous year. In total, 48.9 per cent of the population lives in 
</p>
<p>poverty and 11.3 per cent lives in extreme poverty. Also according to UNDP figures for 
</p>
<p>2012, the adolescent fertility rate (births to women aged between 15 and 19 years old) is 
</p>
<p>19.5 per cent.7 
</p>
<p>6. Alongside poverty, violence and crime remain the country&#8217;s main problems. The 
</p>
<p>main sources of reference for statistical data are the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
</p>
<p>Crime (UNODC), the Monitoring Centre for Violence at the Autonomous National 
</p>
<p>University of Honduras, and the University Institute for Democracy, Peace and Security. 
</p>
<p>According to the <i>Global Study on Homicide 2013</i> published by UNODC in April 2014, 
</p>
<p>based on data for 2012 Honduras has the highest crime rate in the world, with an annual 
</p>
<p>homicide rate of 90.4 per 100,000 inhabitants.8 The most recent national report issued by 
</p>
<p>the Monitoring Centre for Violence, which is supported by UNICEF and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), 
</p>
<p>concludes, on the basis of data for 2013, that the number of homicides fell by 5.8 per cent 
</p>
<p>(or 415 cases) relative to 2012. According to data from the same source, in 2013 homicides 
</p>
<p>were the main external cause of death, accounting for 6,757 cases (71.5 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>total). The national homicide rate was 79 per 100,000 inhabitants, 6.5 points lower than in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Food Programme (WFP), the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) 
</p>
<p>and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF).

<p>2012. On average in 2013 there were 563 homicides per month and 19 homicides per day. 
</p>
<p>Of this total, 83.3 per cent were committed using firearms.9 According to the Monitoring 
</p>
<p>Centre for Violence, 513 children were victims of homicide in 2013 (7.6 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>total 6,757 homicides). 
</p>
<p>7. Violence and poverty are among the factors which drive migration. In recent years, 
</p>
<p>child migration to the United States of America has risen at an alarming rate. Between 1 
</p>
<p>January and 31 May 2014, the United States Border Patrol detained a record 47,017 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied migrant children along the south-west border of the United States. This 
</p>
<p>total included 13,282 children from Honduras.10 Of the total 8,000 children who emigrated 
</p>
<p>from Honduras in 2011 (approximately 8 per cent of total migrants), 2,000 were 
</p>
<p>subsequently deported from either Mexico or the United States. The migratory route 
</p>
<p>followed by these children and adolescents is severely affected by situations of ill-
</p>
<p>treatment, sexual and commercial exploitation and trafficking in human beings.11 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings since the 2012 visit 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scale of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>8. Despite the absence of accurate, disaggregated, up-to-date and verifiable statistical 
</p>
<p>data, the lack of complaints and inadequate level of reporting, the Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>able to ascertain that the sale and sexual exploitation of children in Honduras, in its 
</p>
<p>multiple forms (child prostitution, sexual exploitation of minors of diverse sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation and of African descent, sexual exploitation in the street, sex tourism, child 
</p>
<p>pornography), remains widespread. There has likewise been no abatement in the causes and 
</p>
<p>risk factors identified during her first visit, which include poverty, inequality, social 
</p>
<p>exclusion, gender-based discrimination and violence, social tolerance, impunity for 
</p>
<p>perpetrators, insecurity, migration and the transnational dimension of the phenomena. 
</p>
<p>These causes and factors increase children&#8217;s vulnerability to sale and sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>Teenage and early pregnancies remain a concern, and in many cases result in exclusion 
</p>
<p>from education. 
</p>
<p>9. Figures from the Monitoring Centre for Violence indicate that 2,832 of the total 
</p>
<p>18,018 requests for forensic medical examinations issued by the prosecution service in 
</p>
<p>2013 were for victims of sexual abuse (15.7 per cent of cases) and 512 were for child 
</p>
<p>victims of abuse (2.8 per cent of cases). The majority of the child abuse cases (56.8 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the total, i.e. 291 cases) involved girls. According to figures from the same source, the 
</p>
<p>age range most affected in the case of girls was 10- to 14-year-olds (100 cases) while in the 
</p>
<p>case of boys the age range most at risk was 5- to 9-year-olds (93 cases). A comparison with 
</p>
<p>figures for 2012 reveals a significant decline of 51.5 per cent (i.e. 543 fewer cases).12 With 
</p>
<p>regard to sexual offences, the Monitoring Centre for Violence found that, in 2013, minors 
</p>
<p>aged less than 20 years old were the most vulnerable, accounting for 2,480 cases (87.6 per 
</p>
<p>cent of the total). In the case of girls the victims were most frequently aged between 10 and 
</p>
<p>14 years old (1,094 examinations, 38.6 per cent of the total) while in the case of boys the 
</p>
<p>victims were most often aged between 5 and 9 years old (3.8 per cent).13

</p>
<p>10. As the Special Rapporteur indicated in the report on her first visit, the clandestine 
</p>
<p>and often transnational nature of the sale and sexual exploitation of children and the lack of 
</p>
<p>centralized, disaggregated data make it difficult to measure the true scale of these 
</p>
<p>phenomena. However, although published figures remain variable, all stakeholders with 
</p>
<p>whom the Special Rapporteur met acknowledged the lack of any evidence to suggest that 
</p>
<p>the sale and sexual exploitation of children might be on the decline in Honduras. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the causes and risk factors not only persist but have increased. In the 
</p>
<p>particular case of child pornography, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that data are 
</p>
<p>almost non-existent, and that the scale of the problem is therefore unknown. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Measures to combat and prevent the sale of children, child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p><b>and child pornography  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Political framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur was apprised of the Government&#8217;s new organizational 
</p>
<p>structure, by virtue of which the Ministry of Human Rights and Justice has become part of 
</p>
<p>the Sector Cabinet for Governance and Decentralization. Responsibility for child-related 
</p>
<p>issues is shared between the Sector Cabinet for Development and Social Inclusion and the 
</p>
<p>Sector Cabinet for Governance and Decentralization. All pertinent independent agencies, 
</p>
<p>including the Honduran Institute for Children and the Family, fall under the umbrella of the 
</p>
<p>Sector Cabinet for Development and Social Inclusion. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur appreciates that this reorganization of the State apparatus, 
</p>
<p>by means of mergers designed to reduce the State budget and the public sector deficit, may 
</p>
<p>constitute a good opportunity to improve coordination in the management and 
</p>
<p>implementation of child-related policies. However, she warns that the restructure should not 
</p>
<p>result in less attention being paid to human rights and child protection, or in a dilution of 
</p>
<p>the importance accorded to the two issues within the newly created super-ministries. With 
</p>
<p>this in mind, she highlights the risk of the mergers resulting in a loss of focus and 
</p>
<p>prioritization in the human rights and child protection fields. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur noted the new Government&#8217;s explanation that its aim, in 
</p>
<p>merging the Ministry of the Interior and Population and the Ministry of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Justice, was to mainstream human rights and ensure their diffusion at the local level 
</p>
<p>through the country&#8217;s departmental and municipal administrations. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>welcomes this approach and urges the new authorities to ensure its effective 
</p>
<p>implementation. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the new President had approved 
</p>
<p>the first public human rights policy and a national human rights action plan for 2013&#8211;2022 
</p>
<p>at a Council of Ministers meeting held on 22 April 2014. The action plan, which covers the 
</p>
<p>2013&#8211;2022 period, had already been approved by the previous Government on 22 January 
</p>
<p>2013, following a long process of consultation supported by the international community.14 
</p>
<p>With the signature of an inter-agency implementation agreement, also on 22 April 2014, all 
</p>
<p>State ministries of the new Government undertook to implement the human rights policy 
</p>
<p>and the national human rights action plan. 
</p>
<p>15. The human rights policy and action plan are key instruments which give body to the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s commitment to adopting a human rights approach in public administration 
</p>
<p>and the implementation of sector-specific policies. The human rights policy is divided into 
</p>
<p>various lines (human security, the justice system, democracy, and population groups in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 Canada, Spain, Switzerland, OHCHR, UNDP, UNICEF and the European Union. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-24624 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>situations of vulnerability, which include children and young people as distinct groups). 
</p>
<p>The action plan, meanwhile, encompasses 27 distinct plans dealing with specific rights or 
</p>
<p>targeting specific population groups and envisages a total of 1,200 specific actions divided 
</p>
<p>up by area of competence. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur urges the new national authorities to give life to the human 
</p>
<p>rights policy and action plan by allocating to them a sustainable budget which ensures they 
</p>
<p>can be implemented effectively as soon as possible. The Ministry of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Justice has assumed responsibility for coordinating their implementation. However, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur perceives an urgent need to establish an independent entity responsible 
</p>
<p>for coordinating the implementation of child protection policy and believes that this should 
</p>
<p>be among the actions envisaged under the national human rights action plan. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur was pleased that her recommendations for legislative reform 
</p>
<p>have been acted upon. She particularly welcomed the adoption of the comprehensive 
</p>
<p>reform of legislation on families and children via Legislative Decree No. 35-2013 of 6 
</p>
<p>September 2013, by virtue of which national legislation was aligned with the international 
</p>
<p>instruments on the rights of the child ratified by Honduras.15 The comprehensive reform of 
</p>
<p>legislation on families and children entailed amendments to six national codes and laws (the 
</p>
<p>Code on Children and Adolescents, the Family Code, the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, 
</p>
<p>the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Domestic Violence Act) to comply with the 
</p>
<p>international obligations assumed by Honduras in relation to children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>18. On the other hand, the Special Rapporteur recalls that the Government of Honduras 
</p>
<p>has still to ratify the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of 
</p>
<p>Intercountry Adoption (The Hague, 29 May 1993) and to pass the national law on adoption. 
</p>
<p>Both these instruments are key to combating illegal adoption. She also notes with concern 
</p>
<p>that the amendment of the Firearms Control Act to regulate and drastically restrict the 
</p>
<p>possession of firearms has still not been passed. In addition, the Special Rapporteur urges 
</p>
<p>the Honduran authorities to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child on a communications procedure, which entered into force on 14 April 2014. 
</p>
<p>19. The comprehensive legislative reforms have entailed substantial changes in the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice system and juvenile criminal proceedings. As a result of the reforms, 
</p>
<p>minors cannot be held in pretrial detention for more than 6 months without a judicial ruling. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, decisions concerning social care for minors have been removed from the 
</p>
<p>realms of the court and child protection cases are henceforth handled administratively, 
</p>
<p>through the Honduran Institute for Children and the Family. Similarly, the adoption of 
</p>
<p>alternative measures to detention is encouraged, in line with international standards on the 
</p>
<p>rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur highlights that the age of individual criminal responsibility 
</p>
<p>remains 18 years, which is in compliance with international standards on the rights of the 
</p>
<p>child. She urges the Government not to succumb to the temptation to support any reform 
</p>
<p>that might seek to reduce the minimum age of criminal responsibility on the pretext of 
</p>
<p>combating insecurity, and instead to invest in reinforcing the justice and child protection 
</p>
<p>systems. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur is also pleased that the comprehensive legal reforms have 
</p>
<p>entailed the prohibition and criminalization of the corporal punishment of children. 
</p>
<p>However, she urges the Government to ensure that the legal reforms are supported by 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>information and awareness-raising campaigns to address the persistent social tolerance of 
</p>
<p>corporal punishment. There has also been an amendment to family law, including, in 
</p>
<p>particular, an increase in the minimum age for marriage to comply with the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur praised the work being done by the Office of the Special 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor for Children, which in recent years has been strengthened by funding from the 
</p>
<p>United States of America and support from UNICEF. However, the Office&#8217;s impact 
</p>
<p>remains isolated, as the resources at its disposal, including for investigations, are limited.16 
</p>
<p>In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was troubled to learn of the closure and break-up of 
</p>
<p>the division which formerly worked to combat the abuse, trafficking and commercial sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation of children and adolescents (DATESI) and had obtained good results in 
</p>
<p>preventing trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of minors. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur therefore urges the Minister of Security to re-establish and reinforce this 
</p>
<p>division as soon as possible. The Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to open 
</p>
<p>more special units of the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children and more integrated 
</p>
<p>centres, with a view to diffusing the good practices identified in 2012 and the positive 
</p>
<p>results starting to be achieved in the fight against trafficking and the sexual exploitation of 
</p>
<p>children.17 
</p>
<p>23. All parties with whom the Special Rapporteur spoke agreed that more funds and 
</p>
<p>resources were needed to support the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children. In order 
</p>
<p>to bring cases to court, thorough criminal investigations involving surveillance, tailing and 
</p>
<p>telephone tapping are required. For this reason, as well as police resources, there is a need 
</p>
<p>to train justice officials in children&#8217;s rights. There is also a need for closer regulation of 
</p>
<p>Internet service providers to ensure that IP addresses are reported. With regard to regional 
</p>
<p>cooperation in policing and the administration of justice, the Special Rapporteur welcomed 
</p>
<p>the news that Honduras, through the Inter-Agency Committee against the Commercial 
</p>
<p>Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking of Children and Adolescents, has joined the Regional 
</p>
<p>Coalition against the Trafficking and Smuggling of Human Beings, established with a view 
</p>
<p>to adopting regional policies for combating trafficking in human beings and improving 
</p>
<p>support for victims. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur urges the Public Prosecution Service to take a proactive 
</p>
<p>approach to the investigation and criminal prosecution of offences involving the sale and 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation of children which takes account of the transnational dimension of the 
</p>
<p>phenomenon, despite the limited resources at its disposal. A strategic approach to 
</p>
<p>combating these offences would help to narrow the gap between the true figures and the 
</p>
<p>number of cases that are investigated and brought to justice. The low number of cases 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 The Public Prosecution Service has a special unit tasked with combating the commercial sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation and trafficking of human beings, which is attached to the Office of the Special Prosecutor 
</p>
<p>for Children. The Human Trafficking Unit of the National Directorate of Special Investigation 
</p>
<p>Services, the Special Crimes Unit of the National Directorate of Criminal Investigation and the 
</p>
<p>INTERPOL Division and Transnational Criminal Investigation Unit of the Directorate General of the 
</p>
<p>National Police all have officers dedicated to the investigation of these crimes. After the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s follow-up visit, the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children informed her of the 
</p>
<p>creation of a technical investigation agency dedicated to offences involving trafficking in human 
</p>
<p>beings and child pornography. 
</p>
<p> 17 Figures provided by the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children for offences involving 
</p>
<p>commercial sexual exploitation committed between 2009 and October 2014 reveal that 127 cases 
</p>
<p>have been or are being investigated, 39 cases have been taken to court and 31 cases have resulted in 
</p>
<p>convictions. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-24624 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>investigated and tried attests to a lack of investigative capacity and strategy beyond the 
</p>
<p>commendable commitment to combating the scourge of trafficking and sexual exploitation 
</p>
<p>of minors shown by the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children. This situation calls 
</p>
<p>for a stronger, more effective system of justice. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that, following the comprehensive 
</p>
<p>legislative reforms of 2013, the 12 juvenile courts will henceforth hear the cases of child 
</p>
<p>offenders only, while child victims are referred to the administrative mechanism managed 
</p>
<p>by the Honduran Institute for Children and the Family. 
</p>
<p>26. As mentioned previously, following the legislative reforms of 2012 (anti-trafficking 
</p>
<p>law) and 2013 (comprehensive reform of legislation on families and children), the State 
</p>
<p>now has the legal arsenal to achieve better results in the fight against the sale and sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation of children. However, the Special Rapporteur fears that the advances made in 
</p>
<p>recent years on the legislative front have not been matched by institutional adjustments or 
</p>
<p>reforms that might allow for the changes introduced by the legal reforms to be implemented 
</p>
<p>effectively. 
</p>
<p>27. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur noted with concern that, at the time of her 
</p>
<p>follow-up visit, the establishment of a dedicated entity responsible for child protection 
</p>
<p>policy was still pending. She regretted the lack of real progress since her visit in 2012, at 
</p>
<p>which time the bill to establish the Office of the Children&#8217;s Advocate as the new State 
</p>
<p>agency responsible for overseeing public policy on children&#8217;s rights and child protection 
</p>
<p>and designing and coordinating implementation of the related national policies, was already 
</p>
<p>pending approval. 
</p>
<p>28. After the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s follow-up visit, at a Council of Ministers meeting 
</p>
<p>held on 4 June 2014 the Government adopted Executive Decree PCM-27-2014, establishing 
</p>
<p>the Directorate for Children, Adolescents and the Family, attached to the Ministry for 
</p>
<p>Development and Social Inclusion, and ordered the closure of the Honduran Institute for 
</p>
<p>Children and the Family. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this advance and urges the 
</p>
<p>Government to assign to the new Directorate, on a sustainable basis, the resources 
</p>
<p>necessary to the effective performance of its functions, which include guiding, formulating, 
</p>
<p>coordinating and overseeing the implementation of national policies on children. 
</p>
<p>29. In particular, the Special Rapporteur urges the Directorate for Children, Adolescents 
</p>
<p>and the Family to improve coordination with NGOs specializing in child protection and the 
</p>
<p>technical support it provides to them, to establish standards and a methodology for its work, 
</p>
<p>and to exercise independent oversight over children&#8217;s centres and homes, in order to ensure 
</p>
<p>that children are institutionalized as a last resort only and that care, rehabilitation and 
</p>
<p>reintegration programmes are adapted to the differing situations of the children concerned 
</p>
<p>(victims of sexual exploitation, victims of neglect, at-risk children, among others). 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the effective coordination already apparent in the 
</p>
<p>fight against trafficking in human beings thanks to the efforts of the Inter-Agency 
</p>
<p>Committee against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking of Children and 
</p>
<p>Adolescents. The Inter-Agency Committee is composed of representatives of the Office of 
</p>
<p>the Special Prosecutor for Children, the Honduran Institute for Children and the Family, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Human Rights, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Directorate for Migration 
</p>
<p>and the National Congress, among others. It was established in 2012 with the passing of the 
</p>
<p>law against trafficking in human beings and since then has received an annual budget of 4 
</p>
<p>million lempiras (US$ 186,000) as well as funds appropriated by the Confiscated Property 
</p>
<p>Management Office. 
</p>
<p>31. In line with the action plan drawn up for 2014, the Inter-Agency Committee will use 
</p>
<p>these funds to open an office and recruit staff, to set up an immediate response unit, to 
</p>
<p>organize training workshops, to create local committees, to monitor legal compliance, to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.14-24624 
</p>
<p>increase the reporting, investigation, prosecution and punishment of offences, and to ensure 
</p>
<p>due support for victims. The role of the immediate response unit, created in September 
</p>
<p>2014, is to identify victims of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation and refer 
</p>
<p>them to the integrated care services. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the news that, since 2012, the Office of the 
</p>
<p>National Commissioner for Human Rights has been setting up children&#8217;s advocate offices 
</p>
<p>in the municipalities to assume responsibility for identifying human rights violations and 
</p>
<p>referring them to the Office of the National Commissioner for follow-up. She also 
</p>
<p>welcomed the work to promote children&#8217;s rights that the municipal commissioners for 
</p>
<p>human rights, created in 2010 under the revised Municipalities Act, have been carrying out 
</p>
<p>since the comprehensive legal reforms of 2013. She likewise applauded the establishment 
</p>
<p>of local social protection committees, composed of government and civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives, to build community-based social protection systems. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur saluted NGOs&#8217; active involvement and participation in these initiatives, which 
</p>
<p>is proving key to their effectiveness. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that some of her 2012 recommendations 
</p>
<p>have been acted upon, including the recommendations: to adopt and implement protocols 
</p>
<p>and guidelines for investigating cases of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation; to 
</p>
<p>develop and continue operating web- and SMS-based complaints systems; to organize and 
</p>
<p>disseminate awareness-raising and educational campaigns; to train and build the capacity of 
</p>
<p>staff who provide support for child victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation; and to 
</p>
<p>improve access to education. 
</p>
<p>34. However, the Special Rapporteur regretted the fact that operation of the &#8220;Breaking 
</p>
<p>the Silence&#8221; telephone complaints hotline and the telephone helpline for victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking has been suspended because the support provided by international cooperation 
</p>
<p>partners has come to an end. After her follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
</p>
<p>that the helpline for victims of trafficking (505 89905187) had reopened. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur reiterates her 2012 recommendation that the competent authorities should 
</p>
<p>develop new complaint and reporting mechanisms that are easily accessible to all children 
</p>
<p>throughout the country without distinction, including those in detention centres for children 
</p>
<p>in conflict with the law. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur also recalls that two of her recommendations are still 
</p>
<p>pending implementation &#8211; specifically, the recommendation to introduce and disseminate 
</p>
<p>sex education programmes, and the recommendation to develop online protection 
</p>
<p>programmes. She therefore urges the competent authorities to develop and implement the 
</p>
<p>relevant programmes as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to corporate social responsibility, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to 
</p>
<p>learn that the code of conduct introduced by the Honduran Tourist Board remains in effect. 
</p>
<p>However, she regretted the lack of progress made in engaging Internet service providers 
</p>
<p>and other telecommunications companies in efforts to combat the sexual exploitation of 
</p>
<p>children on the Internet. She therefore repeated her call to the National 
</p>
<p>Telecommunications Commission (CONATEL) to adopt a system of self-regulation to 
</p>
<p>protect children from online sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the adoption of numerous policies for specific 
</p>
<p>sectors (education, health and social protection) including, inter alia, the State policy for 
</p>
<p>early childhood and the social protection policy. These policies have resulted in the 
</p>
<p>development of a number of programmes, such as the &#8220;Bono 10,000&#8221; conditional cash 
</p>
<p>transfers programme for families living in extreme poverty, the creation of a single register </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-24624 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>of beneficiaries, and the adoption of a non-contributory basic social protection floor, which 
</p>
<p>is currently being implemented. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur understands that the current goal is to use the new 
</p>
<p>institutional structure to put policies already developed into action. She noted the 
</p>
<p>propensity for creating a multitude of technical committees to discuss how the policies 
</p>
<p>adopted should be implemented. However, the impact of these committees&#8217; efforts does not 
</p>
<p>appear to be filtering through to the local level and to children. In addition, the authorities 
</p>
<p>have yet to determine how these policies will be coordinated with the human rights action 
</p>
<p>plan and how synergies between them will be harnessed. 
</p>
<p>39. In addition, the Special Rapporteur noted with concern that there appears to be no 
</p>
<p>strategic child protection framework which encompasses at-risk children as well as child 
</p>
<p>victims. The Special Rapporteur urges the competent authorities to leverage existing 
</p>
<p>initiatives to establish a comprehensive child protection system which encompasses 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising, prevention, sex education, data collection and analysis, the 
</p>
<p>identification, investigation, criminal prosecution and punishment of perpetrators, the 
</p>
<p>development of advice and complaints mechanisms that are tailored to children&#8217;s needs, 
</p>
<p>and victim support, rehabilitation and social integration services. Child protection involves 
</p>
<p>many different actors and, if the protection chain is to be effective, it must operate in a 
</p>
<p>coordinated manner, with each agency being assigned a specific role and effectively 
</p>
<p>allocated a budget. With this in mind, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern about the 
</p>
<p>sustainability of the policies adopted, given the extreme dependence on international 
</p>
<p>cooperation and NGO implementation. 
</p>
<p>40. The human rights action plan constitutes an important tool for leverage. The section 
</p>
<p>dealing with childhood consists of nine parts (on legislation, public policies, human rights 
</p>
<p>culture, skills development, accountability and transparency, and urgent action) which 
</p>
<p>together envisage a total of 178 strategic actions (relating to the fight against trafficking in 
</p>
<p>human beings and sexual exploitation, child labour, migrant children, children with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, among others) and are divided up according to the agency directly responsible 
</p>
<p>and date of execution. However, it is essential that the action plan also includes child 
</p>
<p>protection indicators that can be used to measure its real impact, that the lead agency 
</p>
<p>responsible for public policy on children assumes responsibility for coordination and 
</p>
<p>supervision, and that the resources necessary for the plan&#8217;s implementation are freed up. 
</p>
<p>41. Among the inherent weaknesses of the current measures, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>noted, in addition to the multitude of plans and technical committees, a lack of monitoring 
</p>
<p>and impact assessment mechanisms. In this regard, she views the creation of community-
</p>
<p>based social protection committees responsible for compiling qualitative and quantitative 
</p>
<p>indicators for measuring progress in social policy as a step in the right direction. 
</p>
<p>42. Investment in policies and programmes that filter down to the local level is another 
</p>
<p>area that requires increased effort. Mindful of the legislative provision by virtue of which 
</p>
<p>municipalities are required to assign 5 per cent of the funds they receive from central 
</p>
<p>Government to children&#8217;s programmes and policies, the Special Rapporteur calls on the 
</p>
<p>municipal authorities to use these funds to ensure the effective implementation of 
</p>
<p>prevention and protection programmes benefiting children. The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>urges the central authorities to establish systems of budget execution oversight and 
</p>
<p>accountability in the area of child protection at the local and national levels. 
</p>
<p>43. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur expressed great concern about the &#8220;Guardians of the 
</p>
<p>Country&#8221; programme, which is a Presidential initiative designed to nurture patriotic values 
</p>
<p>among vulnerable populations, especially children and adolescents, through sport, culture 
</p>
<p>and art. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the role the State has assigned to the 
</p>
<p>Armed Forces in this initiative. The Special Rapporteur believes that the transfer of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.14-24624 
</p>
<p>functions from State to Army reflects a devaluation of public service. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur understands that these initiatives are framed in a context of insecurity and high 
</p>
<p>crime rates, and reflect the State&#8217;s efforts to combat them. However, the fight against this 
</p>
<p>scourge must be focused on prevention, that is, on addressing the structural causes and risk 
</p>
<p>factors (poverty, dysfunctional families, lack of access to services, among others), investing 
</p>
<p>in social policies and development, building neighbourhoods with proper infrastructures, 
</p>
<p>providing opportunities and lasting alternatives for children at risk, offering high-quality 
</p>
<p>vocational training and adopting reintegration measures, among others. 
</p>
<p>44. Similarly, efforts to combat insecurity and crime must be focused on education. For 
</p>
<p>this reason, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the extension of the school day (with 
</p>
<p>teaching days being extended into the afternoon, and also to Saturday) and urges the 
</p>
<p>authorities to continue adopting measures that will strengthen the educational system. The 
</p>
<p>fight against the sale and sexual exploitation of children needs also to be waged from within 
</p>
<p>the educational system, working with children to address their fears, doubts and ignorance 
</p>
<p>through sensitization and awareness-raising campaigns led by the Ministry of Education. In 
</p>
<p>this connection, the Special Rapporteur commends the efforts of NGOs, with support from 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, to increase awareness of the optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child and urges them to continue working to empower children through initiatives that 
</p>
<p>educate them in human rights. 
</p>
<p>45. In conclusion, since the measures adopted will never be inadequate if they do not 
</p>
<p>address the causes and factors which underlie vulnerability, the Special Rapporteur calls for 
</p>
<p>this Presidential initiative, and the funds allocated to it ($2.8 million), to be re-directed so 
</p>
<p>that prevention, education and child protection become the priorities of the new 
</p>
<p>Government. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>On the basis of the information collected during and after her follow-up visit, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Special Rapporteur concludes that the advances achieved by Honduras in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention and elimination of the sale and sexual exploitation of children since her 
</b></p>
<p><b>first visit in 2012 have not been significant. However, the Special Rapporteur believes 
</b></p>
<p><b>that Honduras is currently exceptionally well positioned to make substantive progress 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the fight against the sale and sexual exploitation of children. Specifically, it is 
</b></p>
<p><b>benefiting from the momentum generated by the formation of a new Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>under the leadership of a new President who has a comprehensive package of legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>reforms in the pipeline that has yet to be leveraged. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>Among the advances made by the Government of Honduras, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur highlights the consolidation of the Inter-Agency Committee against the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commercial Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking of Children and Adolescents, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>incipient advances achieved by the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Children, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislative reforms accomplished, and the recent creation of a lead agency for 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive child protection policy. However, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
</b></p>
<p>new national authorities to demonstrate a greater political commitment to children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>issues, making them a priority of the new Government which is reflected in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>adoption and implementation of a strategic framework for comprehensive child 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection which is backed by effective resource and budget allocations, under the 
</b></p>
<p><b>supervision of the Directorate for Children, Adolescents and the Family, with a view 
</b></p>
<p><b>to achieving real improvements in the situation of Honduran children.</b> </p>

<p><b>to support the national authorities in their efforts to combat and eradicate the sale
