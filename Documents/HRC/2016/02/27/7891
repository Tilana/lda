<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 18/14, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to hold a workshop on regional arrangements for the 
promotion and protection of human rights to take stock of developments since the 
workshop held in September 2010 on the same subject. The Council also requested that the 
workshop include a thematic discussion, based on concrete and practical experience of 
regional mechanisms, to exchange information on best practices and lessons learned and 
discuss new possible forms of cooperation. In resolution 18/14, the Council requested the 
High Commissioner to present to the Council, at its twenty-second session, a report 
containing a summary of the discussions held at the workshop and of the progress towards 
the implementation of that resolution.1  
</p>
<p>2.  The Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) accordingly organized a workshop 
on the theme &#8220;Enhancing cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms&#8221;, in Geneva, from 12 to 14 December 2012 (see annex I). The present report 
reflects the discussions held at the workshop and progress in the implementation of 
resolution 18/14. 
</p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council has recognized the important role played by subregional 
and interregional human rights arrangements on several occasions. In its resolutions 6/20 
and 12/15, it requested OHCHR to hold an international workshop to put forward concrete 
proposals on ways and means to strengthen cooperation between United Nations and 
regional arrangements in the field of human rights. Workshops were thus held in November 
20082 and May 2010.3 At both meetings, participants recognized the need to strengthen 
cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms through the 
establishment of specific mechanisms. At the workshop held in 2010, participants identified 
information-sharing, joint activities and follow-up to recommendations from United 
Nations and regional human rights mechanisms as the main areas in which such 
cooperation could be enhanced. OHCHR submitted a report on the conclusions and 
recommendations of the workshop to the Human Rights Council at its fifteenth session.4 
</p>
<p>4. Following the adoption of Human Rights Council resolution 18/14, OHCHR held 
three consultations with regional human rights mechanisms, attended also by national 
human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and academics, aimed at 
identifying the themes of the workshop held in 2012 and possible future biennial 
workshops: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Washington, D.C., in November 2011, with the participation of the Inter-
American Commission of Human Rights  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Geneva, in December 2011, with the participation of the Council of Europe, the 
European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, and the Office for Democratic 
Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (the Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was also invited) 
</p>
<p>  
  1  Owing to the postponement of the workshop to 12 to 14 December 2012, the secretariat informed the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council that the report on the workshop would be submitted to the Council at its twenty-
third session (see A/HRC/22/68). 
</p>
<p> 2 See A/HRC/11/3. 
 3 A/HRC/15/56. 
 4 Ibid. </p>


<p>&#8226; In Addis Ababa, in February 2012, with the participation of the African Commission 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights 
</p>
<p>5. Participants in the consultations recommended prevention of torture as one of the 
themes to be addressed during the workshop held in 2012 as a cross-cutting issue on which 
regional human rights mechanisms had accumulated practical experience. They also 
suggested other themes, including women&#8217;s rights, indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders, the rights of the child, the rights of persons with disabilities, trafficking in 
persons and the rights of internally displaced persons and refugees.5 
</p>
<p>6. In April 2012, OHCHR held a briefing for States Members of the United Nations in 
Geneva to inform them on the themes proposed by regional human rights mechanisms at 
the above-mentioned consultations. 
</p>
<p>7. The present report summarizes the discussions held during the workshop held from 
12 to 14 December 2012, including its conclusions and recommendations. It also 
summarizes the discussions and recommendations of the first meeting of focal points for 
cooperation, held immediately after the workshop on the afternoon of 14 December 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Progress in cooperation between United Nations and regional 
human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>8. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 18/14, the first session of the 
workshop was devoted to taking stock of developments in cooperation between United 
Nations and regional human rights mechanisms since the workshop held in 2010. 
Participants included representatives of the secretariats of United Nations human rights 
treaty bodies and the special procedures, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe, the 
ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights and the Independent Permanent 
Human Rights Commission of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>9.  Participants shared experiences and good practices, including the added value of 
cooperation mechanisms, as well as challenges encountered in their application. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>10. In 2007, a meeting attended by OHCHR staff supporting United Nations special 
procedures and representatives of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Council of Europe was held in 
order to enhance the understanding of their respective organizational structures and 
working methods. 
</p>
<p>11. A dialogue between special procedures of the United Nations and the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights was held in January 2012 in Addis Ababa, 
which led to the adoption of a road map on cooperation with recommendations to enhance 
collaboration. A joint working group of representatives of United Nations and African 
Commission special procedures was established to oversee the implementation of the road 
</p>
<p>  
 5 At each consultation, participants adopted a protocol containing the proposed themes in order of 
</p>
<p>preference.  </p>


<p>map. The dialogue was built on the fact that both systems involve independent experts with 
thematic mandates who conduct country visits, draft thematic reports, undertake substantive 
research and develop and interpret human rights standards. The Addis Ababa road map 
recommended the establishment of regular and systematic modalities for sharing 
information, joint visits and follow-up on respective recommendations. 
</p>
<p>12. Good practices resulting from the Addis Ababa road map mentioned at the 
workshop included joint press releases, conferences and seminars, with the participation of 
United Nations and African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights experts, and a 
joint visit of the United Nations and the African Commission special procedures mandate 
holders on human rights defenders in Tunisia, in September 2012. Furthermore, United 
Nations special procedures mandate holders participated in the fifty-second session of the 
African Commission, in October 2012. Commission members took part in the nineteenth 
annual meeting of United Nations special procedures, held in June 2012. 
</p>
<p>13. At the secretariat level, the exchange of information has been intensifying. OHCHR 
shares with the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights weekly updates and 
forecasts of activities which are relevant to the region. Recommendations adopted by 
United Nations special procedures are shared with the Commission in order to enhance 
their follow-up. For instance, the Committee for Prevention of Torture in Africa took 
measures to implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery, including on its causes and its consequences, on his visit to Mauritania.6 
End of mission statements by United Nations special procedures are also shared with the 
Commission, which reciprocates. 
</p>
<p>14. Civil society organizations and national human rights institutions play an important 
role in the implementation of the road map, including by means of proposals on activities 
that could be undertaken jointly by United Nations and African human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>15. The high degree of expertise and the commitment of the mandate holders of both the 
United Nations and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights have been 
instrumental in accelerating the implementation of the road map. In addition, the joint 
working group created to oversee its implementation has served as its driving force. There 
have been challenges, however, including the lack of resources, various administrative 
obstacles and differences between the approaches of mandate holders to specific issues. To 
overcome these challenges, both systems need to find a compromise that allows them to 
enhance their cooperation without affecting their independence. 
</p>
<p>16. United Nations special procedures have also interacted with other regional 
mechanisms. For instance, in October 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and his counterpart from the 
Inter-American Commission of Human Rights conducted a joint mission to Mexico. In 
2010, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
devoted her annual report to the role of regional and subregional organizations in the fight 
against trafficking.7  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>17. Cooperation between universal human rights treaty bodies and regional human 
rights mechanisms has increased in recent years. Meetings have been held between: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Human Rights Committee and the European Court of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>  
 6 A/HRC/15/20/Add.2. 
 7 A/HRC/14/32. </p>


<p>&#8226; The Committee on the Rights of the Child and the African Committee of Experts on 
the Rights and Welfare of the Child 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the European 
Commission against Racism and Intolerance  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the 
ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and 
Children  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Inter-American 
Commission for the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Persons with 
Disabilities and the Council of Europe Committee of Experts on the Rights of 
People with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>18. Furthermore, treaty bodies take the recommendations of regional human rights 
mechanisms into consideration in their review of implementation by Member States. The 
secretariats of the treaty bodies also liaise with regional human rights mechanisms 
regarding individual complaints in order to ensure that the same complaints are not dealt 
with at the same time by different mechanisms and to safeguard jurisprudential coherence. 
</p>
<p>19. In June 2012, OHCHR organized a dialogue between the chairpersons of United 
Nations human rights treaty bodies and African human rights mechanisms, in Addis Ababa. 
At the meeting, participants highlighted the need to recognize the complementarity of these 
mechanisms, including the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the 
African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights the Court of Justice of the Economic 
Community of West African States and the East African Court of Justice. Participants in the 
dialogue adopted a set of recommendations aimed at enhancing cooperation.8  
</p>
<p>20. With regard to the reporting procedure, an exchange of information well in advance 
of treaty body sessions was recommended, as were systematic exchanges between country 
focal points and country rapporteurs of both systems, including sharing the respective 
country-based concluding observations and status of implementation; cross-referencing of 
each other&#8217;s recommendations; and mutual follow-up on the implementation of country-
based recommendations. On individual communications, regular contacts at the level of 
secretariat were recommended in order to ensure the exchange of information on issues of 
procedure, jurisprudence and methods of work. It was also recommended that the 
respective jurisprudence be taken into consideration and referenced. 
</p>
<p>21. It was suggested that many of the challenges that the United Nations treaty bodies 
face might be common to regional mechanisms, including difficulties of States in meeting 
reporting obligations, late reporting, non-reporting and report backlogs. Therefore, the 
proposals made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights with regard 
to the treaty bodies strengthening process9 may benefit the cooperation between them and 
regional human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>22. The High Commissioner proposed a system that would establish a single 
comprehensive reporting calendar, based on a periodic five-year cycle. Within that five-
year period, a maximum of two reports per year would be due from a State that is a party to 
all treaties.10 This would be beneficial to regional human rights mechanisms because they 
would be able to keep track of international human rights reporting obligations of States: 
for example, they would be able to track when specific States were due to submit thematic 
</p>
<p>  
 8 See A/67/222, annex II. 
 9 A/66/860. 
 10 Ibid., sect. 4.1. </p>


<p>reports, which would allow them to identify synergies with regional reporting obligations. 
This would also alleviate the reporting burden of States.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p>23. In 2008, when the Universal Periodic Review was established, the High 
Commissioner addressed letters to regional organizations inviting them to submit 
information to the process, including the stakeholders report. Communications are 
addressed by OHCHR to regional organizations before every session of the universal 
periodic review, inviting them to submit information to be included in the stakeholders&#8217; 
report. 
</p>
<p>24. The Council of Europe submits information on its member States on a regular basis. 
Desk-to-desk cooperation between OHCHR and the Council of Europe has been 
instrumental in streamlining the information submitted. Since 2009, the Inter-American 
Commission of Human Rights has regularly submitted information on countries that are 
members of the Organization of American States. Less frequently, the African Commission 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights also submits information on States members of the African 
Union.  
</p>
<p>25. Regional human rights mechanisms interact with the Human Rights Council in other 
contexts. For example, the President of the Council convened a side event on enhancing 
cooperation with regional human rights during the Council&#8217;s twentieth session. 
</p>
<p>26. Representatives of regional human rights mechanisms have increasingly addressed 
the Human Rights Council. At its nineteenth session, the Council of Europe, the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Inter-American Commission of 
Human Rights participated in panels on sexual orientation, the Declaration on the Rights of 
Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities and the 
annual discussion on women&#8217;s human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation tools  
</b></p>
<p>27. Participants identified some cooperation tools that they deemed successful in 
enhancing cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Focal points 
</b></p>
<p>28. At the workshop held in 2010, participants highlighted the need for focal points in 
each human rights mechanism in order to ensure effective information-sharing and to 
facilitate joint activities.11 In May 2012, the High Commissioner addressed letters to 
regional human rights mechanisms, encouraging them to appoint focal points on 
cooperation. Regional mechanisms responded positively. OHCHR also designated focal 
points in the secretariats of treaty bodies, the special procedures, the universal periodic 
review mechanism and geographic sections. Focal points regularly liaise with the National 
Institutions and Regional Mechanisms Section of OHCHR, which is responsible for 
coordinating efforts on cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>29. Participants underscored the important role played by focal points in strengthening 
cooperation. For example, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights 
appointed a focal point within the secretariat responsible for circulating among the 
</p>
<p>  
 11 A/HRC/15/56, paras. 23 and 57. </p>


<p>commissioners and staff the information shared by OHCHR, including weekly updates on 
treaty bodies and special procedures. The focal point is also in charge of exchanging notes 
on the Commission&#8217;s forthcoming activities, end of mission statements, press releases and 
resolutions. In the Council of Europe, focal points have been appointed to address 
cooperation within the Directorate on Human Rights and Rule of Law, the European Court 
of Human Rights and the Office of the European Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>30. The appointment of focal points within human rights mechanisms themselves was 
also considered as a good practice. For instance, the Inter-American Commission of Human 
Rights regularly liaises with the focal point for the Americas region of the United Nations 
Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights works with the Subcommittee focal point for Africa, who took part in a workshop on 
the effective functioning of the national preventive mechanism of Senegal, held in Dakar in 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>31. On 14 December 2012, OHCHR organized the first meeting of focal points on 
cooperation immediately after the workshop. Participants outlined a work plan for 
enhancing cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms (see 
annex II). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Desk-to-desk cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>32. The added value of desk-to-desk cooperation was highlighted. Since 2007, OHCHR 
and the Council of Europe have held annual coordination meetings aimed at discussing 
topics of common interest and at strengthening working-level contacts. The sixth 
coordination meeting was held in Geneva on 11 December 2012. 
</p>
<p>33. One of the main conclusions of the desk-to-desk meeting was that cooperation had 
significantly increased in recent years, even though there was room for improvement. 
Participants agreed that one of the main challenges was to address the gaps in the 
implementation of recommendations made by the various United Nations and regional 
human rights bodies. Strengthened cooperation would help to tackle this challenge, in 
particular by means of working-level exchanges between the two organizations. In this 
regard, the conclusion of bilateral agreements was cited as a good practice. 
</p>
<p>34. Another good example of desk-to-desk cooperation was the agreement between the 
secretariat of the Human Rights Committee (OHCHR Petitions and Inquiries Section) and 
the Registry of the European Court of Human Rights, concluded in 2012, aimed at 
exchanging staff and at increasing the knowledge of the jurisprudence of both systems. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Thematic meetings 
</b></p>
<p>35. Participants underscored the need to increase exchanges on thematic issues between 
United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms, including on standards, 
jurisprudence and challenges in protecting specific human rights. Some good practices were 
mentioned.  
</p>
<p>36. In November and December 2011, and in February 2012, OHCHR organized 
separate regional consultations gathering United Nations and regional mechanisms in 
Africa, the Americas and Europe on the prevention of torture and the protection of victims 
of torture. Participants discussed the possibility of establishing institutional channels to 
share information and to define priority areas in which joint activities could be envisaged, 
how to develop a more strategic approach in follow-up to recommendations by different 
mechanisms, and how to ensure confidentiality. The role of national preventive 
mechanisms and non-governmental organizations was discussed in that context. An 
outcome document was adopted at the end of each regional consultation (see annexes III, 
IV and V). </p>


<p>37. At the regional consultations, specific initiatives were identified, such as a 
coordination body of United Nations and Inter-American human rights mechanisms on 
torture, which would hold periodic meetings to exchange information, identify common 
thematic priorities, discuss strategies and identify complementary areas. Another initiative 
was the drafting of a joint report that would follow up on the recommendations made by 
both systems between 2007 and 2010. At the regional consultation in Europe, it was 
recommended that United Nations and European mechanisms on torture should coordinate 
their assistance to national preventive mechanisms so as to avoid duplication. In that regard, 
the role played by the European national preventive mechanisms project of the Council of 
Europe was underscored. At the regional consultation for Africa, it was recommended that 
United Nations and African mechanisms on torture should consult each other and share 
information at the stages of strategic planning, planning and implementation of activities, 
and follow-up. To that end, the establishment of an institutional framework on cooperation 
was suggested in the form of a general memorandum of understanding or of specific 
memorandums between United Nations and African mechanisms on torture. 
</p>
<p>38.  In follow-up to the regional consultation in Africa, a meeting on enhancing 
prevention of torture in Africa was held in Johannesburg, in August 2012, to commemorate 
the tenth anniversary of the Guidelines and Measures for the Prohibition and Prevention of 
Torture, Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Africa (the Robben 
Island Guidelines), the main regional instrument on the prevention of torture. Participants 
included representatives of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, national human rights institutions, national 
preventive mechanisms and non-governmental organizations. The Johannesburg 
Declaration and Plan of Action on the Prevention and Criminalization of Torture in Africa, 
which included measures and recommendations to be implemented, was adopted at the end 
of the meeting. 
</p>
<p>39. Participants also referred to the joint working group meetings of the African 
Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, held in 2010. At the meetings, the decision was made to create a task 
force to identify modalities of reducing the reporting burden on States parties to the two 
treaties. Recommendations to enhance cooperation between the two bodies were adopted, 
including on the sharing of information and on participation in the activities of the other 
body. 
</p>
<p>40. On the margins of the seventeenth session of the Human Rights Council, in June 
2011, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
convened a side event on regional standards on violence against women. The panel 
included representatives from African, Inter-American, European and ASEAN human 
rights mechanisms, who discussed the levels of protection envisaged by regional human 
rights instruments, remaining gaps and challenges, as well as possible areas of cooperation 
with the United Nations special procedures.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Study visits, workshops and training programmes 
</b></p>
<p>41. Certain capacity-building activities were cited as good practices, in particular those 
for emergent regional human rights mechanisms: for example, in December 2010, OHCHR 
and the United Nations Development Programme organized a workshop on strengthening 
secretariat support for the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, in 
Jakarta. A similar workshop was organized in 2011 by OHCHR for the secretariat of the 
OIC Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>42. A study visit conducted in 2011 by the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on 
Human Rights to Europe and the United States of America was mentioned as a good 
practice. During that visit, commissioners held meetings with the Inter-American </p>


<p>Commission on Human Rights, the Fundamental Rights Agency, the Office for Democratic 
Institutions and Human Rights and the Council of Europe, including the European Court of 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>43. In January 2011, OHCHR, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) organized a 
study visit to Geneva and Strasbourg for the ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and 
Protection of the Rights of Women and Children in order to assist its members and staff in 
developing working methods and identifying priority issues and ways to cooperate with 
United Nations human rights mechanisms and bodies. Commission representatives met 
with staff from OHCHR, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Council of Europe and the European 
Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>44. In July 2012, OHCHR organized a study visit for the OIC Independent Permanent 
Human Rights Commission for its commissioners to gain knowledge of United Nations 
human rights mechanisms and to explore possible ways of cooperation between them. They 
also attended the twentieth session of the Human Rights Council. In December 2012, some 
commissioners carried out a study visit to United Nations Headquarters.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Enhancing cooperation between United Nations and regional 
human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>45. The workshop focused on the three main areas of cooperation identified at the 
workshop held in 2010: information-sharing, joint activities and follow-up to 
recommendations of United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms. For each of 
these areas, an underlying theme of discussion allowed participants to hold concrete 
discussions and to produce solid recommendations. In accordance with Human Rights 
Council resolution 18/14, the themes were selected taking into account concrete and 
practical experience of regional mechanisms and based on the consultations held with 
regional human rights mechanisms and Member States (see paragraphs 5 and 6 above). The 
underlying themes were: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; For information-sharing: prevention of torture 
</p>
<p>&#8226; For joint activities: women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; For follow-up to recommendations: the rights of the child 
</p>
<p><b> A. Information-sharing 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Good practices and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>46. Participants from the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, the European 
Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the Committee against Torture, the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, national human rights 
institutions, national preventive mechanisms and non-governmental organizations agreed 
on the importance of sharing information for the coherence and consistency of international 
human rights standards and jurisprudence, as well as to avoid duplication and 
contradictions. 
</p>
<p>47. Confidentiality was identified as one of the main challenges to information-sharing. 
Participants shared the view that there was information that could be easily shared, such as 
the legal framework, trends, methods of work, calendars, programmes of visits and </p>


<p>activities, contact details and public reports. They also agreed on the need of maximising 
sharing of information within the limits provided by the rules of procedure of each human 
rights body, bearing in mind that their common goal was the protection of victims. For 
example, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment proposed that States parties to the international and the regional 
conventions agree that Committee visit reports and their responses to such reports be 
systematically shared with the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture on a confidential 
basis. In a similar way, it was proposed the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture 
consider sharing systematically its reports with the Committee on a confidential basis. 
</p>
<p>48. Lack of capacity and differences between human rights mechanisms were also 
identified as challenges. It was proposed that universal and regional mechanisms regularly 
exchange standards, experiences and views, in particular for the benefit of emergent 
regional human rights mechanisms that can learn from more developed mechanisms. In that 
regard, it was suggested that thematic exchanges be held on such issues as prison 
overcrowding and non-refoulement. These exchanges were expected to allow human rights 
mechanisms to apply coherent standard methodology protocols, for example with regard to 
interviews with persons deprived of their liberty and criteria for visiting places of detention.  
</p>
<p>49. Trust between actors sharing information and the willingness to share it were 
identified as crucial factors. In that context, it was pointed out that the independence of 
national human rights institutions, national preventive mechanisms and non-governmental 
organizations was fundamental for enhanced cooperation, as they were important sources of 
information for United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms. They also played 
an important role in disseminating information and advocating against torture. It was noted 
that recommendations made by international and regional human rights mechanisms could 
be used by the said actors as a powerful advocacy tool. For instance, in Uganda, a coalition 
comprising the national human rights institution and non-governmental organizations 
allowed for the adoption of a law criminalizing torture in 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Concrete proposals  
</b></p>
<p>50. Participants made proposals to enhance the sharing of information by United 
Nations and regional human rights mechanisms, by means of: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Existing and future focal points provided with the necessary means for carrying out 
their tasks effectively 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Systematized exchange, through focal points, of calendars and activities, 
programmes of visits, list of secretariats and outcome reports 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Desk-to-desk cooperation facilitated by focal points 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development of regular thematic exchanges of standards, jurisprudence, views 
and experiences 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development of a matrix containing recommendations by United Nations and 
regional human rights mechanisms, including information by country 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Communication and exchanges between non-governmental organizations and human 
rights field presences, in particular with regard to urgent situations 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development of a database centralizing findings, decisions and 
recommendations by United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms, as well 
as information on their implementation, to be accessible to victims, States and other 
stakeholders (the Universal Human Rights Index was indicated as a first step in that 
direction, but needed to include the decisions and recommendations of regional 
mechanisms as well) </p>


<p>&#8226; The creation of weblinks on each mechanism&#8217;s website leading to the webpages of 
other human rights mechanisms, and the development of an OHCHR webpage on 
regional human rights mechanisms;12 resources, such as information technology 
tools, should be made available to human rights mechanisms 
</p>
<p>51. With regard to cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms for the prevention of torture, participants suggested: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment of protocols allowing for the incorporation of recommendations 
from regional consultations on the prevention of torture held in Washington D.C., 
Geneva and Addis Ababa into the day-to-day work of United Nations and regional 
human rights mechanisms (see paragraphs 39 and 40 above and annexes II, III and 
IV) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identifying tools to maximise the exchange of non-confidential information 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consultations and the exchange of information on countries and places to be visited 
by United nations and regional human rights mechanisms 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consultations when drafting thematic reports  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Better communications and systematic exchange of information between national 
preventive mechanisms and mechanisms on torture, in particular the Subcommittee 
on Prevention of Torture and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture 
and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Involving national preventive mechanisms in visits by United Nations and regional 
mechanisms (if this is not possible, information should be shared with the said 
mechanisms in advance) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Exchanging views and experiences among national preventive mechanisms; the 
Council of Europe national preventive mechanism project was mentioned as a good 
practice that could be replicated in other regions 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In order to avoid reprisals, sharing information with national preventive 
mechanisms, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations 
to follow up on the situation of persons who have collaborated with them 
</p>
<p><b> B. Joint activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Good practices and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>52. Participants discussed joint activities between United Nations and regional human 
rights mechanisms, with women&#8217;s rights as the underlying theme. Representatives of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Working Group on 
the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice, the Council of Europe, the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the ASEAN Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children, national human rights 
institutions and non-governmental organizations took part in the discussions.  
</p>
<p>53.  Participants agreed on the importance of cross-referencing their jurisprudence and 
recommendations. Reference was made to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
quoting the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, in a ruling on 
the case of Gonz&#225;lez y otras (&#8220;Campo Algodonero&#8221;) v. M&#233;xico regarding the killing of 
</p>
<p>  
 12 A/HRC/15/56, paras. 63-64. </p>


<p>women in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Conversely, the Committee quoted the same ruling in its 
recommendations to Mexico.13 It was highlighted that the institutionalization of exchanges 
between United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms would permit regular 
cross-referencing. 
</p>
<p>54. Contradictory human rights standards were identified as a challenge to cooperation. 
Participants agreed that regional standards could not derogate international standards. States 
should comply with international obligations resulting from the international treaties that 
they have ratified and from customary international law. It was therefore deemed necessary 
to strengthen cooperation to avoid contradictory human rights norms. Participants 
highlighted the view that emergent human rights mechanisms should use the experience of 
established mechanisms when addressing possible contradictions. For example, it was 
suggested that developed mechanisms could assist newer ones in addressing religious and 
cultural issues from a human rights perspective.  
</p>
<p>55. Participants were also of the view that cooperation could be instrumental in dealing 
with financial restrictions currently faced by human rights mechanisms. Joint visits, reports 
and capacity-building activities could held to save resources. The road map between the 
special procedures of the United Nations and the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above) was cited as a tool that had enabled 
mechanisms to cooperate in a more efficient way.  
</p>
<p>56. Partnerships between non-governmental organizations and United Nations and 
regional mechanisms were referred to as a good practice. For example, the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and non-governmental organizations had 
produced a manual on how to bring cases on women&#8217;s rights to the African human rights 
system. Joint training was provided to human rights defenders at which key women&#8217;s rights 
cases considered by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, 
the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and other regional mechanisms 
were discussed.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Concrete proposals 
</b></p>
<p>57. Participants proposed the improvement of joint activities between United Nations 
and regional human rights mechanisms, by means of: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mutual cross-reference to their jurisprudence and recommendations in order to 
ensure consistency and coherence with international human rights law 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The identification of common priorities  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The sharing information on planning, and the definition of a common agenda for 
joint activities, including timelines and responsibilities  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Well-established United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms sharing 
their expertise with emergent regional human rights mechanisms in the framework 
of workshops and study visits 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Replication in other regions of such good practices as the road map between United 
Nations special procedures and the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Building and enhancing the capacity of national stakeholders, in particular judges, 
lawyers, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations in 
the implementation of international human rights norms and standards 
</p>
<p>  
 13 CEDAW/C/MEX/CO/7-8, paras. 18 (c) and 19 (f). </p>


<p>&#8226; Increased joint activities by national human rights institutions and non-governmental 
organizations, such as capacity-building activities, the dissemination of the 
recommendations made by human rights mechanisms and monitoring, including 
facilitating the access of victims to United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms 
</p>
<p>58. To enhance joint activities on women&#8217;s rights, participants also proposed that United 
Nations and regional human rights mechanisms: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Define a common agenda to further protect women&#8217;s rights, on specific themes, for 
example access to justice, and looking into the causes of women&#8217;s human rights 
violations 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participate in the annual full-day discussions of the Human Rights Council on 
women&#8217;s human rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Discuss ways and means to convey joint messages to the United Nations bodies 
working on women&#8217;s rights, for example the Commission on the Status of Women  
</p>
<p><b> C. Follow-up to recommendations by United Nations and regional human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Good practices and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>59. Participants discussed ways and means to improve follow-up to recommendations 
made by United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms based on the example of 
the bodies specialized in the rights of the child. Representatives of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe, the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the African Committee of Experts on 
the Rights and Welfare of the Child, national human rights institutions and non-
governmental organizations participated in the discussion.  
</p>
<p>60. It was observed that the universal periodic review was a good source of information 
for United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms, since it made clear which 
recommendations States were willing to implement and the ones that they only noted. It 
was suggested that universal periodic review recommendations should be used as a follow-
up instrument. Some also noted that national human rights plans of action provided an 
opportunity for greater cooperation if they reflected recommendations of international and 
regional human rights mechanisms. It was also proposed that United Nations and regional 
human rights mechanisms should form partnerships to provide technical cooperation to 
States for the implementation of their recommendations.  
</p>
<p>61. Partnerships between human rights mechanisms were also cited as a good practice, 
for instance, as a strategy in the area of the rights of the child developed by the Council of 
Europe, with the participation of the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency, 
UNICEF, OHCHR and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
This strategy was aimed at the implementation of standards on children&#180;s rights, focusing 
on the protection of children from violence, child-friendly services and systems, the 
protection of children in vulnerable situations and child participation, using standards 
developed by United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>62. Linking the follow-up on recommendations to day-to-day activities was mentioned 
as a way to save resources. For example, non-governmental organizations used the 
recommendations of human rights mechanisms in their advocacy activities, including those 
aimed at harmonizing national legislation with international human rights standards.  </p>


<p>63. The importance of reaching out to stakeholders such as the media, parliamentarians, 
the judiciary and academia, was highlighted.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Concrete proposals 
</b></p>
<p>64. Participants suggested that United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Follow up on each other&#8217;s recommendations (for instance, article 69.2 of the rules of 
procedure of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights direct it to request 
information from other human rights mechanisms in order to monitor the 
implementation of the Court&#8217;s decisions) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide joint support for the development of national human rights plans of action  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide joint support for the establishment of coordinating mechanisms to 
implement human rights recommendations at the national level 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establish partnerships to support the implementation of recommendations of human 
rights mechanisms through technical cooperation 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Map best practices on follow-up to recommendations across mechanisms 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Meeting of focal points  
</b></p>
<p>65. On 14 December 2012, OHCHR hosted the first meeting of focal points in United 
Nations human rights mechanisms, including focal points designated by regional human 
rights mechanisms in Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as well as 
OHCHR staff supporting the treaty bodies, the special procedures and the universal 
periodic review mechanism.  
</p>
<p>66. Future joint activities were discussed aimed at implementing the recommendations 
made at the workshops held in 2010 and the 2012 on enhancing cooperation between 
United Nations and regional human rights arrangements. The focal points discussed ways 
and means to prioritize recommendations in order to elaborate a workplan defining the 
recommendations to be implemented in the short, medium and long term, with 
corresponding responsibilities (see annex II). 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> The workshop on enhancing cooperation between United Nations and regional 
human rights mechanisms generated valuable proposals and recommendations aimed 
</b></p>
<p><b>at enhancing cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms, in particular with regard to the sharing of information, conducting joint 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities and follow-up to recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> The participants in the workshop highlighted the importance of pursuing the 
process of enhancement of cooperation between United Nations and regional human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights mechanisms. To that end, biennial workshops should continue to be held, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as the annual meetings of focal points on cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> The support and endorsement of United Nations and regional organizations 
political bodies were identified as crucial for the effective enhancement of cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Participants encouraged intergovernmental organizations and States to allocate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial and human resources necessary to ensure that recommendations on 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation were implemented. </b></p>


<p>70.<b> Participants recognized the critical role played by OHCHR in advancing 
cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Thecapacity of OHCHR to operate as focal point of cooperation between the two 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms, and in particular to facilitate the continuous activities of the focal points 
</b></p>
<p><b>network, had however, been adversely affected by the financial constraints placed 
</b></p>
<p><b>upon it. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> Cooperation between human rights mechanisms was identified as a way to save 
resources in times of financial constraint. United Nations and regional human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms were encouraged to further develop joint activities and the exchange of 
</b></p>
<p><b>information.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. States and United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> Focal points are fundamental for enhancing cooperation between United 
Nations and regional human rights mechanisms. They should be provided with 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate resources to carry out effectively the tasks outlined in their workplans. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Meetings of focal points on cooperation should be held annually.  
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> Information-sharing between United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms should be systematized by, inter alia, the exchange of calendars of 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities, programmes of visits, list of secretariats and reports. Focal points should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible for ensuring regular information-sharing.  
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> A shared agenda of activities of international and regional human rights 
mechanisms should be developed, including common short- and mid-term planning. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Thematic meetings should be convened with the participation of experts. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> To date, OHCHR has supported the mandate of cooperation between United 
Nations and regional human rights mechanisms by means of extrabudgetary 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources. Owing to the financial constraints faced by the Office, however, such an 
</b></p>
<p><b>arrangement was no longer feasible. The nascent network of two-way exchange of 
</b></p>
<p><b>information and communications on joint activities and follow-up regularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>channelled through the OHCHR focal point required adequate facilitation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development. Furthermore, OHCHR would continue to be the convener of biennial 
</b></p>
<p><b>workshops and annual meetings of focal points. The work required to support such an 
</b></p>
<p><b>important mandate demanded at least one additional Professional staff member and 
</b></p>
<p><b>one additional General Service staff member. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> Such good practices as desk-to-desk cooperation and the Addis Ababa road 
map on cooperation should be used as examples for other regions.  
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms should systematically 
cross-reference their jurisprudence and recommendations. A database containing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>findings, decisions and recommendations of United Nations and regional human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights mechanisms should be created. This tool could be accessible to victims, States 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other stakeholders. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> A matrix containing recommendations made by United Nations and regional 
human rights mechanisms should be developed. The said mechanisms should 
</b></p>
<p><b>systematically follow up on </b>each other&#8217;s recommendations. Best practices on follow<b>-
</b></p>
<p><b>up on recommendations across mechanisms should be mapped and clustered. </b></p>


<p>79.<b> Regional human rights mechanisms should provide information for the 
universal periodic review. In addition, joint support from United Nations and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights mechanisms should be provided for the development of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>national plans of action and for the establishment of national coordinating 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms to implement universal periodic review recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> </b>Weblinks on each mechanism&#8217;s website with links to the webpages of other 
<b>human rights mechanisms should be created. The OHCHR website should include 
</b></p>
<p><b>information on cooperation with regional human rights mechanisms. Resources 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be made available to human rights mechanisms to put such technological tools 
</b></p>
<p><b>in place. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> A working group comprising members of United Nations and regional human 
rights mechanisms should be created to follow up on recommendations resulting from 
</b></p>
<p><b>the workshop held in 2012.  
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms should ensure that the 
capacity of national stakeholders, in particular judges, lawyers, national human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions and non-governmental organizations, is built and enhanced, including on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the implementation of international human standards and recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Other stakeholders, in particular national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Recommendations by United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms 
should be part of the day-to-day work of all stakeholders so as to facilitate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhance their follow-up.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> Cooperation between United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms, 
and relevant stakeholders, should be developed further, including in support for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>follow-up on individual complaints by national human rights institutions and non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations. </b></p>

</p>
<p>mechanisms&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Objective: Discussions will aim at identifying concrete means and tools of cooperation 
between United Nations (United Nations) and regional human rights mechanisms on three 
key areas identified during the international workshop on cooperation between international 
and regional human rights mechanisms held in Geneva in 2010 (A/HRC/15/56): sharing of 
information, possible joint activities, and follow up to recommendations of United Nations 
and regional human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>As recommended by the 2010 workshop and in accordance with Human Rights Council 
(HRC) resolution 18/14, there will be an underlying theme of discussion for each of these 
areas of cooperation which will allow participants to hold targeted discussions and to 
produce practice-oriented recommendations. 
</p>
<p>The workshop will also take stock of developments related to cooperation between United 
Nations and regional human rights mechanism, in particular since the 2010 workshop.  
</p>
<p>The discussions will help to ensure coherence, avoid gaps and overlaps, as well as 
strengthen complementarity and increase the impact of actions by United Nations and 
regional human rights mechanisms. In addition, the workshop will aim at identifying 
concrete commitments for both United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms.

<p>Objective: This session will allow participants to share methods of work, 
best practices and lessons learned; information on strategy and planning, as 
well as jurisprudence and standards developed by each mechanism, so as to 
identify common priorities, challenges, synergies and possible 
complementarities. The role of NHRIs, NPMs and NGOs with regard to 
information sharing will also be discussed. 
</p>
<p>In addition, this session will focus on issues raised at the regional 
consultations held in 2011 and 2012 with Inter-American, European, 
ASEAN and African regional human rights mechanisms: Should 
institutional channels be established in order to exchange information? If 
yes, what kind? How to implement them? What are the key areas of 
collaboration which will allow overcoming information sharing obstacles? 
How to better share United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms&#8217; 
information on planning of visits, preparation of reports, actions on 
individual cases, methods of work, and good practices? What will be the 
role of the mechanisms&#8217; secretariats in an enhanced cooperation? </p>

<p><b>  Regional consultation for the Americas on enhancing 
cooperation between United Nations and regional human 
rights mechanisms on prevention of torture and protection of 
victims of torture, in particular persons deprived of their 
liberty 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Washington D.C., 29 and 30 November 2011 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>The President of the United Nations Committee Against Torture, the Vice-president of the 
United Nations Sub-committee on the Prevention of Torture, the United Nations Special 
Rapporteur on Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the 
Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR)&#8217;s Rapporteur on detainees&#8217; rights, 
IACHR&#8217;s President, IACHR&#8217;s Executive Secretary, professional Staff from the IACHR and 
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), as well as 
representatives of National and Local Preventive Mechanisms of Torture (NPMs) form the 
region, National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) and civil society organizations met to 
identify concrete ways and means to enhance cooperation between the United Nations and 
Inter-American human rights mechanisms on the fight against torture and other ill 
treatment, taking into account key working areas identified during the International 
workshop on cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms 
held in Geneva in 2010 (A/HRC/15/56), namely: exchange of information, possible joint 
activities and follow-up to recommendations, as well as NPMs&#8217; and Civil Society 
Organizations&#8217; role.  
</p>
<p>Participants suggested to further developing the following concrete means and ways of 
cooperation: 
</p>
<p><b> 1. United Nations and Inter-American Human Rights mechanisms coordination body 
</b></p>
<p>In 2011, representatives of the United Nations and the Inter-American Human Rights 
mechanisms against torture met twice to coordinate their activities and to identify areas of 
cooperation. In order to formally establish this coordination body, it was agreed: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To hold periodic meetings -twice per year- in order to, among others, coordinate 
activities, exchange information, identify common thematic priorities, analyze 
substantive issues, discuss strategies and priorities, identify complementary areas so 
as to avoid duplicity, as well as exchange work plans and calendars. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The work of this coordinating body should be public and transparent. The 
participation of civil society organizations, NPMs, and NHRIs, among others, will 
be promoted so as to report on its progress. </p>


<p><b> 2. Exchange of information 
</b></p>
<p>To promote exchange of information between the Secretariats of the IACHR and OHCHR, 
including the CAT, the SPT and the United Nations Special Rapporteur against Torture on 
the following issues: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Preparation of country missions in the region: country information, including the 
human rights situation, list of places to visit, discussion on strategies for visits and 
recommendations previously issued for possible follow-up, as well as the mission&#8217;s 
terms of reference. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Jurisprudence, standards and statements on general issues and individual cases, 
including precautionary measures, urgent appeals, allegation letters and statistical 
data. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Work plans, agendas and timeframes, for example, countries to be examined by the 
Treaty Bodies, guidelines for NPMs (SPT), countries to visit, undergoing general 
observations and thematic reports. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Working methods, experiences and best practices.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sharing more protective standards, for instance on the rights of persons with 
disabilities. Recognize the development of these standards and make possible that 
both United Nations and Inter-American human rights mechanisms on torture refer 
to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Joint Activities 
</b></p>
<p>Proposals to overcome challenges related to joint activities were discussed, including 
specificities of each mandate, confidentiality and available resources. The possibility of 
undertaking the following joint activities was discussed: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Press releases and public statements on specific cases and/or special dates (Human 
rights day, international day in support of victims of torture - June 26, International 
women&#8217;s day, etc.). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Staff exchanges to strengthen mutual institutional knowledge and participation 
and/or assistance from United Nations and Inter-American mechanisms&#8217; members 
and secretariats in each other&#8217;s periodic activities (hearings, working sessions, 
</p>
<p>annual meetings, etc.). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint visits: when appropriate, convenient, and feasible, conduct joint visits (for 
example, following the model used by the joint visit of the United Nations and Inter-
American Rapporteurs on the right to freedom of expression to Mexico). In addition, 
support and/or involvement of mechanisms&#8217; members and secretariats in each 
</p>
<p>other&#8217;s visits may be considered. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint reports, such as thematic reports and reports on specific issues. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; As a follow up to the meeting between mechanisms held on 28 November 2011, it 
was decided to draft a joint report. It will follow up to recommendations issued by 
United Nations and Inter-American mechanisms on torture adopted between 2007 
and 2010. The report will include inputs from relevant States, NHRIs, NPMs and 
civil society organizations. It was suggested to consider the possibility of 
incorporating other Treaty Bodies as well as other regional and international human 
rights mechanisms. This report would be the first step of a cooperation process 
between mechanisms aimed at identifying common thematic priorities as well as 
possible future joint reports and joint actions. </p>


<p>&#8226; Joint precautionary measures and urgent actions, including joint letters for urgent 
cases as well as simultaneous letters on the same case. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promote the ratification of both systems&#8217; human rights instruments. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>joint promotion and joint support to the creation and appointment of members of 
NPMs. Once NPMs are established, to promote and support their strengthening in 
accordance to the OPCAT.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint raising awareness, capacity building and advocacy activities.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Coordination with other human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Promote further coordination with other mechanisms, such as the Treaty Bodies 
(CCPR, CRC, CRPD, CEDAW, CMW, CED, CESCR, CERD) and Special 
Procedures (Special Rapporteur on Terrorism, Migrants, Transitional Justice, 
Violence against Women, among others) taking into consideration that torture is a 
cross-cutting issue. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participation of these mechanisms in the exchange of information and joint 
activities. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Follow-up to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Recognize the importance of recommendations issued by other mechanisms and use 
them as working tools.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Elaborate joint strategies aimed at following up to recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Review process of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Prisoners  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Request that United Nations and Inter-American human rights mechanisms, as well 
as civil society organizations, NPMs and NHRIs are involved in the review process 
of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, 
given their experience and their deep knowledge of the rights of persons deprived of 
their liberty. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Promote the formal recognition of regional mechanisms&#8217; submissions to the UPR, in 
</p>
<p>particular those provided by the IACHR (possibility to include regional 
mechanisms&#8217; submissions in a separate section within the relevant stakeholders&#8217; 
</p>
<p>summary). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Improve communication channels and exchange of information between the IACHR 
and the UPR Secretariat.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Role of the National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs) 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Promote holding thematic hearings on the fight against torture before both the 
United Nations and the Inter-American human rights systems, in particular in 
relation to the situation of NPMs in the region, with the participation of NPMs, 
NHRIs and NGOs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide joint support to NPMs in the follow-up to their recommendations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Jointly promote the creation and establishment of NPMS in those countries which in 
spite of having ratified the OPCAT, have not established a NPM within the deadline </p>


<p>set by it (one year). Promote the ratification of the OPCAT by those States which 
have not ratified it yet. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identify synergies between the United Nations and the Inter-American human rights 
systems and reinforce their support to NHRIs so as to make them Paris Principles 
complainant, in particular those which have been designated as NPMs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Disseminate State obligations in the fight against torture, especially those assumed 
by ratifying the OPCAT. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Find opportunities for discussion and for exchange of information between NPMs. 
These meetings should also include discussions on the challenges they face 
(mandate, working methods, lack of response from the State, among others). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promote cooperation between United Nations an regional human rights mechanisms 
with regard to the monitoring of detention places for persons with disabilities and 
related programmes, taking into account the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, in particular its article 16.3 which establishes State&#8217;s obligations to 
monitor those places of detention and related programmes through independent 
authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> 9. Role of Civil Society Organizations 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Actively participate in the ratification process of the OPCAT, as well as in the 
creation and establishment of NPMs where they do not exist yet, with the view that 
they comply with the SPT guidelines and the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Follow up to and dissemination of recommendations made by the two human rights 
systems on torture through various means, including mapping of compliance with 
recommendations, reports and follow up to recommendations on individual cases. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Discuss with States and among themselves the actions to be undertaken to ensure 
that recommendations are implemented. Participants highlighted the role that civil 
society organizations play in the analysis of national situations, as well as in 
identifying the most appropriate means to elaborate the above mentioned mapping.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Request that thematic hearings aimed to developing standards on prevention and 
protection against torture are held; and promote the participation of NGOs in SPT 
sessions and in IACHR hearings. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Work along with the United Nations and Inter-American human rights mechanisms 
in activities allowing the exchange of views on strategies and priorities to fight 
torture in the region, including countries to be visited and definition of thematic 
priorities, as occurred in the 2011 regional consultations carried out by the United 
Nations Special Rapporteur on torture. Furthermore, to open spaces allowing the 
involvement of civil society organizations in SPT&#8217;s (sessions) and IACHR&#8217;s

actions aimed at improving them. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strategic and complementary use of United Nations and Inter-American human 
rights mechanisms through provision of information, requests for urgent appeals, 
allegation letters and precautionary measures, as well as active participation in the 
preparation, development and follow up to visits of the SPT, CAT, United Nations 
and IACHR Rapporteurs on torture. In addition, to provide information for thematic 
reports and submit shadow reports to these mechanisms, among others. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strategic litigation before both human rights systems in order to obtain concrete 
results, for instance the closure of a detention centre. </p>


<p>&#8226; Use United Nations and Inter-American human rights mechanisms&#8217; statements as 
tools for advocacy regarding States&#8217; public policy planning.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strengthen a regional NGO platform on the fight against torture in order to articulate 
the strategies to be followed by civil society organizations in this field. Some 
participants suggested that the APT lead this initiative. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Discuss ways to improve the OPCAT Contact Group which is strategic to interact 
with the SPT and other regional bodies, as well as to jointly assess the 
implementation of the OPCAT.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Trying to replicate in the negotiation of other treaties the important role played by 
civil society organizations in the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. It was also proposed to seek the creation of 
communication channels between NGOs specialized on torture and NGOs 
specialized on disability rights.

<p><b>  Regional consultation for Europe on enhancing cooperation 
between United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms on prevention of torture and protection of 
victims of torture, especially people deprived of their liberty 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Geneva, 15 and 16 December 2011 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>Participants to the regional consultation included a member of the Committee Against 
Torture, a member of the Sub-committee on the Prevention of Torture, the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the President, as well as the Deputy Executive Secretary of the European 
Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CPT), the manager of the NPM European Project of the Council of Europe&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>(CoE) Directorate General of Human Rights and Rule of Law, a representative of the 
European Union&#8217;s Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the Head of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Department of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), 
the Indonesia Representative and Chair of ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission of 
Human Rights (AICHR), staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), representatives of National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs), National Human 
Rights Institutions (NHRIs) from the region, and civil society organizations. The aim of the 
regional consultation was to identify concrete means and ways of cooperation between the 
United Nations and European Human Rights Mechanisms on the fight against torture and 
other ill treatment, taking into account key areas identified during the International 
workshop on cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms 
held in Geneva in 2010 (A/HRC/15/56), namely: sharing of information, possible joint 
activities and follow-up on recommendations by human rights mechanisms, as well as the 
role of NPMs and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>Participants discussed and suggested to develop means and tools of cooperation including: 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Information sharing 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Considering the importance of access to information for the prevention of torture 
and the protection of victims of torture, the participants discussed and to a large 
extent agreed on the need to share information between United Nations and 
European mechanisms on torture, taking into account their respective confidentiality 
clauses, if applicable.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; United Nations and European human rights mechanisms on torturea could advocate 
with States to share relevant reports of the CPT with the SPT and vice-versa in a 
</p>
<p>  
 a The term &#8220;human rights mechanisms on torture&#8221; used in this document includes mechanisms related 
</p>
<p>to the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. </p>


<p>systematic manner immediately upon receipt, provided that they are treated as 
confidential.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; United Nations and European human rights mechanisms on torture could advocate 
with States to invite NPMs to the meetings between authorities and SPT/CPT at the 
end of visits.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regular contact between secretariats of different mechanisms could also be 
established in order to share plans of work, contact details, calendars, methods of 
work etc. This also includes other relevant mechanisms, for instance the United 
Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Committee on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Thematic meetings could be organized between United Nations and European 
human rights mechanisms on torture so as to make progress in both the standard 
setting and to discuss substantial topics, such as pre-trial detention, solitary 
confinement, detention of migrants, secret detention, persons with disabilities 
deprived of their liberty, including in health care institutions and social care homes, 
etc.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants endorsed the proposal made during the regional consultation in the 
Americas on the need that United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms on 
torture, the CRPD as well as NPMs, NHRIs and NGOsb working on the issue be 
involved in the process of review of the Standard Minimum Rules for the  Treatment 
of Prisoners which is currently taking place under the auspices of UNODC. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was highlighted that there is information related with both United Nations and 
European human rights mechanisms on torture, in particular the SPT and the CPT, 
which is not confidential and can be shared For instance, methods of work, 
experiences, contact details of interlocutors, criteria to interview detainees, criteria 
to visit places of deprivation of liberty, etc.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A global strategy against torture could be developed in order to avoid duplication 
and overlaps. Every mechanism should have a role in the development of this 
strategy. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The CoE&#8217;s European NPM Project will continue to facilitate a forum whereby 
international, regional and national torture prevention bodies can meet in thematic 
and country workshops so as to continue to share good practices and methodologies.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Possible joint activities 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Arrangements of cooperation could be established between United Nations and 
European human rights mechanisms on torture, for example working groups on 
issues such as development of common standards, including evolving standards 
relevant to torture developed by other bodies, such as the CRPD, implementation of 
recommendations of different mechanisms, joint trainings, especially to the police 
and the judiciary, etc. NHRIs, NPMs and NGOs should be involved as much as 
possible in such joint initiatives.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was suggested that European and United Nations human rights mechanisms could 
encourage the ratification of treaties adopted within each other&#8217;s intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations. For instance, the CPT could encourage the CoE&#8217;s member States to 
</p>
<p>ratify the United Nations the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
</p>
<p>  
 b The term &#8220;NGOs&#8221; used in this document includes Disabled People Organizations (DPOs). </p>


<p>or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the OPCAT and the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The possibility of inviting countries outside the European region to ratify the 
European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment was flagged, in particular in the context of the evolving 
situation in North Africa.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Endeavours could be made for joint advocacy to encourage States to extend standing 
invitations to United Nations mandate holders and also to accept requests for visits 
from them, especially the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was proposed that regular meetings between United Nations and European human 
rights mechanisms on torture be held in which expertise on issues in relation to 
torture, best practices and lessons learned could be shared. NHRIs, NPMs and 
NGOs should be involved as much as possible in such meetings.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint press releases could be issued by several human rights mechanisms only for 
specific situations or events in order to preserve their exceptional character. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint capacity building activities may also be carried out, in particular with regard to 
the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities deprived of their liberty and 
CPRD standards. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Bearing in mind the public SPT Guidelines on NPMs, both United Nations and 
European human rights mechanisms on torture could assist States in the 
establishment of NPMs and could jointly provide technical assistance to them, once 
they are established United Nations and European mechanisms would try to 
coordinate their assistance to NPMs so as to avoid overlaps and duplication. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants highlighted the significant impact of joint activities at the local level. 
They suggested increasing the number of joint activities of United Nations and 
European human rights mechanisms on torture. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperation between CAT and CPT could be strengthened and expanded to United 
Nations mechanisms, such as the CRPD, and other regional mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperation with United Nations relevant agencies should also be strengthened, for 
instance with the World Health Organization&#8217;s in the framework of the Quality 
</p>
<p>Rights Project 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants expressed the view that there could be a need in specific cases to keep 
track of persons or groups of persons who have cooperated with United Nations and 
European mechanisms to ensure their protection from reprisals.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants mentioned the importance for the Human Rights Council Special 
Procedures to act in accordance with their Code of Conduct when interacting with 
their colleagues from other mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Follow up to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; It was suggested that a working group between United Nations and European human 
rights mechanisms on torture be established to discuss concrete ways of cooperation 
with regard to follow up on recommendations made by different bodies. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regular contact between United Nations and European human rights mechanisms on 
torture should be increased to follow up on the implementation of their 
recommendations. Videoconferences could contribute to a better coordinated follow 
up.  </p>


<p>&#8226; National actors, including NPMs, NHRIs, and NGOs should be encouraged to 
follow up on international and regional recommendations, taking into account the 
fact that they are closer to the ground and thus in a better position to do the follow-
up. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants have expressed the view that joint advocacy with States aimed at 
implementing common recommendations of United Nations and European human 
rights mechanisms on torture could be conducted.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regional workshops and national round tables, including regional and national 
stakeholders, could be held to review implementation of recommendations from 
different mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Follow up visits by both United Nations and European human rights mechanisms on 
torture could be undertaken to States in need of assistance for implementation of 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was agreed that NPMs can play a key role in the follow up to recommendations 
resulting from United Nations and European human rights mechanisms on torture 
and should be encouraged to do so. For example, NPMs can follow up on CAT and 
CPT recommendations. It was also proposed that NPMs follow up on CRPD 
recommendations when relevant. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants expressed the view that intergovernmental bodies, like the Human 
Rights Council and the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers play an important 
role in persuading States to implement recommendations. For instance, during the 
Universal Periodic Review, the Human Rights Council can add recommendations to 
this effect. Similarly, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe could 
follow up on the CPT&#8217;s public statements.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was suggested that recommendations should be structured in the order of priorities 
to facilitate their prompt implementation, as it is being done by CAT. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Given the importance of access to information in the context of prevention of torture 
and protection of victims of torture at national level, reports from United Nations 
and European human rights mechanisms on torture could be made available in 
national languages and accessible formats. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was proposed that contributions from regional human rights mechanisms to the 
UPR could be included as a separate section in OHCHR&#8217;s summary of stakeholder&#8217;s 
information, similarly to the contributions from A status NHRIs.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Role of NPMs 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Participants expressed the view that NPMs should increase the exchange of 
experiences, best practices, lessons learned and methods of work among them. The 
important role played by the CoE European NPM Project in this regard was 
underscored.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The NPMs&#8217; role in the follow up to recommendations resulting from both United 
</p>
<p>Nations and European human rights mechanisms on torture was highlighted. 
Participants encouraged them to always take these recommendations into account in 
their day-to-day work. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was proposed that both the CPT and the SPT share internal tools on methodology 
with different actors working on torture, including NPMs and NGOs, provided that 
they are not confidential. CPT&#8217;s practice of declassifying internal documents was 
welcomed and other mechanisms were encouraged to do so. </p>


<p>&#8226; Participants expressed the view that NPMs&#8217; members could be invited as experts to 
</p>
<p>visits undertaken by both the CPT and SPT. Some challenges were highlighted, 
including the fact that the SPT can only invite experts who are on the SPT&#8217;s roster of 
experts, as well as that the CPT can only invite NPMs&#8217; members if they are not 
</p>
<p>nationals from the country where the visit is going to take place. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was proposed that NPMs&#8217; members take part in trainings of new members 
</p>
<p>conducted by both the SPT and the CPT. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants expressed the view that a way to maximize and share with other regions 
the results of the European NPM Project is inviting NPM&#8217;s members from other 
regions to its workshops and visits. In this regard, it was mentioned that the 
European NPM Project is looking to expanding the Project to facilitate sharing of 
methodological tools and NPM reports, as well as reaching out to share the 
European NPM Network&#8217;s experience with other regions and new NPMs.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Discussions also touched upon how international and regional torture prevention 
bodies can help NPMs with any serious systemic issue, such as lack of budgetary 
resources, and raise this with the relevant State.   
</p>
<p><b> 5.  Role of NGOs 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Participants proposed that NGOs actively participate in the establishment of NPMs. 
The process of establishment of NPMs should be open, transparent and inclusive.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was suggested that focal points or working groups can be established in States in 
order to develop a strategy on NPM budget, legislation, with the participation of 
NGOs.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was proposed that other international and regional actors, such as OHCHR, 
ODIHR, OSCE field missions, CoE field offices, and international NGOs are invited 
to take part in the process of establishment of NPMs.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was highlighted that NGOs can play an active role in the monitoring activities of 
NPMs. Examples were given of several countries where such a collaborative model 
can be found. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants expressed the view that NPMs should engage more with NGOs in their 
day-to day work. NGOs could provide information, as well as technical assistance to 
NPMs through joint projects, training of NPMs&#8217; staff, advising the NPMs on their 
methods of work, etc.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; NGOs play an important role in disseminating NPMs&#8217; work, including through 
</p>
<p>distribution of NPM&#8217;s reports, monitoring the implementation of their 
</p>
<p>recommendations by the States authorities and conducting awareness-raising 
activities about the work of NPMs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The NGOs&#8217; role as watchdog of the NPMs&#8217; performance was highlighted. It was 
</p>
<p>suggested that they actively monitor NPM&#8217;s work through reports, statements, etc.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants agreed on the important role played by NGOs in identifying best 
practices developed by both United Nations and European human rights mechanisms 
on torture as well as key areas of concern. Tools and arrangements to share these 
best practices should be put in place. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The key role played by NGOs with regard to follow up to recommendations 
resulting from both United Nations and European mechanisms was underscored. It 
was mentioned that they can undertake visits to follow up on recommendations from </p>


<p>United Nations and regional human rights mechanisms on torture. Participants 
encouraged NGOs to keep making efforts in this regard. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants noted that NGOs have the skills and focus to raise awareness about SPT 
and CPT activities and recommendations, in particular with regard to visits.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was mentioned that there is room for more collaboration between the SPT and 
NGOs. Participants encouraged both to go further in their cooperation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; NGOs can play an important role in convening and facilitating constructive 
dialogues among international, regional and domestic bodies relevant to torture so 
they can share information about each other&#8217;s standards and best practices. NGOs 
</p>
<p>having expertise and experience working with specific groups deprived of their 
liberty can feed into the information sharing process and convene relevant 
stakeholders.  </p>

<p><b>  Regional consultation for Africa on enhancing cooperation 
between United Nations and regional human rights 
mechanisms on prevention of torture and protection of 
victims of torture, especially people deprived of their liberty 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Addis Ababa, 6 and 7 February 2012 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>Participants to the regional consultation included a member of the United Nations 
Committee Against Torture (CAT), a member of the United Nations Sub-committee on the 
Prevention of Torture (SPT), the Special Rapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of 
Detention in Africa, representatives of the Secretariat of the African Commission on 
Peoples&#8217; and Human Rights (ACHPR), a Judge of the African Court on Peoples&#8217; and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 
representatives of National Preventive Mechanisms (NPMs), National Human Rights 
Institutions (NHRIs) from the region, and civil society organizations. The aim of the 
regional consultation was to identify concrete means and ways of cooperation between the 
United Nations and African human rights mechanisms on the fight against torture and other 
ill treatment, taking into account key areas identified during the International workshop on 
cooperation between international and regional human rights mechanisms held in Geneva in 
2010 (A/HRC/15/56), namely: sharing of information, possible joint activities and follow-
up on recommendations by human rights mechanisms, as well as the role of NPMs, NHRIs 
and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>Participants discussed and suggested to develop means and tools of cooperation including: 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Information sharing 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; It was agreed that it is necessary to share information between United Nations and 
African mechanisms on torture in order to avoid overlaps and duplication, as well as 
to improve their effectiveness.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Some challenges were highlighted with regard to information sharing, including the 
lack of institutionalization of ways and means to share information, internal 
communication problems, the principle of confidentiality of some mechanisms, the 
lack of trust and the competition between different actors. All these factors prevent 
the establishment of a regular exchange of information based on reciprocity.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The role of NGOs, NHRIs and NPMs in relation to information sharing between 
mechanisms was highlighted as well as the importance of building trust between 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was highlighted that each mechanism has a different nature and mandate. 
Therefore, those differences should be taken into account when sharing information. 
For instance, the SPT and the CPTA have similar but not identical mandates and 
should share information, provided that confidentiality is respected. </p>


<p>&#8226; Participants agreed that there is information that is public and can be easily shared. 
For instance, methods of work, contact details of interlocutors, criteria to interview 
detainees, criteria to visit detention places, etc. However, it was agreed that not all 
kind of information should be shared and confidentiality should still be respected, 
especially for the sake of protection of victims. At the same time, confidentiality 
should not hamper the implementation and follow up of recommendations. Thus, 
participants agreed that different institutional channels should be established in order 
to share information while respecting its different nature. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was suggested that mechanisms on torture should consult each other and share 
information at different stages in conformity with its working methods: strategic 
planning, planning of activities, implementation of activities and follow up.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was proposed that United Nations and African mechanisms on torture share 
strategy plans, plans of work, contact details, calendars, urgent appeals sent to the 
country where the activity is going to take place, i.e. visits, relevant mechanisms&#8217; 
decisions, reports and recommendations, i.e., UPR, CAT, CRPD, ACPHR, the 
African Court on Peoples and Human Rights, reports from NHRIs and NGOs, etc.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The importance of designating focal points in each mechanism aimed at enhancing 
cooperation, in particular information sharing, was underscored. It was proposed that 
focal points are designated as soon as possible. OHCHR should follow up on this 
issue. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; United Nations and African mechanisms on torture should ensure that their reports, 
decisions and recommendations are easily accessible by other mechanisms. This 
could be facilitated by focal points and by technological means, i.e., websites, 
mailing lists etc. OHCHR&#8217;s potential role in facilitating exchanges between 
mechanisms was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was suggested to incorporate to this outcome document the recommendations 
made during the dialogue between United Nations and African Special Procedures 
Mandate Holders, held in January 2012. For instance, the exchange of the lists of 
Secretariat staffs responsible for supporting the thematic and geographic mandate-
holders or the creation of an email list and other information material to facilitate 
desk-to-desk exchanges and coordination. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The role of NGOs with regard to information sharing was highlighted. NGOs ensure 
that United Nations and African mechanisms on torture have access to good quality 
information, including information concerning persons with psycho-social 
disabilities. However, NGOs should not be seen and used only as service providers. 
Some participants mentioned the challenge of having different NGOs speaking 
different voices.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Thematic meetings could be organized between United Nations and African 
mechanisms so as to make progress in both the standard setting and to discuss 
substantial topics, including for instance, monitoring psychiatric and social care 
institutions and CRPD standards. In this connection, it was suggested that for 
example the CPTA who will start undertaking studies on substantive issues, builds 
on those developed by United Nations mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Possible joint activities 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Arrangements of cooperation could be established between United Nations and 
African mechanisms on torture, for example joint missions, joint press releases, joint 
urgent appeals, joint seminars and joint capacity building activities. However, some </p>


<p>challenges were mentioned, including limited capacity and resources, different 
working methods and lack of an institutional framework. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was recommended that an institutional framework on cooperation between United 
Nations and African mechanisms on torture is developed, so as to define the kind of 
joint activities that could be undertaken, as well as to define responsibilities of each 
mechanism. It was recommended to reflect on the form that this institutional 
framework could take, either a general memorandum of understanding (MoU), or 
specific MoUs between United Nations and African mechanisms on torture, building 
on the 10 year capacity building programme (TYCBP) for the AU and on the 
existing MoU between the AU and OHCHR (2010), or a roadmap to concretely 
address the way forward on cooperation between United Nations and African human 
rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was also proposed that an amendment is made to the African Charter, in particular 
to the article 5 by including a specific definition of torture, so as to standardize both 
United Nations and African norms on the fight against torture. This will allow both 
mechanisms to enhance their cooperation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Alternatively, it was also suggested to amend the rules of procedure of both United 
Nations and African mechanisms on torture, so as to facilitate cooperation through 
the definition of a clear institutional framework. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; United Nations and African mechanisms on torture should get more involved in each 
other&#8217;s activities and make sure that they involve NHRIs, NPMs and NGOs as much 
</p>
<p>as possible. For instance, they can invite members from other mechanisms to their 
activities as observers or resource persons, including country visits and sessions in 
conformity with its working methods.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint publications could be issued by United Nations and African mechanisms on 
torture, including an annual bulletin containing main activities and best practices on 
cooperation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint capacity building activities could also be carried out. In particular, it was 
suggested to enhance the knowledge of both United Nations and African 
mechanisms on instruments against torture, including the Robben Island Guidelines 
and United Nations principles and guidelines.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was proposed that exchanges of staff take place in order to share best practices and 
to allow a better knowledge of each other&#8217;s working methods. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was suggested to submit the recommendations resulting from this regional 
consultation to the annual meetings of United Nations mechanisms (Treaty Bodies 
and Special Procedures), as well as to the ACPHR plenary. For instance, it was 
suggested to use the forthcoming annual meeting of the Treaty Bodies&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Chairpersons, which is scheduled to be held in June 2012 in Addis Abba. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; United Nations mechanisms on torture and OHCHR should be invited to participate 
as a partner in the expert workshop to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the 
Robben Island Guidelines which will be held later in 2012 in South Africa.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A joint press release of both United Nations and regional mechanisms, including 
African mechanisms mandated to fight against torture should be issued on the 
occasion of the international day in support of victims of torture (26 June). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Follow up to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; United Nations and African mechanisms on torture should use their country visits to 
follow up on each other&#8217;s recommendations. Both mechanisms should acknowledge </p>


<p>and facilitate the key role of national actors, including NPMs, NHRIs, and civil 
society organizations in relation to follow up on their recommendations. Feedbacks 
after country missions are essentials.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was proposed that contributions from regional human rights mechanisms to the 
UPR be included as a separate section in OHCHR&#8217;s summary of stakeholder&#8217;s 
information, similarly to the contributions from A status NHRIs. OHCHR&#8217;s role in 
</p>
<p>this regard was highlighted. At the same time, African mechanisms should commit 
to prepare the reports to be submitted.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; United Nations and African mechanisms should encourage States to incorporate 
United Nations and regional treaties on torture into their domestic legislation and 
ensure its effective implementation, so recommendations can be more effectively 
and promptly implemented. In this regard, it was proposed that both mechanisms 
provide support to the CPTA in the elaboration of the model law on criminalization 
of torture, and in its wide dissemination once finalized.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; There was also a debate on the issue that laws providing for the detention of persons 
with psycho-social disabilities must be reviewed so as to be complainant with CRPD 
standards. In addition, monitoring of centers of detention for persons with psycho-
social disabilities should include monitoring of the legality of the detention. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was suggested that a mechanism to follow up on the recommendations resulting 
from this regional consultation is established. Further discussions between United 
Nations and African mechanisms on torture should be held so as to define possible 
modalities of this follow up mechanism.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The African Union Member States may want to consider to ratifying the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as the EU did. Furthermore, the African 
Union should encourage African States which have not ratified the CRPD and its 
Optional Protocol, to do so. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was recommended that speeding up the procedures of the ACHPR would facilitate 
follow up.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was suggested that a better quality of recommendations would have a positive 
effect on the effectiveness of their follow up.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Role of NPMs 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Participants expressed the view that NPMs should increase the exchange of 
experiences, best practices, lessons learned and methods of work among them, 
especially within Africa. In this regard, it was recommended that synergies between 
the ACPHR and the Network of African National Human Rights Institutions 
(NANHRI) are established.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The European NPM project was highlighted as a good practice and opportunity for 
cross regional exchange. It was proposed that African NPMs officially request to 
participate in meetings organized by the European NPM Project. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; NPMs&#8217; role in the follow up to recommendations resulting from both United Nations 
</p>
<p>and African mechanisms on torture was highlighted. Participants encouraged them 
to take these recommendations into account in their day-to-day work. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The relationship between NPMs and the SPT should be further developed. Cost-
effective ways of communication should be sought, including conference calls and 
more direct exchanges.  </p>


<p>&#8226; An interfaced between African NPMs, the SPT and the CPTA should be established. 
The idea of a regional NPM network should be further explored. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; National actors such as NHRIs and NGOs should cooperate more with NPMs, in 
order to complement and reinforce each other. They can for example, jointly 
organize thematic seminars to which the SPT and the CPTA could be invited to 
participate.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; On the other hand, NPMs should engage more with NGOs in their day-to-day work. 
Legal obstacles to this collaboration should be removed. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; With respect to the ACPHR, it was suggested the creation of a permanent platform 
between African NPMs and the ACPHR, in particular to enhance engagement with 
the Special Rapporteur on prisons and conditions of detention in Africa and the 
CPTA.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A call to the CPTA was made in order to define a strategy of engagement with 
NPMs outside ACPHR&#8217;s sessions. It was also suggested that the CPTA shares its 
</p>
<p>strategic plan with NPMs, as well as that it develops a gap analysis project aimed at 
evaluating NPMs&#8217; effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; With regard to United Nations mechanisms, it was recommended that the SPT and 
OHCHR, in collaboration with the CPTA develop a relationship of proximity with 
African NPMs aimed at assessing their effectiveness, as well as to build their 
capacities.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; United Nations and African mechanisms should encourage States to take 
commitments to establish NPMs and to strengthen the existent ones, including their 
legal framework, their independence as well as their human and financial resources. 
It was mentioned that this is already an existing practice of CAT when reviewing 
State parties&#8217; periodic reports. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A call to the United Nations was made so as to assess its technical support to NPMs, 
as well as to create innovative ways to facilitate NPMs&#8217; access to it. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; NPMs should engage with subregional human rights mechanisms, including 
ECOWAS and East Africa Courts of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Role of NGOs 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The key role played by NGOs with regard to follow up to recommendations 
resulting from both United Nations and African mechanisms was underscored. This 
monitoring function should be based on constructive dialogue and cooperation with 
Governments. However, their independence should be preserved. It was mentioned 
that NGOs can undertake visits to follow up on recommendations from United 
Nations and regional human rights mechanisms on torture. Participants encouraged 
NGOs to keep making efforts in this regard. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It was recommended that United Nations and African mechanisms on torture reports 
are made public as much as possible, so as to allow NGOs to follow up on them. For 
instance, the reports of the forthcoming &#8220;NPM focused&#8221; missions of the SPT.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; NGOs role in the establishment of NPMs was highlighted. It was suggested that 
NGOs continue to form coalitions that help in the process of establishment of 
NPMs, as well as with regard to their functioning by contributing to make them 
complainant with OPCAT and SPT guidelines on NPMs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The NGO&#8217;s role as watchdog of the NPMs&#8217; performance was highlighted. It was 
</p>
<p>suggested that they actively monitor NPM&#8217;s work through reports, statements, etc.  </p>


<p>&#8226; NGOs play an important role in disseminating information on African and United 
Nations mechanisms on torture, as well as on NPMs&#8217; work, including through 
</p>
<p>distribution of reports and awareness-raising activities. The importance that NGOs 
receive feedback and information from these mechanisms was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Participants agreed on the important role played by NGOs in identifying best 
practices developed by both United Nations and African human rights mechanisms. 
Tools and arrangements to share these best practices should be put in place. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; NGOs&#8217; capacities should be reinforced. United Nations and African mechanisms on 
</p>
<p>torture should conduct capacity building activities aimed at facilitating NGOs&#8217; 
</p>
<p>access to information on their functioning.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; With regard to victims and witness protection, it was highlighted that confidentiality 
and other protection mechanisms should be put in place so as to enhance NGOs&#8217; role 
</p>
<p>in the fight against torture.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The role that NGOs can play in bringing up the specificities of human rights 
situations in various African countries was highlighted. NGOs can facilitate a 
focused approach of United Nations and African mechanisms on torture in their 
engagement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; NGOs can play an important role in convening and facilitating constructive 
dialogues among regional, international and domestic mechanisms on torture so they 
can share information about each other&#8217;s standards and best practices. NGOs having 
</p>
<p>expertise and experience working with specific groups deprived of their liberty can 
feed into this information sharing process and convene relevant stakeholders.
