</b></p>
<p><b>  25/15. 
Promotion of a democratic and equitable international order 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on this issue, in particular Assembly 
resolution 65/223 of 21 December 2010 and Council resolutions 8/5 of 18 June 2008, 18/6 
of 29 September 2011 and 21/9 of 27 September 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote 
universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms for all, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other instruments 
relating to human rights and international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that the enhancement of international cooperation for the promotion and 
protection of all human rights should continue to be carried out in full conformity with the 
purposes and principles of the Charter and of international law as set forth in Articles 1 and 
2 of the Charter and, inter alia, with full respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, 
political independence, the non-use of force or the threat of force in international relations 
and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any 
State, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Preamble to the Charter, in particular the determination to reaffirm 
faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the 
equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the 
rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully 
realized, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the determination expressed in the Preamble to the Charter to save 
succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to establish conditions under which justice 
and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law 
</p>

<p>can be maintained, to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, 
to practice tolerance and good neighbourliness, and to employ international machinery for 
the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that the responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social 
issues, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the 
nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally and that, in this regard, the 
central role must be played by the United Nations as the most universal and representative 
organization in the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> the major changes taking place on the international scene and the 
aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the 
Charter, including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of 
peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law, pluralism, development, better 
standards of living and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human 
rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United Nations, including 
the effective promotion and protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, 
colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that democracy, development and respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that democracy is 
based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, 
social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the promotion and protection of human rights should be based on 
the principle of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the capacity 
of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations for the benefit of all 
human beings, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that democracy is not only a political concept, but that it also has 
economic and social dimensions, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right to 
development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of 
society, and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary 
foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with concern</i> that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, the inequitable distribution of wealth, 
marginalization and social exclusion, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that dialogue among religions, cultures and civilizations could 
contribute greatly to the enhancement of international cooperation at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining </i>the fact that it is imperative for the international community to ensure 
that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world&#8217;s people and that only through 
broad and sustained efforts, based on our common humanity in all its diversity, can 
globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that the current global economic, financial, energy and food 
crises, resulting from a combination of several major factors, including macroeconomic and </p>


<p>other factors, such as environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, 
natural disasters and the lack of financial resources and the technology necessary to 
confront their negative impact in developing countries, particularly in the least developed 
countries and small island developing States, represent a global scenario that is threatening 
the adequate enjoyment of all human rights and widening the gap between developed and 
developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must 
include policies and measures at the global level that correspond to the needs of developing 
countries and countries with economies in transition and are formulated and implemented 
with their effective participation, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing also</i> the need for adequate financing of, and technology transfer to, 
developing countries, in particular landlocked developing countries and small island 
developing States, including to support their efforts to adapt to climate change, 
</p>
<p><i>Having listened</i> to the peoples of the world, and recognizing their aspirations to 
justice, to equality of opportunity for all, to the enjoyment of their human rights, including 
the right to development, to live in peace and freedom and to equal participation without 
discrimination in economic, social, cultural, civil and political life, 
</p>

international order, 
</p>

full realization of all human rights for all; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Declares</i> that democracy includes respect for all human rights and

to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full 
participation in all aspects of their lives, and reaffirms the need for universal adherence to 
and implementation of the rule of law at both the national and international levels; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Reaffirms</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in particular the 
principle that the will of the people, as expressed through periodic and genuine elections, 
shall be the basis of government authority, as well as the right to choose representatives 
freely through periodic and genuine elections, which shall be by universal and equal 
suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Calls upon</i> all Member States to fulfil their commitment expressed during the 
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, to maximize the benefits of globalization 
through, inter alia, the strengthening and enhancement of international cooperation to 
increase equality of opportunities for trade, economic growth and sustainable development, 
global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural 
exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity, and reiterates that 
only through broad and sustained efforts to create a shared future based upon our common 
humanity and all its diversity can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Reaffirms</i> that a democratic and equitable international order requires, inter 
alia, the realization of the following: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The right of all peoples to self-determination, by virtue of which they can 
freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural

fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, and reaffirms that,

</p>
<p>11. <i>Also reaffirms</i> the need to continue working urgently for the establishment of 
an international economic order based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence,
