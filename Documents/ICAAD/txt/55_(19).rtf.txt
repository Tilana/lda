Analysis of the Evidence

The Court gave the Prosecution and the Defence time to file simultaneous submissions with respect to this case. Both have made submissions. The Court has considered their submissions. 

The accused was charged for using abusive language in a public place, contrary to Section 7 (2) of The Minor Offences Act (Cap 18). 

The onus in this case, is on the prosecution to prove the case and the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. Lord Denning in Miller v. Minister of Pensions, in commenting on the proof beyond reasonable doubt stated: "it need not reach certainty, but it must carry a high degree of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a shadow of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence 'of course it is possible but not in the least probable,' the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice."

The Court noted the evidence of the witnesses and noted their respective demeanors. The prosecution called 4 witnesses and the Defence called 4 as well. This case ultimately boils down to the prosecution witnesses and the defence witnesses versions. 

The complainant (Raj Kumar) told the court "accused was 20 yards from me. Accused said "mother fucker and fuck your mother  what you want". Accused continued swearing and ran towards me. Accused was 5-6m away from me. I stood up for self-defence." The 2nd Prosecution witness stated in Court that he "did not see Raj Kumar. Was on the other-side. Cannot recall match. I saw commotion on other side. Road-end. I could not make out what happened. I just observed. I saw accused come to half-way line. He said to "hell with you and Nadroga Soccer". Accused said "ha tum jao gand marao". Where commotion was going on. Could not make out to whom." Pw-4 told the Court "Someone from outside said "murgi-chor" the accused went towards Raj kumar and said mother fucker  "Mai-chod". [witness pointed to complainant (Raj Kumar) sitting in Court]. Accused said "mother fucker" to the complainant. Complainant was seated next to me. Munaf pointed towards complainant and was swearing. Accused was saying "Mother fucker". Raj Kumar stood up in self-defence, then accused came towards him. Some players stopped Munaf.

The Accused told the Court that "In 1st half called one player of Downtown to verbally caution him. As soon as I called him, a spectator (Ra Kumar) yelled "bullshit". I requested him not to pass remarks. Complainant stood up and said "fuck your father", "This is not Labasa, I will see you." He charged towards me. I went further back to observe what was happening" D-2 told the Court "Complainant shouted "bullshit" Referee. Accused said to complainant not to disturb the game. Complainant tried to disturb the game. Complainant tried to threaten the accused. Cameroon players took complainant away. Accused did not swear at the complainant. Referees give reports to NSA. Was not incited to give evidence. Was 10m from the accused. If accused used abusive words would hear." D-3 stated "I heard complainant shout abuse at the ref "bullshit Ref". Ref went to the sideline stopped complainant. Complainant swore at the ref. I was captain of club. I was 10 m from accused. Complainant did swear at accused's father and said to send accused back to Labasa. While D-4 stated in Court "was playing soccer, playing for Downtown. Game on. Accused was ref. he cautioned a player from outside complainant said "Ref bullshit". Accused stopped the game and went and warned complainant not to pass comments. Complainant swore at the accused. Accused did not swear at complainant. I was a player, if accused swore I will hear was near to the referee."

The Court has noted all the evidence and as earlier stated this case boils down to which version the Court believes. The Prosecution witnesses are not consistent with their evidence. One instance is that the Complainant told the Court that the accused said "mother fucker and fuck your mother  what you want". Accused continued swearing and ran towards me. Accused was 5-6m away from me." The 2nd witness told the Court "I saw accused come to half-way line. He said to "hell with you and Nadroga Soccer". Accused said "ha tum jao gand marao." The complainant states that the accused was close (5-6m) to him whereas the 2nd witness states the accused was at the half-way line. The accused states that the complainant stated "mother fucker and fuck your mother" whereas the 2nd witness states "accused come to half-way line. He said to "hell with you and Nadroga Soccer". Accused said "ha tum jao gand marao." There is inconsistency in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. However the Court has taken noted the 4th Prosecution witness is consistent with the complainant. The 2nd Prosecution witness and the inconsistencies do not assist the prosecution case. 

The 2nd prosecution witnesses evidence has created doubts in the Courts mind as to what actually happened. All the defence witnesses are consistent and they maintain that the accused did not swear at the complainant. 

The Court has to decide which version it believes. It is an onerous task deciding when two sides come to Court one with one version and the other side with another. The Court in applying the law and the facts in this case has to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubts as to the commission of the offence. Having noted the evidence and the demeanor of the witnesses the evidence against the accused is not so strong as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence 'of course it is possible but not in the least probable,' the case is not proved beyond reasonable doubt and but nothing short of that will suffice in criminal cases. 

The Court is satisfied that the prosecution has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. A number of doubts linger in the Courts mind which cannot be reconciled and the Court cannot on the evidence at hand convict the accused. 

The accused is acquitted of the charge. 

28 Days to appeal.
