<p>highlights issues of concern in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and makes 
</p>
<p>recommendations with regard to each of the main duty-bearers concerned, namely the 
</p>
<p>Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the authorities in Gaza. With regard to 
</p>
<p>issues in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the High Commissioner examines the 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force by Israeli and Palestinian security forces, which has led to an 
</p>
<p>increase in deaths in the past year. With regard to Gaza, he addresses the ongoing blockade 
</p>
<p>and the enforcement of access restricted areas, noting the hardships and human rights 
</p>
<p>violations that these measures created. In particular, he draws attention to the impact of the 
</p>
<p>blockade on freedom of movement and reconstruction and economic development in Gaza.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, the seventh periodic report of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory, covers the period from 9 November 2013 to 31 October 2014.  
</p>
<p>2. The period from 12 June to 26 August 2014 was marked by violence throughout the 
</p>
<p>West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and an unprecedented escalation of hostilities in 
</p>
<p>Gaza. The possible violations of international humanitarian law and international human 
</p>
<p>rights law and the human rights abuses committed during that period have been addressed 
</p>
<p>separately (see A/HRC/28/80/Add.<footnote name="1">5 PCATI submission, pp. 20-24. 
</footnote>). The International Commission of Inquiry, established 
</p>
<p>pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-21/1, is due to report on the events between 
</p>
<p>12 June and 26 August 2014, and will address issues of accountability for violations of 
</p>
<p>international law at the twenty-eighth session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>3. The information contained in the present report is based primarily on human rights 
</p>
<p>monitoring carried out by the field presence of the Office of the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR) in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Monitoring activities are implemented 
</p>
<p>within the framework of General Assembly resolution 48/141 and Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolutions S-9/1 and S-12/1. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal background 
</b></p>
<p>4. International human rights law and international humanitarian law apply in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory. A detailed analysis of the legal obligations of Israel, as the 
</p>
<p>occupying Power, the Palestinian Authority, the de facto authorities and Palestinian armed 
</p>
<p>groups in Gaza are contained in the first periodic report of the High Commissioner on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (A/HRC/12/37, paras. 5-9). 
</p>
<p>5. In 2014, the State of Palestine deposited instruments of accession to 20 international 
</p>
<p>treaties,1 including seven of the nine core international human rights treaties (see paras. 67 
</p>
<p>&#8211; 70 below).<footnote name="2">6 OHCHR, Press briefing notes on Israel / Occupied Palestinian Territory, 20 June 2014.  </footnote> By acceding to these treaties, the State of Palestine has assumed legal 
</p>
<p>obligations under international law, including that of reporting to various human rights 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies. Nevertheless, Israel, as the occupying Power, remains bound by international 
</p>
<p>human rights law and international humanitarian law, while other relevant actors also 
</p>
<p>remain bound by international law. 
</p>
<p>6. On 23 April 2014, Fatah and Hamas agreed to form a government of national 
</p>
<p>consensus, which was sworn in by President Mahmoud Abbas, under the leadership of 
</p>
<p>Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, on 2 June 2014. At the end of the period under review, 
</p>
<p>however, uncertainty remained with regard to the actual power exercised by the 
</p>
<p>Government and the degree to which it or any other authority or group exercised control in 
</p>
<p>Gaza. In any event, those authorities or groups exercising government-like functions and 
</p>
<p>effective control over territory in Gaza are bound by relevant human rights law in that 
</p>
<p>territory (see A/HRC/8/17, para. 9). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See &#8220;Palestine&#8217;s Accession to International Treaties Q&amp;A&#8221;, 2 April 2014, available on the website of 
</p>
<p>the Negotiations Affairs Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization (www.nad-plo.org).  
</p>

<p><b> III. Human rights violations by all duty-bearers 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Blockade of Gaza and access restricted areas 
</b></p>
<p>7. The blockade imposed by Israel on Gaza since 2007 in violation of international law 
</p>
<p>continued to affect adversely the enjoyment of human rights in Gaza, in particular 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights (A/HRC/28/45, paras. 34&#8211;<footnote name="42">Ibid., p. 13. </footnote>). In the access restricted 
</p>
<p>areas, the continued use of live fire by Israel Defense Forces resulted in the injury and death 
</p>
<p>of several Palestinians.
 
 
</p>
<p>8. Import and export restrictions imposed by Israel continue to reduce economic 
</p>
<p>activity in Gaza, thereby stifling the economy.3 The Kerem Shalom crossing, the only 
</p>
<p>operating commercial crossing between Gaza and Israel, allows a maximum of 500 
</p>
<p>truckloads of goods to enter Gaza a day, which is insufficient to meet the needs of the 
</p>
<p>population. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the 
</p>
<p>weekly average number of truckloads in 2014, when compared to pre-blockade levels, 
</p>
<p>stood at 32 per cent for imports and less than 1 per cent for exports.<footnote name="4">1.  
</footnote> Unemployment 
</p>
<p>increased in Gaza from 26.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2007
 
to 44.5 per cent in the 
</p>
<p>same quarter of 2014. 5 Before the Israeli military operation &#8220;Protective Edge&#8221;, 57 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the population in Gaza were food insecure; and by the end of 2014, 70 per cent were 
</p>
<p>dependent on humanitarian aid.<footnote name="6">Gisha, the Gaza Cheat Sheet: Real Data on the Gaza Closure, 19 January 2015.  
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>9. Israel continues to limit the passage of Palestinians through the Erez crossing to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;exceptional humanitarian cases&#8221;. As a result, Palestinians in Gaza were unable to go to the 
</p>
<p>West Bank, including East Jerusalem, or abroad, for educational or professional purposes. 
</p>
<p>They thus relied heavily on the Rafah crossing, between Gaza and Egypt, until its closure in 
</p>
<p>October 2014. Since then, the Erez crossing is the only option for Palestinians to leave 
</p>
<p>Gaza.  
</p>
<p>10. The access of Palestinians in Gaza to emergency medical treatment outside Gaza 
</p>
<p>through Erez remained unpredictable and fluctuated. Given the vast number of seriously 
</p>
<p>injured Palestinians requiring medical treatment during and after the escalation of hostilities 
</p>
<p>in July and August 2014, and the damage sustained to the already limited health facilities 
</p>
<p>and capacity in Gaza, the number of permits granted did not meet the needs of the 
</p>
<p>population. With the repeated closure of the Rafah crossing, many people requiring medical 
</p>
<p>treatment unavailable in Gaza were unable to seek medical treatment outside of it. 
</p>
<p>11. The restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians from Gaza were further 
</p>
<p>compounded by the frequent closure of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Prior 
</p>
<p>to the escalation, the crossing had operated irregularly, with entry and exit limited to 
</p>
<p>Palestinians with dual citizenship, those with foreign visas and/or Egyptian residency 
</p>
<p>status, and patients requiring emergency medical care.<footnote name="7">Gisha, &#8220;One step at a time: Israel revises criteria for exiting Gaza&#8221;, 26 October 2014.  </footnote> The crossing was open daily 
</p>
<p>between 26 August and 24 October 2014 for the same category of people, but was closed

</p>

<p>thereafter following an attack on Egyptian military troops in the Sinai. It was still closed at 
</p>
<p>the end of the period under review.
 
 
</p>
<p>12. The restricted access of fishermen to fishing waters continued. Israeli Naval Forces 
</p>
<p>arrested approximately 53 fishermen, confiscated 22 boats, damaged one and destroyed two 
</p>
<p>others during the period under review. 
</p>
<p>13. The restrictions of Israel on the entry of construction materials into Gaza continued 
</p>
<p>to undermine the reconstruction and economic development in Gaza. The Gaza 
</p>
<p>Reconstruction Mechanism, a temporary agreement between the Government of Palestine 
</p>
<p>and the Government of Israel brokered by the United Nations in September 2014 and 
</p>
<p>launched on 20 October 2014, represents an attempt to ease the crisis and to begin 
</p>
<p>reconstruction.
 
Given the scale of reconstruction needs, the initial phase of implementation 
</p>
<p>of the Mechanism produced only limited results;8 and whether it will lead to significant 
</p>
<p>increases in the flow of materials, such as cement, iron bars and gravel, into Gaza remains 
</p>
<p>to be seen. At the end of October 2014, more than 70,000 people remained homeless, their 
</p>
<p>homes having been damaged or destroyed during the hostilities.9
 
 
</p>
<p>14. Although accelerating the Mechanism is critical to addressing the situation of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, it is no substitute for lifting the blockade. The continued 
</p>
<p>imposition of the blockade is contrary to international law and constitutes a form of 
</p>
<p>collective punishment that denies the rights of the population in Gaza (see A/HRC/28/45, 
</p>
<p>paras. 34 &#8211; 42). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Excessive use of force and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>15. During the period under review, a dramatic increase was seen in the number of 
</p>
<p>incidents involving Israeli security forces in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p>resulting in 47 Palestinian fatalities.10 By comparison, there were 27 fatalities in the whole 
</p>
<p>of 2013 and eight in 2012. 
</p>
<p>16. Twenty fatalities were recorded in the context of demonstrations against the 
</p>
<p>hostilities in Gaza while they were ongoing (see A/HRC/28/80/Add.1). As in previous 
</p>
<p>years, both in the context of demonstrations and in other incidents, OHCHR documented 
</p>
<p>that Israeli security forces appeared to be under little or no threat at the time of the 
</p>
<p>incidents, indicating the unnecessary or disproportionate use of force (A/69/347, paras. 44 &#8211; 
</p>
<p>51).  
</p>
<p>17. Of particular concern was the killing of two Palestinian youths, shot at Beituniya in 
</p>
<p>the West Bank on 15 May 2014 in demonstrations commemorating what Palestinians call 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nakba day&#8221;. OHCHR found that the Israeli security forces faced no threat when the two 
</p>
<p>youths were killed. During the period under review, a total of six people were shot and 
</p>
<p>killed (including two children) and 128 were injured as a result of enforcement of access 
</p>
<p>restricted areas by Israeli security forces in Gaza. In some incidents, shooting by Israeli 
</p>
<p>security forces occurred in circumstances that, according to information available to 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, posed no threat to soldiers (A/HRC/28/45, paras. 15-17). Nine fishermen were 
</p>
<p>injured between 9 November 2013 and 31 October 2014 while reportedly fishing in the 
</p>
<p>permitted fishing zone. According to information gathered by OHCHR, the fishermen 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 As at 4 November 2014, some 700 Gazans had been able to purchase materials.  
</p>
<p> 9 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Occupied Palestinian Territory, Protection of 
</p>
<p>Civilians report, reporting period 28 October &#8211; 3 November 2014.  
</p>
<p> 10 Figures do not include the death of two Palestinians who allegedly died of tear gas inhalation during 
</p>
<p>clashes between Palestinians and the Israel Defense Forces (on 1 January and 14 April 2014 
</p>
<p>respectively). </p>


<p>posed no lethal threat to the Israeli security officers when they were shot, although some of 
</p>
<p>them reportedly attempted to approach the shore when they saw Israeli security forces ships 
</p>
<p>in the area.  
</p>
<p>18. B&#8217;tselem, an Israeli non-governmental organization, informed OHCHR that, since 
</p>
<p>the adoption of the policy of automatically opening of investigations regarding Palestinian 
</p>
<p>fatalities involving Israeli security forces in incidents outside of &#8220;combat activity&#8221;, there 
</p>
<p>had only been two indictments and one conviction out of 36 investigations launched.
 
With 
</p>
<p>regard to the access restricted areas, OHCHR was informed by the Legal Centre for Arab 
</p>
<p>Minority Rights in Israel (Adalah) that one investigation into an incident involving the use 
</p>
<p>of excessive force by Israeli security forces. Both the High Commissioner and the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General have highlighted the imperative need to ensure accountability for 
</p>
<p>incidents involving excessive use of force (see A/HRC/24/30 and A/69/347).
 
In that 
</p>
<p>connection, the High Commissioner takes note of the indictment of a border police officer 
</p>
<p>allegedly involved in one of the killings at Beituniya on 15 May 2014. No one has yet been 
</p>
<p>indicted in relation to the other killing on the same day. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Settlements and settler violence</b>11<b> 
</b></p>
<p>19. During the period under review, Israeli settlements continued to expand in the West 
</p>
<p>Bank, including East Jerusalem. For instance, in April and August 2014, more than 1,000 
</p>
<p>acres of land located nearby Bethlehem were declared State land (see A/HRC/28/44). Once 
</p>
<p>land is declared as such, it is often allocated for settlements (see A/69/348, para. 20 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/28/44, chap. IV).  
</p>
<p>20. Israeli settlements and settler violence continue to be a root cause of many violations 
</p>
<p>of the Palestinians&#8217; human rights. The well-documented failure of Israel to address settler 
</p>
<p>violence against Palestinians, either by protecting vulnerable communities or through 
</p>
<p>ensuring accountability for violence committed by settlers, has led to repeated violations 
</p>
<p>(see A/HRC/28/44, chap. V). According to one Israeli non-governmental organization, 
</p>
<p>between 2005 and 2014, 91.4 per cent of the complaints it monitored were closed without 
</p>
<p>an indictment.12  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Demolitions and forcible transfer 
</b></p>
<p>21. The High Commissioner has expressed concern on several occasions regarding 
</p>
<p>forced evictions and demolitions in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/40, paras. 17-22). According to the Office for the Coordination of 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory during the period under review, 
</p>
<p>620 Palestinian structures were demolished, of which 244 were residential. A total of 1,<footnote name="2">5 Ibid. 
</footnote>46 
</p>
<p>people were consequently displaced, including 699 children. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>22. In most cases, demolitions were carried out under the Israeli planning regime, which 
</p>
<p>unlawfully discriminates against Palestinians (A/HRC/25/38, paras. 19-20). The 
</p>
<p>implementation of demolition orders under such a regime violates the State&#8217;s obligations to 
</p>
<p>respect the right to adequate housing, including the security of tenure and freedom from 
</p>
<p>arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family and home (see A/HRC/25/40, para. 
</p>
<p>20). <b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. In addition, thousands of Palestinian Bedouins and herders living in Area C of the 
</p>
<p>Central West Bank continued to be at risk of forcible transfer owing to a plan advanced by 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 See also A/HRC/28/44. 
</p>
<p> 12 Yesh Din, Law Enforcement on Israeli Civilians in the West Bank, Data Sheet, November 2014. See 
</p>
<p>also A/HRC/28/44, chap. V. </p>


<p>Israeli authorities to transfer them to three centralized sites (see A/69/348, paras.12-16). 
</p>
<p>Forcible transfer would be in violation of article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention (see 
</p>
<p>A/69/348, para.53 and CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 9). It is expected that the Israeli Higher 
</p>
<p>Planning Council will make a decision on the objections presented to the plan by the 
</p>
<p>communities affected before mid-2015. According to the United Nations Relief and Works 
</p>
<p>Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), such decisions may be 
</p>
<p>reviewed by the Supreme Court of Israel.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Israeli Civil Administration has been taking actions aimed at facilitating such a 
</p>
<p>transfer by creating a coercive environment, including by issuing demolition, seizure and 
</p>
<p>stop work orders against structures belonging to the Bedouin communities affected, 
</p>
<p>restricting access to grazing lands and markets for their products, and limiting the issuance 
</p>
<p>of building permits (see A/69/348, paras.12-16). According to UNRWA, there were 229 
</p>
<p>demolitions of Bedouin-owned structures, including 129 concerning residential structures 
</p>
<p>during the period under review. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Situation in East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p>25. The situation in East Jerusalem deteriorated significantly during the period under 
</p>
<p>review, which witnessed demonstrations by Palestinians, an increase in incidents involving 
</p>
<p>the use of force by Israeli security forces resulting in Palestinian casualties, and attacks by 
</p>
<p>Palestinians on Israelis (see A/HRC/28/80/Add.1). The significance of East Jerusalem and 
</p>
<p>its holy sites makes it a sensitive trigger point for friction and violence and its status of 
</p>
<p>central importance to any peaceful resolution of the conflict. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 6. Detention 
</b></p>
<p>26. Non-governmental organizations and lawyers with access to Israeli detention 
</p>
<p>facilities reported to OHCHR many allegations of torture and ill-treatment of detainees by 
</p>
<p>Israeli authorities, particularly by the Internal Security Agency. These allegations were 
</p>
<p>consistent with reports received in previous years;
13 
</p>
<p>for example, an Israeli non-
</p>
<p>governmental organization documented allegations of the use by the Agency of 
</p>
<p>incommunicado detention, sleep deprivation, beatings (slapping, kicking and punching), 
</p>
<p>stress positions, strangulation and prolonged shackling.14 It expressed particular concern 
</p>
<p>that, in the aftermath of the abduction and murder of three Israeli youths, detainees were at 
</p>
<p>a heightened risk of torture and ill-treatment.15 
</p>
<p>27. To date, no crime of torture under international law has been incorporated into 
</p>
<p>legislation in Israel; &#8220;defence of necessity&#8221; continues to be legal, and is used as a possible 
</p>
<p>justification of torture (see CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 14). This compounds the long-
</p>
<p>standing concern at the apparent complete lack of accountability for allegations of torture 
</p>
<p>and ill-treatment. For more than a decade, not a single criminal investigation has been 
</p>
<p>opened into hundreds of complaints lodged against the Internal Security Agency.
16
</p>
<p> While 
</p>
<p>the appointment in February 2014 of a new civilian inspector responsible for handling 
</p>
<p>complaints within the Agency marked a minor improvement in the system of 
</p>
<p>accountability, as at October 2014 no criminal investigation had been opened for at least a 
</p>
<p>decade (see CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 14).

</p>

<p><b> 7. Detention of children 
</b></p>
<p>28.  At the end of September 2014, 181 boys and one girl were in Israeli detention for 
</p>
<p>alleged security offences. Their ages ranged from 14 to 17 years, with 125 in pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention and 57 serving a sentence.17 This was approximately the same as the monthly 
</p>
<p>average seen in 2013.18 Approximately 49 per cent of children in detention were unlawfully 
</p>
<p>transferred to Israel, in violation of article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

<p>against Children between May 2013 and September 2014 from 159 children illustrate what 
</p>
<p>children experience in Israeli detention. These showed that many of the issues highlighted 
</p>
<p>by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in February 201319 remained a concern. 
</p>
<p>Many stated that they had been arrested by Israeli security forces during military night raids 
</p>
<p>despite the recommendation made by UNICEF that they be stopped and that the pilot 
</p>
<p>scheme introduced by Israel in October 2013 to issue summonses be adopted instead.<footnote name="2">4 B&#8217;tselem, Statistics on Administrative Detention, 1 January 2011.  
</footnote>0 In 
</p>
<p>most cases, parents were not clearly informed at the time of arrest of where their child was 
</p>
<p>being taken or the reason for the arrest. In all the cases documented, parents were not 
</p>
<p>allowed to accompany their children, and three-quarters of the children stated that they had 
</p>
<p>not been informed of their right to legal counsel. A total of 89 per cent of those interviewed 
</p>
<p>reported being painfully hand-tied, 76 per cent blindfolded and 77 per cent subjected to 
</p>
<p>beating, slapping, kicking and beatings with a stick on various parts of the body, including 
</p>
<p>the head and face. Almost 40 per cent of the children suffered from painful restraints or 
</p>
<p>from being forced to lie on the floor of a vehicle used by the Israeli security forces.21  
</p>
<p>30. According to some affidavits seen, children had been subjected to torture and/or ill-
</p>
<p>treatment during interrogation with the purpose of obtaining a confession, as previously 
</p>
<p>reported by the Secretary-General and non-governmental organizations.22 Children reported 
</p>
<p>having been restrained to a chair, in some cases for extended periods, which caused them 
</p>
<p>pain in their hands, back and legs. Many children experienced physical violence or were 
</p>
<p>threatened with solitary confinement, sexual assault against them or a family member, and 
</p>
<p>reportedly received death threats. Some were coerced to sign a confession in Hebrew, a 
</p>
<p>language most did not understand. According to UNICEF, most children saw their lawyers 
</p>
<p>for the first time when they were brought to court.

</p>
<p> 18 Military Court Watch, a non-governmental organization, informed OHCHR that the figures given 
</p>
<p>might not reflect the real number of children arrested and detained since, for example, children 
</p>
<p>detained for short periods by the Israeli security forces and not transferred to Israeli prisons were not 
</p>
<p>included.

<p> 20 See ibid, Timing of arrests and arrest warrants, recommendation (i), p. 15. See also UNICEF, 
</p>
<p>Children in Israeli Military Detention, Bulletin No. 2, February 2015.  
</p>
<p> 21 Information provided by the monitoring and reporting mechanism, managed by country-based task 
</p>
<p>forces co-led by UNICEF to provide timely and reliable information on grave violations of children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights. The UNICEF-led Working Group on Grave Violations against Children in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory informed OHCHR that the mechanism database stores records on all cases of 
</p>
<p>physical violence and verbal abuse, but not on the time of the event. The statistics related to physical 
</p>
<p>violence and verbal abuse relate to the whole detention process including the arrest, transfer and 
</p>
<p>interrogation.  
</p>
<p> 22 See CRC/C/ISR/CO/2-4, paras. 35-36. DCI-Palestine and Military Court Watch also documented 
</p>
<p>many similar allegations in their submissions to OHCHR. See also A/HRC/24/30, paras.56-57. </p>


<p>31. In the majority of cases, the principal evidence against the child was the child&#8217;s own 
</p>
<p>confession.23 Israeli Military Order 1745, which came into effect on 10 September 2014, 
</p>
<p>provides for the audiovisual recording of police interrogations of children, but only in 
</p>
<p>relation to non-security offences. The majority of Palestinian children in detention are, 
</p>
<p>however, reportedly prosecuted for alleged security offences (under Israeli Military Order 
</p>
<p>1651), in particular stone throwing.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Administrative detention 
</b></p>
<p>32. According to an Israeli non-governmental organization, in May 2014, Israel was 
</p>
<p>holding 196 administrative detainees.24 By the end of August 2014, this number reached 
</p>
<p>493 (see A/HRC/28/80/Add.1); by the end of October, there were still 457 Palestinian 
</p>
<p>administrative detainees.25 
</p>
<p>33. Israel&#8217;s practice of administrative detention has been condemned by the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General (A/69/347, para. 29), the High Commissioner (A/HRC/25/40, para. 40) and the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 10); the concerns raised remain valid 
</p>
<p>today. Detainees are brought before a judge in a military court and not charged with any 
</p>
<p>criminal offence. The Secretary-General and the Human Rights Committee called for an 
</p>
<p>end to the administrative detention regime and stressed that detainees should be allowed to 
</p>
<p>challenge their detention and, in the absence of prompt criminal charges, be released 
</p>
<p>without delay (A/69/347, para. 29 and CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 10). The use of secret 
</p>
<p>evidence in most cases makes it impossible for detainees to challenge the basis of their 
</p>
<p>detention (A/HRC/25/40, para. 40 and CCP/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 10). Detention orders are 
</p>
<p>moreover issued for one to six months, and may be renewed indefinitely. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Hunger strikes and sick detainees 
</b></p>
<p>34. From 24 April to 25 June 2014, a large number of detainees (as many as125) went 
</p>
<p>on a hunger strike to protest against Israel&#8217;s continued use of administrative detention 
</p>
<p>(A/69/347, para. 28).
 
OHCHR received reports that the authorities had made attempts to 
</p>
<p>break the strike, allegedly by punishing the detainees for going on strike, for instance by 
</p>
<p>transferring them to other facilities, putting them in isolation, and through repeated and 
</p>
<p>extensive cell searches and the denial of medical treatment. The detainees were also 
</p>
<p>reportedly denied access to counsel during the hunger strike. This raises concern at the 
</p>
<p>possible violations of detainees&#8217; right to freedom of expression and with regard to the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of torture and ill-treatment. At the time of the hunger strike, a bill amending the 
</p>
<p>Prisons Act was brought before the Knesset that would permit force-feeding and medical 
</p>
<p>treatment of prisoners on hunger strike against their will under certain conditions, in 
</p>
<p>contravention of international standards.26 The timing of the bill suggested that it may have 
</p>
<p>been intended to break the strike. Following the end of the hunger strike on 25 June 2014, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23 UNICEF, Children in Israeli Military Detention (see footnote 19), p. 11. According to the No Legal 
</p>
<p>Frontiers, a non-governmental organization, between 2010 and 2011, the vast majority of files in the 
</p>
<p>juvenile justice system in Israel were based on defendants&#8217; confessions given during police 
</p>
<p>interrogations, and on incrimination by boys of similar ages given in the same circumstances. In no 
</p>
<p>case was there a trial within a trial on the admissibility of the confessions&#8221; (see &#8220;All Guilty! 
</p>
<p>Observations in the Military Juvenile Court 2010-11&#8221;). See also Defence for Children International 
</p>
<p>Palestine, &#8220;Bound, Blindfolded and Convicted: Children held in military detention&#8221;, April 2012, p. 
</p>

<p>consideration of the bill was postponed in the face of domestic and international opposition, 
</p>
<p>although it had not been withdrawn at the end of the period under review.  
</p>
<p><b> 10. Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>35. According to Palestinian human rights organizations, as at December 2014 some 
</p>
<p>400 Palestinians from Gaza were detained in Israel for security and political reasons. Under 
</p>
<p>international law, and in particular article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, protected 
</p>
<p>persons accused of offences must be detained and, if convicted, serve their sentences within 
</p>
<p>the occupied territory.  
</p>
<p>36. During the military operation in Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces arrested 66 men 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/80/Add.1), 31 of whom were transferred to Israel; the remaining 35 were 
</p>
<p>subsequently released. According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and the Al 
</p>
<p>Mezan Center for Human Rights as at October 2014, 22 Palestinian detainees arrested 
</p>
<p>during the escalation remained in detention in Israel. At the end of the period under review, 
</p>
<p>the Al Mezan Center informed OHCHR that one of the 22 detainees had been reportedly 
</p>
<p>held since 24 August 2014without trial under the Unlawful Combatant Act 5762-2002.  
</p>
<p>37. The right to family visits of Palestinian detainees from Gaza remained severely 
</p>
<p>restricted during the period under review. At 11 June 2014, no more than four relatives 
</p>
<p>could visit detainees once a month. Following the disappearance of three Israeli youths on 
</p>
<p>the West Bank on 12 June 2014, and throughout the escalation of hostilities in Gaza, 
</p>
<p>however, family visits were suspended for four months. They resumed in October 2014, 
</p>
<p>when the Government of Israel announced that it was easing measures, including a decision 
</p>
<p>to permit 50 detainees to receive family visits once a week. Detainees could receive up to 
</p>
<p>six relatives, including their parents, spouse and three children.27 However, human rights 
</p>
<p>organizations reported that, in practice, each detainee was only permitted to have three 
</p>
<p>visitors per visit.28  
</p>
<p><b> B. Palestinian Authority 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Torture, ill-treatment and arbitrary detention 
</b></p>
<p>38. During the period under review, OHCHR continued to monitor detention facilities 
</p>
<p>managed by the Palestinian Authority, focusing on detention centres managed by General 
</p>
<p>Intelligence and the Palestinian Preventive Security Service. Palestinian authorities 
</p>
<p>continued to cooperate with OHCHR, in particular by allowing it to have unannounced and 
</p>
<p>unrestricted access to the detention facilities of the Palestinian Preventive Security Service 
</p>
<p>(see A/HRC/25/40, para. 44). In 2014, OHCHR was also granted unannounced and 
</p>
<p>unrestricted access to the detention centres run by General Intelligence.  
</p>
<p>39. Torture and ill-treatment are prohibited under international and Palestinian law alike. 
</p>
<p>On 14 May 2013, President Abbas issued an order requiring authorities competent to make 
</p>
<p>arrests and order detention and interrogations to abide by the Palestinian Basic Law and 
</p>
<p>relevant laws that prohibit all forms of torture and degrading treatment, as well as relevant 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties.29 Notwithstanding these legal provisions, OHCHR

</p>
<p>relatives and only children younger than 10 years of age were allowed to visit detainees. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Law of Penal Procedure No. 3, art. 29. </p>


<p>documented cases of torture and ill&#8211;treatment, as well as arbitrary detention, in particular of 
</p>
<p>persons affiliated with political opposition groups. 
</p>
<p>40. Detainees informed OHCHR that they had often been blindfolded, handcuffed, 
</p>
<p>slapped in the face, beaten on different parts of their bodies, forced into <i>shabeh</i> (a stress 
</p>
<p>position for an extended period of time) and received threats against themselves and their 
</p>
<p>families with the aim of obtaining a confession. In a case monitored by OHCHR in 
</p>
<p>September 2014, a detainee reported being forced to stand with his hands up against the 
</p>
<p>wall for some 13 hours during the first day of his interrogation. On the second day, he was 
</p>
<p>slapped in the face, and kicked in the legs and abdomen for about three hours. The detainee 
</p>
<p>claimed that he confessed in order to avoid further beating.  
</p>
<p>41. Detention conditions, including overcrowding, inadequate sanitary conditions, and 
</p>
<p>lack of access to natural light and recreational exercise remain causes for concern. 
</p>
<p>Detainees were in many cases held for days in very small cells (approximately 2 by 1.7 
</p>
<p>metres), with almost no ventilation or natural light. In one case monitored by OHCHR in 
</p>
<p>January 2014, a detainee was held in such a cell for 25 days. He was reportedly transferred 
</p>
<p>to a larger cell with other detainees after he commenced a hunger strike to protest against 
</p>
<p>his conditions of detention. In some cases, detainees were held in such cells for long 
</p>
<p>periods of time, in high temperatures during the summer and cold temperatures in winter. In 
</p>
<p>another case monitored by OHCHR in January 2014, 12 people were held in a small cell 
</p>
<p>(approximately 5 m2). 
</p>
<p>42. OHCHR documented multiple violations of the right to a fair trial and due process 
</p>
<p>of law. In most cases, individuals were not informed of the reason for their arrest, in 
</p>
<p>violation of article 9.2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
</p>
<p>Principle l0 of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of 
</p>
<p>Detention or Imprisonment (see also CCPR/C/GC/35, paras. 25 and 27). Most detainees 
</p>
<p>reported being brought before the court 72 hours after their arrest.30 International law 
</p>
<p>provides that anyone arrested or detained must be brought promptly before a judge. In its 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 35, the Human Rights Committee stated that any delay longer than 48 
</p>
<p>hours must remain absolutely exceptional; prolonged detention without judicial control 
</p>
<p>(given that a public prosecutor cannot be considered an officer exercising judicial power 
</p>
<p>under article 9.3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) increases the 
</p>
<p>risk of ill-treatment (CCPR/C/GC/35, paras. 32-33).  
</p>
<p>43. Courts usually extended the detention for investigation purposes for weeks, and, in 
</p>
<p>some cases, months.31 Several detainees reported, however, that they had not been 
</p>
<p>interrogated after their detention had been extended. Although the courts generally review 
</p>
<p>detention orders, they do not appear to be subjecting detention and the action of security 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 30 Palestinian Law of Penal Procedure No. 3 establishes that a detainee may be held for questioning for 
</p>
<p>24 hours, after which the detainee must be brought before the Prosecutor, who will decide whether to 
</p>
<p>release or to keep the detainee, for a maximum of 48 hours, for further interrogation. Thereafter, any 
</p>
<p>extension of detention requires court authorization (arts. 107, 108 and 115). 
</p>
<p> 31 According to Palestinian Law of Penal Procedure No. 3, art. 120, magistrates courts may extend 
</p>
<p>detention for 15 days during the first hearing. Thereafter, they may extend it for a period not 
</p>
<p>exceeding 45 days in total. Upon request of the Attorney General or his/her assistants, detention may 
</p>
<p>be further extended by a court of first instance for a period not exceeding three months.  </p>


<p>forces to sufficient scrutiny, which raises concerns that such cases of detention may be 
</p>
<p>arbitrary.32  
</p>
<p>44. OHCHR is concerned that, in most of the cases monitored, detainees were unable to 
</p>
<p>meet their lawyers in private during the interrogation period, in contravention of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>and international law.33 Many detainees reported meeting their lawyers for the first time at 
</p>
<p>the first hearing in court (usually held 72 hours after the arrest). 
</p>
<p>45. Incommunicado detention remains a cause for concern (A/HRC/25/40, para. 45). In 
</p>
<p>a case monitored by OHCHR in January 2014, a detainee reported that he had been denied 
</p>
<p>contact with his family and his lawyer for 22 days. In another case monitored in October 
</p>
<p>2014, a detainee reported that he was not permitted to contact his lawyer and family for 13 
</p>
<p>days. In its general comments No. 20 (CCPR/C/GC/20, para. 11) and No. 35 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/GC/35, para. 35), the Human Rights Committee noted that incommunicado 
</p>
<p>detention increased the risk of torture and ill-treatment, and could also violate several other 
</p>
<p>rights, including the rights to life, to personal integrity and to due process of law.  
</p>
<p>46. OHCHR received information from numerous detainees claiming that they had been 
</p>
<p>detained by order of the provincial Governor. Such detention is provided for under 
</p>
<p>domestic law,34 with the stated objective of protecting detainees, maintaining public order 
</p>
<p>and preventing crimes related to national security.35 This type of detention is reportedly not 
</p>
<p>reviewed by a judge or any other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power, in 
</p>
<p>contravention of international law.36  
</p>
<p>47. In one case monitored by OHCHR, a Palestinian man was detained by governor 
</p>
<p>order four times over a seven-month period. On 27 March 2014, a court issued a release 
</p>
<p>order that was not implemented because the Governor decided to keep the detainee in 
</p>
<p>detention for an additional three weeks on the grounds of public order. He was detained 
</p>
<p>again from 7 to 14 August, and from 1 to 7 and from 12 to 16 November. According to the 
</p>
<p>information received, the order was aimed at protecting the man from alleged death threats 
</p>
<p>in relation a case of a so-called &#8220;honour&#8221; killing. In that case, the Palestinian authorities 
</p>
<p>should have taken the measures necessary to protect the man&#8217;s life, including by 
</p>
<p>investigating the death threats, rather than deprive him of liberty as a &#8220;protective&#8221; measure.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 32 According to the Human Rights Committee, the decision to keep a person in detention is arbitrary if it 
</p>
<p>is not subjected to a periodic review of the justification to continue detention. See for example 
</p>
<p>CCPR/C88/D/1324/2004, para. 7.2. 
</p>
<p> 33 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 14; Human Rights Committee general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 32 (CCPR/C/GC/32), para. 34, Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons 
</p>
<p>under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, Principle 18. The Basic Principles on the Role of 
</p>
<p>Lawyers establish that States should ensure prompt access to a lawyer in any case no later than 48 
</p>
<p>hours after the arrest or detention. According to Palestinian Law on Penal Procedure No. 3, art. 103, 
</p>
<p>communication restrictions imposed during the interrogation period do not apply to lawyers, who may 
</p>
<p>contact their clients without any restriction.

<p><b> 2. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>48. Palestinian women face multiple forms of violence and discrimination 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/40, paras. 72-74). So-called &#8220;honour&#8221; killings continue to be a matter of 
</p>
<p>concern. Although no reliable figures were available for the period under review, the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights, in its ninth annual report, found 
</p>
<p>that, in 2013, there had been three cases of such killings and 16 cases of women killed in 
</p>
<p>&#8220;mysterious circumstances&#8221; in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.37. The accuracy of 
</p>
<p>figures might also be affected by underreporting.38 
</p>
<p>49. A study commissioned by OHCHR on the response by the Palestinian judiciary to 
</p>
<p>so-called &#8220;honour killings&#8221; concluded that the broad use of mitigating circumstances led to 
</p>
<p>impunity for such crimes.39 The study analysed a sample of 37 rulings by the courts of first 
</p>
<p>instance in the West Bank (32) and Gaza (five) issued between 1993 and 2013 on cases 
</p>
<p>involving the killing of women &#8220;under the pretext of honour&#8221;. In 29 cases, the judges 
</p>
<p>reduced the perpetrator&#8217;s penalty on the basis of extenuating circumstances established in 
</p>
<p>articles 98 and 99 of the Penal Code 16 of 1960.40 Reasons for extenuating culpability 
</p>
<p>include the waiving of personal rights (37.8 per cent),41 the &#8220;fit of rage&#8221; justification (16.2 
</p>
<p>per cent) and the defence of &#8220;honour&#8221; (8.1 per cent). 
</p>
<p>50. In May 2014, the President issued a Decree Law amending article 98 of the Penal 
</p>
<p>Code so that perpetrators of crimes of so-called &#8220;honour&#8221; crimes against women could not 
</p>
<p>benefit from article 98, which allows for mitigation in sentencing. The High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>commends this measure. However, concerns remain regarding article 99, which gives broad 
</p>
<p>discretionary power to judges in the application of mitigating factors. Of the 37 cases 
</p>
<p>analysed in the OHCHR study, judges used article 99 in 23 cases as a basis for allowing 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of crimes of so-called &#8220;honour&#8221; to benefit from mitigating factors in 
</p>
<p>sentencing.42 
</p>
<p><b> C. Authorities in Gaza  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>51. Arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment by the security forces remain issues of 
</p>
<p>concern in Gaza. During the period under review, the Internal Security Agency and the 
</p>
<p>police allegedly subjected detainees to torture and ill-treatment, and arbitrarily summoned 
</p>
<p>and detained several civilians on various charges.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 37 Among the cases of women killed in &#8220;mysterious circumstances&#8221;, one was shot and killed by her son, 
</p>
<p>one was stabbed to death by her husband and three others &#8220;fell&#8221; from high floors or their own 
</p>
<p>balconies.  
</p>
<p> 38 The Women&#8217;s Centre for Legal Aid and Counselling, a non-governmental organization, recorded 27 
</p>
<p>cases of so-called &#8220;honour&#8221; killings in 2013, significantly higher than those recorded by the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights.

<p>Palestine&#8221; (see footnote 39), pp. 10-11. 
</p>

<p><b> 2. Wide-scale arrest campaigns against social activists and Fatah members and 
</b></p>
<p><b>supporters 
</b></p>
<p>52. Many Fatah members and supporters across the Gaza Strip were reportedly 
</p>
<p>summoned or arrested by the Internal Security Agency and questioned about Fatah&#8217;s plans 
</p>
<p>to mark the anniversary of the death of Yasser Arafat on 11 November 2013. 
</p>
<p>53. Alleged members of Salafist groups were also subjected to arbitrary arrest and 
</p>
<p>detention by the Internal Security Agency. From 4 to 6 March 2014, the Agency arrested 
</p>
<p>without warrant two people suspected of organizing an attack targeting a church in the 
</p>
<p>south of Gaza. One of them was accused of being affiliated with the Islamic State group.  
</p>
<p>54. OHCHR also documented several cases related to the arrest, reportedly without a 
</p>
<p>warrant, of persons suspected of treason. The absence of a legal warrant is one illustration 
</p>
<p>of a wider pattern of abuse by the Internal Security Agency and of violations of the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Torture, ill-treatment and violations of due process  
</b></p>
<p>55. Many detainees held in detention by the Internal Security Agency were allegedly 
</p>
<p>subjected to torture and ill-treatment upon arrest and during interrogation. Torture methods 
</p>
<p>included beating with sticks, sensory deprivation (blindfolding), <i>shabeh</i>, solitary 
</p>
<p>confinement and intimidation. Gazan security agencies appeared to use harsher 
</p>
<p>interrogation techniques with detainees suspected of treason. 
</p>
<p>56. In a case monitored by OHCHR, in February 2014, a 27-year-old man accused of 
</p>
<p>treason was arrested by the Internal Security Agency. He was detained and transferred to 
</p>
<p>the civilian prison in Al-Katiba, west of Gaza city, where he was held for another six days. 
</p>
<p>He claimed that, during interrogations, he was beaten with a rubber stick and forced into 
</p>
<p><i>shabeh</i>. He was reportedly detained in solitary confinement with the aim of obtaining 
</p>
<p>information on his alleged collaboration with Israel. Following his transfer back to the 
</p>
<p>Agency detention facility, he was held again in solitary confinement. He was allegedly 
</p>
<p>denied access to a lawyer and family visits.  
</p>
<p>57. In a similar case, in March 2014, a 38-year-old man suspected of treason was 
</p>
<p>arrested by the Internal Security Agency. He was reportedly held in solitary confinement 
</p>
<p>and threatened with hanging. Although he was permitted to see the prosecutor, who 
</p>
<p>extended his detention for 15 days, he was denied the right to contact his wife and a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, he was reportedly denied access to medical treatment while suffering from a 
</p>
<p>serious liver illness. 
</p>
<p>58. Alleged members of the Tamarod movement (see A/HRC/25/40, para. 65) arrested 
</p>
<p>in November 2013 were also allegedly subjected to beatings on the hands and feet with a 
</p>
<p>stick, punching, shackling for extensive time periods and <i>shabeh</i>. A 16-year-old youth 
</p>
<p>suspected of being affiliated with Tamarod was arrested by the investigation police and was 
</p>
<p>held in detention for two days before being released. He was allegedly subjected to beatings 
</p>
<p>on the soles of the feet, <i>shabeh</i> and sleep deprivation. The victim reported to OHCHR that 
</p>
<p>nine other people were in detention on the same charges during his detention. He had been 
</p>
<p>detained on previous occasions for similar accusations. Some Fatah members also alleged 
</p>
<p>that they had been subjected to ill-treatment during detention. In March 2014, a 21-year-old 
</p>
<p>Fatah member was held in detention for several hours by the investigation police owing to 
</p>
<p>his participation in a demonstration supporting the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He 
</p>
<p>was reportedly held in solitary confinement and slapped in the face numerous times, forced 
</p>
<p>to stand on a wet and dirty floor, and verbally abused. He was subsequently released with 
</p>
<p>no charges.  </p>


<p><b> 4. Deaths in custody 
</b></p>
<p>59. In March 2014, a 45-year-old man from Deir El Balah suffering from several health 
</p>
<p>conditions died in police custody. He had been arrested by the Police Criminal 
</p>
<p>Investigation Department without an arrest warrant on 1 March 2014 in connection with a 
</p>
<p>family dispute. The police were reportedly aware of the victim&#8217;s heart, kidney and lung 
</p>
<p>conditions, and his family had repeatedly requested the police to transfer him for medical 
</p>
<p>treatment. On 7 March, the man was transferred to Nasser Hospital, in Khan Younis, for 
</p>
<p>medical treatment. Subsequently, after a few hours of treatment on the same day, he was 
</p>
<p>transferred back to Khan Younis police station, where he died on 12 March 2014. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>received information indicating that the police headquarters had established an 
</p>
<p>investigation committee and that the findings would be made public. At the end of the 
</p>
<p>period under review, OHCHR was not aware of any outcome of the investigation 
</p>
<p>committee. 
</p>
<p>60. Two other cases of death in custody were reported to OHCHR during the period 
</p>
<p>under review. The first case, on 14 May 2014, related to a 33-year-old man detained in Beit 
</p>
<p>Lahia prison for drug dealing who died in custody after spending 27 days in detention.43 
</p>
<p>The second case, also in Beit Lahia prison, arose on 16 May 2014, where a 28-year-old man 
</p>
<p>was being detained on criminal charges. In both cases, the Gaza Ministry of the Interior 
</p>
<p>stated that the cause of death was a heart attack.44 It launched an investigation into the first 
case, but the findings have yet to be been published. The circumstances of the cases and the 
</p>
<p>lack of public information on the investigations raise concerns regarding the treatment to 
</p>
<p>which the detainees may have been subjected while in custody, including if they were 
</p>
<p>provided with an adequate medical health care.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>61. In November 2013, the Internal Security Agency launched a wide-scale campaign 
</p>
<p>targeting alleged members of the Tamarod movement across the Gaza Strip, including by 
</p>
<p>raiding their houses, confiscating property (such as laptop computers and mobile 
</p>
<p>telephones) and arresting and detaining them (see paras. 55-58 above).  
</p>
<p>62. From 6 to 18 November 2013, the Internal Security Agency and the Police Criminal 
</p>
<p>Investigation Department summoned and arrested several people from different parts of 
</p>
<p>Gaza based on their alleged political affiliation with Fatah and Tamarod. Many Palestinians 
</p>
<p>in Gaza reported to OHCHR that they were forced to sign a document stating that they 
</p>
<p>would not participate in any movement and not incite hatred against the authorities in Gaza, 
</p>
<p>nor engage in any hostile activities or demonstration against them.  
</p>
<p>63. During the period under review, OHCHR continued to document cases of arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrest and detention of journalists and human rights defenders for participating in public 
</p>
<p>events (see also A/HRC/25/40, paras. 63-67). On 12 November 2013, the head of the 
</p>
<p>General Union of Palestinian Women and several other women were briefly detained by the 
</p>
<p>Internal Security Agency following a protest against the political split between Hamas and 
</p>
<p>Fatah. On 24 March 2014, a journalist was detained by the Police Criminal Investigation 
</p>
<p>Department after posting a video clip on Facebook criticizing the political situation in 
</p>
<p>Gaza.

<p><b> 6. Violations in the context of the escalation of hostilities 
</b></p>
<p>64. In a case monitored by OHCHR, in August 2014, a 28-year-old man suspected of 
</p>
<p>treason was arrested by the Internal Security Agency and held in an unknown detention 
</p>
<p>facility in Gaza for approximately 10 days. He was reportedly subjected to beatings and 
</p>
<p>solitary confinement, and was denied access to a lawyer and family visits. He was 
</p>
<p>subsequently transferred to an Agency prison in Ansar. Reportedly, his sister was detained 
</p>
<p>in another detention facility on suspicion of treason and brought to an Agency detention 
</p>
<p>facility for interrogation on several occasions, where she was allegedly tortured.  
</p>
<p>65. A total of 21 alleged collaborators were reportedly summarily executed by 
</p>
<p>Palestinian armed groups in August 2014. Some of them were allegedly tortured prior to 
</p>
<p>execution (see also A/HRC/28/80/Add.1, paras. 73-74). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Accession of the State of Palestine to international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights treaties 
</b></p>
<p>66. In April 2014, the State of Palestine deposited instruments of accession to 20 
</p>
<p>international treaties, including seven human rights treaties and the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the 
</p>
<p>Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions 
</p>
<p>and the Convention respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land.
 
Each accession was 
</p>
<p>effected without reservations, a notable decision in a region with a large number of 
</p>
<p>reservations to human rights treaties. Accession by the State of Palestine to the core 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties represents a significant strengthening of the legal 
</p>
<p>framework for the protection and promotion of human rights in Palestine. The challenge 
</p>
<p>will be to put these legal commitments into effect in law and in practice.  
</p>
<p>67. Since 2011, OHCHR has been working with the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Planning and Administrative Development of the Palestinian Authority to develop a 
</p>
<p>rights-based framework for the national development agenda. A broad-based collaborative 
</p>
<p>process produced a comprehensive 160-page guidance document setting out concrete 
</p>
<p>recommendations on how to incorporate human rights more effectively into development 
</p>
<p>programming. The document was finalized by the Government of the State of Palestine in 
</p>
<p>January 2014. 
</p>
<p>68. Most of the recommendations in the guidance document were integrated into the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian National Development Plan for 2014&#8211;2016, which was finalized in February 
</p>
<p>2014, providing a strong human rights-based framework in the four sectors covered by the 
</p>
<p>Plan: social development, economic development, infrastructure and governance. The 
</p>
<p>document was framed to provide guidance for integrating human rights into the Plan as 
</p>
<p>well as in future Palestinian development plans. The document has been available to those 
</p>
<p>involved in the damage and needs assessment exercise being conducted by the Government 
</p>
<p>of the State of Palestine for the long-term reconstruction of Gaza after the escalation of July 
</p>
<p>and August 2014. 
</p>
<p>69. Accession to international human rights treaties has provided an opportunity for 
</p>
<p>OHCHR to build on its work with the Palestinian authorities, as well as with the Palestine 
</p>
<p>Independent Commission for Human Rights and civil society, to ensure that the political 
</p>
<p>commitments contained in the Palestinian National Development Plan are implemented in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the legal commitments contained in the treaties. The Government has 
</p>
<p>adopted a coordinated approach to its treaty reporting, which aims to draw on the linkages 
</p>
<p>between treaty provisions and the Plan. With this approach, it is hoped that the initial treaty 
</p>
<p>reports will provide a comprehensive baseline assessment for implementation of human </p>


<p>rights in the context of national development programming. Such an assessment can 
</p>
<p>provide a firm starting point to address some of the human rights concerns raised in the 
</p>
<p>present and previous reports of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government of Israel 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of Israel take all 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible measures:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To ensure full respect of its obligations under international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law, particularly obligations governing the conduct of hostilities, such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution, and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as well as full accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>for violations of the said obligations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Lift the blockade of Gaza in order to halt the ongoing punitive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>against civilians; measures should be taken to ensure the freedom of movement of 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilians and the transfer of goods into and out of, and within, Gaza, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>materials necessary for its reconstruction, in accordance with international law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>with due regard to security concerns; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that the use of force by the Israeli security forces in situations 
</b></p>
<p><b>other than hostilities, including in the areas of restricted access, is in compliance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and allow for an independent assessment and review of open fire regulations and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>rules of engagement to ensure their compatibility with international law;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Carry out prompt, effective, independent, impartial, thorough and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent investigations of alleged unlawful killings and injuries of Palestinians, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>of allegations of torture and ill-treatment, allowing for meaningful participation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims and their relatives and for public scrutiny; and ensure that perpetrators are 
</b></p>
<p><b>be brought to justice and that victims have access to an effective remedy; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Halt any plans that would result in the forcible transfer of Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bedouin communities and herders currently residing in Area C of the West Bank;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure that all acts of violence committed by Israeli settlers against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinians and their property are investigated independently, impartially, 
</b></p>
<p><b>thoroughly, promptly, effectively and in a non-discriminatory manner, and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators are brought to justice and victims have access to an effective remedy;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Implement UNICEF recommendations that remain unimplemented, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>those made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child with regard to Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>children in Israeli detention; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Either charge and bring to trial or release any person in administrative 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention, and put an end to the administrative detention regime in its current form in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Israel. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Government of the State of Palestine 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of the State of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestine:  </b></p>


<p><b>(a) Take measures to respect and protect the rights of persons deprived of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their liberty, particularly the rights to physical integrity, to a fair trial and to due 
</b></p>
<p><b>process of law;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Conduct prompt, effective, independent, impartial, thorough and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent investigations of allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators are brought to justice and victims have access to an effective remedy; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Either charge and bring to trial or release all detainees under the 
</b></p>
<p><b>governor orders, and end the practice of detentions based on governor orders;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) </b>Ensure periodic and effective judicial review of a person&#8217;s detention in 
</p>
<p><b>all cases, without exception;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Take all necessary measures to ensure that perpetrators of all acts 
</b></p>
<p><b>involving violence against women, including so-called </b>&#8220;honour killings&#8221;, are 
</p>
<p><b>prosecuted and appropriately sentenced; for instance, amend article 99 of the Penal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Code to prevent mitigating circumstances leading to impunity for such crimes. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Authorities in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The High Commissioner calls upon the authorities in Gaza: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)  To respect international humanitarian law, particularly the principles of 
</b></p>
<p><b>distinction, proportionality and precaution, and to ensure accountability for 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To take all the necessary measures to ensure that the rights of persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>deprived of liberty are respected, including by ensuring effective, independent, 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>treatment, and to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice and that victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>have access to an effective remedy; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To conduct prompt, effective, independent, impartial, thorough and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent investigations on allegations of summary executions and cases of death of 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons in the custody of the authorities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To refrain from unlawful restrictions on the freedoms of expression and 
</b></p>
<p><b>of peaceful assembly. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Palestinian armed groups in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The High Commissioner calls upon Palestinian armed groups in Gaza to 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect international humanitarian law, particularly the principles of distinction, 
</b></p>
<p><b>proportionality and precaution, and to ensure accountability for violations. 
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
