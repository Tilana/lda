Boadicea Resources Ltd

Chairman's letter

30 June 2016

Dear Shareholder

It is with much pleasure that I present the Annual Report of Boadicea Resources Ltd (the Company) for the year ended
30 June 2016 and welcome each and every one of you as shareholders of the Company.

The Fraser Range continues to be one of the most exciting destinations for nickel exploration In Western Australia as
evidenced by the $1.8 billion takeover of Sirius Resources, the previous owner of the Nova»Bollinger Nickel-Copper
Deposit.

Boadicea Resources is the only listed exploration company with an exploration licence joining and on the north-east trend
of the Nova-Bollinger Nickel-Copper Mining Lease, now owned by Independence Group NL.

Boadicea's Symons Hill licence is both strategic and highly prospective.

The main focus of the Company‘s exploration has again been on its Symons Hlll licence. Activities during the year have
included a detailed infill gravity survey, a deep diamond drill hole over its most advanced target (Red Cap) and
preparations for an extensive Aboriginal Heritage Survey which, upon completion, will allow drill testing ofa number of
new highly attractive targets.

Interpretation of the gravity survey has generated 13 targets including 6 high priority targets, whilst the drilling at Red
Cap. although a technical success in that it intersected a sulphide source for the EM anomaly, did not produce any
anomalous nickel results.

Boadicea now has a very comprehensive database of geological and geophysical information which will now form the
basis of ourforthcoming target drilling during the second half of 2016.

Field work was also undertaken on the Com pany‘s Lake Nerramyne and Paraburdoo Projects.

At the Lake Nerrarnyne Project, an initial but limited soll sampling program returned favourable geochemistry supporting
the geophysically interpreted mafic complex which is prospective for nickel, copper and platinum group elements, As a
result of this encouragement an additional Exploration Licence has been applied for north and east of the Company‘s
existing licence.

At the Paraburdoo Project, an inltial broad spaced soil geochemical sampling program designed to follow-up stream
sediment anomalies generated In 2015 has defined a 2.5km x 2,5km area of encouraging platinum — palladium
anomalism. The coherent and coincident modest tenor anomaly peaks at tZGppb palladium and 37ppb platinum, which is
considered encouraging especially given the very broad sample spacing.

Four new applications have been made for licences in Western Australia which are considered prospective for gold,
nickel and lithium.

Boadicea points of difference:

- Signiﬁcant cash on hand

- Small tightly held share capital

0 Low overheads

- Primary project (Symons Hill located next to world class nickel project); and

o Attractive secondary projects.

I would especially like to express my grateful thanks for the support from my fellow Directors, Consultants, Sharebrokers
and most importantly, our Shareholder Investors.

Boadicea Resources Ltd
Directors‘ report
30 June 2016
Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration
The objective of the Company's executive reward framework is to ensure reward for performance is competitive and
appropriate for the results delivered. The framework aligns executive reward with the achievement of strategic objectlves
and the creation of value for shareholders, and conforms with the market best practice for delivery of reward. The Board of
Directors ('the Board') ensures that executive reward satisfies the following key criteria for good reward governance practices:
0 competitiveness and reasonableness
- aoceptabililyto shareholders
o alignment of executive compensation
a transparency
The Board is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for its Directors and executives. The
performance of the Company depends on the quality of its Directors and executives. The remuneration philosophy is to
attract, motivate and retain high performance and high quality personnel.
The Board has structured an executive remuneration framework that is market competitive and complementary to the reward
strategy of the Company
The reward framework is designed to align executive reward to shareholders' interests. The Board have considered that it
should seek to enhance shareholders' interests by:
0 focuses on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering

constant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-ﬁnancial drivers of value
a attracts and retains high calibre executives
Addltionally, the reward framework should seek to enhance executives' interests by:
0 rewarding capability and experience
- reﬂecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth
- providing a clear structure for earning rewards
In accordance with best practice corporate governance, the structure of non-executive Directors and executive remunerations
are separate.
Non»executive Directors remuneration
Noneexecutlve Directors’ fees are paid within an aggregate limit which is approved by the shareholders from time to time.
Retirement payments. if any, are agreed to be determined in accordance with the rules set out in the Corporations Act at the
time of the Directors retirement or termination.
The total maximum remuneration of non-executive Directors is initially set by the Constitution and subsequent variation is by
ordinary resolution of Shareholders in general meeting in accordance with the Constitution, the Corporations Act and the
ASX Listing Rules, as applicable. The determination of non—executive Directors remuneration within that maximum will be
made by the Board having regard to the inputs and value to the Company of the respective contributions by each non
executive Director. The current amount has been set at an amount not to exceed $100,000 per annum.
Executive remuneration
in determining the level and make—up of executive remuneration, the Board negotiates a remuneration to reﬂect the market
salary for a position and individual of comparable responsibility and experience. Due to the limited size of the Company and
of its operations and ﬁnancial aﬁairs, the use of a separate remuneration committee is not considered appropriate
Remuneration has been compared with the external market by participation in industry salary surveys and during recruitment
activities generally.
The remuneration framework is solely comprised offixed remuneration.
Use of remuneration consultants
The Company has not made any use of remuneration consultants.
Voting and comments made at the Company’s 27 November 2015 Annual General Meeting ('AGMQ
The Company received 100.00% of 'for' votes in relation to its remuneration report for the year ended 30 June 2015. The
Company did not receive any specific feedback at the AGM regarding its remuneration practices.

Review of operations
30 June 2016
Symons Hill Project (Nickel, Copper & Gold)
(E28I1932 - 100% Boadicea)
The Symons Hill Project is located Within the Fraser Range Province of Western Australia, east of Norseman and
approximately 200 kilometres southeast of Kalgoorlie and. subsequent to a statutory reduction in area in April 2016, now
covers an area of 73 square kilometres
The licence adjoins, to the north east, the Mining Lease hosting the world class Nova-Bollinger nickel-copper discovery,
Nova-Bollinger is now owned by the independence Group NL after it completed the $1.8 billion takeover of Sirius Resources
during late 2015.
During the year, Boadicea completed a detailed infill gravity survey across the western portion of its licence. A detailed
interpretation of the survey resulted in a total of 13 targets being identified including 6 high priority targets. The high priority
targets were selected on the basis of their position along trend from Nova and/or a combination of both favourable magnetic
and gravity signatures.

An additional diamond drill hole was completed to a depth of 5433m to test the Red Cap EM conductor target located 6km
to the north east of the Nova-Bollinger nickel mine. BSHD002 was the second diamond drill hole completed at the Red
Cap prospect and the ﬁrst to intersect and test the modelled EM conductor plate. Hole BSHD002 intersected disseminated
pyrrhotite (3% of rock mass) and trace chalcopyrite from 499.05 to 50(5er downhole. Pyrrhotite stringer sulphides were
intersected from 5005 to 501 .2m and 506.1 to 506.22m downhole, comprising approximately 20% of the rock mass of the
respective intervals, Both of the intercepts of disseminated and stringer sulphides occur within a sequence of foliated
quartz, biotite, garnet metasediments. Samples of the sulphide material were submitted for laboratory analysis and no
anomalous results were reported A subsequent down-hole EM survey conﬁrmed that the original modelled EM conductor
plate was intersected by the drill hole and no further off—hole conductors were present.

Boadicea Resources Ltd
Review of operations
30 June 2016
The Company has made application for an extensive Aboriginal Heritage Survey that will enable Boadicea to commence a
detailed aircore drilling program over its priority targets, which have been generated from its extensive high quality gravity,
magnetic and electromagnetic surveys. it is anticipated that the Heritage Survey will be completed in the September quarter
with drilling to commence soon after.
During the June quarter and in accordance with statutory licence conditions, Boadicea reduced the existing licence by 40%.
The area reduced was in the far east of the licence, which was considered the least prospective for nickel. The highly
prospective western part of the licence has been retained.
Lake Nerramyne Project (Nickel, Copper, Gold 8- PGE)
(ETD/4525 — 100% Boadicea)
The Lake Nerramyne Project is located approximately 160 kilometres northeast of Geraldton in Western Australia and
covers an area of 164 square kilometres.
A soil sampling program was partially completed to follow up historic anomalous results and assess the potential for
magmatic nickel sulphide and PGE mineralization within the interpreted mafic complex. A total of 359 auger soil samples
were collected before the program was suspended due to weather conditions.
The initial soil sampling program has returned favourable geochemistry supporting the interpreted potential for a layered
mafic intrusive complex prospective for PGE and nickel-copper systems.
The proposed follow-up work program will include geological mapping and rock chip sampling along with infill soil
geochemical sampling as warranted to increase the geological understanding and refine the soil anomalism.
Based on the initial results and the perceived success of the geochemistry defining a mafic intrusive complex, Boadicea
has applied for an additional Exploration Licence to the immediate north and east, which covers additional magnetic
features that potentially represent other mafic/ultramafic complexes.

Paraburdoo Project (Gold & PGE)
(EAT/2936 —1on% Boadicea)
The Paraburdoo Project is located approximately 25 km west of the township of Paraburdoo in Western Australia and
covers an area of 221 square kilometres.
A soil geochemistry program was designed and executed to follow-up gold, platinum and palladium stream sediment
anomalies generated by the Company in 2015. A total of 687 soil geochemical samples were collected on a very broad
200m sample spacing on lines 400m apart across the anomalous stream sediment areas.
The assay results have highlighted the presence of a coincident platinum & palladium geochemical anomaly within the
centre of lhe sampled area (Figure 3), The anomaly has been named the Hope Creek Prospect and comprises coherent
and coincident modest tenor anomalism peaking at 126ppb palladium and 37ppb platinum, which is considered encouraging
especially given the very broad sample spacing.
The proposed follow-up work program will include geological mapping and rock chip sampling along with infill soil
geochemical sampling as warranted to increase the geological understanding and reﬁne the soil anomalism.

Boadioea Resources Ltd
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
30 June 2016
Note 1. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements are set out below. These policies
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
New, revised or amending Accounting Standards and interpretations adopted
The Company has adopted all of the new, revised or amending Accounting Standards and lnterpretalions issued by the
Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') that are mandatory for the current reporting period. The adoption of these
standards had no impact on these ﬁnancial statements.
Any new, revised or amending Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early
adopted,
Basis of preparation
These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and
Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate
for for—profit oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with international Financial Reporting Standards as
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (’lASB').
Historical cost convention
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company/s accounting policies. The areas involving a
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the ﬁnancial
statemenls, are disclosed in note 2,
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable Ihat the economic benefit will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably
measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Interest
Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method.
Other revenue
Other revenue is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established.
income tax
The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based on the applicable
income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary
differences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that
future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax
assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available for the
carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable
that there are future taxable proﬁts available to recover the asset.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on
either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle simultaneously.
Current and non-current classification
Assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification.

21


Boadicea Resources Ltd
Notes to the financial statements
30 June 2016
Note 1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
An asset is classiﬁed as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the
Company's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months
after the reporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a
liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classiﬁed as non-current.
Cash and cash equlvalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and
which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables
Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment.
investments and other financial assets
Investments and other financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs are included as part of the initial
measurement, except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. They are subsequently measured at either
amortised cost or fair value depending on their classificalion. Classification is determined based on the purpose of the
acquisition and subsequent reclassification to other categories is restricted.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the ﬁnancial assets have expired or have been
transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation expenditure in relation to separate areas of interest for which rights of tenure are current is carried
forward as an asset in the statement of ﬁnancial position where it is expected that the expenditure will be recovered through
the successful development and exploitation of an area of interest, or by its sale; or exploration activities are continuing in
an area and activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable estimate of the existence or otherwise of
economically recoverable reserves. Where a project or an area of interest has been abandoned, the expenditure incurred
thereon is written off in the year in which the decision is made,
Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and seNices provided to the Company prior to the end of the financial year
and which are unpaid, Due to their short-term nature they are measured at amortised cost and are not discounted. The
amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee beneﬁts
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non»monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be
settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities
are settled.
Other long-term employee benefits
The liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are
measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to
the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels,
experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at
the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible. the
estimated future cash outflows.
issued capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax,
from the proceeds.

Boadicea Resources Ltd
Notes to the financial statements
30 June 2016
Note 1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Boadicea Resources Ltd, excluding
any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding
during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the ﬁgures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the
after income tax effect of interest and otherfinancing costs associated with dllutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted
average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Goods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred Is not
recoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of
the expense.
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST
recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of
ﬁnancial position.
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities
which are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash ﬂows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority.
New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory.
have not been early adopted by the Company for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2016. The Company‘s
assessment of the impact of these new or amended Accounling Standards and Interpretations, most relevant to the
Company, are set out below.
AASB 9 Financial Instruments
This standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 20i8. The standard replaces all
previous versions of AASB 9 and completes the project to replace lAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement. AASB 9 introduces new classification and measurement models for financial assets. A ﬁnancial asset shall
be measured at amortised cost, if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect
contractual cash ﬂows, which arise on specified dates and solely principal and interest. All other ﬁnancial instrument assets
are to be classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss unless the entity makes an irrevocable election on initial
recognition to present gains and losses on equity instruments {that are not held—fontrading) in other comprehensive income
('OCI’). For financial liabilities, the standard requires the portion of the change in fair value that relates to the entity's own
credit risk to be presented in OCI (unless it would create an accounting mismatch). New simpler hedge accounting
requirements are intended to more closely align the accounting treatment with the risk management activities of the entity.
New impairment requirements will use an 'expected credit Ioss' ('ECL') model to recognise an allowance. Impairment will be
measured under a 12-month ECL method unless the credit risk on a ﬁnancial instrument has increased significantly since
initial recognition in which case the lifetime ECL method is adopted. The standard introduces additional new disclosures. The
Company will adopt this standard from 1 January 2018 but the impact of its adoption is not expected to be material.

Boadicea Resources Ltd
Notes to the financial statements
30 June 2016
Note 2. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the ﬁnancial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts in the ﬁnancial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in
relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and
assumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events. management
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal
the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are
discussed below.
Tax losses
The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset with regard to unused tax losses and other temporary differences, as
it has not been determined whether the Company will generate sufficient taxable income against which the unused losses
and other temporary differences can be utilised in the foreseeable future
Employee benefits provision
As discussed in note 1, the liability for employee beneﬁts expected to be settled more than 12 months from the reporting
date are recognised and measured at the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows to be made in respect of all
employees at the reporting date. in determining the present value of the liability, estimates of attrition rates and pay increases
through promotion and inflation have been taken into account.
Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation costs have been capitalised on the basis that the Company will commence commercial production
in the future, from which time the costs will be amortised in proportion to the depletion of the mineral resources, Key
judgements are applied in considering costs to be capitalised which includes determining expenditures directly related to
these activities and allocating overheads between those that are expensed and capitalised In addition, costs are only
capitalised that are expected to be recovered either through successful development or sale of the relevant mining interest.
Factors that could impact the future commercial production at the mine include the level of reserves and resources, future
technology changes, which could impact the cost of mining, future legal changes and changes in commodity prices. To the
extent that capitalised costs are determined not to be recoverable in the future, they will be written off in the period in which
this determination is made.
Note 3. Operating segments
Identiﬁcation of reportable operating segments
The Company is organised into one operating segment, exploration for minerals within Australia. This operating segment is
based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors (who are identified as the Chief Operating
Decision Makers ('CODM')) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources.
