<p><b>2</b> GE.15-07967 
</p>
<p>1. Spain would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm, in line with its national report 
</p>
<p>for the second cycle and its oral presentation of the report on 21 January 2015, its 
</p>
<p>commitment to the universal periodic review as an instrument which has proved to be of 
</p>
<p>great value in promoting and protecting human rights globally. 
</p>
<p>2. The Spanish State has carefully considered and assessed the 189 recommendations it 
</p>
<p>received during the second cycle of the universal periodic review. All of the ministries with 
</p>
<p>relevant responsibilities took part in the exercise, and consultations were held with civil 
</p>
<p>society. The Ombudsman was kept fully informed of the process. As a result, I am pleased 
</p>
<p>to announce that Spain accepts, in full or in part, 174 recommendations. 
</p>
<p>3. With a view to increasing the transparency of the acceptance, in full or in part, and 
</p>
<p>the noting by Spain of the 189 recommendations received, and in line with the model used 
</p>
<p>by other States in the context of the universal periodic review, this report is accompanied 
</p>
<p>by an annex setting out the reasons for each decision. 
</p>
<p>4. The recommendations that Spain accepts in full are those whose underlying spirit or 
</p>
<p>principle we support and which we are in a position to implement. This category also 
</p>
<p>includes recommendations that have already been implemented or that relate to ongoing 
</p>
<p>measures, without in any way implying that we regard the efforts made to date to be 
</p>
<p>insufficient. 
</p>
<p>5. Recommendations that Spain accepts in part are those whose spirit and principle we 
</p>
<p>support, but which can only be partially implemented because of legal, budgetary or 
</p>
<p>constitutional issues. This category also includes recommendations whose underlying 
</p>
<p>principle we support but where we differ as to how they may best be achieved, and 
</p>
<p>composite recommendations where it is possible to accept one element while rejecting the 
</p>
<p>other. Furthermore, we accept in part those recommendations whose underlying principle 
</p>
<p>we support and which we will continue to pursue, but in respect of which we do not accept 
</p>
<p>that our efforts to date are insufficient or do not constitute good practice.  
</p>
<p>6. Recommendations that Spain notes are those that we cannot undertake to implement 
</p>
<p>at this juncture, whether or not we agree with the underlying principles. 
</p>
<p>7. Spain will keep the Working Group informed of the progress made in a midterm 
</p>
<p>report.
