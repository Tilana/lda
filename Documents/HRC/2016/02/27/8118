</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
conducted an official mission to Senegal from 14 to 21 November 2011 in order to assess 
the manner in which the Government ensures the enjoyment of the rights to water and 
sanitation. 
</p>
<p>2. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur met with the Ministers for 
Decentralization and Local Communities, and for Family and Women&#8217;s Organizations. She 
also met representatives of the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing, Construction and 
Water; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Health and Social Action; the 
Ministry of Sanitation and Public Hygiene; the National Office for Sanitation and the 
National Society for Water in Senegal; and the Senegalese Committee for Human Rights. 
The Special Rapporteur also met representatives of S&#233;n&#233;galaise des Eaux, of the United 
Nations system based in Senegal and of donor agencies supporting work in the sector of 
water and sanitation. She met with civil society organizations and visited the communities 
of Ngor, Baraka, Gu&#233;diawaye and Rufisque in the Dakar region, as well as rural 
communities in the Kaolack region. In all her visits to communities, she met local leaders 
and residents. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur is thankful to the Government of Senegal for its cooperation 
before and during her visit. She also expresses her gratitude for the support provided by the 
West Africa Regional Office of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, the West and Central Africa Regional office of the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the national office of UNICEF in Senegal in the 
organization of her activities. Lastly, she thanks all those with whom she met in Senegal, 
especially those who openly shared information and their personal challenges regarding 
lack of access to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>4. Over the past two decades, Senegal has reformed its water and sanitation system and 
made important progress in the expansion of the water supply sector. As a result of these 
efforts, the rate of access to water reached 87.2 per cent in 2010, putting the country on 
track to reach the relevant target of the Millennium Development Goals. On the other hand, 
numerous challenges continue to seriously compromise the enjoyment of the right to water 
and sanitation in the country: disparities in access to water and sanitation between rural and 
urban areas remain significant; water and sanitation are still unaffordable for some of the 
poorest groups; water quality is not fully ensured in some regions of Senegal; a significant 
proportion of the population still does not have access to any form of sanitation as 
investments in the sector remain inadequate; and, lastly, more attention is required to 
educate communities regarding hygiene.  
</p>
<p>5. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur provides an overview of the legal and 
institutional framework for the provision of water and sanitation in Senegal. She then 
identifies some important obstacles to the realization of the rights to water and sanitation, 
making recommendations in this regard.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>6. Senegal is party to seven of the nine core international human rights treaties,1 all of 
which guarantee rights relevant to access to safe drinking water and sanitation.2 Senegal has 
also ratified a number of regional human rights treaties, such as the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the 
Child.3 The country&#8217;s international commitment to the human right to water and sanitation 
could be furthered by ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which it has already signed. 
</p>
<p>7. At the international level, safe drinking water and sanitation is a human right and 
derives from the right to an adequate standard of living, enshrined in, inter alia, article 11 of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This was explicitly 
recognized by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/292, which enjoyed the support of 
Senegal, and by the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 15/9, which was adopted 
without a vote. 
</p>
<p>8. Furthermore, in its general comment No. 15, the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights defined the legal basis of the right to water as entitling everyone to 
sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and 
domestic uses. According to the Committee, an adequate amount of safe water is necessary 
to prevent death from dehydration, to reduce the risk of water-related disease and to provide 
for consumption, cooking and personal and domestic hygienic requirements.  
</p>
<p>9. In its statement on the right to sanitation, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights also affirmed that, since sanitation is fundamental for human survival and 
for leading a life in dignity, the right to sanitation is an essential component of the right to 
an adequate standard of living, enshrined in article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Committee added that States must ensure that 
everyone, without discrimination, has physical and affordable access to sanitation in all 
spheres of life, which is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable, provides 
privacy and ensures dignity.4 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p> 2 Explicit references to the rights to water and sanitation are made in the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, art. 14, para. 2; and the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, art. 24, para. 2. The effective exercise of a number of other human rights is clearly related 
to the fulfilment of the right to water and sanitation, including the right to life, the prohibition of 
torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to health, the right to 
education, the right to adequate housing and the right to food. 
</p>
<p> 3 Explicit reference to the provision of water is made in article 14, para. 2 (c).

<p><b>A/HRC/21/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Constitution of Senegal of 22 January 2001 guarantees in the preamble thereto 
&#8220;equal access to public services for all citizens&#8221;. Title II, article 8, on civil liberties and the 
human person, and economic, social and collective rights, guarantees all citizens their 
individual fundamental freedoms, economic and social rights, as well as collective rights . 
Although it contains specific references to the right to health and the right to a healthy 
environment, the Constitution does not include specific provisions on the right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>11. The Constitution affirms in its preamble adherence to international human rights 
instruments adopted by the United Nations and the African Union. According to article 98 
of the Constitution, ratified or approved treaties or agreements have, upon publication, an 
authority superior to that of laws, subject, for each treaty or agreement, to its application by 
the other party. 
</p>
<p>12. The Water Code (Code de l&#8217;eau, law No. 81-13 of 4 March 1981) establishes the 
main legal framework for the management and use of water resources in Senegal. The 
preamble to and article 2 of the Code state that water resources are public goods, and any 
exploitation of this resource must be authorized and subject to control and monitoring. 
Article 75 establishes that human consumption is the priority in the allocation of water 
resources. 
</p>
<p>13. The Law on the Public Service of Drinking Water and Sanitation (Loi sur le service 
public de l&#8217;eau potable et de l&#8217;assainissement<i>, </i>Law 2008-59 of 24 September 2008) 
regulates the services for drinking water supply and collective sanitation in urban and rural 
areas. Ultimate responsibility for both services remains under the authority of the central 
Government. However, the law lays down roles and responsibilities in situations of 
concession of these public services to a third party.  
</p>
<p>14. The Hygiene Code (Code de l&#8217;hygi&#232;ne, Law 83-71 of 5 July 1983) establishes the 
sanitary rules for the public distribution of water and water installations, distribution work, 
tanks, wells and springs, and public and private cisterns. The Code does not lay down 
standards for water quality. 
</p>
<p>15. The Sanitation Code (Code de l&#8217;assainissement, Law 2009-24 of 8 July 2009) 
harmonizes the various regulations relating to sanitation. Furthermore, Decree 2011-245 of 
17 February 2011 implements the Sanitation Code and regulates the discharge, flow, 
deposit, jet, burying and direct or indirect immersion of liquid waste. The Code also 
clarifies the legal framework for the management of pluvial waters. 
</p>
<p>16. A recent analysis found that the enforcement of the provisions of the Water Code 
was weak, while knowledge of the various legal instruments for water and sanitation among 
civil society and public officers is limited.5 The Special Rapporteur notes the need to ensure 
coherence between different legal instruments and to enhance awareness of existing norms. 
As detailed below, she also emphasizes the need to ensure that the legal and institutional 
frameworks guarantee an adequate regulation of water and sanitation services in accordance 
with human rights norms.

</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> C. National human rights institution  
</b></p>
<p>17. Senegal has a national human rights institution, the Senegalese Committee for 
Human Rights (Comit&#233; s&#233;n&#233;galais des droits de l&#8217;homme). According to Law 97-04 of 10 
March 1997, the Committee is a non-jurisdictional organ defined as an independent 
institution mandated to consult, monitor, promote, dialogue and present recommendations 
on human rights-related matters. 
</p>
<p>18. Although mandated to report and make recommendations on cases of human rights 
violations, the Senegalese Committee for Human Rights has no explicit powers of 
investigation, and no specific mandate to receive or process individual complaints on 
human rights violations. According to an analysis of the justice sector in Senegal, the 
Committee is not consulted in the drafting of legislation on human rights issues, and its 
recommendations are often not implemented by the relevant authorities.6 
</p>
<p>19. Insufficient budgetary allocations and delayed disbursals further limit the capacity of 
the Senegalese Committee for Human Rights to ensure the necessary human and material 
resources for the performance of its core tasks. Consequently, the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights recommended that the classification of the Committee should be 
downgraded from status &#8220;A&#8221; to &#8220;B&#8221; (where &#8220;B&#8221; denotes an institution not fully in 
compliance with the Paris Principles).7 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the call for urgently increasing financial support 
for the Senegalese Committee for Human Rights, given its role in monitoring the situation 
of human rights in the country. Reinforcing the monitoring and technical capacity of the 
Committee could promote accountability and raise awareness of economic and social 
rights, including the rights to water and sanitation. This would also give a voice to alleged 
victims of these human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>21. At the time of the visit, the main institutions responsible for the provision of safe 
drinking water and sanitation were, respectively, the Ministry of Urban Development, 
Housing, Construction and Water (Minist&#232;re de l&#8217;urbanisme, de l&#8217;habitat, de la construction 
et de l&#8217;hydraulique) and the Ministry of Sanitation and Public Hygiene (Minist&#232;re de 
l&#8217;assainissement et de l&#8217;hygi&#232;ne publique). The ministerial restructuring carried out at the 
inauguration of the new national Government on 4 April 2012 saw the transfer of the core 
responsibilities for the water and sanitation sectors to the newly established Ministry of 
Water and Sanitation (Minist&#232;re de l&#8217;hydraulique et de l&#8217;assainissement).  
</p>
<p>22. The fragmented distribution of responsibilities for water and sanitation issues among 
diverse governmental actors is often identified as one of the causes for inadequate planning 
and the slow progress witnessed in the promotion of the rights to water and sanitation. In 
this sense, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the unification of responsibilities for both 
sectors under a single ministry. Better coordination is vital for ensuring sustainable 
achievements.

</p>
<p>Human Rights, report and recommendations of the session of the Subcommittee on Accreditation, 
Geneva, May 2011. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>23. In the Ministry of Water and Sanitation, the Urban Hydraulics Directorate (Direction 
de l&#8217;hydraulique urbaine) and the Rural Hydraulics Directorate (Direction de l&#8217;hydraulique 
rurale) are responsible for the design and implementation of the overall water policy in 
urban and rural contexts. The main responsibilities for the design and implementation of 
sanitation policies are concentrated in the Directorates of Urban Sanitation (Direction de 
l&#8217;assainissement urbain) and of Rural Sanitation (Direction de l&#8217;assainissement rural). 
</p>
<p>24. Since reform in the water sector started in 1995, the main responsibilities for urban 
water services have been delegated to the National Society for Water in Senegal (Soci&#233;t&#233; 
nationale des eaux du S&#233;n&#233;gal), a State-owned company. It owns the water service assets 
and is responsible for investments under a 30-year concession contract with the State. It is 
also responsible for proposing water and sanitation tariffs to the Government, jointly with 
the National Office for Sanitation in Senegal (Office national de l&#8217;assainissement du 
S&#233;n&#233;gal). Through the same sector reform, a private operator, S&#233;n&#233;galaise des Eaux, 
became responsible for operating the public water service in those urban areas. It is linked 
to the State of Senegal through a lease contract and to the National Society for Water 
through a performance contract. The concession agreement between the State of Senegal 
and S&#233;n&#233;galaise des Eaux is currently under assessment. The agreement, originally 
established for a period of 10 years, has been repeatedly extended since 2006 and will 
continue until the end of 2012.  
</p>
<p>25. The Exploitation and Maintenance Directorate (Direction de l&#8217;exploitation et de la 
maintenance) is responsible for the water distribution network in rural areas served by 
boreholes. After the adoption of the Law on the Public Service of Drinking Water and 
Sanitation in 2008, private operators represented by the borehole user associations 
(Associations d&#8217;usagers de forage) are entrusted with the management of these boreholes 
and given a fixed-term operating license by the Directorate.  
</p>
<p>26. Under the supervision of the Urban and Rural Sanitation Directorates, the National 
Office for Sanitation in Senegal is the main institution charged with investing in and 
operating both domestic and industrial wastewater and rainwater treatment facilities in 
urban centres on behalf of the State. Its activities are defined through a performance 
contract with the State. 
</p>
<p>27. The Ministry of Health is also involved in the promotion of better sanitary 
conditions through the Hygiene Directorate. The Directorate monitors the quality of 
drinking water and promotes activities to sensitize communities on hygiene standards.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Private sector involvement in the provision of water  
</b></p>
<p>28. The Government of Senegal is currently evaluating the conversion of the original 
10-year lease agreement between S&#233;n&#233;galaise des Eaux and the State into a comprehensive 
concession of water services, possibly for a period of 30 years. Under the new 
comprehensive concession, the private sector would be responsible not only for managing 
and maintaining the urban infrastructure of water supply but also investing in its expansion. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Senegalese experience of private sector participation in water supply was 
considered by the World Bank to be a successful example in the African context, given the 
increasing rates of water access and the reported improvements in efficiency.8 On the other

<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>hand, it is also recognized that the expansion of access to water was primarily ensured by 
investments made by the Government and international donors. 
</p>
<p>30. Civil society organizations commenting on the concession process9 further indicate 
that, despite progress achieved in urban access rates, some concerns remain unaddressed, 
such as the limited access to water in rural areas or the high cost of water in standpipes 
servicing poor communities. Moreover, these organizations expressed concerns at various 
stages of the process about the lack of transparency and public consultation in the current 
evaluation of the lease agreements. Given that investments in richer areas would offer 
better rates of return, the possible impact on future water tariffs and on the poorest 
communities of a full delegation of responsibility for investment in the water supply 
infrastructure to the private sector is a matter of significant concern. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to a study on the participation of non-State providers in water and 
sanitation service delivery,10 the Special Rapporteur has stated that the international human 
rights framework does not prescribe either public or private management of these essential 
services. In her study, however, she underlined the fact that, regardless of the model 
chosen, States remain the primary duty-bearer for the realization of the human rights to 
water and sanitation. In this sense, she recommended that States should develop legal and 
policy instruments to ensure the progressive realization of the rights to water and sanitation, 
including, in particular, a focus on unserved and underserved areas. The Special Rapporteur 
also recommended that any decision to delegate service provision to third parties should be 
taken through a transparent and participatory process, and emphasized the importance of 
ensuring that a strong independent regulatory agency is in place to ensure that those 
managing water and sanitation services remain fully accountable to the public. 
</p>
<p>32. In this context, the Special Rapporteur considers that the current evaluation of the 
possible long-term concession of water supply services to the private sector must serve as 
an opportunity for Senegal to hold a broad public debate on the functioning of and gaps in 
water and sanitation services in the country. Moreover, regardless of the chosen modalities 
of concession to the private sector, further attention to the regulation of the water and 
sanitation sectors is crucial (see paragraphs 33 to 37 below), and Senegal must, at least, 
empower an independent monitoring body to ensure that both public and private providers 
deliver sanitation and water to all without discrimination, at affordable costs and with 
adequate quality.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Regulation of the water and sanitation sectors  
</b></p>
<p>33. Senegal does not have a single institution responsible for the regulation of the water 
and sanitation sectors. The Law on the Public Service of Drinking Water and Sanitation 
contains a provision for the institutionalization of an interministerial committee of 
monitoring and control charged with technical and financial contractual regulation in the 
delegated urban centres; however, such a body is not yet in place, because the provisions 
implementing the Law have not been enacted. Such a body might not, however, comply 
with human rights requirements of ensuring independent monitoring of the water and 
sanitation sectors.  
</p>
<p>34. Currently, the lease and performance contracts between the different institutions 
responsible for the water and sanitation sectors are the mainframe for their self-regulation.

</b></p>
<p>An analysis of the regulatory framework for the water and sanitation sectors in Senegal11 
indicated that regulation by contract contributed to ensuring that efficiency gains were 
achieved, tariffs increased to cost-recovery levels and investments made (albeit with some 
delays). The same report also pointed out, however, that &#8220;more powerful than the contracts 
themselves, the good relations between the parties enabled them to reach mutually 
acceptable solutions to unforeseen events, based on the spirit rather than the letter of the 
original contracts&#8221;; as conflicts emerged, they were resolved by negotiation and 
conciliation between Soci&#233;t&#233; nationale des eaux du S&#233;n&#233;gal and S&#233;n&#233;galaise des Eaux, for 
example, rather than through a legal process. The author of the study also noted that none 
of these conciliation mechanisms functioned exactly as planned in the contracts. Under 
these circumstances, the perception was that decisions concerning the management of the 
water and sanitation sector were taken in relative isolation, and that the right of recourse for 
civil society was relatively limited, given that there were no interlocutors empowered to 
receive complaints and municipalities still did not play a strong role in the planning and 
regulation of water and sanitation services.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur considers that, even though the above-mentioned self-
regulatory system has contributed to flexibility by providing informal solutions between 
public and private partners, the predominant informality may also have limited the 
transparency of the regulation process as well as the levels of accountability. Again, the 
Special Rapporteur underlines that transparency and accountability are core human rights 
principles that must guide the design and implementation of policies ensuring the fulfilment 
of the rights to water and sanitation, and may be enhanced through the establishment of a 
strong regulatory agency, independent of the public or private actors managing the water 
and sanitation sectors.  
</p>
<p>36. The current regulatory system also lacks an accessible channel for processing 
complaints regarding the many actors involved in the provision of water and sanitation. 
Although S&#233;n&#233;galaise des Eaux, for example, has consumer hotlines for consumers to 
register complaints, these channels only respond to the requests of its own consumers and 
exclude, for example, those not served by the company network. The lack of a focal point 
for the presentation of public complaints may lead to a permanent neglect of situations of 
unfair exclusion, in particular when those affected are families living in extreme poverty, 
without access to any other type of legal assistance.  
</p>
<p>37. Besides reforming the water and sanitation regulatory framework and establishing 
complaint channels, the promotion of accountability with regard to economic and social 
rights, including the right to water and sanitation, and the relevant training should require 
further sensitization of members of legal professions, including the judiciary, as most 
judges reportedly have very limited awareness of the relevant international human rights 
norms. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Water and sanitation policy strategies  
</b></p>
<p>38. Both strategic plans for poverty reduction (PRSP-I, 2003-2005 and PRSP-II, 2006-
2010) include the promotion of access to drinking water and sanitation as core objectives of 
the strategy relating to the improvement of social services.

<p>39. Between 1996 and 2004, the Projet sectoriel eau was implemented in order to 
provide water to the Dakar region, aiming particularly at strengthening institutional 
capacities, as well as the management plan and regulation of the water sector. Since 2005, 
the main national policy strategy, which focuses exclusively on the development of the 
water and sanitation sectors, is outlined by the Millennium Safe Drinking Water and 
Sanitation Programme (Programme d&#8217;eau potable et d&#8217;assainissement du mill&#233;naire). 
</p>
<p>40. The Millennium Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation Programme provides a national 
programmatic approach to coordinate different actors involved in the water and sanitation 
sectors (including national and local Governments, international cooperation agencies and 
civil society) with the aim of meeting the Millennium Development Goal targets for water 
supply and sanitation by 2015. In the Programme, it was noted that, in 2005, 25 per cent of 
the population had no access to safe drinking water, while 65 per cent did not have access 
to adequate sanitation.12 In this context, the Programme aims to increase access to safe 
drinking water to 82 per cent of the rural population and 98 per cent of the urban 
population; it also aims to ensure sanitation to 59 per cent of the rural population and 78 per 
cent of the urban population. Programme initiatives include investments in the 
improvement and expansion of infrastructure for water supply and sanitation, and the 
establishment of a framework for water and sanitation policies in rural areas, including 
through decentralization and enhanced monitoring and evaluation.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the policy framework provided by the 
Millennium Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation Programme was instrumental in the 
alignment of water and sanitation initiatives. The Programme Coordination Unit , created in 
2005, played an important role as a convener of the different Government agencies working 
on water and sanitation. However, as already mentioned above, coordination may and 
should be further enhanced with the recently announced unification of the water and 
sanitation portfolios under a single ministry. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation of safe drinking water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>42. The lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation is a major concern for West 
and Central Africa. In 2008, it was estimated that approximately 39 per cent of the 
population had no access to safe drinking water in the region, and only 27 per cent had 
access to improved sanitation.13 Most West and Central African countries are not expected 
to achieve the Millennium Development Goals target of reducing the proportion of people 
without sustainable access to safe drinking water by half by 2015, and none is expected to 
reach the target on basic sanitation.  
</p>
<p>43. In comparison with its neighbours, however, Senegal has higher rates of access to 
water and is on track to achieve the related Millennium Development Goals target. 
Nonetheless, many Senegalese still have limited or no access to water and to improved 
sanitation. The State faces important technical and financial challenges if it is to ensure that 
this situation is remedied. 
</p>
<p>44. According to data from the Millennium Drinking Water and Sanitation Programme 
(calculated through an inventory of functioning water facilities and an estimated number of 
users), Senegal is on track to meet the national targets for drinking water, as the access rate

</b></p>
<p>stood at 85 per cent at the end of 2008;14 however, estimates by the Joint Monitoring 
Programme, calculated through a linear regression of household surveys, show that the 
country had an overall access rate of 69 per cent in 2008, and would probably miss the 
target of 81 per cent in 2015. 
</p>
<p>45. On the other hand, sanitation is still inaccessible to most Senegalese. The Joint 
Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation estimated that at least 17 per cent 
of the population still practiced open defecation, and almost half the population had no 
acceptable sanitation solutions in 2010.15 The pace of progress in sanitation is insufficient 
to meet the country&#8217;s needs, and estimates by both the Millennium Drinking Water and 
Sanitation Programme and the Joint Monitoring Programme indicate that Senegal is 
unlikely to reach its Millennium Development Goal target for sanitation. 
</p>
<p>46. While recognizing progress in the indicators of access to water, the Special 
Rapporteur still points out that such challenges as limited access to water and sanitation in 
rural areas, the high cost of water and sanitation for some of the poorest groups, limited 
water quality and insufficient investments in sanitation continue to undermine the 
enjoyment of the right to water and sanitation in Senegal.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Limited access to water in rural regions  
</b></p>
<p>47. Overall progress in access to water in Senegal is certainly the most important 
achievement of recent investments in this sector. It is important to recognize, however, that 
most progress made was concentrated in urban areas (mainly in Dakar), and some rural 
areas continue to be neglected. Those responsible for the poverty reduction strategy have 
already recognized the disparity in access between Dakar and the rest of the country, noting 
that, in 2004, there were significant differences in terms of private connections between the 
Dakar region (75.7 per cent) and other urban centres (57.1 per cent).16 
</p>
<p>48. Broad regional disparities in the rate of water access can be noted, ranging from 50 
per cent for the Kolda region to 80 per cent for the Thi&#232;s region. Disparities may also be 
noted between rural communities within the same region. These disparities are related to an 
inequitable allocation of public and donated financial resources and to different hydro-
geological and sociological constraints.17 
</p>
<p>49. Since the launch of the Millennium Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation Programme, 
greater financial investments have been made in rural areas. Nonetheless, further 
investments are required to meet the adopted targets. Interventions have often included the 
construction of small piped systems to reduce the widespread use of unprotected water 
sources. The transfer of responsibilities for the operation of rural boreholes to user 
associations, initiated with the adoption of the Law on the Public Service of Drinking Water 
and Sanitation, is credited with improvements in the condition of the infrastructure and the 
rate of water network expansion. On the other hand, it has also been noted that the 
extension of the water supply in rural areas has been marked by inconsistencies, owing to

<p>the involvement of different actors and the significant differences in the procedures used for 
designing and implementing local interventions.18 
</p>
<p>50. Plans for the future expansion of the rural water supply include promoting the 
participation of private actors in the management of all boreholes and redirecting State 
efforts to monitoring and regulatory activities, and providing back-up support. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that, even if the increased involvement of user associations may have 
improved efficiency in the management of boreholes, attention is required to ensure that 
greater private sector involvement does not result in an increase in tariffs or contribute to 
the already noted lack of coordination and consistency among the needed investments in the 
rural water supply across the country. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Affordability of water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>51. Affordability of water and sanitation is a core concern in Senegal, given that half the 
population is estimated to live beneath the poverty line19 and therefore has limited capacity 
to afford the potential costs of these essential services. In this context, one of the main 
objectives of the Millennium Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation Programme is the 
maintenance of affordable rates for the most disadvantaged populations while ensuring the 
sustainability and quality of services. 
</p>
<p>52. The Government has succeeded in avoiding any increase in water tariffs for 
domestic clients since 2003. In 2006, the authorities applied a price increase only to State-
run ministries, departments and agencies (the largest clients of S&#233;n&#233;galaise des Eaux), 
sparing domestic users. In the context of the recent global financial crisis, however, costs 
for domestic water use might need to be revised in the light of public budget limitations.  
</p>
<p>53. The main initiative in place to ensure water affordability is a &#8220;social connections&#8221; 
programme. Implemented over the past 15 years with the support of international 
cooperation, the programme is credited with having greatly contributed to the increasing 
number of households connected to the national water network. According to estimates, 
some 70 per cent of all additional connections made between 1996 and 2008 were made 
possible by the initiative. The programme provides poor households with small-diameter 
private connections free of charge, and can supply up to 20m3 of water per household every 
two months at subsidized rates (also called social tariffs).20  
</p>
<p>54. The beneficiaries of &#8220;social connections&#8221; are identified through a partnership 
comprising the ministries responsible for water and urbanism, Soci&#233;t&#233; nationale des eaux du 
S&#233;n&#233;gal, S&#233;n&#233;galaise des Eaux and a non-governmental organization. Soci&#233;t&#233; nationale des 
eaux du S&#233;n&#233;gal and the civil society partner are responsible for identifying potential 
geographical areas to be served and eliciting preferences from community leaders for 
improved water and sanitation. To be eligible for a connection, (a) applicants cannot be 
wealthy; (b) a house must exist on the lot that is to be served; (c) the house must be a 
residence (not a business); (d) the connection cannot cross private property; (e) the 
applicant must have a title to his or her house and land; (f) a pipe of the water network must 
be located within 20 metres of where the connection is made to serve a single house, or 
within 100 metres to serve the houses of at least four applicants; and (g) if approved for a

<p>connection, the applicant must pay a security deposit of approximately $19 against future 
water consumption charges (meter is, however, provided free of charge). 
</p>
<p>55. Despite the acknowledged role of the programme in the expansion of urban water 
connections, assessments have suggested that the programme does not always reach the 
poorest groups in Senegal because of its eligibility criteria,21 which require stable 
neighbourhoods, where residents have established themselves and secured land tenure. 
Most of those living in extreme poverty live in informal settlements that can never qualify 
for social connections. These groups frequently rely on <i>bornes fontaines, </i>standpipes 
intended to guarantee a water supply where piped networks do not yet exist, and pay more 
for the water they consume; the official tariff for water from standpipes is in fact 
substantially higher than that charged for those benefiting from social connections (315.09 
CFAF per m3 as against 186.32 CFAF per m3). Moreover, poorer consumers also have to 
pay an overhead to the licensed vendor or reseller managing the standpipe. Overhead costs 
can easily double the original cost of water; furthermore, the authorities acknowledge that 
how such costs are imposed on communities is not monitored. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur visited the community of Baraka in Dakar, served by a 
standpipe, and talked to residents using these sources. During her visit, she confirmed the 
very high costs paid by residents, who had inhabited the area for more than 10 years but did 
not benefit from social connections owing to disputed land titles in the area. Besides having 
to carry the water from the standpipes to their residences, the community habitually spent 
up to four times more than wealthier residences that benefited from social connections.  
</p>
<p>57. Another concern regarding the cost of water is the fact that water tariffs are 
calculated on the basis of consumption, given that higher prices are charged to households 
with a social connection using more than 20m3 every two months. Poorer households often 
comprise numerous members of the same family, and the amount of water consumed daily 
by each resident needs to be drastically limited in order not to exceed the limit imposed to 
be entitled to social tariffs; for example, residents in a house hosting a family of 10 
members had to consume no more than 33 m2 of water per day, which is clearly below the 
minimum quantity recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)in its 
guidelines.22 The Special Rapporteur visited various residences in Ngor, Gu&#233;diawaye and 
Rufisque, where the water connection tap was closed with a padlock in order to control 
consumption. Women and children complained about the lack of water for personal hygiene 
and housekeeping; in some cases, the key to the lock was held by the male head of the 
household. 
</p>
<p>58. Even though the Government of Senegal has already acknowledged the 
disproportionate water costs imposed on poorer residents living in informal settlements23 
and declared its intention to revise the strategies used to ensure water affordability, no 
revised measures have been adopted to date. The Special Rapporteur underlines the urgency 
of revising the targeting methods and the costing procedures in the case of social tariffs. At 
a minimum, it is urgent that the unfair costs imposed at standpipes known to serve the 
poorest groups be controlled.

<p><b> C. Water quality 
</b></p>
<p>59. Despite improvements in the capacity and efficiency of water supply systems 
serving urban areas, in some regions of Senegal the quality of water is still too low for 
human consumption owing to natural causes and pollution. 
</p>
<p>60. An analysis of the impact of water sector reform carried out by the Government 
noted that the quality of water and the efficiency of service delivery in urban sectors had 
improved in recent years. Assessments also indicate that the bacteriological quality and 
physiochemical water quality targets set in the performance contract with S&#233;n&#233;galaise des 
Eaux were mostly met.24  
</p>
<p>61. Nonetheless, water quality remains a major issue in some suburbs of Dakar, and in 
particular in Bassin Arachidier, in the centre of the country, where salinity levels and the 
fluoride, chloride and iron content of the water frequently exceed WHO standards. Isolated 
areas in the south also present high levels of chemical pollution in the groundwater table.25 
The Government has acknowledged the inadequate quality of the water provided in some 
areas of the country, and estimates that 21 per cent of the population using motorized 
boreholes in rural areas consume water with a high fluoride content, and that 15 per cent 
consume water with high salinity levels.26 
</p>
<p>62. Poor water quality has a significant effect on health standards. For example, a recent 
epidemiological study in rural communities where 70 per cent of the population had access 
to water with high levels of fluoride concluded that 83.6 per cent of those surveyed suffered 
from dental fluorosis, while 52.7 per cent had clinical symptoms indicating possible 
development of skeletal fluorosis.27 
</p>
<p>63. A considerable proportion of the population, with no access to or unable to afford 
water provided by the main network often rely on polluted or untreated water sources, such 
as rivers, or water extracted by homemade pumps or through private standpipes.28 
</p>
<p>64. Investments in water purification, such as the development of a defluoridation unit 
in Thiadiaye, are proceeding, but they do not fully meet the needs, as noted above. 
Moreover, the lack of regular monitoring efforts limits the possibility of making a more 
accurate assessment of the full impact of low-quality water and the outcome of efforts to 
address the issue. In this regard, the National Hygiene Service, in partnership with 
UNICEF, is investing in efforts to ensure more regular and accurate quality monitoring 
throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur underlines the fact that, in order to meet human rights 
standards, water must be safe, namely, of such a quality that it does not pose a threat to 
human health. In this sense, it is crucial that further investments be made in purification, 
pollution control and quality monitoring. The Special Rapporteur also believes that the 
estimates of access to water in Senegal (when assessing progress towards the Millennium 
Development Goals targets) should be revised, given the limited quality of the water

<p>available in some regions. As explained by the Special Rapporteur in her report on how 
human rights can contribute to the realization of the Millennium Development Goals,29 the 
use of household survey data as an indicator of access to safe drinking water should be 
complemented by other approaches, such as periodic surveys of water quality sample 
surveys. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to sanitation and financial support for the sanitation sector 
</b></p>
<p>66. Statistics from the Joint Monitoring Programme indicate that, despite some progress, 
access to improved sanitation facilities continues to be limited across the country, 
particularly in rural areas. In accordance with the Millennium Safe Drinking Water and 
Sanitation Programme, in urban areas the rate of access rose from 56.7 per cent in 2004 to 
63.1 per cent in 2010. In the same period, access in rural areas rose from 26.7 per cent in 
2004 to 29.6 per cent in 2010.30  
</p>
<p>67. Large disparities between urban and rural areas are clear in the rates of access to 
sanitation. Coordinated efforts have led to an increase in access to sanitation in Dakar 
(responding in part to the continuous population growth in the capital). On the other hand, 
progress in access to sanitation in rural areas has been hampered by the limited 
coordination of activities conducted by the actors involved in rural water and sanitation 
sectors and by the limited capacity of the Sanitation Directorate to exercise its potential 
leadership. The high cost of the facilities required, that difficulty of obtaining building 
materials in remote communities and the limited willingness of users to meet the potential 
costs for new sanitation facilities are also factors possibly contributing to the delay in 
expanding rural sanitation. 
</p>
<p>68. Despite some progress in the promotion sanitation in urban and rural areas, a history 
of insufficient investments in the sector is considered to be one of the main reasons for the 
limited degrees of access. After the sector reform of 1995, when sanitation services were 
placed under the responsibility of the National Office for Sanitation, these services were 
somewhat neglected and did not receive much funding, even if sanitation was still a policy 
priority.31 With limited funding available, the expansion of the sanitation system has been 
further delayed by the need to cover regular maintenance costs. Lastly, lack of public 
awareness of the benefits of sanitation interventions has been identified as a long-standing 
obstacle to progress in the sector, as political leaders and international donors may often see 
limited visibility when investing. 
</p>
<p>69. The Government of Senegal has repeatedly reiterated its commitment to increase 
financial support for sanitation: in 2008, it pledged to allocate 0.5 per cent of its investment 
budget to sanitation, while in 2010, it pledged to allocate more than $24 million a year to 
the water and sanitation sectors between 2011 and 2015, giving sanitation an increasingly 
important priority in budget allocation. There are, however, concerns that the State will be 
unable to meet its commitments, as budget limitations brought on by the recent financial 
crisis have severely restricted its recent investment capacity; on 23 April 2010, at the high-
level meeting of Sanitation and Water for All, in Washington, D.C., the Government stated 
that only 25 per cent of the original budget for rural sanitation had been disbursed between 
2006 and 2009. In this context, ensuring complementary international financial aid is 
crucial for the improvement of water and sanitation in Senegal. In fact, international 
development aid funding is reportedly responsible for more than 85 per cent of investments

<p>in the water and sanitation sector. Two thirds of external funding, however, comes in the 
form of loans, and repayment is more difficult in the case of sanitation given its low profit 
return. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur underlines the need for both the State and the international 
community to honour their commitments to finance both the water and sanitation sectors in 
Senegal. She emphasizes the fact that States are obliged to use the maximum of available 
resources when working to realize progressively the rights to water and sanitation32 and 
cannot justify neglect of these obligations by asserting that they lack the necessary funds or 
human resources.33 Rather, States are expected to mobilize resources from those living 
within their borders and, where necessary, the international community.34 Countries in a 
position to assist through international cooperation have an obligation to provide support in 
a manner consistent with human rights principles.35  
</p>
<p><b> E. Affordability of sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>71. As the Special Rapporteur has pointed out above, concerted efforts are required to 
ensure that water and sanitation are affordable for most of the population . Most initiatives 
promoting sanitation in both rural and urban areas are highly subsidized. 
</p>
<p>72. In urban areas, the Sanitation Programme for Peri-urban Areas of Dakar 
(Programme d&#8217;assainissement autonome des quartiers p&#233;riurbains de Dakar), the first 
Government-led programme designed to provide support for on-site sanitation and semi-
collective sanitation solutions in Senegal, is credited to have reached 25 per cent of the 
city&#8217;s peri-urban population.36 The initiative targeted areas with a high incidence of poverty 
in the peri-urban zone of the Dakar, where it was deemed too expensive or impractical to 
extend conventional sewerage networks. Financed with international aid, the programme 
involved the provision of sanitation services and included household sanitation, small-bore 
sewers, community sanitation (public toilets), school sanitation and sludge treatment 
facilities. The sanitation options offered included on-site excreta disposal and semi-
collective sewerage systems. Households benefiting from the initiative are required to make 
a financial contribution, but most hardware and software costs are subsidized. Poor areas 
were geographically targeted. Within communities, community leaders assisted the 
National Office for Sanitation in Senegal and a non-governmental partner organization in 
the identification of households and the design and implementation of solutions.  
</p>
<p>73. An assessment of the programme conducted by the World Bank indicated that it had 
been successful in mobilizing communities, focusing attention on on-site sanitation and in 
offering different service options suited to the various needs of the communities assisted. 
At the same time, the assessment found that the subsidies provided needed to be increased, 
and that a shortage of funding had put the programme on hold, leaving interested

<p>households unserved.37 Another independent evaluation of the programme highlighted the 
fact that the coverage achieved was much more limited than claimed by the implementing 
agencies, as several systems were not fully operational owing to serious deficiencies in 
implementation at the local level. Households benefiting from the programme and 
sometimes connected to the newly installed networks were therefore not properly served 
and, in some cases, even faced serious health hazards owing to the pollution generated by 
malfunctioning systems.38 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur visited communities served by a semi-collective sanitation 
system in Ngor and Rufisque. Residents acknowledged the improvements made since the 
installation of a new sanitation system, and it was clear the project had focused the attention 
of communities on sanitation. Problems in the functioning of these systems, such as 
frequent blockages and inactive pumping stations, were however, visible at the time of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The pollution generated by unserved residents in the areas 
surrounding the beneficiaries of the new system also seemed to be undermining the 
improvements, particularly in areas frequently affected by flooding. In all visited areas, 
residents stated they had no clear idea about the future of the programme, and underlined 
the urgency of extending it to the surrounding areas. In one of the communities visited, 
even though a good number of residents had already made their direct financial contribution 
to the system, activities were paralysed and had never resumed owing to the end of project 
funding.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the Sanitation Programme for Peri-urban 
Areas of Dakar as an innovative solution for the serious obstacles facing the promotion of 
sanitation in urban areas affected by poverty with very limited infra-structure. She also 
recognizes the importance of actively engaging the community in the development and 
implementation of solutions; however, she urges the Government and its partners to further 
evaluate the effectiveness of the installed system, improve its maintenance and fully 
conclude all projects initiated. It is also essential that the residents of served and unserved 
communities be informed about future plans for the programme or when alternatives are 
being designed.  
</p>
<p>76. For those not connected to a collective or semi-collective sewage system, the septic 
tank is the most common alternative for sanitation, in both rural and urban areas of Senegal. 
The cost of emptying the tank is often high for those living in poverty. In some areas, 
particularly in rural zones, septic tanks may be emptied manually, though in deplorable 
hygiene and working conditions. The Special Rapporteur was informed about prisoners and 
former prisoners being recruited to provide these services as they constituted a cheap labour 
force. Moreover, residents in the communities visited in the region of Dakar informed the 
Special Rapporteur that the sanitation fee was included in their water tariffs even though 
their homes were not connected to the sanitation system. In such cases, the residents also 
had to pay for the costs of maintenance of their individual septic tanks. Expenses for water 
and sanitation in some very poor households could easily exceed 5 per cent of all household 
income, and in some it almost reached 20 per cent.  
</p>
<p>77. In the light of the above situation, the Special Rapporteur calls attention to the need 
to carefully monitor the services offered to maintain sceptic tanks, and the urgency of

<p>identifying and rectifying all situations where residents are charged for sanitation services 
they have never received.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Awareness-raising  
</b></p>
<p>78. Besides investments in the development of collective and semi-collective and 
individual infrastructures, the promotion of the right to sanitation also often requires 
investment in the promotion of behavioural changes through awareness-raising efforts. 
</p>
<p>79. An important initiative in this regard is the Community-led Total Sanitation 
Programme (Programme d&#8217;assainissement total pilot&#233; par la communaut&#233;). Piloted with the 
support of UNICEF, the Programme promotes the active participation of communities in 
identifying problems in their sanitation conditions and in developing low-cost sanitation 
technologies to respond to them. To date, the Programme has covered more than 309 
villages in the Tambacounda, Kolda, S&#233;dhiou, Kaffrine, Fatick and Kaolack regions. More 
than half of the villages reportedly achieved the complete elimination of open-air 
defecation.39 The initiative replicates a methodology developed by non-governmental 
organizations in Bangladesh. The Special Rapporteur had noted the positive impact of a 
similar initiative to eliminate open-air defecation in Bangladesh in a report on her mission 
to that country.40 
</p>
<p>80. The approach of a community-led sanitation programme is particularly interesting, 
because it fully integrates efforts to develop sanitation improvements in remote 
communities with efforts to promote hygiene education and to stimulate the demand for 
sanitation. In Kaolack, the Special Rapporteur visited communities that participated in the 
programme and witnessed clear improvements in the sanitation conditions of participating 
households. Residents also reported the positive impact of improved sanitary conditions on 
the health of children.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Senegal has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to the realization of the 
rights to water and sanitation. Since the outset of reforms to the water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>sector in 1995, the country has achieved progress, particularly in the expansion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>sources for the provision of safe water. On the other hand, it is clear that the efforts 
</b></p>
<p><b>made to date have not sufficiently addressed the vast challenges that continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>impede the full enjoyment of the rights to water and sanitation by most of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>population. Despite important efforts to reform regulations and to incentivize private 
</b></p>
<p><b>investment in the expansion of the water and sanitation sector, transparency and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability must be improved, in particular as the country considers the long-term 
</b></p>
<p><b>concession of water supply services to private partners. Despite having invested in 
</b></p>
<p><b>subsidies and important targeted efforts to ensure access of poor groups to water and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanitation, assessments indicate that adjustments will be required to secure better 
</b></p>
<p><b>results and to avoid the exclusion of the most vulnerable. Despite the commitments to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhance investment, particularly in sanitation, financing by external and domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>sources is still clearly unsatisfactory and sometimes erratic</b>.

</b></p>
<p><b>82. As a new Government is established, Senegal will have a good opportunity to 
</b></p>
<p><b>discuss the efforts required to tackle all of the above concerns in accordance with its 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights obligations. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government strengthen institutional and legal frameworks by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Revising the legal and institutional framework for the supply of water 
</b></p>
<p><b>and sanitation in order to ensure better coordination of multiple efforts in both 
</b></p>
<p><b>sectors; In particular, it should ensure that the regulatory framework for public and 
</b></p>
<p><b>private sector participation in the provision of water and sanitation fully reflects 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Establishing an independent monitoring body responsible for ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>that public or private services providing water and sanitation are available, safe, 
</b></p>
<p><b>acceptable, accessible and affordable, and ensuring that it provides accessible channel 
</b></p>
<p><b>for processing individual complaints regarding the provision of water and sanitation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensuring transparency and broad public participation in the ongoing 
</b></p>
<p><b>revision of contracts regulating the concession of services of the water supply to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>private sector;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensuring the resources necessary for the adequate functioning of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Senegalese Committee for Human Rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ratifying the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>83. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government of Senegal 
</b></p>
<p><b>further expand access to safe drinking water and sanitation by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensuring the financial resources necessary to increase access to both 
</b></p>
<p><b>water and sanitation through domestic and international sources; particular attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be paid to the fulfilment of financial commitments with regard to the sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensuring better coordination and coherence in the implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives aimed at expanding access to water and sanitation in rural areas.  
</b></p>
<p><b>84. The international community must uphold and enhance its commitments to 
</b></p>
<p><b>assist Senegal. Donors must ensure the predictability, coordination and long-term 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainability of initiatives supporting the expansion of water and sanitation sectors.  
</b></p>
<p><b>85.  The Government should ensure that water quality meets the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards required for safe human consumption by further investing in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>purification of water sources, the control of all forms of environmental pollution and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the regular monitoring of quality throughout the country.  
</b></p>
<p><b>86. The Government should furthermore ensure the affordability of water and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanitation by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Making sure that priority is given to communities living in extreme 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty when designing and implementing any initiative aimed at expanding access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>water and sanitation in Senegal; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Revising existing initiatives aimed at ensuring affordable water and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanitation in order to eliminate inadequate eligibility criteria, the unfair exclusion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>beneficiaries and any distortions or mistakes in the application of water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>tariffs;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Improving the financial stability of all initiatives aimed at promoting 
</b></p>
<p><b>affordable water and sanitation; in this regard, the Government should take measures </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>to ensure that information on planned and implemented initiatives is available and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible to potential beneficiaries.  
</b></p>
<p><b>87.  The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Government invest in 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness-raising by incorporating the Community-led Total Sanitation Programme 
</b></p>
<p><b>into its overall national strategy for the promotion of sanitation in rural areas, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>replicating the initiative in other regions of the country.
