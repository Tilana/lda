<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report contains information on the question of the death penalty, and 
reports that the international community as a whole is moving towards the abolition of the 
death penalty in law or in practice. Nevertheless, a small number of States have continued 
to use the death penalty and in many instances, international standards guaranteeing the 
protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty were not fully respected. The 
report also discusses the continued difficulties in gaining access to reliable information 
regarding executions, and issues related to the human rights of children of parents 
sentenced to the death penalty or executed.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  Pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 18/117, the present report is submitted 
in order to update previous reports on the question of the death penalty, including the last 
quinquennial report of the Secretary-General (E/2010/10 and Corr.1 and 2) and reports 
submitted to the Council (A/HRC/4/78, A/HRC/8/11, A/HRC/12/45, A/HRC/15/19, 
A/HRC/18/20 and A/HRC/21/29). As requested by Human Rights Council resolution 
22/11, the report also includes information on the human rights of children of parents 
sentenced to the death penalty or executed.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report covers the period from June 2012 to May 2013 and  is based on 
information received from States and other available sources, including national human 
rights institutions, United Nations agencies, international and regional bodies and non-
governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Changes in law and practice 
</b>3.  Changes in law include new legislation abolishing or reinstating the death penalty, 
restricting or expanding its scope, as well as ratifications of international and regional 
human rights treaties that provide for the abolition of the death penalty. Changes in practice 
cover mainly non-legislative measures reflecting a new approach regarding the use of the 
death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Member States that have abolished the death penalty for all crimes  
</b></p>
<p>4.  More than 150 of the 193 Member States of the United Nations have abolished the 
death penalty or introduced a moratorium, either in law or in practice.1 174 of the 193 
Member States reportedly were execution-free in 2012.2  
</p>
<p>5. During the reference period, Benin repealed death penalty provisions in its Criminal 
Procedure Code. In the United States of America, the State of Maryland adopted a law 
abolishing the death penalty, thus becoming the 18th State in the country to do so.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Member States that have restricted the scope of the death penalty or 
are limiting its use 
</b></p>
<p>6. Even in countries where the application of the death penalty remains, some 
noticeable initiatives towards restricting its use were recorded during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p>7. In January 2013, amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#8217;s 
Republic of China came into force, authorizing the Supreme People&#8217;s Court to amend death 
sentences in all cases. The amendments also make it mandatory to record or videotape 
interrogations of individuals potentially facing the death penalty or life imprisonment. The

 The International Commission against the Death Penalty released a new report entitled &#8220;How States 
</p>
<p>abolish the death penalty&#8221;, which reviews the processes towards abolition of capital punishment by 
analysing the experiences of 13 States. Drawing on these lessons and experiences, it provides 
guidance to States on how to abolish the death penalty. Available at: http://www.icomdp.org/cms/wp-

<p>National Human Rights Action Plan of China (2012-2015) includes measures aimed at 
strengthening safeguards in all death penalty cases.  
</p>
<p>8.  Singapore adopted the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act (2012) and the Penal 
Code (Amendment) Act (2012), both of which abolish the mandatory death penalty in 
certain circumstances.  
</p>
<p>9. In the United States of America, the State of Texas adopted a law, known as the 
&#8220;Michael Morton Act&#8221;, requiring prosecutors to open files for defendants and keep records 
of the evidence disclosed in the death penalty cases. The Act aims at preventing wrongful 
convictions by stopping prosecutors from suppressing evidence.3 
</p>
<p><b> C.   Member States that have ratified or committed to ratifying 
international and regional instruments providing for the abolition of 
the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>10. As of June 2013, 76 States had ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
penalty.4  Benin and Latvia acceded to the Second Optional Protocol. Madagascar signed 
the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR).  
</p><p>11. On 17 April 2013, the Plurinational State of Bolivia adopted a law for the 
ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the ICCPR.5 Armenia reported that an 
intergovernmental procedure was under way for the ratification of the Second Optional 
Protocol to the ICCPR.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Member States that have introduced a moratorium on executions 
</b></p>
<p>12. During the reference period, Singapore observed a short moratorium on executions 
pending a decision on legislative amendments to its death penalty law.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Member States that have reintroduced the use of the death penalty, 
extended its scope or resumed executions 
</b></p>
<p>13.   Bangladesh adopted the Human Trafficking Prevention and Suppression Act (2012) 
authorizing the use of the death penalty as the most severe punishment for organized 
trafficking in human beings.6 Kenya adopted the Defence Forces Act 2012,7 which allows 
the imposition of the death penalty against members of defence forces for a range of 
offences.8 India adopted the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013, which authorizes the 
use of the death penalty for &#8220;repeat rape-offenders&#8221; or for rape attacks that result in the

<p>victim&#8217;s death.9 Papua New Guinea adopted a law which provides for the reimplementation 
of the death penalty and extends its application to crimes of killings for sorcery, aggravated 
rape and robbery. 
</p>
<p>14. Some States also introduced new legislation expanding the use of the death penalty 
for terrorism- related crimes. Nigeria adopted an amendment to its terrorism prevention law 
that prescribes the death penalty as punishment for a wide range of acts of terrorism.10 In 
the United States of America, the State of Mississippi adopted a new law which added acts 
of terrorism to the list of crimes that could lead to the application of death penalty.11 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Data on the use of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>15. In its resolution 67/176 (2012) on moratorium on the use of the death penalty, the 
General Assembly calls upon all States &#8220;To make available relevant information with 
regard to their use of the death penalty, <i>inter alia</i>, the number of persons sentenced to 
death, the number of persons on death row and the number of executions carried out, which 
can contribute to possible informed and transparent national and international debates, 
including on the obligations of States pertaining to the use of the death penalty&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. As noted by the Secretary-General in previous reports,12 up-to-date and accurate 
global figures on the application of the death penalty are difficult to obtain. This difficulty 
arises from the continued lack of transparency on the part of some Governments concerning 
the number and characteristics of individuals executed. The lack of transparency in death 
penalty cases is compounded in countries that have been affected by conflicts, where it may 
not be possible to obtain sufficient information to confirm the number of executions that 
may have taken place. Furthermore, the data on the use of the death penalty continues to be 
classified as a State secret in some States and the disclosure of such information considered 
a criminal offence.  
</p>
<p>17.  The Human Rights Committee continued to call upon States to take all necessary 
measures to guarantee accessibility of information on the death penalty.13 The Committee 
against Torture expressed deep concerns over the conditions of detention of prisoners on 
death row in Japan, with respect, <i>inter alia</i>, to the unnecessary secrecy and uncertainty 
surrounding the execution of prisoners sentenced to death. It noted that refusing to provide 
convicted persons and their family members advance notice of the date and time of 
execution is a clear human rights violation (CAT/C/JPN/CO/2, paragraph 15).14  
18. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions called on 
several States, including the Gambia and Iraq, to refrain from executing in secrecy.15

<p><b> IV.  Enforcement of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>19.  In 2012, an increased number of Member States of the United Nations supported the 
adoption of the fourth General Assembly resolution (A/67/176) on moratorium on the use 
of the death penalty.16 However, despite an encouraging international trend towards the 
universal abolition of the death penalty, a small number of States continue to use it. 
Reportedly, executions were carried out in at least 21 countries during the review period.  
</p>
<p>20. According to Amnesty International, at least 23,386 people remained under death 
sentence at the end of 2012 and at least 682 people were executed worldwide during that 
year, excluding China. In addition, 1,722 individuals were reportedly sentenced to death in 
58 countries.17  
</p>
<p>21. During the period under review, some States with a long-standing de facto 
moratorium resumed imposing the death penalty and carried out executions. After 27 years 
without any executions, the Gambia executed nine individuals in August 2012. In India, 
one execution was carried out in November 2012. This was India&#8217;s first execution since 
</p><p>2004. Pakistan carried out its first execution since 2007, also in November 2012, when its 
military authorities executed a soldier. In Indonesia, no execution took place between 2008 
and 2012, but in March 2013, one person was executed for drug-related crimes, and three 
more were executed in May 2013. These executions took place at a time when the use of 
the death penalty was under review by Indonesia&#8217;s national courts, and a public debate was 
ongoing in the country. Indonesia&#8217;s Attorney General also announced that 20 prisoners 
convicted and sentenced to death would be executed in 2013.18   
</p>
<p><b> V. Application of safeguards guaranteeing protection of the 
rights of those facing the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>22. The norms and standards  protecting the rights of those facing the death penalty are 
set out in international human rights law, in particular at article 6 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 37 (a) of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. Furthermore, in an annex to its resolution 1984/50, the Economic and Social 
Council set out minimum international standards that provide safeguards for guaranteeing 
protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty.19   
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions submitted 
a report on &#8220;Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221; to the General Assembly in 
2012 (A/67/275) which states, <i>inter alia</i>, that &#8220;in States in which the death penalty 
continues to be used, international law imposes stringent requirements that must be met for 
it not to be regarded as unlawful&#8221;. In its resolution 67/168, the General Assembly called on 
States to take into account the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in his 
reports regarding the need to respect all relevant safeguards and restrictions.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 In December 2012, General Assembly resolution A/67/176 on &#8220;moratorium on the use of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty&#8221; was adopted with a recorded vote of 111.

</p>
<p>19
 The Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/59, reaffirmed the importance of the 
</p>
<p>safeguards, as did the General Assembly in its resolutions 62/149, 63/168, 65/206 and 67/176. </p>


<p><b> A.  Restriction of use of the death penalty to &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p>24. Article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
prescribes that in States that have not abolished it, the death penalty may only be imposed 
for the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. This term has been interpreted to mean that the death penalty 
should only be applied to the crime of murder or intentional killing. The application of this 
safeguard in recent years has focused on the use of the death penalty for acts that do not 
meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. In particular, the use of the death penalty for 
drug-related offences, economic crimes, political crimes, adultery, and offences relating to 
consensual same-sex relationships, is a violation of article 6, paragraph 2, and of the 
safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty.20  
</p>
<p>25. The European Union (EU) adopted in April 2013 new revised and updated 
Guidelines on the Death Penalty.21 These guidelines have made a number of key 
clarifications to the minimum standards for States that still maintain the use of the death 
penalty, including narrowing the definition of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, while continuing to 
emphasize the EU&#8217;s strong opposition to the death penalty and advocating for its full 
abolition. The guidelines state that the death penalty must not be imposed for &#8220;non-violent 
acts&#8221;, and economic, political and drug-related crimes have been added to the list of 
offences that the death penalty should not be imposed for. 22   
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Use of the death penalty for drug-related offences 
</b></p>
<p>26. In accordance with the Human Rights Committee, drug-related offences do not meet 
the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;.23 Nevertheless, 33 countries or territories continue 
to retain the death penalty for drug-related offences in their legislation, though only a few 
of these countries actually impose and enforce this punishment.24  
</p>
<p>27. During the reference period, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran<b> </b>continued to raise concerns about the use of 
capital punishment in the country, including for crimes such as alcohol consumption and 
drug trafficking, which do not constitute serious crimes by international standards 
(A/67/369, paragraph 56).  Reportedly, executions for drug-related offences also took place 
and people were sentenced to death for such offences in several States, including China, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and 
Yemen.25 
</p>
<p>28. Human rights organizations expressed concerns about the international funding and 
technical assistance for drug control programmes in States that retain the death penalty for 
drug-related offences.26 According to these organizations, there is no persuasive evidence

<p>that the death penalty contributes more than any other punishment to eradicating drug 
trafficking or any other drug-related offences.27 
</p>
<p>29. In his report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, 
Summary or Arbitrary Executions emphasized that clear guidelines are needed to help 
States to engage in cooperative drug control efforts without departing from the human 
rights framework, including international standards on the use of death penalty (A/67/275, 
paragraphs 84-86). 
</p><p>30. Such guidelines are also being explicitly sought by regional organizations that are 
major donors with regard to drug control efforts. For example, in its December 2010 
resolution on the European Union&#8217;s annual report on human rights and democracy in the 
world, the European Parliament called upon the European Commission to develop 
guidelines governing international funding for country-level and regional drug enforcement 
activities.28   
</p>
<p>31. The European Union emphasized that &#8220;actions, such as legal, financial or other 
technical assistance to third countries, should not contribute to the use of the death 
penalty&#8221;.29  
</p>
<p>32.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) published a position 
paper in 2012 articulating its position on the promotion and protection of human rights as 
part of its work. Taking note of applicable international norms and standards, it stated that 
if &#8220;a country actively continues to apply the death penalty for drug offences, UNODC 
places itself in a very vulnerable position vis-&#224;-vis its responsibility to respect human rights 
if it maintains support to law enforcement units, prosecutors or courts within the criminal 
justice system&#8221;. It further noted that &#8220;at the very least, continued support in such 
circumstances can be perceived as legitimizing government action. If, following requests 
for guarantees and high-level political intervention, executions for drug-related offences 
continue, UNODC may have no choice but to employ a temporary freeze or withdrawal of 
support&#8221;.30 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Use of the death penalty for other crimes not involving intentional killings 
</b></p>
<p>33. The continued use of the death penalty for other crimes not involving intentional 
killings &#8211; such as economic and political crimes, robbery, blasphemy, witchcraft and 
sorcery &#8211; that do not constitute &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; under international human rights law 
remains a particular concern. The Islamic Republic of Iran continued to use the death 
penalty for so-called crimes of &#8220;<i>Moharebeh</i>&#8221; (&#8220;enmity against God&#8221;).31 In June 2012, four 
individuals were executed for &#8220;<i>Moharebeh</i>&#8221; in connection with alleged crimes committed

 <i>&#8220;Moharebeh&#8221;</i> is aimed at armed insurrection, or more generally, the resort of armed and violent 
</p>
<p>activities. Anyone found responsible for taking up arms, whether for criminal purposes or against the 
State, or even belonging to an organization taking up arms against the State, may be considered guilty 
of &#8220;enmity against God&#8221;. </p>


<p>during the widespread political protests in Khuzestan in the south-west region of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in 2011. In a joint statement issued in January 2013, a group of 
special procedure mandate holders of the Human Rights Council urged the Iranian 
authorities to halt the execution of five individuals belonging to the Ahwazi community 
who were at imminent risk of execution for charges including &#8220;<i>Moharebeh</i>&#8221;, &#8220;<i>Mufsid-fil-
Arz</i>&#8221; (&#8220;corruption on Earth&#8221;) and spreading propaganda against the system.32 
34. The Human Rights Committee regretted that Kenya imposes the death penalty for 
crimes such as robbery with violence, which do not qualify as &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; within 
the meaning of article 6, paragraph 2 of the Covenant (CCPR/C/KEN/CO/3, paragraph 10). 
The Committee against Torture remained concerned about the high number of offences that 
carry the death penalty in Cuba, including common crimes and vaguely defined categories 
of State security-related offences (CAT/C/CUB/CO/2, paragraph 14). 
35. In March 2013, the High Commissioner for Human Rights strongly condemned the 
execution of seven individuals in Saudi Arabia who were charged with organizing a 
criminal group, armed robbery and breaking into jewellery stores. The High Commissioner 
noted that such executions clearly violated international safeguards which stipulated that 
capital punishment may be imposed only for &#8220;the most serious crimes&#8221; and only after the 
most rigorous judicial process.33  
36. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief reported that persons 
belonging to religious minorities are frequently exposed to increased risks of 
criminalization and accusations of &#8220;blasphemy&#8221;, which in some countries carry harsh 
sanctions, including the death penalty (A/HRC/22/51, paragraph 53). The Special 
Rapporteur also reported that, in various regions of the world, converts are confronted with 
difficulties when trying to live in conformity with their convictions. Some States have 
criminal laws that impose the death penalty for acts of conversion (A/67/303, paragraph 36; 
A/HRC/22/51, paragraph 53).  
37. In 2012, individuals were reportedly charged in Pakistan for offences relating to 
religion, including under the &#8220;blasphemy&#8221; provisions of the Penal Code punishable by the 
death penalty.34  In the Islamic Republic of Iran, a Christian pastor who was sentenced to 
death for crime of &#8220;apostasy from Islam&#8221; in 2011 was retried, but finally acquitted in 
September 2012.35 
</p>
<p>38. The use of the death penalty in counter-terrorism cases is also a serious concern.  
Several States continued to use the death penalty for a broad range of acts related to crimes 
of terrorism which may not meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. The Government 
of Iraq maintained that it only executed individuals who committed terrorist acts or other 
serious crimes against civilians, and who were convicted under the Anti-Terrorism Law No. 
13 of 2005. However, the broad scope and wide application of article 4 of the Anti-
Terrorism Law of Iraq remains a serious concern, since it envisages the death penalty for a 
wide range of terrorism-related acts, not all of which meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious 
crimes&#8221;.

<p>39. The United Nations Political Office in Somalia reported that military courts in 
Puntland and Somaliland continued to impose the death penalty against individuals accused 
of a broad range of crimes provided under their anti-terrorism laws. For instance, in March 
2013, the Nugaal Military Court in Puntland sentenced to death two men who were accused 
of possession of explosives, wires and detonators under Section 7 of the Puntland Anti-
Terrorism Law of 2010. In April 2013, the military authority in Puntland executed 13 
individuals suspected of links with a terrorist organization. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Mandatory use of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>40. In accordance with international human rights jurisprudence, the mandatory use of 
the death penalty is not compatible with the limitation of capital punishment to the &#8220;most 
serious crimes&#8221;.36 However, mandatory death sentences continued to be imposed in 
Barbados, India, Malaysia, Maldives, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, and Trinidad and 
Tobago.37  
</p>
<p>41.  During the period under review, human rights treaty bodies continued to address the 
issue of mandatory death penalty. For instance, the Human Rights Committee 
recommended that Maldives remove mandatory death penalties from its statute 
(CCPR/C/MDV/CO/1, para.13).  
</p><p>42. In October 2012, the High Court of Lagos in Nigeria ruled that the mandatory 
imposition of the death penalty was unconstitutional. The Court declared that &#8220;the 
prescription of mandatory death penalty for offences such as armed robbery and murder 
contravenes the right of the applicants to dignity of human person and their right not to be 
subjected to inhuman or degrading punishment under S.34 of the constitution of the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria, 1999&#8221;.38 
</p>
<p>43. In January 2013, the High Court at Kisumu in Kenya ruled that the death penalty for 
robbery with violence and attempted robbery with violence should be interpreted as a 
discretionary, and not a mandatory, sentence. The Court held that the mandatory death 
sentence does not provide the individual concerned with an opportunity to mitigate and 
therefore attain a fair trial. 39 
</p>
<p>44.  In Uganda, a bill is reported to have been proposed to amend the Penal Code Act, 
the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces Act, which impose 
mandatory death penalty sentences. Efforts are also currently underway to develop 
sentencing<b> </b>guidelines intended to facilitate the exercise of judicial sentencing powers. In 
particular, the draft Guidelines include special rules of mitigation and encourage the death 
sentence to be issued only in exceptional circumstances.

<p><b> B.  Fair trial guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>45. Pursuant to Article 6(2) of ICCPR, the death penalty can only be imposed in 
accordance with laws which are &#8220;not contrary to the provisions of the present Covenant&#8221; 
and &#8220;pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a competent court&#8221;. During the reporting 
period, human rights treaty bodies continued to address issues of fair trial standards relating 
to the death penalty in their dialogue with State parties during the consideration of their 
periodic reports. For instance, in June 2012, the Committee against Torture expressed its 
serious reservations as to whether Cuba respected due process guarantees, such as the 
detainees&#8217; right to have adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence and to 
communicate with counsel of their choosing, in the last three executions that were carried 
out after a summary procedure in 2003. The Committee urged Cuba to respect the 
international norms established in the Safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of 
those facing the death penalty (CAT/C/CUB/CO/2, para.14). In May 2013, the Committee 
urged Japan to guarantee effective assistance by legal counsel for death row inmates at all 
stages of the proceedings, and the strict confidentiality of all meetings with their lawyers 
(CAT/C/JPN/CO/2, paragraph 15). 
</p><p>46. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has continued to express concerns about 
the lack of a fair trial in death penalty cases in a number of States. For instance, referring to 
reports in November 2012 about the imminent execution of eight people in Afghanistan, the 
High Commissioner emphasized that &#8220;those accused of capital offences must be effectively 
assisted by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings. Furthermore, executions should not 
take place when an appeal or other recourse is pending, and there must be the possibility for 
the individual concerned to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence.&#8221;40 With regard to 
executions in Iraq in April 2013, the High Commissioner noted that &#8220;the criminal justice 
system in Iraq was still not functioning adequately, with numerous convictions based on 
confessions obtained under torture and ill-treatment, a weak judiciary and trial proceedings 
that fall short of international standards. The application of the death penalty in these 
circumstances is unconscionable, as any miscarriage of justice as a result of capital 
punishment cannot be undone.&#8221;41 Referring to the execution of seven individuals in Saudi 
Arabia in April 2013, the High Commissioner expressed concerns that the accused men 
were reportedly not allowed to speak or given adequate opportunities to conduct their 
defence. Noting that the defendants were not present during the appeal stages and had no 
defence counsel representing them, the High Commissioner stated that such serious failings 
in the process would constitute violations of international safeguards in the use of death 
penalty, especially those related to the right to a fair trial and the right to appeal.42 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and other 
special procedure mandate holders of the Human Rights Council also urged several States, 
including Bangladesh,43 the Gambia,44 Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran45, Saudi Arabia46

<p>and Somalia47 to maintain stringent respect of due process and fair trial guarantees in death 
penalty cases.  
</p>
<p>48. National judiciaries also addressed the importance of fair trial standards in death 
penalty cases. For instance, in one case,48 the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court found that 
section 52(2) of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court Act, which sets a strict 14-day limit 
for filing appeals to the Court in capital cases, violated defendants&#8217; fair trial rights as 
guaranteed under Section 10 of the Constitution of Saint Kitts and Nevis and article 14 of 
ICCPR, including adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence.  
</p>
<p>49. Human rights organizations also reported on trials of capital cases that did not meet 
the requirements of fair trial. For instance, Amnesty International remained concerned that 
&#8220;in a minority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death 
penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards&#8221;.49 
The Death Penalty Project, in collaboration with the Centre for Prisoners&#8217; Rights, published 
a report that noted Japan&#8217;s failure to meet its requirements under international human rights 
law, <i>inter alia</i>, in relation to fair trial guarantees.50 The International Federation of Human 
Rights published a report on the use of the death penalty in the Democratic Peoples&#8217; 
Republic of Korea in which it noted the systematic denial of the right to a fair trial in death 
penalty cases.51   
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to consular services for foreign nationals 
</b></p>
<p>50. Access to consular services is an important aspect of the protection of those foreign 
nationals facing the death penalty. In its report on &#8220;The Death Penalty in the Inter-
American Human Rights System: From Restrictions to Abolition&#8221;, the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights has examined issues related to due process concerning the 
failure to comply with the notification requirements of the Vienna Convention on Consular 
Relations in the execution of foreign nationals in the United States.52  
</p>
<p>51. In the United States of America, a draft bill entitled &#8216;&#8216;Consular Notification 
Compliance Act of 2011&#8217;&#8217; is currently being reviewed by Congress. This legislation would 
provide for the judicial review and reconsideration of claims of foreign nationals sentenced 
to capital crimes without having received consular notification and access.53 
</p>
<p>52. The new EU Guidelines on the death penalty state that, when considering whether 
legal proceedings provide all possible safeguards to ensure a fair trial, due attention should 
be given to whether anyone suspected of or charged with a crime for which capital 
punishment may be imposed has been informed of the right to contact a consular 
representative.

<p><b> D.  Clemency, pardon or commutation  
</b></p>
<p>53. Article 6(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that 
anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the 
sentence. Article 4(6) of the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights and the 
Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of those facing the Death Penalty contain 
a similar provision stating that capital punishment shall not be imposed while such a 
petition is pending decision by the competent authority. 
</p>
<p>54. During the period under review, Amnesty International recorded pardons or 
commutations of death sentences in 27 States.54 In the United States of America, the 
Governor of Colorado granted an indefinite stay of execution to a death row prisoner. In his 
Executive Order, the governor expressed concern about the State&#8217;s death penalty system, 
calling it flawed and inequitable.55 The Supreme Court of India commuted the death 
sentence of an individual to life imprisonment on the grounds that &#8220;12 years delay in the 
disposal of the appellant&#8217;s mercy petition was sufficient for commutation of the sentence of 
death&#8221;.56 Fifty-five death sentences were commuted in Guatemala after the Criminal 
Division of the Supreme Court of Justice reviewed the cases of death penalty prisoners in 
the country.57 In Zambia, 113 death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment by the 
President.58  
</p>
<p><b> E. Prohibition of extradition, expulsion or deportation in the death penalty 
cases 
</b></p>
<p>55. In accordance with the jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee, an individual 
may not be extradited, expelled or deported to a country where there is a &#8220;necessary and 
forcible threat&#8221; that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will be 
violated.59  
</p>
<p>56. During the period under review, the issue of the prohibition of extradition, expulsion 
or deportation of individuals who may face the death penalty to a third country was 
addressed by international, regional and national mechanisms. For instance, the Human 
Rights Committee welcomed the actions of the judiciary in Macao, China in blocking the 
transfer of a person to mainland China. However, it was concerned that, despite its previous 
recommendation to that effect (CCPR/C/79/Add.115, paragraph 14), Macao, China had not 
adopted any specific regulation regarding the transfer of offenders from Macao, China to 
mainland China to protect those persons against the risk of death penalty or ill-treatment 
upon return (CCPR/C/CHN-MAC/CO/1, paragraph 11).  
</p><p>57. In a judgment, adopted in 25 September 2012,  the European Court of Human Rights 
recalled that Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights, taken together 
with obligations under Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Convention, prohibits a member State of 
the Council of Europe from detaining individuals with a view to extraditing them to stand

<p>trial on capital charges or in any way subjecting individuals within its jurisdiction to a real 
risk of being sentenced to the death penalty and executed.60 
</p>
<p>58. In South Africa, the Constitutional Court decided that the Government is not entitled 
to deport or extradite a person charged with a capital offence in a country seeking his 
extradition, after having sought and been refused a written assurance from the extraditing 
State that the death penalty will not be imposed, or, if imposed, will not be executed.61 
</p>
<p><b> F. Methods of execution  
</b></p>
<p>59.  In his report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur on Torture noted that 
there is no categorical evidence that any method of execution in use today complies with 
the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Even if the required 
safeguards are in place, all methods of execution currently used can inflict inordinate pain 
and suffering. States cannot guarantee that there is a pain-free method of execution 
(A/67/279, paragraph 41). 
</p><p>60.  During the reference period, the international charity organization Reprieve 
reported on a continued shortage of drugs available for use in lethal injections worldwide.  
This is due to several key developments, including: export controls placed on the drugs 
used for lethal injections adopted by the European Commission in December 2010 and by 
some individual States; and worldwide distribution control rules adopted by a number of 
pharmaceutical companies to prevent their drugs from being used in executions. In the 
United States of America, shortages of the &#8220;traditional&#8221; lethal injection drugs are reported 
to have led a number of States to change their protocols and use new drugs. The use of 
previously untested drugs in executions raises concerns about the pain and suffering 
inflicted on person concerned, which potentially may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman 
or degrading punishment.62  
</p>
<p>61. During the period under review, public executions were reportedly carried out in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Saudi 
Arabia and Somalia. Special procedure mandate holders of the Human Rights Council 
repeatedly condemned public executions. For instance, with regard to public executions 
carried out in the Islamic Republic of Iran in January 2013, the Special Rapporteurs on the 
human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran, on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions and on torture stated that &#8220;executions in public add to the already cruel, 
inhuman and degrading nature of the death penalty and can only have a dehumanizing 
effect on the victim and a brutalizing effect on those who witness the execution&#8221;.63

<p><b> VI. Use of the death penalty against children, persons with 
mental or intellectual disabilities and other vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Children  
</b></p>
<p>62. In accordance with Article 37 (a) of the Convention of the Rights of the Child and 
Article 6 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the death penalty 
cannot be imposed for offences committed by persons below 18 years of age. General 
Assembly resolutions on Human Rights in the Administration of Justice (67/166) and on 
moratorium on the use of the death penalty (67/176), both adopted in 2012, reaffirmed this 
principle. 
</p>
<p>63. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and human rights organizations 
reported that several States, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and 
Yemen, are known to have executed children in the past year. In accordance with the Child 
Rights International Network (CRIN), 15 countries continued to maintain the death penalty 
for children in their legislation during the reference period.64  
</p>
<p>64. During the period under review, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on Violence against Children continued her global advocacy for the prevention and 
elimination of all forms of violence against children, including the risks of death penalty. 
Through advocacy and policy dialogue with Member States, the Special Representative 
placed special emphasis on the enactment of national legislation banning capital 
punishment and all forms of violence against children and called on States to take all 
necessary measures to immediately suspend the execution of all death penalties imposed for 
crimes committed by persons below the age of 18. The abolition of the death penalty has 
also been identified as a critical area of concern in the &#8220;Joint report of the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children on 
prevention of and responses to violence against children within the juvenile justice system&#8221;, 
to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/21/25).  
</p><p>65. In some States, the lack of birth registration and difficulties in determining the age 
of children leave unenforced the explicit prohibition of the death penalty for persons under 
18 at the time of offence. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence 
against Children recommended that, where it is not possible to conclusively determine the 
age of the child at the time of offence, she or he should be presumed to be below 18. All 
these cases should be reviewed in full conformity with international human rights norms 
and standards.65 
</p>
<p>66.   Human Rights Watch published a report entitled &#8220;Look at Us with a Merciful Eye&#8221;, 
which discusses cases of juvenile offenders who are awaiting execution in Yemen, and 
recommends, <i>inter alia</i>, that the President of Yemen &#8220;order a review of all death sentences 
where there is doubt that the individual was at least 18 at the time of offence&#8221;, and 
&#8220;commute all sentences when evidence regarding an offender&#8217;s age remains 
inconclusive.&#8221;66

<p><b> B.  Persons with mental or intellectual disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>67. In accordance with  international human rights norms and standards, the imposition 
of the death penalty is prohibited &#8220;for persons suffering from mental retardation or 
extremely limited mental competence, whether at the stage of sentence or execution&#8221;,67 as 
well as &#8220;for persons suffering from mental retardation or extremely limited mental 
competence&#8221;.68  
</p>
<p>68. In the Caribbean region, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and domestic 
courts continued to restrict the implementation of the death penalty, specifically in relation 
to those with mental illnesses or impairment. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council 
has delivered judgments on appeal in two capital cases69 where prisoners were sentenced to 
the mandatory death penalty in Trinidad and Tobago. In each of these cases, fresh medical 
evidence (psychiatric and psychological) was admitted and the cases were remitted to the 
Court of Appeal in Trinidad and Tobago for further hearing. In another case,70 the Eastern 
Caribbean Court of Appeal also admitted new psychiatric evidence. The conviction for 
murder was quashed and substituted with manslaughter, on the grounds of diminished 
responsibility, and a life imprisonment was imposed.  
</p>
<p>69. According to the Death Penalty Information Centre, around a quarter of those 
executed or scheduled to be executed in 2012 in the United States of America showed signs 
of severe mental illness.71  Moreover, it is estimated that between 5 and 10 per cent of 
inmates on death row suffer from severe mental illness.72 In July 2012, the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions urged the Government of the 
United States of America and relevant authorities to prevent the execution of two 
individuals with psychosocial disabilities. He emphasized that &#8220;it was a violation of death 
penalty safeguards to impose capital punishment on individuals suffering from 
psychosocial disabilities&#8221;.73 In August 2012, the State of Texas executed an individual with 
a significant intellectual disability.  
</p>
<p>70. The Committee against Torture expressed concerns about reports on the execution of 
individuals with mental illness in Japan, in contradiction with article 479(1) of its Code of 
Criminal Procedures which prohibits the execution of &#8220;a detainee in a state of insanity&#8221;. 
The Committee urged Japan to ensure that death row inmates were afforded all legal 
safeguards and protections, <i>inter alia</i>, by ensuring &#8220;an independent review of all cases 
when there is credible evidence that death row inmate is mentally ill&#8221;, and also to ensure 
that any &#8220;detainee with a mental illness is not executed, in accordance with article 479(1) of 
its Code of Criminal Procedures&#8221;.74 
</p>
<p><b> C. Discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>71. In practice, the decision whether to sentence the convict to death or life

<p>of the death penalty is frequently discriminatory.  It is often used disproportionately against 
the poor and members of racial, ethnic, religious and sexual minority groups.  
</p>
<p>72. The new EU Guidelines on the death penalty emphasize that the death penalty must 
not be applied or used in a discriminatory manner on any ground, including political 
affiliation, sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual 
orientation. 
</p>
<p>73. During the reference period, Islamic Republic of Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, 
Sudan and Yemen continued to retain laws providing the imposition of the death penalty 
against those found guilty of offences relating to consensual, adult, same-sex relationships 
that do not meet threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;.  In addition, local and regional courts 
in some parts of Somalia and Nigeria continued to have power to impose the death penalty 
for such offences on the basis of the Sharia law.75  While no execution in cases involving 
consensual same-sex conduct was confirmed in the past year, the mere existence of these 
laws has a terrorizing effect on an entire community and, as in other places where 
homosexual relationships are criminalized, also reinforces stigma, and fuels discrimination 
and violence against anyone perceived to be gay or lesbian. In Uganda, a bill remains 
before Parliament, which, if passed in its present form, would allow for the imposition of 
the death penalty in cases of so-called &#8220;aggravated homosexuality&#8221; &#8211; including against 
repeat offenders and those who are HIV-positive. 
</p>
<p>74. The Centre for Migrant Workers reported that foreign nationals and migrant workers 
remained disproportionately affected by the death penalty in several States.76 With regard to 
the execution of a foreign national in Saudi Arabia, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of migrants stated that &#8220;given the large number of women migrant domestic workers 
in Saudi Arabia it is of paramount importance that transparent laws are put in place to 
ensure that all procedural rights and guarantees are afforded to all persons in Saudi Arabia, 
no matter their migration status or nationality.&#8221;77

<p><b> VII. Human rights of children of parents sentenced to the death 
penalty or executed 
</b></p>
<p>75. Murder Victims&#8217; Families for Human Rights &#8211; a group of family members of 
murder victims &#8211; maintains that &#8220;the death penalty does not help to heal and is not the way 
to pursue justice for victims&#8221;. In addition, it argued that the families of the executed can 
also be viewed as victims under the United Nations Declaration of Universal Principles of 
Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of State Power.78  
</p>
<p>76. In a resolution adopted in March 2013, the Human Rights Council acknowledges the 
negative impact of a parent&#8217;s death sentence and his or her execution on their children, and urges States to provide those children with the protection and assistance they may require. 
It also calls upon States to provide those children, or, where appropriate giving due 
consideration to the best interests of the child, another member of the family, with access to 
their parents and to all relevant information about the situation of their parents 
(A/HRC/RES/22/11).

<p>77. The Quaker United Nations Office reported that, according to academic and policy 
studies,79 children can suffer change or deterioration in their living situation and conditions, 
relationship with others and physical and mental well-being following parental 
incarceration. There is a growing body of evidence that documents the specific and serious 
mental health implications of capital punishment, in particular for children of persons 
sentenced to death. Those children suffer a uniquely traumatic, profoundly complicated and 
socially isolating loss often combined with social ostracism.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII.  Conclusions 
</b>78.<b> Developments on the question of the death penalty during the reporting period 
suggest that the trend towards abolition is continuing. However, numerous concerns 
remain with regard to respect for relevant international human rights norms and 
standards in States where the death penalty is still imposed. Until it is fully abolished, 
retentionist States must ensure that the death penalty is imposed only for those crimes 
that involve intentional killing. It should not be imposed for drug-related offences and 
any other ordinary crime that does not meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. 
The mandatory death penalty is not compatible with the limitation of the use of the 
death penalty only to &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. States should abolish the mandatory 
death penalty, where it still exists. States must also ensure that the highest level of 
compliance with fair trial and other international human rights norms and standards 
are met in all death penalty cases. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> States should amend national laws on extradition and deportation to 
specifically prohibit the enforced transfer of persons to States where there is a genuine 
risk that the death penalty may be imposed in violation of internationally recognized 
standards, unless adequate assurances are obtained that the death penalty will not be 
carried out.</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The lack of data on the number of executions or individuals on death row is a 
serious impediment to international and national debates that may lead to the 
abolition of capital punishment. It will also be important for the effectiveness and 
transparency of such a debate to ensure that the public has access to balanced 
information, including accurate information and statistics on criminality and the 
various effective ways to combat it, without resorting to capital punishment. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> There is an also urgent need to examine the effects of the capital punishment 
system in its entirety, including the social, economic and psychological impact on the 
children of those executed or under death sentence.  </b>
