<p><b>  Forced returns of Haitians from third states</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>Established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1995/70 and with 
Presidential Statement PRST/15/1, the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in 
Haiti submits this Addendum to his annual report to the Council at its twentieth session.  
</p>
<p>Since the 12 January 2010 earthquake, several international bodies, including the 
Independent Expert, have urged UN member states to suspend forced returns to Haiti because 
of the ongoing humanitarian crisis.  Despite the international community&#8217;s appeals, several 
UN member States have forcibly returned Haitian nationals to Haiti since the earthquake, 
placing these individuals in a vulnerable, life-threatening position and placing additional 
burden on Haiti.  Due to the government&#8217;s instability, the shortage of resources in Haiti, the 
conditions under which forcibly-returned individuals are detained, and the severe 
humanitarian consequences &#8211; including separation of family members and exposure to deadly 
diseases &#8211; the Independent Expert is deeply concerned that the forced return of these 
individuals may constitute human rights violations.   
</p>
<p>In light of these concerns, the Independent Expert renews his call upon UN member 
States to suspend all forced returns to Haiti. In the event that States decide to forcibly return 
Haitian nationals to Haiti, they should, at a minimum, and in accordance with their 
international legal obligations, 1) take humanitarian factors into consideration when making 
decisions concerning forced returns, and 2) ensure adequate reintegration and support services 
for individuals forcibly returned to Haiti.  The Independent Expert has learned that some 
member States that are forcibly returning individuals to Haiti may not be following these 
obligations, raising serious concerns about the rights to life, health, dignity, family, due 
process, and access to justice.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Since the 12 January 2010 earthquake, several United Nations bodies, including the 
Independent Expert, have issued joint emergency appeals to States to suspend forced 
returns to Haiti.  On 12 February 2010 and 18 February 2010, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) issued a joint emergency appeal to countries to suspend all forced returns to 
Haiti because of the ongoing humanitarian crisis: &#8213;pending stabilization and until such time 
</p>
<p>as people can return safely and sustainably, HCHR and HCR call on all countries not to 
return Haitians at this time and to continue granting interim protection measures on 
humanitarian grounds&#8214;.1   
</p>
<p>2. In his 31 May 2010 report,2 the Independent Expert reported that despite the 
OHCHR/UNHCR joint appeals, some countries had terminated their reception programmes 
implemented in the wake of the earthquake, and had begun to send irregular migrants back 
to Haiti. Additionally, States whose territories lie in geographic proximity to Haiti had 
resumed interdictions on the high seas of large numbers of migrants and returned these 
individuals to Haiti. The Independent Expert urged that this was not the right time to inflict 
on Haiti the burden of the return of so many migrants trying to escape Haiti&#8217;s harsh post-
earthquake conditions. 
</p>
<p>3. In his 4 April 2011 report,3 the Independent Expert reiterated his recommendation to 
suspend forced returns to Haiti in light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the 
Independent Expert urged States &#8213;to adopt a flexible and generous attitude toward Haitians 
</p>
<p>seeking refuge in other countries&#8214;,4 and recommended that those States choosing to forcibly 
return Haitian nationals should ensure that returns comply with States&#8217; international legal 
obligations. 
</p>
<p>4. The OHCHR and UNHCR jointly issued an updated return advisory on 9 June 2011 
urging States to &#8213;refrain from conducting returns to Haiti&#8214; on humanitarian grounds. It 
appeals &#8213;to Governments to renew...residence permits and other mechanisms that allow 
</p>
<p>Haitians to remain [outside Haiti]&#8214;, and requested that Governments &#8213;[g]ive special 
</p>
<p>consideration and refrain from returning to Haiti persons with special protection needs...; 
[p]revent situations where returns lead to the separation of family members; [v]erify the 
nationality of persons of Haitian origin when doubts arise to nationality; [e]nsure that 
forced returns [if they take place] are undertaken in a humane manner, in full respect for 
human rights and dignity, and with adequate advance notification provided to the 
competent Haitian authorities&#8230;.&#8214;<footnote name="5">6. Those specifically named in the OHCHR/UNHCR joint advisory are particularly 
vulnerable to human rights violations in Haiti.  For example, unaccompanied and separated 
minors do not have access to the protections and assistance provided by family members.  
They are especially vulnerable to generalized and targeted violence; inadequate food, 
housing and medical care; and are unable to protect themselves from the harsh environment 
of Haiti.  Persons with disabilities and medical conditions are vulnerable due to insufficient 
access to medicine and medical care in Haiti.   
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>5. On 4 February and 11 May 2011, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
(IACHR) issued similar guidance, &#8213;urg[ing] the United States to suspend deportations to 
Haiti of persons of Haitian origin who are seriously ill or who have family members in the

<p>United States.&#8214; The Commission issued precautionary measures on behalf of named Haitian 
nationals subject to immediate deportation by the United States.6   
</p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert has conducted site visits to Haiti from 28 August to 9 
September 2011 and from 31 January to 8 February 2012, during which time he 
investigated the issue of forced returns of Haitian nationals to Haiti from third States. On 11 
November 2011, the Independent Expert sent a questionnaire requesting information from 
UN member States concerning forced returns to Haiti. 
</p>
<p>7. In the present Addendum, the Independent Expert reports on measures taken by 
States regarding forced returns of Haitians and the effect of these returns on Haiti. This 
Addendum synthesizes and analyses information from site visits, State responses to the 
questionnaire, and independent research concerning forced returns from third States.7  
</p>
<p><b>  The severe and ongoing humanitarian crisis in Haiti 
</b></p>
<p>8. As described in the Independent Expert&#8217;s 2012 main report8, the humanitarian crisis 
following the 12 January 2010 earthquake is severe and ongoing, placing a great burden on 
Haiti.  There are significant health and other issues: a continued cholera outbreak and 
insufficient access to food, water, housing, medicine, and medical treatment for the general 
population.  Poverty and increasing violent crime exacerbate the deplorable conditions in 
Haiti. Gender-based violence is of particular concern, especially in tent camps. Like others, 
deportees face these conditions. Many confront additional barriers, such as language and 
cultural barriers, social stigma, and little or no family support in Haiti.  
</p>
<p>9. Displacement and safety is a continuing grave concern. In recent months violent 
crime in Haitian shantytowns has been on the rise; February 2012 had the highest murder 
per capita since 20069.  As of February 2012, more than 500,000 individuals are still living 
in tent camps,10 presenting serious sanitary and safety concerns.  While this number is a 
decrease from the peak of 1.5 million tent camp inhabitants following the earthquake, it 
does not adequately describe the housing crisis, which is compounded by a wave of illegal 
and often violent evictions which are forcing people out of camps and communities, and 
into conditions that are potentially even worse.  
</p>
<p>10. Gender-based violence was a serious problem prior to the earthquake and has 
remained a serious problem subsequently, particularly in tent camps.  The already-limited

<p>prevention and response mechanisms in place before January 2010 were greatly 
undermined by the earthquake11. 
</p>
<p>11. Persons forcibly returned to Haiti face the prospect of living in camps &#8211; especially 
those with little or no family in Haiti.  These individuals also face other barriers: they have 
difficulty finding employment due to stigma and inability to quickly access national 
identity cards; many do not speak Haitian Creole and have lived the vast majority of their 
lives in the sending country; and many have little or no family support system in Haiti.  
Some of those returned or deported to Haiti have never been to Haiti because they were 
born in other countries. 
</p>
<p>12. The ongoing humanitarian crisis raises concern about both the human rights and 
dignity of those returned as well as the burden that such returns place on the Haitian state to 
support additional persons, many of whom have little connection (cultural, linguistic, 
family ties) to Haiti.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Questionnaire and terminology 
</b></p>
<p>13. The questionnaire sent to UN member states by the Independent Expert asked States 
to respond to questions (1) concerning the number of returns/deportations of Haitian 
nationals since 12 January 2010; (2) the legal and administrative framework &#8211; including the 
availability of appeals &#8211; that applies to Haitian nationals with irregular migratory status or 
subject to forced removal; (3) specific legal, administrative or other measures taken to 
address the specific circumstances of Haitians &#8211; especially those belonging to vulnerable 
groups; and (4) follow-up measures to ensure returnees&#8217; adequate reintegration in Haiti.  
</p>
<p>14. UN member states have used varying language in their responses to the 
questionnaire with regard to characterizing such forced returns, including &#8213;deportation,&#8214; 
</p>
<p>&#8213;return,&#8214; &#8213;repatriation,&#8214; and/or &#8213;removal.&#8214;  Similarly, as described below, the various UN 
</p>
<p>treaty monitoring bodies, UNHCR, and OHCHR have used this varying terminology to 
refer to the same phenomenon.  
</p>
<p>15. For this report, the term &#8213;forced returns&#8214; will primarily be employed to refer to the 
practice of a State expelling individuals from that country, against their will, whom are 
lawfully or unlawfully present there, regardless of grounds for their return.  The terms 
&#8213;deportee&#8214; and &#8213;returnee&#8214; &#8211;individuals who were forcibly returned to Haiti &#8211; are used 
interchangeably.      
</p>
<p><b> III. State responses to the questionnaire  
</b></p>
<p>16. The Independent Expert thanks those UN member states that responded to the 
questionnaire on the issue of forced returns of Haitians from third States: Brazil, Costa 
Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Lebanon, Mexico, Paraguay, Romania, Slovenia, the 
Slovak Republic, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The information 
from these responses is incorporated in this report.  Unfortunately, some States did not 
include information on the situation in their overseas territories, and others &#8211; including 
States that regularly forcibly return Haitian nationals &#8211; did not respond to the questionnaire 
altogether. States&#8217; failure to respond leaves the Independent Expert with an incomplete data 
</p>
<p>set that must be filled in with secondary source research.

</p>
<p>17. Some States do not keep adequate records of individuals removed to Haiti. It is 
important that UN member States keep records of the number of individuals removed to 
Haiti and disaggregate data based on sex, age, date of removal, medical conditions, country 
of birth and ties to Haiti to ensure these individuals are guaranteed adequate protections and 
human rights safeguards.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Forced returns and deportations to Haiti after 12 January 
2010  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Specific legislative and administrative frameworks concerning forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>return of Haitian nationals by states immediately following the 12 
</b></p>
<p><b>January 2010 earthquake 
</b></p>
<p>18. According to responses to the questionnaire and information gathered from other 
sources, following the 12 January 2010 earthquake, some States &#8211; including Canada, 
France, Mexico, and the United States &#8211; halted all forced returns to Haiti for humanitarian 
reasons.   
</p>
<p>19. Other countries relaxed their policies and/or practices of forced returns for a limited 
period of time. The Bahamas temporarily suspended for a &#8213;short period&#8214; the forced returns 
</p>
<p>of Haitian nationals,12 announcing that Haitians without legal status would be released from 
detention centers and given temporary legal status.13 Likewise, the Dominican Republic 
announced it would stop deporting Haitians who entered the country illegally, and for the 
year following the earthquake, forced returns appear to have reduced.14  Jamaica indicated 
that Haitians arriving on Jamaican shores would not be turned away.15  Turks and Caicos, a 
British overseas territory, also temporarily suspended forced returns of Haitian nationals, 
following the same policy as the United States and the Bahamas of not deporting people 
who were already in the country on 12 January 2010 but returning those who arrived after 
that date. 16  However, none of these States/territories responded to the questionnaire of the 
Independent Expert, so it is either unclear whether returns were halted in practice or 
whether returns continued, as independent reports indicate.  
</p>
<p>20. On 13 January 2010, France suspended removals to Haiti.17  According to the French 
response to the questionnaire, family reunification requests have been granted, without 
delay and without a temporary visa, allowing family members to come to France.  Haitian

12 January 2010, have received new temporary residency permits.   
</p>
<p>21. Canada refrained from forcibly returning individuals to Haiti before the January 
2010 earthquake: in 2004, Canada imposed a Temporary Suspension of Removals (TSR) on 
Haitian nationals.18  The TSR program, which allows the government to interrupt removals 
to a country when the general conditions could seriously endanger the lives or safety of the 
entire population, remains in effect as of the date of publication of this report.19 TSR does 
not apply to individuals who choose to voluntarily return, those who are viewed as a 
security threat, or those who have a criminal record or conviction.20  Canada halted all 
removals to Haiti on January 13, 2010, including for individuals who do not qualify for 
TSR.21  
</p>
<p>22. On 3 March 2010, Mexico reiterated its pledge to halt deportations and its 
commitment to expediting humanitarian visas for Haitians with family ties to Mexico.22 As 
of 27 April 2010, 324 Haitians had relocated to Mexico.23 
</p>
<p>23. In January 2010, the United States designated Haiti for temporary protected status 
(TPS), allowing temporary immigration relief for eligible Haitian nationals who were 
physically present in the United States as of 12 January 2010. Countries are designated for 
TPS &#8213;due to conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country&#8217;s nationals from 
</p>
<p>returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the 
return of its nationals adequately.&#8214;24 Additionally, the United States temporarily suspended 
certain regulatory requirements, permitting qualifying nonimmigrant Haitian students to 
obtain employment authorization, granted humanitarian parole to Haitian orphans, and 
released and granted discretionary stays of removal to Haitians with final removal orders. 
The TPS program has been extended through 22 January 2013, and also applies to eligible 
Haitians who arrived in the United States before 12 January 2011. TPS does not apply to 
Haitian nationals with convictions in U.S. courts for at least two misdemeanors or one 
felony.25 Currently 55,604 Haitians hold TPS benefits and are not subject to removal.26  
</p>
<p>24. In response to the questionnaire, several states &#8211; including Costa Rica, Denmark, 
Germany, Paraguay, Romania, Lebanon, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia &#8211; reported not 
conducting forced returns to Haiti since the earthquake.27  It is unclear however, if any of

Haiti and taken measures to provide relief to Haiti, given the dire situation there.

<p><b> B. Despite the humanitarian crisis, several states resumed forced removals 
</b></p>
<p><b>to Haiti in 2010 and 2011: Legal framework and state practice 
</b></p>
<p>26. Some States/territories that returned individuals to Haiti since 12 January 2010 had 
previously halted or decreased forced returns for humanitarian reasons, including the 
Bahamas, Canada, the Dominican Republic, France, Jamaica, Mexico, and the United 
States.30   
</p>
<p>27. Media reports indicate that the Bahamas forcibly returned approximately 906 
Haitians between mid-February 2010 and mid-September 2010,31 indicating that forced 
returns were resumed as early as one month following the earthquake.  In this same time 
period, 102 Haitians were given permits &#8213;to reside&#8214; in the Bahamas.32  From January 2011 
to November 2011, 2,117 Haitians were returned,33 bringing the total of forced returns to at 
least 3,023 in the two years since the earthquake.   
</p>
<p>28. Canada resumed removals to Haiti on May 4, 2011; however, TSR remains in 
effect.34  Canada reports deporting 90 individuals to Haiti between 12 January 2010 and 
December 2011.35  Canada&#8217;s Regulation 230(1) provides that the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration may impose a stay of removal orders to a country or place if the 
circumstances in that country or place pose a generalized risk to the entire population as a 
result of, inter alia, an environmental disaster resulting in a substantial temporary disruption 
of living conditions or any situation that is temporary and generalized. 36 However, some 
individuals may qualify for exceptions to the stay, for instance, &#8213;on the grounds of serious 
</p>
<p>criminality&#8230;&#8214;37 
</p>
<p>29. Generally, all those subject to removal in Canada may apply for a Pre-Removal Risk 
Assessment, which examines whether the individual would be at risk of persecution and/or 
cruel and unusual punishment or a risk to their life before they are returned. Humanitarian 
factors cannot be considered unless the person has filed an application for permanent 
residence on humanitarian grounds. According to civil society organizations, there is no

<p>guarantee that a humanitarian application will be considered prior to a removal from 
Canada.  Persons who are found to be inadmissible, for instance, for &quot;serious criminality&quot; 
are barred from having the grounds of risk of persecution considered.38  Civil society 
organizations report that the removal of persons to Haiti can include persons who have 
committed minor crimes; those who have family, including children, in Canada; those who 
have lived in Canada most of their lives; those who have no family in Haiti nor any 
knowledge of the country; and those who face health and other risks. 
</p>
<p>30. With regard to the Dominican Republic, according to NGO documentation,39 
between January and December 2011, approximately 9,700 individuals were documented 
as removed to Haiti across the border in the Belladere/Elias Pi&#241;a and Malpasse/Jiman&#237; 
regions;40 many more undocumented forced removals are suspected.  While there is no 
clear data on the number of forced removals from the northern region of the Dominican 
Republic in this period, NGOs estimate at least 20,000 individuals were forcibly removed &#8211; 
a similar number to forced removals that occurred prior to the earthquake.41  As described 
below, many of those who are forcibly returned by the Dominican Republic to Haiti are 
Dominican nationals of Haitian descent. Commentators have noted that the Dominican 
Republic has &#8213;tak[en] its cue&#8214; from the United States, resuming forced removals of 
</p>
<p>Haitians shortly following the resumption of U.S. forced returns in January 2011.42  
</p>
<p>31. The Dominican Republic regularly subjects Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian 
descent to expulsions and forced removals without due process of law, the opportunity to 
collect and present identity documents, obtain or communicate with counsel, and/or appear 
before a judge or magistrate prior to their forced return across the border to Haiti.43  The 
New York Times reported that since the earthquake, &#8213;[t]he [Dominican] police and military 
near the border, with little more to go on than darker skin color and a failure to produce 
identification, have stopped cars and buses and forced them to Haiti.&#8214;44  These individuals 
are generally detained and then taken by bus across the border to Haiti, without the 
opportunity to contact family members or gather their possessions or money.45  Frequently, 
multiple homes in a given Haitian community will be robbed en masse immediately 
following these roundups, leading many NGOs to suspect a coordinated effort on the part of 
the Dominican militias to deport and plunder homes simultaneously.46 
</p>
<p>32. Forcible returns without the opportunity to gather possessions or money causes 
additional problems for vulnerable persons, especially women.  For example, one young 
woman was forcibly returned to Haiti and dropped off in a region a great distance from her 
previous residence.47  She was not permitted to gather any belongings or money in the 
Dominican Republic before being forcibly returned, and her only way to get money for bus

<p>fare was to have sex with two Dominican officials.48   If she had not gotten to a safe place 
before nightfall, she would have been alone in an unfamiliar place and in a highly 
vulnerable position.  
</p>
<p>33. Documented examples of expulsions from the Dominican Republic abound. On 8 
February 2012, 94 individuals of Haitian descent, including 62 men, 14 women, and 18 
children were forcibly removed from the Dominican Republic to Haiti.49 Similarly, 
Amnesty International reports that on 20 September 2011, Dominican authorities drove 80 
Haitian migrants across the border to Haiti from the Dominican Republic without having 
their cases individually examined and without the opportunity to appeal against the decision 
to return them to Haiti.50  Some of these individuals were beaten and children were 
separated from their parents.51  
</p>
<p>34. France reports forcibly returning 5 individuals to Haiti from the French &#8213;m&#233;tropole&#8214; 
between January 2010 and November 2011. In total there were 55 returns to Haiti from the 
m&#233;tropole, 31 of which were voluntary, 18 of which were aided by the French, and the 
remaining 5 of which were forced and 1 of which was a readmission to one of the European 
States. Deportations from French overseas territories Martinique and Guadeloupe resumed 
following the January 2010 moratorium.52  The French Government noted, that &#8213;[i]t has 
been decided to allow the Governors of the two Departments [Martinique, Guadeloupe] and 
Guyana to remove Haitians in irregular situations [illegals] to their country, giving as 
instructed, accordance [to the recognized standard] of the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and the High Commissioner for Refugees, to not apply these laws to the 
weak, while also considering the state of health, age, and the eventual isolation from one&#8217;s 
country.&#8214;53  The French Government justifies the end of the moratorium, which occurred in 
June 2011, on the grounds that &#8213;the migratory situation in the Departments of Martinique 
</p>
<p>and Guadeloupe has degraded because of the arrival of many clandestine Haitians.&#8214;54 
</p>
<p>35. From the French overseas departments, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and French 
Guyana, France reports that 455 individuals have been returned to Haiti. From the French 
response, it is unclear how many individuals were removed from each territory, and 
whether these removals were voluntary. NGOs report, however, that 50 individuals have 
been forcibly removed from Guadeloupe between June 2011 and 15 February 2012. In the 
same period, 78 individuals have had &#8213;the obligation to leave Guadeloupe.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>36. It is unclear how many individuals have been returned from Jamaica during this time 
period.  News sources report 67 Haitian asylum seekers were returned in March 2010,55 
indicating that returns from Jamaica began as little as six weeks after the earthquake.  
Jamaica also planned to deport 30 Haitians, 10 of whom were children, in May 2010 after 
they had all arrived about a month earlier by boat and landed without documentation.56  
This group included a new mother, who had given birth to her baby in Jamaica, and ten of

<p>her family members.57  Despite noting that there were humanitarian and health factors to be 
considered, the Jamaican Information Minister suggested that the deportations were 
occurring because funding to host the Haitians was depleted.58  
</p>
<p>37. Mexico reports forcibly returning three individuals in 2010 and six between January 
and October 2011. 
</p>
<p>38. The United Kingdom reports that there have been no forced returns or voluntary 
departures from the United Kingdom during this period. However, news reports indicate 
that there have been returns from the Turks and Caicos, an overseas territory of the United 
Kingdom, explaining the relevant Ministry could not provide a breakdown by year over the 
past five years of the total number of Haitians who were returned.59  The report also 
indicates that there have been interdictions at sea near Turks and Caicos.60   
</p>
<p>39. Some countries, in response to increasing political pressures to address illegal 
immigration, have forcibly returned certain lawful permanent residents and lawful 
immigrants to Haiti on the grounds that they pose a security threat due to prior criminal 
records.  This has occurred in the United States and Canada since 12 January 2010, where, 
despite their TPS and TSR programs, individuals with convictions for minor crimes who 
have already served their sentences are being deported.61   
</p>
<p>40. The United States announced its decision to resume deportations to Haiti in 
December 2011. On 20 January 2011, 26 deportees were sent on a plane to Haiti.  The 
deportees reported being detained in police station holding cells for nearly two weeks upon 
arrival in Haiti.  Advocates reported this detention was &#8213;pursuant to the Haitian 
</p>
<p>government&#8217;s longstanding policy of detaining deportees from the U.S. for indefinite 
</p>
<p>periods of time in unsanitary and abusive conditions in which they are deprived of food, 
water, medical and psychological care, and medicine.&#8214;62  One 34-year old deportee, 
Wildrick Guerrier, who became violently ill and weakened while detained in a police 
station holding cell, died of cholera-like symptoms shortly after his detention and exposure 
to these life-threatening conditions.63 In the wake of Guerrier&#8217;s death, the United States 
briefly suspended deportations to Haiti again. 
</p>
<p>41. On 1 April 2011, despite conditions in Haiti, the United States formally 
implemented a &#8213;Policy for Resumed Removals to Haiti.&#8214;64 Under this policy (&#8213;April 1st 
Policy&#8214;), individuals convicted of crimes in the United States can be deported to Haiti.65   
The policy states that it balances &#8213;the severity, number of convictions, and dates since 
convictions&#8230;against any equities of the Haitian national, such as duration of residence in

<p>the United States, family ties, or significant medical issues.&#8214;66  Under this policy, the 
United States continues to deport approximately 40-50 persons to Haiti each month.  
</p>
<p>42. There are serious concerns from U.S. civil society with the application of the April 
1st Policy. For example, individuals with severe, life-threatening medical conditions &#8211; 
including HIV, schizophrenia, diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, severe injuries, and 
bleeding ulcers &#8211; have been deported to Haiti without or with limited supply of medicine.67  
Since access to medical care and medicine is a serious problem in Haiti, these individuals 
are at severe risk.    
</p>
<p>43. Under the Policy, individuals with U.S. citizen and legal permanent resident children 
and spouses have been deported to Haiti.  In many cases, the individual economically 
supports the family, and his/her removal creates financial and emotional burdens on all 
involved.  One deportee, for instance, had served his sentence over 10 years ago. He was 
forcibly returned to Haiti, despite the fact that he had been living lawfully in the United 
States for 36 years, and was the primary source of support for his U.S. citizen wife and 
daughter.68  Another individual was forcibly returned to Haiti, despite being the only 
financial support for five U.S. citizen children and his wife, also a U.S. citizen.69   
</p>
<p>44. The policy does not adequately consider how long individuals have been in the 
United States or other humanitarian factors.  Many individuals deported have been legally 
in the United States for most of their lives.  For example, one individual who was a veteran 
of the United States military had been living in the United States as a legal permanent 
resident for 40 years.  
</p>
<p>45. Under the Policy, many deported individuals were convicted of minor, non-violent 
crimes, for which they have served a full prison/jail sentence.70  One individual, whose only 
criminal convictions were from when he was a minor, was deported to Haiti in July 2011.71  
The individual was born in the Bahamas to Haitian parents but had never even been to Haiti 
before his forced return there. He speaks little Haitian Creole or French and has only distant 
relatives in Haiti, with whom he has not had contact.72  
</p>
<p>46. The United States reports that it forcibly returned 376 individuals to Haiti between 
January and December 2011.73 While the United States has a written policy that takes 
humanitarian factors into account, it appears that this policy is not being fully implemented.   
</p>
<p>47. Additionally, some States have conducted interdictions at sea of Haitian nationals.  
News reports indicate that in December 2011, there were interdictions at sea of Haitian 
nationals by the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and the United States.  In December 2011, 
244 Haitians were found on a boat off the coast of the Bahamas and returned to Haiti.74  On 
27 January 2010, 122 Haitians were intercepted at sea by officials from Turks and Caicos.75

</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>According to the U.S. Coast Guard, from 2010 through 3 April 2012, there were 3,299 
interdictions of Haitians at sea.76  
</p>
<p>48. All U.N. member states, regardless of whether there are Haitian nationals currently 
in their territory, should adopt appropriate legal and administrative frameworks that give 
legal status to Haitian nationals living abroad and implement other measures to prevent 
forced returns of Haitian nationals during the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Haiti.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Appeal procedures pertaining to final orders of removal by states 
</b></p>
<p>49. Appeal procedures pertaining to final orders of removal vary significantly between 
States.  In the Bahamas, an individual has seven days to appeal a removal order only if he 
or she previously had legal status; those without legal status appear not to have access to 
any appeal mechanism.77  Individuals in the Bahamas cannot be detained during their 
appeals.78  In Canada, the right to appeal a removal order depends on whether an individual 
has immigration status.79  Permanent residents in Canada who are inadmissible cannot 
appeal their loss of residence unless they received a jail/prison sentence of less than two 
years.80 An appeal means the individual can ask that the Immigration Appeal Division 
consider and weigh humanitarian factors.81  
</p>
<p>50. There appears to be no appeals procedure in the Dominican Republic.  As discussed 
above, most returns happen in the context of roundups in the Dominican Republic and 
drop-offs across the border in Haiti.  
</p>
<p>51. In France, the Haitian nationals against whom removal procedures have been 
initiated can appeal the decision before the Administrative Court and the Administrative 
Court of Appeal.  In French overseas territories, Guyana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, 
Mayotte, Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin, Haitians and other foreign nationals can be 
forcibly returned before the appeal is considered by the courts. While in theory, there is an 
emergency appeal &#8211; a motion for a protective order &#8211; such appeals are generally heard after 
one month, and aliens are generally returned after 48 hours. 
</p>
<p>52. In the United Kingdom, if an application for protection or leave to remain is refused, 
the individual has a right of appeal to the Immigration and Asylum Appeal Court,82 
</p>
<p>ensuring that all foreign nationals, including Haitians, are guaranteed due process before 
being forcibly returned to their home country.   
</p>
<p>53. In the United States, an immigration judge&#8217;s removal order may be appealed by the 
individual or the immigration prosecutor to the administrative Board of Immigration 
Appeals.  Decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals may be appealed to a federal 
Court of Appeals only in limited circumstances; decisions that fall within an immigration 
judge&#8217;s discretion generally may not be appealed to the federal court unless the appeal 
involves questions of law or constitutional claims.83  People who are removable due to

<p>criminal convictions cannot get federal court review of even non-discretionary issues unless 
their appeals involve questions of law or constitutional claims.84  Decisions involving U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#8217;s prosecutorial discretion, such as those under the 
</p>
<p>April 1st Policy are not subject to any judicial review. 
</p>
<p>54. While all forced returns to Haiti should be indefinitely halted, when member states 
forcibly return Haitian nationals, they should ensure the existence of appeal procedures, the 
guarantee of due process of law, and the consideration of family and other humanitarian 
factors prior to deportation and removal proceedings for all Haitian nationals to safeguard 
human rights, especially for the most vulnerable groups, which include individuals with 
medical conditions, mental health conditions, and disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Specific measures taken with regard to groups of Haitian 
nationals 
</b></p>
<p>55. While member states should refrain from any and all forced returns to Haiti, member 
states that nevertheless forcibly return individuals to Haiti should implement specific 
measures to protect the most vulnerable groups of Haitian nationals who have high 
susceptibility to illness, violence, or other serious threats to their human rights if removed 
to Haiti.  The OHCHR/UNHCR joint advisory issued June 2011 stated that specific 
measures should be taken with regard to the following groups of Haitian nationals subject 
to forced return: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Unaccompanied or separated minors 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Persons living with disabilities or suffering from severe medical condition 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Victims of human trafficking 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Victims of sexual or gender based violence 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Persons whose deportation would lead to the separation of family members 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Persons not born in Haiti 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Persons with no known family members in Haiti 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/20/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>separation of family members, including minor children.  Multiple individuals with serious 
health conditions have also been removed. In January 2012, one woman who was raped in 
Haiti when she was 18, was forcibly returned to Haiti from Guadeloupe. Although aware of 
this, the French office for refugee status concluded that it was a previous event, hence 
justifying her forcible return despite her vulnerability as a victim of rape. The woman was 
afraid to return to Haiti and has no family there. 
</p>
<p>59. As discussed above, the United States&#8217; April 1st Policy considers certain 
humanitarian factors, including medical conditions and family ties in the United States, 
before sending an individual to Haiti, and provides that in such cases, supervision or other 
programs may be appropriate.  But the Policy does not explicitly consider before removal 
whether individuals were born in Haiti and whether there are known family members in 
Haiti.  For deportees who have never been to Haiti, who have not been to Haiti for many 
years, and who have no family members in Haiti, communication and integration into 
Haitian society is immensely difficult.   
</p>
<p>60. NGOs report that individuals are being deported to Haiti from Guadeloupe and 
Martinique are in particularly vulnerable situations, with fragile medical conditions, 
including a man whom the official medical service of the detention center had 
recommended not to be returned.  
</p>
<p>61. The removal of political refugees is also a concern. According to an interview, the 
Dominican Republic removed one individual who was a political refugee and had been 
living legally in the Dominican Republic since 2006 but was rounded up and returned to 
Haiti after the earthquake.85  
</p>
<p>62. Additionally, NGOs have described the separation of family members resulting from 
forcible returns to Haiti. For instance, NGOs have documented returns of a father of a 
French citizen child, a single mother, and several fathers whose children and families were 
residents in Guadeloupe and the United States. 
</p>
<p>63. The Independent Expert strongly urges States to consider the separation of family 
members before forcibly removing anyone to Haiti. More generally, States should refrain 
from all deportations and special measures should be in place for the vulnerable groups set 
forth in the 9 June 2011 OHCHR/UNHCR joint advisory. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Discrimination against Haitian nationals subject to removal 
</b></p>
<p>64. Some States&#8217; immigration policies, laws and practices have a disproportionately 
negative effect on Haitian nationals, as opposed to other groups of foreign nationals. For 
example, in the Dominican Republic, areas consisting of predominantly Haitian immigrants 
and their children are targeted by immigration authorities and police.  Those with Haitian- 
or French-sounding names (as opposed to Hispanic-sounding names) or with dark skin are 
targeted and rounded up by state officials.86   
</p>
<p>65. Advocates have criticized the United States for a long history of targeting Haitian 
migrants in U.S. immigration policy and practice, specifically with regard to detention and 
removal procedures, legislation concerning status adjustment and naturalization for various

<p>groups of immigrants, and interdictions by the U.S. Coast Guard.  Discrimination against 
Haitian migrants, they argue, occurs through implementation of policies specifically 
targeting Haitians, neutral policies that leave too much discretion to immigration officials, 
and preferential treatment for other nationality groups.87 
</p>
<p>66. The Independent Expert is concerned about state action that targets or 
disproportionately impacts Haitian nationals. States should ensure that their immigration 
laws and policies are applied without discrimination to particular groups, especially 
Haitians.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Effects of forced returns on human rights of deportees and 
on the Haitian state 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Independent Expert is concerned about the profound implications that forced 
returns have on the human rights of deportees and the impact these removals have on the 
Haitian State during this post-earthquake crisis. The Independent Expert has gathered 
information from his site-visits to Haiti, interviews with individuals returned from several 
States, and independent research.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Effects of removals on individual human rights  
</b></p>
<p>68. Individuals returned to Haiti are vulnerable to human rights violations, especially the 
fundamental rights to life, health, and family.  
</p>
<p>69. Individuals deported from Canada and the United States, and possibly other 
countries, are routinely and illegally detained, unjustifiably and without due process, upon 
arrival in Haiti in unsanitary police stations. According to eyewitness reports by human 
rights organizations and interviews with the deportees, the cells contain human excrement, 
blood and vomit, and have few or no working toilets.88  Deportees are generally not 
provided with food, water, medical or mental health care unless family members bring this 
to the detention center.  
</p>
<p>70. Deportees routinely fall ill in these unsanitary conditions. One organization in Haiti 
reports that many deportees detained upon arrival have exhibited cholera-like symptoms but 
have been denied medical attention. 89 As described above, one deportee, Wildrick 
Guerrier, died of cholera-like symptoms.  In another instance, the United States deported an 
individual with a serious head wound, which became infected.  He was unable to access 
medical care or obtain medicine and was living in a tent-camp, further exposing the head 
wound to unsanitary conditions.90  Deportees also face great difficulty in getting released 
from detention unless a family member signs them out. For instance, one 25-year-old 
deportee had no family in Haiti, and was able to leave jail only after another deportee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>cousin, a tent camp organizer, generously agreed to sign him out and take responsibility for 
the deportee for the next 18 months.91

<p>71. Deportees are highly stigmatized in Haitian society.  After they are released from 
detention, deportees have difficulty finding food, employment, housing, and medical care. 
Some end up living in tent camps, where they struggle to survive. In its 2009 and 2010 
human rights reports, the State Department described the situation for deportees arriving in 
Haiti as follows: &#8213;Returnees, some of whom spent substantial portions or most of their lives 
</p>
<p>abroad, alleged corruption, widespread discrimination and social abuse after returning 
home.  Reported discriminatory practices include arbitrary arrests, false accusations about 
their activities to local police and extortion attempts against them and their families abroad 
during the initial detention phase, in exchange for quicker release from administrative 
quarantine.&#8214;92 
</p>
<p>72. Few Haitian nationals forcibly returned from the United States, Canada, or the 
Dominican Republic have been able to find jobs despite their notable efforts, skills, and 
levels of education.  This is due to high unemployment rates and stigmatization of 
deportees &#8211; particularly those from the United States and Canada &#8211; and lack of community 
and family connections.  Deportees stand out in Haitian society by the way they dress, carry 
themselves, and style their hair.   Some had stable jobs or careers in the countries from 
which they were removed and now face bleak job prospects in Haiti. Without access to 
work, deportees have difficulty paying for food, clothing, housing and other basic needs 
and are unable to support dependents.  
</p>
<p>73. Forced removals to Haiti also threaten the right to private and family life.  Many 
removals to Haiti result in the separation of immediate family members.  Interviews with 
deportees in Haiti revealed that several States conduct removals despite strong family ties 
and dependency in the deporting State. For example, one woman&#8217;s forced removal from the 
Dominican Republic resulted in her separation from her husband and two children.93  One 
man&#8217;s removal from the United States resulted in his separation from his wife and four U.S. 
</p>
<p>citizen and one legal permanent resident child.94  One man&#8217;s removal from Canada resulted 
in separation from his wife and daughter.95  In January, a father of three children (6 months 
to 3-years-old) in Guadeloupe was forcibly removed. He used to work and support his 
family. Without his salary, his family lives in poverty.96  There are many more stories like 
these.   
</p>
<p>74. Removals to Haiti threaten the rights to life, health, family, equality, and due 
process.  Member states should carefully consider these concerns before forcibly returning 
any individual to Haiti.   
</p>
<p><b> IX. Effects of deportations and removals on the Haitian state 
</b></p>
<p>75. The January 2010 earthquake left an already-weak Haitian State further debilitated. 
Although recovery has been painfully slow, the international community has made notable 
contributions to help the faltering country in the wake of the devastating earthquake. On the 
two-year anniversary of the earthquake, international bodies noted the significant 
improvement of the situation while pointing out obstacles to the recovery process. Efforts 
to rebuild the Haitian state remain slow and inadequate to the enormity of need.  However

</p>
<p>third States counteract these incremental improvements, and instead impose an additional 
burden on Haiti, when they forcibly return individuals there.  
</p>
<p>76. Some Haitian State officials have articulated concerns to the Independent Expert that 
forced removals from the United States could impact Haiti&#8217;s security.  Officials claim that 
deportees from Canada and the United States have been involved in criminal activities or 
have joined gangs in Cit&#233; Soleil and other areas and have thus increased the level of 
insecurity in the country.97 However, as officials have not shared any data or research done 
on the subject, questions may be raised on the accuracy of such information and the extent 
to which this is a serious security threat. The Minister of Justice and Public Security,  in a 
recent meeting, expressed a desire to launch a study on the impact of the return of deportees 
on the level of security in Port-au-Prince.98  
</p>
<p><b> X.  Follow-up measures should be taken to ensure adequate 
reintegration and protection measures for persons after 
return to Haiti, and to monitor their situation 
</b></p>
<p>77. While the Independent Expert calls for States to stop forced returns to Haiti, it is 
critical that those persons who have been removed should benefit from support in Haiti.  
Reintegration and protection programs for those returned to Haiti are critical because of 
insufficient food, water, and access to healthcare and housing and widespread violence and 
instability in Haiti.  Some of those sent to Haiti do not have family ties or connections to 
the community and need assistance to survive.   
</p>
<p>78. Of all U.N. member States that have forcibly returned Haitian nationals to Haiti 
since the earthquake, only the United States has implemented a reintegration program 
designed to promote successful reintegration of deportees in Haiti.  The United States 
characterizes the program, established in 2006 and reinstated after the earthquake, as 
providing deportees from the United States with, <i>inter alia,</i> job training, cell phones, 
medical services, and in-kind assistance for start-up businesses.99   
</p>
<p>79. While the reintegration program is a positive and critically important development, 
it has been subject to criticism by civil society in Haiti and the United States for not 
providing sufficient services to deportees, particularly for those with serious medical or 
mental health conditions.100 Interviews with deportees reveal that many individuals have 
been unable to access reintegration program resources despite repeated attempts, while 
those who do gain access are ultimately not provided enough support to start sustainable 
businesses.101  A reintegration program&#8217;s success is dependent on comprehensive and 
consistent services that are offered from the moment deportees arrive in Haiti and that are 
available until the deportee is well-established in Haiti.102   
</p>
<p>80. Further complicating reintegration, deportees are often unable to obtain national 
identification cards, in part because the Haitian government holds their documents for 18

<p>months after arrival.103 This makes deportees ineligible for lawful employment.  Moreover, 
because deportees are targets of police harassment, deportees face arrest for failing to 
produce identification when police frequently stop them on the street.104 Traveling on 
weekly trips to check-in at the police station &#8211; a requirement for all deportees from the 
United States and possibly those from Canada &#8211; heightens the risk.105 
</p>
<p>81. Both sending States and Haiti should provide reintegration and protection assistance 
to deportees to ensure the protection and promotion of deportees&#8217; human rights, and the 
stability of Haiti.   
</p>
<p><b>XI.  Forced returns in the context of the humanitarian crisis in 
Haiti: Relevant international and regional standards 
</b></p>
<p>82. The international community has urged States not to return Haitian nationals to Haiti 
until the situation in Haiti improves.106  Under international law, states must follow 
appropriate procedures and are under obligations to consider such human rights principles 
as prohibition of torture, inhumane and degrading treatment, respect for family life, health 
protections, non-discrimination, and other human rights grounds, in making this 
determination.107   
</p>
<p><b> A. The United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>83. Article 3 of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) absolutely prohibits sending individuals to a 
country in which there is risk of torture.108 Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR) also prohibits the deportation of a person where he faces a 
risk of torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.109  Article 17 of the 
ICCPR, the protection from undue invasion of into family life, has also been applied to halt 
deportations.110    
</p>
<p>84. According to the Committee, no State may &#8213;expose individuals to the danger of 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another 
country by way of their extradition, expulsion or refoulement.&#8214;111 Article 7 is an absolute,

invoked to excuse a violation of article 7 for any reasons.&#8214;112 
</p>
<p>85. The Human Rights Committee, in numerous cases113, has found the forced returns of 
persons to be in violation of Article 17 of the ICCPR, freedom from unlawful interference 
with privacy, family and home.  
</p>
<p>86. In a 2008 report, the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Migrants recommended 
States to incorporate a human rights framework into their bilateral and regional 
arrangements in relation to balancing national security interests and managing migration 
and to review their expulsion procedures and harmonize them with human rights norms.114 
Moreover, in a 2011 report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur noted that 
many States suspended deportations of nationals affected by the 2004 tsunami, another 
devastating natural disaster, and stated that these examples are positive developments.  The 
Rapporteur recommended that States maintain and reinforce the use of a human-rights 
based approach to protect the rights of migrants.115  
</p>
<p>87. In specific recommendations to the United States, the Special Rapporteur 
recommended that &#8213;United States immigration laws should be amended to ensure that all 
</p>
<p>non-citizens have access to a hearing before an impartial adjudicator, who will weigh the 
non-citizen&#8217;s interest in remaining in the United States against the Government&#8217;s interest in 
deporting him or her.&#8214;116 
</p>
<p>88. With regard to interdictions at sea, States have international obligations to rescue 
those found at sea under maritime law.117  UNHCR notes that under the principle of <i>non-
refoulement</i>, interception measures should not result in asylum-seekers and refugees being 
denied access to international protection, or returned to the very States from which they 
seek to flee<i>.</i>118  States should admit asylum-seekers on a temporary basis and provide them 
with protection&#8212;a comprehensive principle to stopping interdictions and providing 
detainees with humane treatment and sufficient opportunity to seek asylum.119  On this 
issue, UNHCR considers it is not about admission, but the obligation of States not to return 
refugees to a place where their freedom or lives may be in danger.120  These obligations do 
not have territorial borders, as State responsibility to uphold these inalienable principles 
does not diminish outside jurisdictional boundaries.121

<p><b> B. Regional human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p>89. At the regional level, the Inter-American Commission and Court of Human Rights, 
the African Commission on Human Rights, and the European Court of Human Rights have 
established case law and standards setting forth when the forced return of persons is 
prohibited on human rights grounds and the factors to consider in evaluating forced 
return/deportation cases, including harmful country conditions, health of deportee, and 
deportees&#8217; family ties in their resident country and country of origin.  
</p>
<p>90. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has directly addressed the issue 
of forced returns to Haiti in a recently-granted set of precautionary measure orders in favor 
of 57 individuals facing deportation to Haiti from the United States.122  The Commission 
stated that, if deported, the lives and health of these individuals would be at &#8213;grave risk&#8214; as 
</p>
<p>they would probably be detained upon arrival in Haiti and denied access to drinking water, 
food, and medical treatment.  The Commission asked the United States to suspend the 
deportation process until: &#8213;(1) Haiti is able to guarantee that detention conditions and 
</p>
<p>access to medical care for persons in custody comply with applicable minimum standards, 
and (2) the procedures in places to decide upon and review the deportation of the&#8230; 
beneficiaries adequately take into account their right to family life and their family ties in 
the United States.&#8214;123 The Commission also urged the United States to suspend deportations 
to Haiti, especially in cases of &#8213;persons of Haitian origin who are seriously ill or who have 
</p>
<p>family members in the United States.&#8214;124  
</p>
<p>91. The African Commission on Human Rights also has expressed concern in matters 
regarding (a) likely discrimination125 involved in the decision to deport; (b) separation of a 
family unit;126 (c) poor detention conditions in the country being deported to which 
constitute torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;127 and (d) return to 
a country where the deportee&#8217;s right to life and integrity of person could be compromised 
(<i>non-refoulement</i>).  The African Charter does not allow derogation of these responsibilities, 
even in times of war.128 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>92. The European Court of Human Rights has noted that States must consider all 
relevant factors when determining whether deportation is appropriate in any given case.  In 
specific cases, it has noted the importance of the deportee&#8217;s familial ties (both in the 
</p>
<p>sending state or host state),129 sex/age/ethnicity/etc.,130 risk of being tortured in receiving

<p><b>(c) Initiate and prioritize family reunification programs that grant visas to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Haitians to resettle in third States in which their family members legally reside. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>may simply mean expediting the issuance of visas that have already been approved 
</b></p>
<p><b>but, due to bureaucratic delays, are not issued for years;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Enact laws, procedures, and programs designed to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular needs of Haitian nationals. Such laws, procedures, and programs include, 
</b></p>
<p><b>but are not limited to, legal and administrative measures that guarantee due process 
</b></p>
<p><b>of law and an appropriate balancing of humanitarian factors in forced removal 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings, especially where States continue to deport persons to Haiti; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure deportees both within and outside of detention centers have 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to food, water, housing, medical care, etc., and enact reintegration programs to 
</b></p>
<p><b>help deportees integrate into Haitian society.  Some components that are necessary to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the creation and sustenance of a successful reintegration program include, but are not 
</b></p>
<p><b>limited to: (1) providing necessary aid to deportees; (2) improving collaboration 
</b></p>
<p><b>between the Haitian government, civil society, and NGOs; (3) financing educational 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilities and learning centers; (4) aiding the creation of jobs for deportees; and (5) 
</b></p>
<p><b>assisting in the provision of healthcare for deportees. Another necessary component 
</b></p>
<p><b>for a successful reintegration program includes an independent body monitoring the 
</b></p>
<p><b>reintegration program to ensure that it complies with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Consider the possibility, on a case-by-case basis, of permitting the return 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the deporting country of Haitian nationals who have been forcibly returned to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Haiti;

</b></p>
<p><b>obligations to ensure that individuals and groups are free from discrimination.

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Whether the individual is a member of a vulnerable group (articulated in the

<p><b>removal proceedings for all Haitian nationals.

<p>95. <b>The Haitian government should:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(m) Stop detentions of individuals forcibly removed to Haiti; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Ensure that detention facilities meet international human rights
