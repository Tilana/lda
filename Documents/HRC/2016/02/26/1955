</p>

<p><i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution 65/154 of 20 December 2010, 
establishing 2013 as the International Year of Water Cooperation and that strengthening

</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of 
Sanitation for All, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010, on the follow-
up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit, in which Heads of State and Government 
committed to, inter alia, accelerate progress in order to achieve Millennium Development 
Goal 7, including by redoubling efforts to close the sanitation gap through scaled-up 
ground-level action, and Assembly resolution 65/153 of 20 December 2010, on follow-up 
to the International Year of Sanitation, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the commitments made by the international community to achieve 
fully the Millennium Development Goals, and stressing in that context the resolve of Heads 
of State and Government, as expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, to 
halve, by 2015, the proportion of people unable to reach or afford safe drinking water, and 
to halve the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, as agreed in the Plan of 
Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (&#8220;Johannesburg Plan of 
Implementation&#8221;) and the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the 
General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals entitled &#8220;Keeping the promise: 
</p>
<p>united to achieve the Millennium Development Goals&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human right to 
safe drinking water and sanitation, including the Abuja Declaration, adopted at the first 
Africa-South America Summit, in 2006; the Sharm el-Sheikh Final Document, adopted at 
the Fifteenth Summit Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Movement of 
Non-Aligned Countries, in 2009; the Colombo Declaration, adopted at the fourth South 
Asian Conference on Sanitation, in 2011; the Chiang Mai Declaration, adopted at the

third Latin American and Caribbean Conference on Sanitation, in 2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>in particular</i> paragraph 14 of Human Rights Council resolution 21/2, in 
which the Council encouraged the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation to continue to make contributions to the discussions on the United 
Nations development agenda beyond 2015, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply</i> <i>concerned</i> that approximately 768 million people still lack access to 
improved water sources and that more than 2.5 billion people do not have access to 
improved sanitation as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund in their 2013 Joint Monitoring Programme update, and concerned that 
these figures do not fully capture the dimensions of water safety, the affordability of 
services, and the safe management of excreta and wastewater, as well as of equality and 
non-discrimination, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation, and alarmed that, every year, approximately 1.5 million 
children under five years of age die and 443 million school days are lost as a result of 
water- and sanitation-related diseases, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the 
progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where 
appropriate, as means to promote the progressive realization of the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, 
including international watercourse law, </p>


<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles 
everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically 
accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use and to have physical and 
affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure and 
acceptable, and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the recognition of the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, and the reaffirmation 
by the latter that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is derived from the 
right to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as to the right to life and human 
dignity; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also welcomes</i> the commitments of States regarding the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development on 22 June 2012; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Further welcomes</i> the fact that, according to the 2012 Joint Monitoring 
Programme report, the Millennium Development Goal target relating to the reduction by 50 
per cent of people without access to an improved water source was met five years before its 
deadline of 2015, and insists that much remains to be done on safety, equity, equality and 
non-discrimination issues; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Regrets</i> the fact that, according to the 2013 Joint Monitoring Programme 
update, the Millennium Development Goal target on sanitation still is one of the most off-
track of the United Nations development agenda, and calls upon all Member States to 
continue to support the global effort to realize the goals of the advocacy campaign 
&#8220;Sustainable sanitation: the five-year drive to 2015&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Encourages</i> Member States to intensify global partnerships for development 
as means to achieve and sustain the Millennium Development Goal targets on water and 
sanitation; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations 
conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and 
the undertaking of country missions, and notes with interest the announcement of the 
development of a handbook on implementing the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Also welcomes</i> the annual report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 
General Assembly on integrating non-discrimination and equality into the post-2015 
development agenda for water, sanitation and hygiene,1 takes note with appreciation of her 
proposal to integrate the progressive reduction and elimination of inequalities into the post-
2015 agenda, and encourages further discussion on how to possibly integrate these issues in 
the elaboration of the post-2015 agenda; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Notes </i>the recommendation contained in the report of the High-level Panel of 
Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, commissioned by the Secretary-
</p>

<p>General,2 listing water and sanitation among the indicative goals in the post-2015 
development agenda, and also takes note of the report of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;A 
life of dignity for all: accelerating progress towards the Millennium Development Goals 
and advancing the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015&#8221;,3 in which the 
Secretary-General recognized the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation as one 
of the foundations for a decent life; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Also notes</i> the discussion on water issues, especially on water and sanitation, 
at the third session of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, held 
from 22 to 24 May 2013; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Calls upon</i> States to integrate the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation and the principles of equality and non-discrimination into the post-2015 
development agenda; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Welcomes</i> the annual report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 
Human Rights Council on sustainability and non-retrogression in the realization of the 
human right to safe drinking water and sanitation,4 and takes note of its potential relevance 
to the post-2015 development agenda; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Recalls</i> that safe drinking water and sanitation must be progressively made 
available for present and future generations, without discrimination, and that the provision 
of services today should safeguard the ability in the future to realize the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Calls upon</i> States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To incorporate the principle of sustainability into measures adopted to realize 
the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, during times of both economic 
stability and economic and financial crisis; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To prioritize appropriately funding for maintenance and operation to achieve 
and maintain sustainability and prevent retrogression in service provision, and to ensure, in 
an appropriate manner, independent regulation and monitoring of the water and sanitation 
sectors, as well as accountability mechanisms to deal with practices that undermine the 
progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To undertake holistic planning aimed at achieving sustainable universal 
access, including in instances where the private sector, donors and non-governmental 
organizations are involved in service provision; 
</p>
<p>14.  <i>Reaffirms </i>that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full 
realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international 
assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their 
available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to safe drinking 
water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of 
legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Stresses</i> the important role of international cooperation and the technical 
assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and 
international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, in particular in the 
timely achievement of the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and urges development
