Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
Nature of Operations
EV Energy Partners, L.P. together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (“we,” “our” or “us”)
is a publicly held limited partnership. Our general partner is EV Energy GP, L.P. (“EV
Energy GP”), a Delaware limited partnership, and the general partner of our general
partner is EV Management, LLC (“EV Management”), a Delaware limited liability company.
EV Management is a wholly owned subsidiary of EnerVest, Ltd. (“EnerVest”), a Texas
limited partnership. EnerVest and its affiliates also have a significant interest in us through
their 71.25% ownership of EV Energy GP which, in turn, owns a 2% general partner interest
in us and all of our incentive distribution rights.
Basis of Presentation
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been
prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or
omitted. We believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make
the information not misleading. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary
for a fair presentation of the interim periods. The results of operations for the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the
full year. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10–K
for the year ended December 31, 2015.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, all dollar and unit
amounts in tabulations are in thousands of dollars and units, respectively, unless
otherwise indicated.
Subsequent Events
We evaluated subsequent events for appropriate accounting and disclosure through the
date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued.
NOTE 2. EQUITY–BASED COMPENSATION
We grant various forms of equity–based awards to employees, consultants and directors
of EV Management and its affiliates who perform services for us. These equity–based
awards consist of phantom units and performance units.
We estimated the fair value of the phantom units using the Black–Scholes option pricing
model. Compensation cost is recognized for these phantom units on a straight–line basis
over the service period and is net of estimated forfeitures. These phantom units are
subject to graded vesting over a four year period. We recognized compensation cost
related to these phantom units of $1.4 million and $2.3 million in the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3.0 million and $7.1 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs are included in “General and
administrative expenses” in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
operations.
As of June 30, 2016, there was $10.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to unvested phantom units which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of 2.2 years.
In September 2011, we issued 0.3 million performance units to certain employees and
executive officers of EV Management and its affiliates. These performance units were fully
vested as of January 2015, and we recognized compensation cost related to these
performance units of $0.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015. These costs are
included in “General and administrative expenses” in our unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations.

EV Energy Partners, L.P.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS
In October 2015, we made the following acquisitions from certain institutional partnerships
managed by EnerVest, a related party:
·we acquired Belden & Blake Corporation (“Belden”) for $111.1 million;
·we acquired oil and natural gas properties in the Austin Chalk for $25.9 million; and
we acquired oil and natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin and the San Juan Basin for
·
$122.0 million.
These acquisitions were not accounted for as common control transactions as EnerVest
does not control the institutional partnerships that sold the oil and natural gas properties.
As part of the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the San Juan Basin, we
assumed an obligation to deliver approximately 2.4 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”) of natural gas
through December 31, 2016 under previously existing volumetric production payment
(“VPP”) agreements. Under these agreements, certain of these oil and natural gas
properties are subject to fixed–term overriding royalty interests which had been conveyed
to the VPP purchaser. While we are obligated under these agreements to produce and
deliver to the purchaser its portion of future natural gas production from these oil and
natural gas properties, we retain control of these oil and natural gas properties and rights
to future development drilling. If production from the oil and natural gas properties subject
to the VPP is inadequate to deliver the natural gas provided for in the VPP, we have an
obligation to make up the shortfall in accordance with the provisions of the agreements. At
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the remaining obligation under these agreements
was approximately 0.9 Bcf and 1.9 Bcf, respectively, of natural gas.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we have recorded a liability of $2.0 million and
$4.0 million, respectively, which is included in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”
in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, for the cost to produce and
deliver to the VPP purchasers their portion of future natural gas production from these oil
and natural gas properties. In the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, we
recorded $0.04 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of accretion expense related to this
VPP obligation.
We accounted for these acquisitions as business combinations. The following table
reflects pro forma revenues and net income for the three months and six months ended
June 30, 2015 as if these acquisitions had taken place on January 1, 2015. These
unaudited pro forma amounts do not purport to be indicative of the results that would
have actually been obtained during the periods presented or that may be obtained in the
future.

NOTE 4. RISK MANAGEMENT
Our business activities expose us to risks associated with changes in the market price of
oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. In addition, our floating rate credit facility exposes
us to risks associated with changes in interest rates. As such, future earnings are subject
to fluctuation due to changes in the market prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids and interest rates. We use derivatives to reduce our risk of volatility in the prices of
oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and interest rates. Our policies do not permit the
use of derivatives for speculative purposes.
We have elected not to designate any of our derivatives as hedging instruments.
Accordingly, changes in the fair value of our derivatives are recorded immediately to
operations as “(Loss) gain on derivatives, net” in our unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations.
As of June 30, 2016, we had entered into commodity contracts with the following terms:

We have entered into master netting arrangements with our counterparties. The amounts
above are presented on a net basis in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheets when such amounts are with the same counterparty. In addition, we have recorded
accounts payable and receivable balances related to our settled derivatives that are
subject to our master netting agreements. These amounts are not included in the above
table; however, under our master netting agreements, we have the right to offset these
positions against our forward exposure related to outstanding derivatives.
Should our credit facility become due and payable because of an event of default, our
derivatives that are in a net liability position could also become due and payable. We could
also be required to post cash collateral related to these derivatives under certain
circumstances. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were not required to post
any collateral nor did we hold any collateral associated with our derivatives.

NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to
determine fair value.  Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 refers to fair values determined
based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market
corroboration.  Level 3 refers to fair values determined based on our own assumptions
used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
Recurring Basis
The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for our assets and liabilities that are
required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Our derivatives consist of over–the–counter contracts which are not traded on a public
exchange.  As the fair value of these derivatives is based on inputs using market prices
obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as
their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be
validated through external sources, including third party pricing services, brokers and
market transactions, we have categorized these derivatives as Level 2. We value these
derivatives using the income approach with inputs such as the forward curve for
commodity prices based on quoted market prices and prospective volatility factors related
to changes in the forward curves and yield curves based on money market rates and
interest rate swap data, such as forward LIBOR curves. Our estimates of fair value have
been determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market data. There were no
changes in valuation techniques or related inputs in the three months ended June 30,
2016.

EV Energy Partners, L.P.
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Nonrecurring Basis
In the six months ended June 30, 2015, as a result of a reduction in estimated future net
cash flows primarily caused by the continuing decrease in prices, we recognized a $58.2
million impairment charge to write down oil and natural gas properties to their fair value of
$31.4 million.
The fair values were determined using the income approach and were based on the
expected present value of the future net cash flows from proved reserves. Significant
Level 3 assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the
impairment analysis included estimates of future prices, production costs, development
expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated reserves, appropriate risk–adjusted
discount rates and other relevant data.
Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of our financial instruments have been determined at discrete
points in time based on relevant market information. Our financial instruments consist of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
derivatives and long–term debt. The carrying amounts of our financial instruments other
than derivatives and long–term debt approximate fair value because of the short–term
nature of the items. Derivatives are recorded at fair value (see above).
The carrying value of debt outstanding under our credit facility approximates fair value
because the credit facility’s variable interest rate resets frequently and approximates
current market rates available to us. The estimated fair value of our senior notes due 2019
was $208.6 million and $211.9 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, which differs from the carrying value of $341.7 million and $423.6 million at
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value of the senior notes due
2019 was determined using Level 2 inputs.
NOTE 6. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
We record an asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) and capitalize the asset retirement cost
in oil and natural gas properties in the period in which the retirement obligation is incurred
based upon the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle facilities
or plug and abandon wells. After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its
future estimated value using an assumed cost of funds and the additional capitalized
costs are depreciated on a unit–of–production basis. The changes in the aggregate ARO
are as follows:

Credit Facility
As of June 30, 2016, we have a $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in February 2020.
Borrowings under the facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our
oil and natural gas properties. The facility allows for up to $35.0 million in cash, reduced by
the amount of any quarterly distributions for the remainder of 2016, to be used for the
redemption of our senior notes due 2019 (see below) and limits cash held by us to the
greater of 5% of the current borrowing base or $30.0 million. We also may use up to $100.0
million of available borrowing capacity for letters of credit. As of June 30, 2016, we have a
$0.4 million letter of credit outstanding. The facility requires the maintenance of certain
financial covenants, and, as of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with these financial
covenants.
The facility does not require any repayments of amounts outstanding until it expires in
February 2020. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a floating rate based on, at
our election, a base rate or the London Inter–Bank Offered Rate plus applicable premiums
based on the percent of the borrowing base that we have outstanding (weighted average
effective interest rate of 4.58% and 3.50% at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively).
Borrowings under the facility may not exceed a “borrowing base” determined by the
lenders under the facility based on our oil and natural gas reserves. As of June 30, 2016,
the borrowing base under the facility was $450.0 million. The borrowing base is subject to
scheduled redeterminations as of April 1 and October 1 of each year with an additional
redetermination once per calendar year at our request or at the request of the lenders and
with one calculation that may be made at our request during each calendar year in
connection with material acquisitions or divestitures of properties.
8.0% Senior Notes due 2019
Our senior notes due 2019 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally,
on a senior unsecured basis, by all of our existing subsidiaries other than EV Energy
Finance Corp. (“Finance”), which is a co–issuer of the Notes. Neither EV Energy Partners,
L.P. nor Finance have independent assets or operations apart from the assets and
operations of our subsidiaries.
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, we redeemed $82.7 million of our senior notes
due 2019 for $35.0 million, resulting in a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $47.7
million.

NOTE 9. OWNERS’ EQUITY
Units Outstanding
At June 30, 2016, owners’ equity consists of 49,055,214 common units, representing a 98%
limited partnership interest in us, and a 2% general partnership interest.
Issuance of Units
In January 2016, we issued 0.2 million common units related to the vesting of equity–
based awards.
Cash Distributions
On January 25, 2016, the board of directors of EV Management declared a $0.075 per unit
distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015 on all outstanding units. The distribution of $3.9
million was paid on February 12, 2016 to unitholders of record at the close of business on
February 5, 2016.
In April 2016, the board of directors of EV Management announced that it had elected to
suspend distributions for the first quarter of 2016. The board of directors also elected to
suspend distributions for the second quarter of 2016.
NOTE 10. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

NOTE 12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Pursuant to an omnibus agreement, we paid EnerVest $4.0 million and $3.3 million in the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $8.0 million and $6.6 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in monthly administrative
fees for providing us general and administrative services. These fees are based on an
allocation of charges between EnerVest and us based on the estimated use of such
services by each party, and we believe that the allocation method employed by EnerVest
is reasonable and reflective of the estimated level of costs we would have incurred on a
standalone basis. These fees are included in general and administrative expenses in our
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
We have entered into operating agreements with EnerVest whereby a wholly owned
subsidiary of EnerVest acts as contract operator of the oil and natural gas wells and
related gathering systems and production facilities in which we own an interest. We
reimbursed EnerVest approximately $4.6 million and $3.7 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $10.8 million and $7.8 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for direct expenses incurred in the
operation of our wells and related gathering systems and production facilities and for the
allocable share of the costs of EnerVest employees who performed services on our
properties. As the vast majority of such expenses are charged to us on an actual basis
(i.e., no mark–up or subsidy is charged or received by EnerVest), we believe that the
aforementioned services were provided to us at fair and reasonable rates relative to the
prevailing market and are representative of the costs that would have been incurred on a
standalone basis. These costs are included in lease operating expenses in our unaudited
condensed consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, in its role as contract
operator, this EnerVest subsidiary also collects proceeds from oil and natural gas sales
and distributes them to us and other working interest owners.

NOTE 14. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014–15, Presentation of Financial Statements – Going
Concern. This ASU amends the accounting guidance for the presentation and disclosure
of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. It requires
management to evaluate and disclose whether there is substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management should consider relevant conditions or
events that are known or reasonably known on the date the financial statements are
issued. The provisions of ASU 2014–15 are applicable to the annual reporting period
ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We
do not expect that adopting this ASU will have a material impact on our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016–09, Compensation – Stock Compensation.
This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share–based payment
transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory
withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The
provisions of ASU 2016–09 are applicable to annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is
permitted for financial statements that have not yet been previously issued. We do not
expect that adopting this ASU will have a material impact on our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements.
No other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 have had or are expected to have a material impact on our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and the related notes thereto, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10–K for
the year ended December 31, 2015.
OVERVIEW
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2006 by EnerVest to acquire,
produce and develop oil and natural gas properties. Our general partner is EV Energy GP,
a Delaware limited partnership, and the general partner of our general partner is EV
Management, a Delaware limited liability company.
We operate in one reportable segment engaged in the acquisition, development and
production of oil and natural gas properties and all of our operations are located in the
United States.
As of December 31, 2015, our oil and natural gas properties were located in the Barnett
Shale, the Appalachian Basin (which includes the Utica Shale), the San Juan Basin,
Michigan, Central Texas (which includes the Austin Chalk area), the Mid-Continent area in
Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana, the Monroe Field in Northern
Louisiana, and the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2015, we had estimated net proved
reserves of 22.0 MMBbls of oil, 747.0 Bcf of natural gas and 36.3 MMBbls of natural gas
liquids, or 1,096.7 Bcfe, and a standardized measure of $536.4 million.
Current Price Environment
Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are determined by many factors that are
outside of our control. Historically, these prices have been volatile, and we expect them to
remain volatile. In late 2014, prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids declined
precipitously, and such prices have remained low into the six months ended June 30,
2016.
Factors contributing to lower oil prices include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil
producing regions of the world, particularly the Middle East; lower forecasted levels of
global economic growth combined with excess global supply; actions taken by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the strength of the U.S. dollar in
international currency markets. Factors contributing to lower natural gas prices include
increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities;
higher levels of natural gas in storage; and competition from other energy sources. Prices
for natural gas liquids generally correlate to the price of oil and, accordingly, prices have
fallen and are likely to continue to directionally follow the market for oil. Further, excess
supply with higher volumes in storage has resulted in a further drop in pricing for natural
gas liquids.
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, these low prices negatively affected our revenues,
earnings and cash flows, and sustained low prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. A further or extended decline
in prices could also adversely have a significant impact on the value and quantities of our
reserves, assuming no other changes in our development plans.
As specified by the SEC, the prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids used to
calculate our reserves were the average prices during the year determined using the price
on the first day of each month. The prices utilized in calculating our total estimated proved
reserves at December 31, 2015 were $50.28 per Bbl of oil and $2.587 per MMBtu of natural
gas. Had we used the current forward strip prices at December 31, 2015 through
December 31, 2021, we estimate that the present value (discounted at 10% per annum) of
estimated future net revenues of our proved reserves would have been approximately 29%
higher and that our reserves on an Mcfe basis would have been approximately 7% higher
than our reserves calculated using SEC prices.
Our Response to the Current Price Environment
In response to continued depressed prices and the fact that we have less production
hedged in 2016 and 2017 at lower prices relative to previous years, we have taken
additional steps going forward into 2016 to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial
flexibility. These steps include:
·reevaluating and suspending our common unit distribution to conserve excess cash;
16
·maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment;
reducing the amount of capital spending we dedicate to the development of our reserves by
·
approximately 75%;
focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in
·
operating and capital costs;
continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long–life, producing oil and natural gas
·
properties; and
further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of
·capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization of
acreage.
In April 2016, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that, among other things:
· decreased the borrowing base to $450.0 million;
changed the senior secured funded debt to EBITDAX ratio covenant to be no greater than (a) for
the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, September 30, 2016 and December
·

changed the total funded debt to EBITDAX ratio covenant to be no greater than (a) for the fiscal
quarters ending March 31, 2018, 5.50 to 1.0, (b) for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2018 and
·
September 30, 2018, 5.25 to 1.0 and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018 and
thereafter, 4.25 to 1.0;
added a cash interest expense to EBITDAX ratio covenant to be no less than (a) for the fiscal

fiscal quarters ending and December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, 2.0 to 1.0
and (c) for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 and thereafter, 1.5 to 1.0;
allowed for up to $35.0 million of cash, reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of any quarterly
·
distributions for the remainder of 2016, to be used for the redemption of our senior notes due
2019; and
·limited cash held by us to the greater of 5% of the current borrowing base or $30.0 million.
In April 2016, the board of directors announced that it had elected to suspend
distributions to unitholders and, since the adoption of this amendment in April 2016, we
have repurchased $82.7 million of outstanding senior notes due 2019 for $35.0 million.
This repurchase of our senior notes due 2019 at a discount to par created cancellation of
debt income for our unitholders.
As of July 29, 2016, we have $280.0 million outstanding under our credit facility and $343.3
million of our senior notes due 2019 outstanding, for a total of $623.3 million, and we have
over $172.8 million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity and cash on hand.
Business Environment
Our primary business objective is to provide stability and growth in cash distributions per
unit over time. We have currently suspended distributions to unitholders to conserve any
excess cash to enable us to be able to pay a distribution at a future date. When we resume
our distribution payments, the amount of cash we could distribute to our unitholders will
principally depend upon the amount of cash generated from our operations, which will
fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:
·the prices at which we will sell our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production;
· our ability to hedge commodity prices;
17
·the amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas we produce; and
· the level of our operating and administrative costs.
In order to mitigate the impact of lower prices on our cash flows, we are a party to
derivatives, and we intend to enter into derivatives in the future to reduce the impact of
price volatility on our cash flows. We have entered into derivative contracts covering a
portion of our future production through December 2017; however, due to depressed
commodity prices over the last 18 months, we have less production volumes hedged and
the prices at which those volumes are hedged are at lower average prices than in the past.
This has left us with a greater exposure to current commodity prices and has impacted
cash flows from operations. An extended period of depressed commodity prices would
alter our acquisition and development plans, adversely affect our growth strategy and our
ability to access additional capital in the capital markets and reduce the cash we have
available to pay distributions, which may delay our ability to reinstate our quarterly
distribution.
The primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability, including
planned reductions in capital spending for 2016, our ability to make accretive acquisitions,
the success of our drilling program and our inventory of drilling prospects. In addition, as
initial reservoir pressures are depleted, production from our wells decreases. We attempt
to overcome this natural decline through a combination of drilling and acquisitions. Our
future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves through drilling and
acquisitions in excess of production. We will maintain our focus on the costs to add
reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such
reserves. Our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital
resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling
permits and regulatory approvals. Any delays in drilling, completion or connection to
gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact our production, which may have an
adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result, cash available for future possible
distributions.
We focus our efforts on increasing our reserves and production while controlling costs at
a level that is appropriate for long–term operations. Our future cash flows from operations
are dependent upon our ability to manage our overall cost structure.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with the Three Months Ended June 30,
2015
Net (loss) income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $(29.0) million compared
with $164.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The significant factors in this
change were (i) a $250.4 million decrease in income from discontinued operations and (ii) a
$26.3 million unfavorable change in loss (gain) on derivatives, offset by (iii) a $47.7 million
gain on early extinguishment of debt and (iv) a $46.3 million decrease in impairment of oil
and natural gas properties.
Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016
totaled $42.4 million, a decrease of $1.4 million compared with the three months ended
June 30, 2015. This was the result of a decrease of $9.9 million related to lower prices for
oil and natural gas offset by increases of $8.1 million from increased oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids production and $0.4 million from higher natural gas liquids prices.
Lease operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased $2.2
million compared with the three months ended June 30, 2015 as the result of $5.0 million
from increased production offset by $2.8 million from a lower unit cost per Mcfe. Lease
operating expenses were $1.42 per Mcfe in the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared with $1.61 per Mcfe in the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) for the three months ended June 30,
2016 increased $6.3 million compared with the three months ended June 30, 2015 as a
result of $6.1 million from increased production and $0.2 million from a higher unit cost per
Mcfe. The higher average DD&A rate per Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our
reserves estimates. DD&A was $1.73 per Mcfe in the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared with $1.71 per Mcfe in the three months ended June 30, 2015.
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016
totaled $8.0 million, which was flat compared with the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Included in G&A expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $1.0 million of
lower equity compensation costs offset by $0.7 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest
under the omnibus agreement. G&A expenses were $0.43 per Mcfe in the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared with $0.54 per Mcfe in the three months ended June 30,
2015.
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred leasehold impairment charges of
$2.0 million. In the three months ended June 30, 2015, we incurred leasehold impairment
charges of $48.3 million, of which $47.9 million related to a change in our development
plans for acreage in the Utica Shale.
(Loss) gain on derivatives, net was $(35.6) million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared with $(9.2) million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This change
was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices and the impact of the
expiration of derivative contracts with more favorable terms as of December 31, 2015. The
12 month forward price at June 30, 2016 for oil averaged $49.42 per Bbl compared with
$38.56 at March 31, 2016, and the 12 month forward prices at June 30, 2016 for natural gas
averaged $3.02 per MmBtu compared with $2.19 at March 31, 2016. The 12 month forward
price at June 30, 2015 for oil averaged $61.99 per Bbl compared with $53.30 at March 31,
2015, and the 12 month forward prices at June 30, 2015 for natural gas averaged $3.13 per
MmBtu compared with $2.91 at March 31, 2015.
Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $1.3 million
compared with the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to $4.3 million from a lower
weighted average long–term debt balance offset by $1.5 million from a higher weighted
average effective interest rate and the write–off of $1.5 million of loan costs due to the
reduction in the borrowing base and the redemption of the senior notes due 2019.
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a $47.7 million gain on the early
extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $82.7 million of our senior notes due 2019 for
$35.0 million.
In the three months ended June 30, 2015, income from discontinued operations was
$250.4 million, which included the $246.7 million gain on the sale of UEO.
19
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared with the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Net (loss) income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $(58.0) million compared
with $102.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The significant factors in this
change were (i) a $255.5 million decrease in income from discontinued operations and (ii) a
$40.1 million unfavorable change in loss (gain) on derivatives, offset by (iii) a $47.7 million
gain on early extinguishment of debt and (iv) a $103.8 million decrease in impairment of oil
and natural gas properties.
Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016
totaled $80.1 million, a decrease of $10.0 million compared with the six months ended June
30, 2015. This was the result of a decrease of $24.2 million related to lower prices offset by
an increase of $14.2 million from increased production.
Lease operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased $7.6 million
compared with the six months ended June 30, 2015 as the result of $9.5 million from
increased production offset by $1.9 million from a lower unit cost per Mcfe. Lease
operating expenses were $1.50 per Mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
with $1.56 per Mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2015.
DD&A for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased $8.6 million compared with the
six months ended June 30, 2015 as a result of $10.3 million from increased production
offset by $1.7 million from a lower unit cost per Mcfe. The lower average DD&A rate per
Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates and the decrease in the
carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties from the impact of the impairments that
were recognized in 2015. DD&A was $1.63 per Mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared with $1.69 per Mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2015.
G&A expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $16.3 million, a decrease of
$4.0 million compared with the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily
the result of (i) $4.3 million of lower equity compensation costs, of which $2.3 million
related to the accelerated vesting of the phantom units of a former officer in the six months
ended June 30, 2015; (ii) a $1.4 million decrease in compensation costs, of which $0.8
million related to the vesting of our phantom units under our equity compensation plan;
offset by (iii) $1.4 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest under the omnibus agreement.
G&A expenses were $0.45 per Mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with
$0.68 per Mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2015.
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred leasehold impairment charges of $2.7
million. In the six months ended June 30, 2015, we incurred impairment charges of $106.5
million. Of this amount, $58.2 million related to oil and natural gas properties that were
written down to their fair value as determined based on the expected present value of the
future net cash flows. Significant assumptions associated with the calculation of
discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis included estimates of future
prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our
estimated reserves, appropriate risk – adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. The
remainder of the impairment charges consisted of $48.3 million of leasehold impairments,
of which $47.9 million related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the
Utica Shale.
(Loss) gain on derivatives, net was $(25.8) million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared with $14.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This change was
attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices and the impact of the expiration
of derivative contracts with more favorable terms. The 12 month forward price at June 30,
2016 for oil averaged $49.42 per Bbl compared with $40.45 at December 31, 2015, and the
12 month forward prices at June 30, 2016 for natural gas averaged $3.02 per MmBtu
compared with $2.49 at December 31, 2015. The 12 month forward price at June 30, 2015
for oil averaged $61.99 per Bbl compared with $56.46 at December 31, 2014, and the 12
month forward prices at June 30, 2015 for natural gas averaged $3.13 per MmBtu
compared with $3.03 at December 31, 2014.
Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $4.6 million compared
with the six months ended June 30, 2015 due to $10.1 million from a lower weighted
average long–term debt balance offset by $4.0 million from a higher weighted average
effective interest rate and the write–off of $1.5 million of loan costs due to the reduction in
the borrowing base and the redemption of the senior notes due 2019.
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a $47.7 million gain on the early
extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $82.7 million of our senior notes due 2019 for
$35.0 million.
20
In the six months ended June 30, 2015, income from discontinued operations was $255.5
million, which included the $246.7 million gain on the sale of UEO.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Historically, our primary sources of liquidity and capital have been issuances of equity
and debt securities, borrowings under our credit facility and cash flows from operations.
Our primary uses of cash have been acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and
related assets, development of our oil and natural gas properties, distributions to our
unitholders and general partner and working capital needs.
In response to continued depressed prices, we took a number of actions to preserve our
liquidity and financial flexibility, and, as of July 29, 2016, we have over $172.8 million of
liquidity between our borrowing base capacity and cash on hand. However, given current
forward oil and natural gas prices and the fact that we have less production volumes
hedged and the prices at which those volumes are hedged are at lower average prices
relative to previous years, we have taken additional steps going forward into 2016 to
continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include:
·reevaluating and suspending our common unit distribution to conserve excess cash;
·maintaining a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment;
reducing by approximately 75% the amount of capital spending we dedicate to the development
·
of our reserves;
focusing on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in
·
operating and capital costs;
continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long–life, producing oil and natural gas
·
properties; and
further realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of
·
capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization of
acreage.
For 2016, we believe that cash on hand, proceeds from sales of assets, net cash flows
generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to
fund our capital budget and satisfy our short–term liquidity needs.
We may also utilize borrowings under our credit facility and various financing sources
available to us, including the issuance of equity or debt securities through public offerings
or private placements, to fund our acquisitions and long–term liquidity needs. Our ability
to complete future offerings of equity or debt securities and the timing of these offerings
will depend upon various factors including prevailing market conditions and our financial
condition.
Long–term Debt
As of June 30, 2016, we have a $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in February 2020.
Borrowings under the facility may not exceed a “borrowing base” determined by the
lenders based on our oil and natural gas reserves. As of June 30, 2016, the borrowing
base was $450.0 million, and we had $280.0 million outstanding.
As of June 30, 2016, we have $343.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of
our senior notes due 2019. As of June 30, 2016, the aggregate carrying amount of the
senior notes due 2019 was $341.7 million.
For additional information about our long–term debt, such as interest rates and
covenants, please see “Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)” contained herein.
Cash and Short–term Investments
At June 30, 2016, we had $2.8 million of cash on hand.
Counterparty Exposure
All of our derivative contracts are with major financial institutions who are also lenders
under our credit facility.  Should one of these financial counterparties not perform, we may
not realize the benefit of some of our derivative contracts and we could incur a loss. As of
June 30, 2016, all of our counterparties have performed pursuant to their derivative
contracts.

23
Our revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain
additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and natural
gas liquids. Declines in prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition,
liquidity, ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower prices also may reduce
the amount of oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids that we can produce economically. A
decline in prices could have a material adverse effect on the estimated value and
estimated quantities of our reserves, our ability to fund our operations and our financial
condition, cash flows, results of operations and access to capital. Historically, prices and
markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to
be volatile.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial statements that
arise in the normal course of business. We may enter into derivative instruments to
manage or reduce market risk, but do not enter into derivative agreements for speculative
purposes.
We do not designate these or plan to designate future derivative instruments as hedges
for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of these instruments
are recognized currently in earnings.
Commodity Price Risk
Our major market risk exposure is to prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
These prices have historically been volatile. As such, future earnings are subject to
change due to changes in these prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by the
prevailing worldwide price for oil and regional spot prices for natural gas production. We
have used, and expect to continue to use, commodity contracts to reduce our risk of
changes in the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Pursuant to our risk
management policy, we engage in these activities as a hedging mechanism against price
volatility associated with pre–existing or anticipated sales of oil, natural gas and natural
gas liquids.
We have entered into commodity contracts to hedge a portion of our anticipated oil and
natural gas production through December 2017. As of June 30, 2016, we have commodity
contracts covering approximately 83% of our production attributable to our estimated net
proved reserves from July 2016 through December 2017, as estimated in our reserve
report prepared by third party engineers using prices, costs and other assumptions
required by SEC rules. Our actual production will vary from the amounts estimated in our
reserve reports, perhaps materially.
The fair value of our commodity contracts at June 30, 2016 was a net asset of $9.2 million.
A 10% change in oil and natural gas prices with all other factors held constant would result
in a change in the fair value (generally correlated to our estimated future net cash flows
from such instruments) of our oil and natural gas commodity contracts of approximately
$19.7 million. Please see “Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)” contained herein for additional information.
Interest Rate Risk
Our floating rate credit facility and interest rate swaps also expose us to risks associated
with changes in interest rates and as such, future earnings are subject to change due to
changes in these interest rates. If interest rates on our facility increased by 1%, interest
expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 would have increased by approximately
$1.3 million. The fair value of our interest rate swaps at June 30, 2016 was a liability of $2.5
million. A 1% change in interest rates with all other factors held constant would result in a
change in the fair value (generally correlated to our estimated future net cash flows from
such interest rate swaps) of our interest rate swaps of approximately $1.9 million. Please
see “Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)” contained herein
for additional information.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
In accordance with Exchange Act Rule 13a–15 and 15d–15, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016 to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and
procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
