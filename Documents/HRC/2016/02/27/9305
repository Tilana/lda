<p><b>Report of the High Commissioner</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its decision 2/102, the Human Rights Council, requested the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous 
decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and 
studies. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
understands that decision as preserving the previous annual reporting cycles in respect of the 
present issue, until otherwise decided by the Council. Pursuant to resolution 2005/72 of the 
Commission on Human Rights, a comprehensive annual report on the composition of the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/103) was submitted 
to the Commission at its sixty-second session. The High Commissioner therefore submitted her 
report (A/HRC/4/93) to the Human Rights Council at its fourth session. The current issue of the 
composition of the staff of OHCHR addresses developments in the composition of OHCHR staff 
in 2007. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  The present report was submitted after the deadline to ensure incorporation of human 
resources data up to and including 31 December 2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>2. In section I of the present report, information is provided on the composition of OHCHR as 
at 31 December 2007. It includes data on staff members in posts subject to geographical 
distribution, as well as data on staff members in temporary posts funded from extrabudgetary 
resources or in technical cooperation project posts, neither of which are included in the definition 
of posts subject to geographical distribution. 
</p><p>3. Section II contains a description of the measures for improvement taken by the 
High Commissioner aimed at addressing the geographical composition issues identified by 
the Commission in its resolution 2005/72, while fully observing Secretariat human resources 
policies, in particular, its recruitment and contractual policies. 
</p>
<p><b>II. COMPOSITION OF THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>4. The recruitment of staff members to posts subject to geographical distribution is governed 
by the system of desirable ranges at the Secretariat level. For that purpose, Member States are 
grouped into four categories: unrepresented, underrepresented, within range and 
over-represented. A Member State is considered unrepresented when none of its nationals, 
throughout the entire Secretariat, is serving in a post subject to geographical distribution and 
filled in accordance with the established selection process. It is underrepresented when the 
number of its nationals appointed to such posts throughout the entire Secretariat is below the 
lower limit of the desirable range. It is within range when the number of its nationals appointed 
to such posts is between the upper and lower limits of the desirable range, and it is 
over-represented when the number of its nationals appointed to such posts within the entire 
Secretariat exceeds the upper limit of the desirable range. The representation status of 
Member States is affected by many factors, notably turnover of staff, changes in the scale of 
assessments and changes in the total number of Member States. 
</p>
<p>5. The official report on the composition of the Secretariat is submitted annually by the 
Secretary-General to the General Assembly in accordance with a number of resolutions, the 
most recent of which are 57/305 of 15 April 2003; 59/266 of 26 December 2004; 60/238 
of 23 December 2005 and 61/244 of 22 December 2006. 
</p>
<p>6. The latest report of the Secretary-General on the composition of the Secretariat (A/62/315) 
was issued in 2007. OHCHR is part of the Secretariat and the breakdown of its geographical 
composition has to be seen against the breakdown of the overall distribution within the 
Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>7. Table A1 (annex I) provides a breakdown of all OHCHR staff in the Professional category 
and above who have been selected through the established recruitment process against 
both regular budget and extrabudgetary posts by nationality, grade and gender as 
at 31 December 2007. </p>

 <p></p>
<p>8. Table A2 (annex II) provides a breakdown of the following categories of additional 
OHCHR staff in the Professional category and above not included in table 1 by nationality, grade 
and gender as at 31 December 2007: 
</p>
<p> (a) Staff holding appointments of less than one year; 
</p>
<p> (b) Staff charged to general temporary assistance funds;  
</p>
<p> (c) Staff employed as technical cooperation project personnel. 
</p><p>9. In accordance with General Assembly resolution 53/221, section IX, paragraph 4, the 
practice of showing the representation of staff according to major geographical groupings has 
been discontinued. The information is provided by country, listed in alphabetical order. 
</p>
<p>10. OHCHR has 419 staff members in the Professional category and above, of which 304 are 
considered regular staff. Of the 419 staff members, 49.4 per cent are female. One staff member is 
an Under-Secretary-General, one is an Assistant Secretary-General, three staff members are at 
the D-2 level and eight staff members are at the D-1 level. A total of 13 per cent of staff fall into 
the P/L-5 category, 23 per cent in the P/L-4 category, 46 per cent are P/L-3, 14 per cent are 
P/L-2 and 1 per cent are P/L-1 staff. 
</p>
<p>11. Nationals from 93 countries are represented in the Professional and above category; one 
more staff member is from Palestine. Of these 93 nationalities, 15 are underrepresented in the 
Secretariat,<b>1</b> 64 are considered within range (36 below midpoint<b>2</b> and 28 above midpoint<b>3</b>), 
while 14 nationalities are overrepresented<b>4</b> in the Secretariat.

<p>12. Of the 419 staff members, 268 come from the more developed regions, while 151 come 
from the less developed regions.<b>5</b> Thirty-four staff members come from least developed 
countries. 
</p>
<p>13. Of OHCHR Professional staff members, 278 work in Geneva, 9 work in the New York 
office, while 132 work in 31 different locations<b>6</b> in the field. 
</p>
<p><b>III. RESULTS OF EFFORTS MADE TO ACHIEVE EQUITABLE  
GEOGRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION 
</b></p>
<p>14. Despite the decision of the General Assembly to discontinue references to regions in 
reporting on staff representation referenced above, both the Commission on Human Rights, in its 
resolution 2005/72, and the Joint Inspection Unit<b>7</b> have made use of the concept of geographic 
diversity by regional grouping when assessing the composition of the staff of OHCHR. This 
difference in approach, terminology and methodology from the report of the Secretary-General 
(A/62/315) has caused confusion and made comparison of data problematic. In order to facilitate 
a consistent and coherent discussion in the present report, the High Commissioner has therefore 
adopted, to the extent possible, the regional methodology used by the Human Rights Council and 
the Joint Inspection Unit when analysing the Office&#8217;s geographic diversity. 
</p>
<p>15. As stated in the plan of action of the High Commissioner (A/59/2005/Add.3, annex), 
achieving geographical balance in OHCHR staff will remain one of her priorities. In line with 
that objective, the Office has continued to vigorously implement the High Commissioner&#8217;s 
procedures and framework for improving geographic diversity, which were explained in detail in 
the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of OHCHR submitted to the 
Council in February 2006 (E/CN.4/2006/103).  
</p>
<p>16. The results of the above are now being seen clearly in the Office&#8217;s selection data. Since 
the procedures were introduced, 122 selection decisions have been made for Professional 
posts. Of these, 72 (60 per cent) were from regions requiring improved representation within

</b>  See the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the Office of 
</p>
<p>the High Commissioner for Human Rights (A/59/65-E/2004/48 and Add.1), the follow-up to 
the management review (A/61/115 and Add.1) and the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on 
the funding and staffing of the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights. </p>

 <p></p>
<p>OHCHR. This is clearly an improvement, particularly when noting that of the 50 selections 
from the regions well represented within OHCHR, 32 were internal staff members who had 
been transferred or promoted, thus having no net impact on the geographic balance of the 
Office. There has been similar progress with regard to senior (P-5 and above) posts. A total 
of 28 selection decisions have been made for senior posts since the procedures were 
introduced. Of these, 16 (58 per cent) were from regions requiring improved representation 
within OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>17. These improved selection figures have resulted in significant progress in the overall 
geographic diversity of the Office. An analysis of the data contained in table 1 below using the 
methodology employed by the Joint Inspection Unit clearly shows that the Office has 
significantly increased the percentage of staff from regions identified as requiring better 
representation within OHCHR.

</p>
<p>18. This underlines the issue, of what constitutes geographic balance for the Office. It is 
important to note that the Office, while being criticized for its geographic imbalance, has yet to 
receive any indication of what would be considered an appropriate level of representation for 
each region, apart from the system of desirable ranges mandated by the General Assembly. In the 
absence of any such recommendation and in order to establish indicative goals, the Office 
analysed the current desirable ranges approved by the Assembly and extrapolated the levels of 
representation by region that this would entail, to allow comparison with the statistics presented 
in the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit. 
</p>
<p>19. Reviewing the composition of the Office on this basis reveals a different picture to 
that presented in the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit, which cast OHCHR as a United Nations 
office with a particularly serious geographic imbalance. Table 2 below indicates that OHCHR 
has higher representation from three regions (Africa, Latin America and Western Europe) than 
is targeted by the system approved by the Assembly. It is also worth noting that OHCHR draws 
a higher proportion of its staffing from Latin America and the Caribbean than the Secretariat 
itself.  </p>

</p>
<p>20. The Office will continue to vigorously implement the High Commissioner&#8217;s 
procedures and framework for improving geographic diversity (A/HRC/4/93), which have, 
to date, proven extremely effective. It is anticipated that the current positive geographic trends 
will continue throughout the current biennium; for its part, the Office will endeavour to 
maximize the opportunity afforded by its continued growth to further increase geographic 
diversity. 
</p>
<p>21. The Office is confident that a number of other initiatives will further enhance its 
geographic diversity. 
</p>
<p>22. A human rights national competitive examination will be held in 2008. The Office of 
Human Resources Management has focused on inviting participation in the examination from 
eligible countries in regions deemed requiring improved representation in OHCHR. This is a 
unique opportunity to improve the long-term geographic balance of the Office and it is hoped 
that those Member States invited to participate do so. 
</p>
<p>23. The Office has also received support at the legislative level. In 2006, the General 
Assembly, on the basis of a report of the Third Committee, adopted resolution 61/159, in 
which it proposed a number of concrete measures to redress the geographical imbalance of 
the staff of OHCHR, including the establishment of a temporary mechanism whereby 
recruitment for extrabudgetary posts at the P-2 level would not be restricted to successful 
candidates from the national competitive examination; and encouraged participation from a 
broader range of Member States in the associate experts programme and the implementation of 
the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit (A/61/115). The 
Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Committee to look into such 
administrative matters. In its resolution 61/244, the Assembly, on the basis of a report of the 
Fifth Committee on human resources management, subsequently made specific reference to 
OHCHR. The Assembly requested that the Secretary-General present, in consultation with 
OHCHR, proposals to address the imbalance in the geographical distribution of the staff in that 
Office. Following extensive consultations between OHCHR and the Office of Human Resources 
Management, the Secretary-General submitted a report (A/61/823) to the Fifth Committee, in 
which several concrete measures were laid out, such as requesting an exemption from the 
national competitive recruitment examination process for posts at the P-2 and P-3 levels, and a 
commitment to more selectively targeting countries for inclusion in the examinations scheduled 
for 2008. </p>

 <p></p>
<p>24. Pending the review of the report to the Assembly, OHCHR is working closely with the 
Office of Human Resources Management to proceed with some of the recommendations made 
by the Third and Fifth Committees. 
</p>
<p>25. While seeking to improve the geographical distribution of its staff members, OHCHR 
will continue to pay special attention to the issue of gender balance, an area in which 
determination and concerted effort have already brought success, as demonstrated by the fact 
that as at 31 December 2007, 49.7 per cent of regular OHCHR staff and 48.7 per cent of 
temporary OHCHR staff at the Professional level were women, equivalent to an overall 
percentage of 49.4.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>26. <b>The implementation and results to date of the High Commissioner&#8217;s framework to 
improve geographic diversity reflect the high priority that the High Commissioner is 
giving to this issue in OHCHR. The success of the Office&#8217;s efforts is now clearly apparent in 
the improved geographical diversity of its staff. Additional measures developed in 
consultation with OHRM pursuant to General Assembly resolutions will further 
strengthen those efforts.</b>
