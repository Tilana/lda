The  Shareholder  Rights  Plan  which  was  adopted  will  ensure  the  fair  treatment  of  all  the  Company’s 
shareholders in the event of an unsolicited take-over bid for the outstanding common shares of the Company.  
In the event that a take-over bid should occur, the Shareholder Rights Plan provides a mechanism to ensure 
that  shareholders  have  adequate  time  to  properly  evaluate  and  assess  it  without  facing  undue  pressure  or
2
coercion. The Shareholder Rights Plan also provides the board of directors with additional time to consider 
any  take-over  bid  and,  if  applicable,  to  explore  alternative  transactions  in  order  to  maximize  shareholder 
value.    Accordingly,  the  Shareholder  Rights  Plan  is  not  designed  to  prevent  take-over  bids  that  treat  the 
Company’s shareholders fairly.   A copy of the Shareholder Rights Plan Agreement is be available under the 
Company’s  profile  on  SEDAR  at  www.sedar.com  and  the  Company’s  website  at  www.lomiko.com.  
Reference should be made to the full text of the  Shareholders Rights Plan for the details of its provisions.  
The Shareholder Rights Plan has received TSX Venture Exchange conditional acceptance and the Company 
will now make the necessary filing for final acceptance.
