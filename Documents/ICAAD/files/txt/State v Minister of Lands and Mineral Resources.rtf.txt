The first respondent had granted VML,approval for a drainage reserve or easement over Lot 1 on Plan No.M 2605, to discharge storm water to the Labasa river.VML is the owner of State Lease No. 17786,Lot 13 and 13A in Plan No.M1644, which lies behind Lot 1 on Plan No. 2605.The applicants allege that the respondents have withdrawn the approval and issued a lease to Centre Point Hotel Management Ltd over Lots 1 and 2 on Plan No. M2605, without authority and without consulting the applicants, Labasa residents and ratepayers and/or calling for expressions of interest. The zoning of Jaycees Park has been altered from open space to Special Use (Tourism).It is further alleged that the respondents have not issued a Completion Certificate to VML, in respect of its building at 13 and 13A Jaduram Street, Labasa, despite representations made by engineers that the building is structurally sound.

5.      
The grounds upon which the reliefs are sought are as follows:

a)      
The respondents exceeded or did not properly exercise their jurisdiction, under the Town and Country Planning Act, the Local Government Act, the State Lands Act, the I-Taukei Lands Trust Act and their respective regulations and made errors of law in not properly construing and applying these laws.

The pending court case against the developer and Mr Vinesh Dayal.

"        
The project would be revenue generating.

"        
The Jaycees Park was not properly maintained nor used very much.

"        
The drainage reserve or easement should be a Tourism issue.

"        
Labasa Town Council would save on yearly rental.

"        
The Look North Policy.

"        
The business risk taken by Mr Vinesh Dayal.

(ii)    
failing to take into consideration relevant matters namely:-

c        
The proposal was not consistent with the operative Approved Labasa Town Planning Scheme(2007) and policy directions.

c        
The approved scheme clearly zoned the site as open space.

c        
The Jaycees Park is for public use, as part of Labasa Town Councils services to its people.

c        
The drainage reserve or easement granted to VML is necessary for the inspection chamber..and the voluminous roof water discharge, which must not be discharged into the road, and as the roof water piping is laid at an angle sloping to the river bank.

c        
The applicants have nowhere else to conveniently discharge the roof water discharge to avoid reversal surge of water causing flooding.

f)      
The respondents have acted in breach of the legitimate expectations of the applicants.

b.      
Native Lot 1 & 2 on Plan M2605 was a crown reverted lease by virtue of the Native Lands (Amendment) Act,2002. Lot 1 had reverted to Native Lease, while Lot 2 had always been I Taukei Land. 

c.      
The Agreement for Lease had been granted to Centrepoint Hotel Management Ltd based on information provided by the Ministry of Lands. 

d.      
The fifth respondents role in this matter was limited to the granting of the Agreement for Lease, pursuant to the lessee application and it meeting the formal requirements for a lease .

e.      
The applicant had only applied for drainage easement late last year, in a bid to stall the development on the lot, which would in no way impede any water outlets. 

f.      
It cannot comment on the withdrawal by Divisional Surveyor Northern. The fifth respondent did not advise the Divisional Surveyor Northern, to withdraw the approval. 

g.      
The fifth respondents actions with regard to this matter is not in any way illegal, irrational nor was there procedural impropriety.

h.      
Culverts would be put to improvise the drainage system in the area. The applicants had been informed that there will be a proper suitable alternative system for the water outlet. The lessees have approved plans of a proper drainage system which would properly dispose of the rainwater A copy of the approved plan where the lessee would build a proper drainage system for the proper disposal of rain water, is attached.

i.      
The applicants are not prejudiced in any way, as the disposing rain water is being accommodated via an approved 2 metre drainage easement and this rain water will be directed to the river. 

j.

m.      
The orders sought by the applicants would be prejudicial to the respondents and the lessees, as the proposed development by the lessees does not in any way hinder or affect the applicants, as the drainage system will not be improperly dealt with in any way. 

n.      
The applicant has a part of his building encroaching on the land.

M 2605 to the I Taukei Land Trust Board is unlawful and ultra vires.

e)      
The applicants do not have locus standi to apply for judicial review. The applicants have failed to establish how their sufficient interest have been abused, as a result of the decision by the respondents.

9.      
The first, second, third, fourth and sixth respondents oppose the grant of leave on the following grounds:

i.      
The applicants do not have an arguable case.

ii.     
The first and second respondents acted within their powers, in arriving at the decisions challenged and took into account all relevant facts and circumstances, in withdrawing the approval granted to Vanualevu Muslim League for drainage reserve or easement over Lot 1 on Plan 2605.

The first and second respondents complied with the State Lands Ac, (Cap 132) by giving withdrawal of the notice of approval granted to VML.

iv.     
The respondents had not made an error in law and had exercised their discretion fairly.

v.      
The application for judicial review is frivolous and vexatious and should be struck out.

vi.     
The first, second, third, fourth and sixth respondents have not breached the legitimate expectation of the applicant at any stage of their decision.

10.     
The determination 
10.1    
 On 27thFebruary,2012,the first respondent granted VML approval for a drainage reserve or easement over Lot 1 on Plan No.M 2605,to discharge storm water to the Labasa river. 

10.2    
 The approval addressed to the first applicant, President of VML,was in these terms:

 Re: Application for Drainage Reserve
Reference is made to your application dated 18th October 2011, regarding the above subject.

I am pleased to advise that approval is now granted for the Drainage Reserve to be put in place in order to discharge the storm water from your property to the Labasa River. We will immediately proceed with the application to the Director of Town and Country Planning for approval. (emphasis added)

10.3    
 The grievance of the applicants is that this approval was withdrawn and a lease was granted to Centre Point Hotel Management Ltd of the land .

10.4    
 The fifth respondent, its affidavit in reply states that:

o       
..culverts would be put up to improvise the drainage system in the area and the Applicants had been informed ...that there will be a proper suitable alternative system for the water outlet.

o       
..the Applicant is are not prejudiced in any way, as the disposing rain water is being accommodated via an approved 2 metre drainage easement and this rain water will be directed to the river. 

o       
..the proposed development...does not hinder or affect the Applicants..The lessees have approved plans of a proper drainage system which would properly dispose of the rainwater.

10.5    
. At the hearing, Mr Valenitabua, counsel for the plaintiff said that the applicants had been informed that alternative draining arrangements will be provided to VML.

10.6    
The application before me is for leave to apply for judicial review. At this stage, there are three issues that need to be considered. 

10.7    
 I would refer to the judgment of Calanchini AP in Proline Boating Co Ltd v Director of Lands,(Misc. Action 39 A of 2011) stated at pg 9:

The first matter to be determined is whether the Applicant has a sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates. This is required under Order 53 Rule 3 (5). The second issue is the question of delay..The third matter is whether the Applicant has established on the affidavit material before the Court that it has an arguable case to obtain leave to apply for judicial review.(emphasis added)

10.8    
 I am satisfied that the applicants have sufficient interest to bring this application, as regards the decision to withdraw the approval granted to VML, for the drainage reserve over the land. The application is within time.

10.9    
 The issue then, to be decided is whether the applicants have an arguable case. On this point, Calanchini AP in Proline Boating Co Ltd v Director of Lands,(supra) said:

 At the outset it should be stated that the requirement of an arguable case is a low threshold. ....

The applicant need only establish that his application is not frivolous nor vexatious in the sense that it is not a hopeless case. .(emphasis added)

10.10   
 That takes me to the speech of Lord Diplock in Inland Revenue Commissioners v National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Business Ltd, [1981] 2 All ER 93 at page 106 where his Lordship referred to the limited nature of the requirement to demonstrate an arguable case as follows:

The whole purpose of requiring that leave should first be obtained to make the application for judicial review would be defeated if the court were to go into the matter in any depth at that stage. If on a quick perusal of the material then available, the court thinks that it discloses what might on further consideration turn out to be an arguable case in favour of granting to the applicant the relief claimed, it ought, in the exercise of a judicial discretion, to give him leave to apply for that relief.

10.11   
I would also refer to the following passage from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Maisamoa v. Chief Executive Officer for Health,(Civil Appeal No. ABU 0080/2007):

All that needs to be demonstrated at the leave stage is that there is an arguable case. In State v Connors, ex parte Shah [2008] FJHC64 Scutt J correctly observed about the process at the leave stage:

At this stage a full review of the facts is unnecessary. Nonetheless, a court is obliged to sufficiently pursue the material provide to determine whether an applicant raises an issue arguably involving an error in law, a serious error in fact; a violation of natural justice or procedural fairness, or an excess of jurisdiction by the decision-maker the subject of the application.(emphasis added)

10.12   
 In my view, the decision to withdraw the drainage approval over the land presents an arguable case.

10.13   
I grant the applicants leave to apply for judicial review, in respect of the withdrawal of the approval granted to VML on 27th February, 2012, for drainage reserve or easement over Lot 1 on Plan No. 2605 and grant a stay of that decision.

10.14   
The applicants also seek judicial review in respect of the approval and grant of a lease to Centrepoint Hotel Management Ltd and the zoning of the land.

10.15   
In my view, VML have no rights over the land. VML had only been granted a drainage and easement over the land. The letter of approval of 27 February,2012,did not specify the type of drain.It states that the drainage reserve was " to be put in place". But VML dug a drain on the land, as stated in its affidavit in support. The sixth respondent, in its affidavit in opposition, states that the drain and/or temporary easement made by VML is illegal and without approval from the relevant authorities.

10.16   
In my judgment, VML does not have "sufficient interest " in respect of the grant of a lease of the land or its zoning. The application for leave is declined.

10.17   
The remaining issue is the application for judicial review of the decision of the respondents not to issue Vanualevu Muslim League with a Completion Certificate, in respect of its building at Lots 13 and 13A Jaduram Street, Labasa, However, sufficient facts have not been put forward in support, except to state that representations have been made by its engineers that building is "structurally sound". This matter was not urged at the hearing. The application is declined.

11.     
Orders

(a)     
The applicants are granted leave to apply for judicial review of the decision to withdrawal the approval granted to Vanualevu Muslim League on 27th February, 2012, for drainage reserve or easement over Lot 1 on Plan No. 2605. I grant a stay of this decision.

(b)     
the application for judicial review of the decision grant of a lease to Centre Point Hotel Management Ltd, the zoning of the land and failure to issue Vanualevu Muslim League with a Completion Certificate in respect of its building at Lots 13 and 13A Jaduram Street, Labasa,is declined.

(c)     
Costs in the cause.
