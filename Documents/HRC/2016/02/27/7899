<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 6/13, decided to preserve the Social 
Forum as a vital space for dialogue between the representatives of Member States and civil 
society, including grass-roots organizations and intergovernmental organizations, on issues 
linked to the promotion of the enjoyment of all human rights by all. Consequently, the 
Social Forum has met annually since 2008.1 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with resolution 19/24 of the Council, the 2012 Social Forum was held 
in Geneva from 1 to 3 October 2012. The President of the Council appointed Alya Al-
Thani, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and Permanent Representative of 
Qatar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, as Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 2012 
Social Forum. As requested by the Council in resolution 19/24, the 2012 Social Forum 
focused on &#8220;people-centred development and globalization&#8221;, particularly: (a) people-
centred development and global governance in an era of multiple challenges and social 
transformation; (b) promoting measures and actions for participatory development and 
democratic governance, including through the role of civil society and social movements at 
the grass-roots, local and national levels; and (c) enhancing a globally enabling 
environment for development, including through the international financial system, which 
should support sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, sustainable 
development, and hunger and poverty eradication in developing countries, while allowing 
for the coherent mobilization of all sources of financing for development. 
</p>
<p>3. The programme of work2 for the 2012 Social Forum was prepared with guidance 
from the Chairperson-Rapporteur and inputs received from Member States and other 
relevant stakeholders. In addition, the background report to the Social Forum, 
(A/HRC/SF/2012/2) submitted by OHCHR pursuant to paragraph 8 of Council resolution 
19/24, informed the discussions. The present report contains a summary of the proceedings 
of the 2012 Social Forum, as well as its conclusions and recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening of the Social Forum 
</b></p>
<p>4. In her opening remarks, the Chairperson-Rapporteur highlighted the importance of 
taking a forward-looking and action-oriented approach to promoting people-centred 
development and globalization. She emphasized that &#8220;people-centred development&#8221; 
requires the development process to focus on people as beneficiaries and drivers of 
development. This was particularly critical in the era of globalization, where the growing 
interdependence of States, companies and people has important human rights implications. 
While globalization expands our horizons in science and technology, creates wealth and 
prosperity, and promotes the exchange of information and communications, it can also 
threaten individual identity and cultural diversity, foster economic and social inequality, 
and facilitate financial instability. In this context, a people-centred and human rights-based 
approach to development and globalization will help realize the full enjoyment of all human 
rights.3

<p>5. On behalf of OHCHR, Marcia V. J. Kran, Director of the Research and Right to 
Development Division, delivered welcoming remarks. She underlined that global 
development and global governance had to be bound by the international human rights 
obligations to which all States have committed. Therefore, the primary concern of 
development should be to ensure freedom from fear, freedom from want and a life of 
dignity for all people. A people-centred approach to development and globalization would 
promote the realization of human rights and the improved well-being of all people by, inter 
alia, their active, free and meaningful participation in development, the equitable 
distribution of benefits from development and the advancement of an enabling national and 
international environment for development. 
</p>
<p>6. In her remarks, Human Rights Council President Laura Dupuy Lasserre (Uruguay) 
observed that human rights advances had to accompany economic development. In an 
increasingly globalized world, many contemporary challenges to human rights transcend 
national borders, undermine the objectives of social justice, peace and security, and call for 
holistic, international solutions.  Under these circumstances, it was significant that the 
vision of development embodied in the United Nations Declaration on the Right to 
Development was not limited to economic aspirations. Rather, the Declaration envisioned a 
holistic development paradigm, founded on the enjoyment of all human rights, furthered 
through the creation of an enabling national and international environment, and nurtured 
through the application of the human rights principles of accountability, equality, non-
discrimination, participation, empowerment and transparency.  
</p>
<p>7. In a video address to the Social Forum, 2011 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Tawakul 
Karman described the rallying force of universal human rights during the Arab Spring 
revolutions. She highlighted the growing interconnectedness of States and peoples, 
including through social media, as a primary driver of the rapid transmission of the 
democratic values and human rights principles that fuelled the Arab Spring. She also 
emphasized the link between the inequitable distribution of benefits from development and 
the Arab Spring revolutions. The ultimate goal of these revolutions was to eradicate 
poverty, illiteracy and corruption, achieve good governance and sustainable development, 
and make globalization into a positive phenomenon that benefits all people. In this regard, 
the downfall of dictatorships in many countries only marks the beginning of a revolutionary 
process that will remain unfinished until nepotism and corruption have been eliminated and 
human rights realized. 
</p>
<p>8. During the general statements segment, the representatives of Algeria, Cuba, the 
Maldives and Nepal, as well as North-South XXI, took the floor. Speakers noted that 
multiple global crises posed unprecedented challenges to the enjoyment of human rights 
and the realization of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in the least 
developed countries. A comprehensive development package was needed to bring about 
economic transformation in these countries, and global sustainable development requires 
development of the poorest and the weakest. The preservation of the Earth for succeeding 
generations and respect for human rights and universal values was critical to the success or 
failure of people-centred development and small island developing States. The right to 
development should unite developed and developing countries in promoting a people-
centred, rights-based approach to development that allows the meaningful participation of 
marginalized and vulnerable people, business enterprises, civil society and smaller 
governments. A speaker urged the Human Rights Council to seriously consider the 
recommendations of the Social Forum in light of its important role as a vehicle for civil 
society participation, and recommended that the Forum address the need for a democratic 
and equitable international order as a basis for development. </p>


<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. People-centred development and globalization 
</b></p>
<p>9. Johan Galtung, Rector of Transcend Peace University, stated that this was a 
multipolar and evolving world, with emerging countries and declining ones. His 
presentation described six development models: Western liberal, Western Marxist, 
Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese and Chinese. He argued that local communities should be the 
central focus of development, and that community-level development would lift up poor 
and marginalized people. He highlighted the need for increasing mobilization of resources 
and political will to achieve development through democratic processes and dialogue. He 
further called for a new, more flexible and participatory development paradigm that 
incorporated the best elements of the six models he introduced in line with human rights, 
including the right to development. According to Johan Galtung, this new development 
paradigm was necessary for the establishment of a more equitable people-centred society. 
</p>
<p>10. Myrna Cunningham, member of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 
emphasized the importance of tackling development and human rights in a holistic way that 
accounted for cultural diversity, harmony with nature and the full realization of all human 
rights. She described balance, solidarity, sustainability, sharing, autonomy and self-
governance as principles common to most indigenous world views that should be 
incorporated in development planning. One means of doing so was through systematized 
mechanisms for the good faith consultation and participation of indigenous peoples 
respectful of the principle of free, prior and informed consent. She described the concept of 
<i>vivir bien</i> or &#8220;living well&#8221; as an example of an indigenous development that respected 
cultural diversity, emphasized education and promoted sustainability. People-centred 
development should incorporate intercultural education, traditional knowledge, respect for 
cultural identity and diversity, intergenerational solidarity and collective rights. 
</p>
<p>11. Delphine Djiraibe, Principal Advocate of the Public Interest Law Centre in Chad, 
described the challenge of developing processes and institutions that were responsive to the 
needs of the poor. She observed that the poor had not benefited from oil revenues in Chad, 
and without effective, participatory and accountable governance, this would not change. Oil 
revenues in Chad supported militarization rather than development, and control over these 
resources was a source of internal conflict. Noting the involvement of the World Bank in 
pipeline financing in Chad, she recommended that international financial institutions 
subject development projects to increased scrutiny with regard to human rights 
implications. In conclusion, she called for democratic governance, an independent 
judiciary, a reversal of discriminatory policies, and international solidarity to help the 
people of Chad in their struggle for peaceful and sustainable development.  
</p>
<p>12. Martin Khor, Executive Director of the South Centre, argued that people-centred 
development should drive globalization and not the other way around. This would require 
continuing efforts to reform national economies and the international economic order. 
Promoting people-centred development would require, inter alia, restoring the financial 
sector to service of the real economy; reviewing liberalized cross-border financial 
movements, implementing the United Nations recommendations adopted in the aftermath 
of the financial crisis; ensuring balanced follow-up to the Rio+20 outcome in the economic, 
social and environmental pillars; equitably curbing carbon emissions; broadening the scope 
of the post-2015 development framework to include the environmental perspective and 
strengthen the economic pillar; and addressing job creation, income distribution and global 
factors that affect national development. He argued that human rights should be part of the 
development agenda, but not to the exclusion of economic development. Instead, 
development issues should be approached holistically in order to clarify the right balance </p>


<p>between growth, employment and sovereign debt, the developmental role of the state, the 
basic needs of people and the role of local communities in development planning. 
</p>
<p>13. Representatives of China, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the Defensor&#237;a del 
Pueblo de Venezuela, North-South XXI, the Indian Movement &#8220;Tupaj Amaru&#8221; and the 
Ligue marocaine pour la citoyennet&#233; et les droits de l&#8217;homme took part in the ensuing 
dialogue that addressed the right to development, anti-poverty policies, representative 
participation in decision-making processes, neoliberalism, multiple global crises and 
structural adjustment programmes. It was suggested that developed countries should 
assume greater responsibility for the consequences of their actions, abolish the debt burden 
of developing countries and provide compensation for former colonial countries.  
</p>
<p>14. In concluding remarks, the panellists responded to specific questions raised and 
comments made. Myrna Cunningham addressed the significant impact of global crises on 
the human rights of indigenous peoples and described &#8220;good living&#8221; indicators elaborated 
by the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. Delphine Djiraibe emphasized that oil 
revenues in her country had been misappropriated as a result of corruption and increasing 
militarization. Martin Khor stressed the importance of clarifying State human rights 
obligations with regards to policies that negatively impact other States. On the issue of 
sovereign debt, he argued for policies that promote responsible lending and borrowing and 
a sovereign debt arbitration mechanism. Johan Galtung emphasized the importance of 
harnessing the positive elements of capitalism for development, while avoiding increased 
inequality and social pathologies by keeping development planning open to a variety of 
development models and the totality of human experiences. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Participatory development 
</b></p>
<p>15. Virginia Dandan, the Independent Expert on human rights and international 
solidarity, described a human rights community development project jointly sponsored by 
the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines and the New Zealand Human Rights 
Commission in indigenous communities in the Philippines and New Zealand. The 
Independent Expert related her experience as leader of the project in the Philippines, 
working with Bajau indigenous communities. She highlighted the significant progress 
achieved by the project in promoting positive development outcomes and human rights 
awareness within the Bajau community through culturally appropriate project design and 
self-determined development. She emphasized that human rights practitioners should not 
focus exclusively on preventing rights violations but should also seek to empower people 
and communities to maximize their own well-being. In this context, human rights should 
determine how we live together as one human family.  
</p>
<p>16. Maria Mercedes Rossi, Representative of the Associazione Comunit&#224; Papa Giovanni 
XXIII, stressed that development was an integral process that had to respect and promote 
all aspects of human well-being, including the spiritual; therefore, it could not be measured 
by purely economic growth.  In order to promote holistic growth, people, particularly the 
most vulnerable, should be the protagonists of their own development. Maria Mercedes 
Rossi presented two of her organization&#8217;s projects in Zambia (the Rainbow Project and the 
Chichetekelo Youth Project) as examples of people-centred, participatory development in 
which community participation was critical to successful development outcomes. In her 
view, development entailed providing individuals and communities with opportunities to 
express themselves and empowering them to pursue their own objectives. 
</p>
<p>17. Robert Moulias, President of All&#244; maltraitance des personnes &#226;gees et/ou des 
personnes handicap&#233;es, discussed the importance of the active participation of older 
persons in society. He emphasized that populations were ageing worldwide and described 
examples of efforts to promote active ageing. Keeping physically and mentally active and </p>


<p>participating in society were the main factors for promoting mental and physical well-being 
and preventing age related diseases. Astrid Stuckelberger, Chair of the NGO (non-
governmental organization) Committee on Ageing, argued that growing populations of 
older persons required profound and immediate attention from the United Nations. 
Population ageing and the human rights of older persons should be world priorities both of 
their own right, and in order to address the impacts of transgenerational poverty on 
development. She called for increased participation of older persons in development 
processes and the protection of their rights through the adoption of international policies on 
ageing, the appointment of a Special Rapporteur on ageing and the drafting of a convention 
on the rights of older persons.  
</p>
<p>18. Ramona Constantin, a community worker at the Big Life Company, told her story as 
a Roma woman from Romania who had immigrated to the United Kingdom in search of 
better opportunities for herself and her child. She emphasized the difficulties she had faced 
in adapting to a new culture, learning a new language and securing housing and 
employment. Given these difficulties, the training and employment opportunities offered to 
her by the non-profit Big Life Company had been truly life-altering as she succeeded in 
moving from a desperate situation to becoming a community worker who helped other 
Roma women in need. She highlighted the importance of empowering people through 
opportunity, education and participation.  
</p>
<p>19. In the interactive dialogue that followed, representatives of the International 
Movement ATD Fourth World and North-South XXI emphasized that participation was key 
to development, referring to the guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, 
which identified concrete procedures for guaranteeing the participation in development of 
individuals living in extreme poverty. They also questioned how to balance the aspirations 
for greater participation of older persons with the need to ensure the participation of youth, 
particularly with regards to economic opportunities.  
</p>
<p>20. In concluding remarks, Robert Moulias argued that increasing the participation of 
older persons and youths were not competing goals because older people could benefit 
youth by sharing their experience and caring for them. Maria Mercedes Rossi shared the 
view that community participation should include all people, including the voiceless, and 
described the efforts undertaken by her association in this regard. Virginia Dandan 
emphasized the need to respect indigenous cultures, while at the same time encouraging all 
indigenous persons, particularly women and youth, to speak up.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Democratic governance 
</b></p>
<p>21. Alfred de Zayas, the Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and 
equitable international order, stressed the need for the objective and consistent application 
of international law to promote his mandate. The Charter of the United Nations should be 
seen as a global constitution that established an international legal order by which Member 
States were bound. Democracy at the international level was a critical element of this 
international legal order that depended on the meaningful participation of all peoples and 
States in global governance. As constituent components of the international legal order, 
States had to operate in compliance with principles of democratic governance and 
representativeness to promote a democratic and equitable international order. The 
Independent Expert highlighted that education, freedom of opinion and the right to 
information, among other things, were critical pillars of State support for a democratic and 
equitable international order. 
</p>
<p>22. Obiora Okafor, member of the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, argued 
that poverty often originated with inadequate local democratic governance related to 
divisions between decision-makers and local stakeholders.  He emphasized the potential of </p>


<p>the interpretation by the African Commission on Human and People&#8217;s Rights of the right to 
development (article 22 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights) in the 
<i>Endorois</i> case, to bridge this divide and facilitate poverty reduction. The <i>Endorois</i> decision, 
by vesting the right to development in a sub-State group (the Endorois People), set a 
precedent for rethinking  the organization and governance of African States, especially with 
regard to control over natural resources. Implementation of this decision would increase 
local control over resources and participation in decision-making processes, thereby 
resulting in improved development outcomes.  
</p>
<p>23. Koen De Feyter, a professor at the University of Antwerp, discussed his research on 
the invocation of human rights by marginalized social groups. He studied the origins of 
human rights claims in some communities, the impacts of these claims on the communities, 
and the development of community knowledge about human rights. He found that NGOs 
were often responsible for translating community demands into human rights language. 
However, the concept of human rights understood by claimants might be influenced by 
local traditions and might not necessarily reflect international understandings of the same 
rights. Still, by employing a common human rights language, these groups engaged the 
international community with significant impacts. The degree to which local communities 
brought human rights into play at the international level was often critical to the success of 
their claims. This meant that both local authorities and international institutions played an 
important role in guaranteeing human rights, and the synergistic coordination of their 
efforts, guided by cultural understanding, was critical. 
</p>
<p>24. In the ensuing interactive dialogue, representatives of North-South XXI and the 
Ligue marocaine pour la citoyennet&#233; et les droits de l&#8217;homme discussed inadequate 
democratic governance at the international level, including in international financial 
institutions and the United Nations Security Council. The discussion emphasized the 
importance of access to information, freedom of the press, transparency, integrity and 
accountability for democratic governance.  
</p>
<p>25. In concluding remarks, Alfred de Zayas agreed that institutional reform of the 
United Nations and access to information were critical to the promotion of a more 
democratic and equitable international order. Obiora Okafor expressed concern that non-
democratic governance at the World Bank could lead to policies that exacerbate poverty, 
and called for the meaningful and equitable participation of civil society and all States in 
decision-making. Koen De Feyter argued that proponents of democratic reforms to 
international mechanisms should consider the potential impacts and form of a human rights 
approach to the reform of the Security Council and the World Bank. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Social movements 
</b></p>
<p>26. Gustavo Massiah, member of the International Council of the World Social Forum, 
discussed social movements as a corrective response to multiple crises. He argued that the 
global financial crisis was a symptom of underlying ecological, ideological and regulatory 
crises. Occupy Wall Street, the World Social Forum, the indigenous peoples&#8217; rights 
</p>
<p>movement and other movements were responding to structural and systemic causes of 
crises. Therefore, the international community should pay heed to social movements as they 
could help identify possible solutions to global crises.  
</p>
<p>27. Pascale Delille, researcher at the Universit&#233; Blaise Pascal, maintained that social and 
solidarity economies were organized around providing social benefits to people. This 
contrasted with traditional economies where competition, efficiency and profit were the 
main driving forces. In traditional economies, reduced economic diversity could lead to 
economic imbalance and undermine self-sufficiency. In social and solidarity economies, 
local self-sufficiency and community involvement provided greater resilience to crises. </p>


<p>There were no shareholders to demand consistent growth and consumers made socially 
conscious, informed decisions. Growing support for fair trade, eco-tourism, microcredits, 
recycling and ethical banking was a response to flaws in the traditional economy. Pascale 
Delille also described a community banking project in a favela in Fortaleza, Brazil that 
created a new community currency and produced significant community-based 
development as a potential alternative to the traditional economy.  
</p>
<p>28. Alain Yvergniaux, Special Adviser for International Affairs to the Office of the 
President of the Brittany Region (France), highlighted the potential of regional and local 
economic development models to address structural flaws in the global economy. He 
described Britanny&#8217;s cooperation in local development projects in Burkina Faso and Mali. 
</p>
<p>These projects promoted greater self-sufficiency amongst local farmers by providing them 
with the technical and organizational assistance necessary to access global markets in fair 
trade cotton, form cooperatives and decrease their dependency on imported foods. He 
emphasized empowering people to pursue their own economic development by helping 
them at the start-up stage. This type of assistance, powered by regional and local social and 
solidarity economies, could transform communities even in the absence of international 
consensus. The Special Adviser argued for the creation of networks that brought together 
different peoples and skills to realize positive development results.  
</p>
<p>29. Euchang Jun and Hyewon Jeon, student activists from the Republic of Korea, 
presented the youth rights movement in their country, its activities, organizational structure, 
major challenges and some of its achievements, notably the passage of a students&#8217; rights 
ordinance. 
</p>
<p>30. During the interactive dialogue, the Independent Expert on human rights and 
international solidarity and representatives of Ariel Foundation International, the 
International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse, Webster University and the Ligue 
marocaine pour la citoyennet&#233; et les droits de l&#8217;homme discussed several issues such as 
ensuring the engagement of all actors &#8211; especially States &#8211; in economic development 
processes, the role of the State in social and solidarity economies, and solidarity with social 
movements facing repression.  
</p>
<p>31. In concluding remarks, Gustavo Massiah agreed that States should play an active 
role in development, but noted that independent social movements often transcended State 
lines and catalyzed political change. Alain Yvergniaux held the view that the regional 
approach to development involved multilevel governance aspects and required active 
collaboration between State and local governments, not rivalry. Pascale Delille shared the 
view that State and local laws could and should coexist and mutually reinforce each other.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Social movements and w</b>omen&#8217;s <b>rights 
</b></p>
<p>32. Shreen Abdul Saroor, founder of the Mannar Women&#8217;s Development Federation in 
Sri Lanka, addressed women&#8217;s rights, development policy and peacebuilding in a post-war 
situation. She explained that the civil war in Sri Lanka had had devastating impacts on 
family structures as many families lost members, predominantly men, during the conflict. 
Many single and widowed women were now the primary income earners for their families. 
The impacts on women in the war-torn North and East of the island had been particularly 
severe. Women in these regions suffered from inadequate access to natural resources, basic 
amenities and services necessary for their livelihoods. Typical obstacles for women, which 
were often compounded by discrimination and customary practices, included domestic 
violence, denial of effective access to and control of land, and the inability to access 
essential services. While the economic and security situation in the country had improved 
since the end of the war, there remained an urgent need to ensure equal rights for and the 
economic empowerment of women. The Mannar Women&#8217;s Development Federation </p>


<p>capitalized on the strength and resilience of its members by collectively organizing them to 
secure their land rights, pool resources for rebuilding and advocate post-war development 
policies that addressed discrimination and inequality in society and reconstruction.  
</p>
<p>33. Manal Alsharif, a women&#8217;s rights activist and blogger in Saudi Arabia, discussed the 
use of social media and information and communication technologies to promote women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights. She observed that social media was a powerful tool for change in Saudi Arabia, 
particularly with regards to women&#8217;s empowerment, and also continued to play a critical 
role in the Arab Spring. In her campaign to overturn the prohibition against women drivers 
in Saudi Arabia, she had used Youtube and Twitter to post pictures of herself driving, 
garner international media attention and galvanize support. The women&#8217;s rights movement 
</p>
<p>in Saudi Arabia continued to use social media to fight for women&#8217;s dignity and full 
citizenship.  
</p>
<p>34. Priti Darooka, Executive Director of the Programme on Women&#8217;s Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights in India, argued that society had to surpass the false narrative of women 
as victims and recognize women as economic actors, workers and producers that support 
their families and communities, often by providing basic necessities such as food, water, 
fuel, health care and social security. She asserted that the unpaid work typically undertaken 
by women was undervalued by society in spite of its critical importance. Priti Darooka 
advocated the recognition of a right to livelihood that encompassed more than the right to 
work, the right to property or the right to income-earning assets, and was founded on 
fundamental human dignity. She argued that dignity should be further explored as an 
operational concept, as it would lead to greater recognition of the social and economic 
value of women&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>35. In the interactive dialogue that followed, Myrna Cunningham from the Permanent 
Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Independent Expert on human rights and international 
solidarity, and representatives of Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, the Association of World 
Citizens, the People&#8217;s Health Movement, Webster University and the Ligue marocaine pour 
la citoyennet&#233; et les droits de l&#8217;homme intervened. Speakers addressed the unequal access 
of women to social media, the exploitation of women in rural areas, the role of livelihoods 
in eradicating poverty amongst rural indigenous women, the need to comprehensively 
address violence against women and its structural and institutional causes, the importance 
of participation in guaranteeing women&#8217;s collective and individual rights, the role of civil 
</p>
<p>society in promoting women&#8217;s rights, Sri Lanka&#8217;s efforts to safeguard the rights of women 
</p>
<p>and children and to integrate gender perspectives in assistance programmes, and 
government measures taken to improve the enjoyment of rights by women in Saudi Arabia, 
including access to social media. 
</p>
<p>36. In concluding remarks, Manal Alsharif emphasized the importance of rights 
awareness, education and economic empowerment for realizing women&#8217;s rights in Saudi 
</p>
<p>Arabia and the world. Shreen Abdul Saroor noted that Sri Lanka&#8217;s assistance to women 
often took the form of monetary reparations that were inadequate and did not restore human 
dignity or account for pre-existing inequalities. Priti Darooka highlighted the importance of 
learning from different cultures and called for the balancing of collective and individual 
rights through participatory processes. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Coherent mobilization of all sources of financing for development 
</b></p>
<p>37. Gemma Adaba, Advisory Board Member of Social Justice in Global Development 
and Representative of the People&#8217;s Movement for Human Rights Learning, discussed 
official development assistance, aid effectiveness and South&#8211;South cooperation. She 
described the evolution in development assistance from the aid effectiveness agenda of the 
Paris Declaration (2005) to the Accra Agenda for Action (2008) and finally, the Busan </p>


<p>Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (2011), which articulated an 
increasingly comprehensive vision of development partnership that was inclusive of South&#8211;
South cooperation and civil society. In July 2012, in follow-up to Busan, a number of 
development partners agreed to a governance and monitoring framework to maximize 
effective development cooperation. The Busan Partnership called for recipient countries to 
direct development efforts, the streamlining of conditionalities, enhanced parliamentary 
scrutiny, women&#8217;s empowerment and local and transparent procurement processes. 
According to Gemma Adaba, development effectiveness should be judged in terms of 
compliance with the core principles of people-centred, rights-based development, a view 
which was increasingly shared by the international community. 
</p>
<p>38. Jean Saldanha, Policy and Advocacy Officer on Resources for Development at 
Coop&#233;ration internationale pour le d&#233;veloppement et la solidarit&#233;, advocated the use of 
financial transactions taxes (FTTs) to meet the financial demands of satisfying human 
rights obligations. She argued for a more progressive, redistributive fiscal policy both 
nationally and globally to promote an enabling environment for development. Value added 
taxes and taxes on labour were the most common source of government revenue and the 
financial sector was comparatively undertaxed. She described FTTs as a potential solution 
to this inequity, noting that many countries already employed different variants of FTTs 
without significant negative consequences. New FTTs could raise considerable revenue, 
reintroduce a measure of equality and progressivity in taxation systems, and help 
Governments meet their legal obligation to commit the maximum available resources to 
respect, protect and fulfil human rights. In order for this to work, funds derived from FTTs 
should be designated for fulfilment of human rights, including the right to development, 
and allocated pursuant to a participatory process. Jean Saldanha concluded by 
recommending the integration of an FTT within the post-2015 development framework.  
</p>
<p>39. Fran&#231;ois Mercier, Desk Officer for Financing for Development and Programme 
Officer on the Democratic Republic of Congo at Fastenopfer (the Swiss Catholic Lenten 
Fund), described the negative development impacts of illicit financial flows, including the 
proceeds of bribery, theft, trafficking, trade mispricing and tax evasion. The majority of 
illicit financial flows out of developing countries were the result of tax evasion and 
mispricing rather than bribery, theft, and other causes. He presented a study of Glencore, a 
company involved in mining activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as an 
example. The study showed that Glencore activities contributed to severe environmental 
damage and social conflict, and that a large portion of Glencore&#8217;s profits were shifted to tax 
havens with resulting losses of revenue by the Democratic Republic of Congo. Francois 
Mercier argued that tax evasion threatened progress toward the Millennium Development 
Goals and recommended the promotion of initiatives such as the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative and other measures to improve transparency and accountability. 
Finally, he called for the strengthening of the Committee of Experts on International 
Cooperation in Tax Matters.  
</p>
<p>40. In the ensuing interactive dialogue, representatives of Social Justice in Global 
Development, the Association of World Citizens, the People&#8217;s Health Movement, North-
South XXI and Espace Afrique International discussed strengthening the Committee of 
Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters, the impact of intellectual property 
laws on South&#8211;South cooperation, funding development through FTTs and the role of 
diasporas, migrant workers and remittances in contributing resources for development. 
</p>
<p>41. In concluding remarks, Fran&#231;ois Mercier agreed that the Committee of Experts on 
International Cooperation in Tax Matters should be strengthened, but noted that this was a 
political matter dependent upon Member States. Gemma Adaba discussed the need to 
continue to expand the role of South&#8211;South cooperation in providing access to low-cost 
generic drugs and also emphasized the importance of improving tax cooperation. Jean </p>


<p>Saldanha reiterated her argument in favour of using an FTT to generate revenues for the 
post-2015 development agenda and proposed as a first step that the Human Rights Council 
initiate a study of the issue.  
</p>
<p><b> G. The international financial system and enhancing a globally enabling 
</b></p>
<p><b>environment for development   
</b></p>
<p>42. Isabel Ortiz, Associate Director of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, summarized 
two recent publications she had worked on: <i>A Recovery for All: Rethinking Socio-Economic 
Policies for Children and Poor Households</i> and &#8220;Be outraged: there are alternatives&#8221;.  The 
publications analysed the social impacts of the financial and economic crisis and suggested 
socially responsible approaches to recovery. In her presentation, the Associate Director 
illustrated the dramatic inequality between the richest and poorest quintiles of the world 
population, rising unemployment and cuts to public expenditures. She argued that 
prevailing macroeconomic policies, which valued labour flexibility and reflected the 
demands of international financial institutions, threatened people&#8217;s livelihoods. For 
example, implementing austerity measures in response to crises reduced social protections 
when they were most needed and exacerbated inequalities. Instead, Governments should 
consider alternatives including reallocating expenditures, increasing tax revenues, lobbying 
for aid/transfers, tapping into fiscal and foreign exchange reserves, borrowing, restructuring 
existing debt and transforming the financial sector to respond to the needs of the real 
economy. She emphasized that there were viable, rights-based alternatives to the current 
austerity response to financial crises that could address inequality, promote an equitable 
recovery and maintain and improve social protections.  
</p>
<p>43. Collins Magalasi, Executive Director of the African Forum and Network on Debt 
and Development, discussed excessive sovereign debt as a problem of developed and 
developing countries alike. The Euro zone crisis revealed the social and political 
consequences of excessive sovereign debt and the increased vulnerability of all States to 
debt crises as a result of the financial crisis. He argued that current lending practices were 
biased toward creditors, permitted irresponsible lending, failed to adequately consider 
human rights and development implications and had contributed to a significant rise in 
sovereign debt disputes, including disputes between developing countries. These concerns 
illustrated the need for an international mechanism to comprehensively and effectively 
address sovereign debt problems. He recommended setting up an independent, fair and 
transparent sovereign debt arbitration mechanism and adopting principles for responsible 
borrowing and lending in line with those recommended by the African Forum and Network 
on Debt and Development, the European Network on Debt and Development, or the United 
Nations Conference on Trade and Development in this area. 
</p>
<p>44. Manual Montes, Senior Adviser on Finance and Development at the South Centre, 
claimed that current financial rules were inimical to economic development in poor 
countries. Dependence on volatile private financial flows restricted the policy space of 
developing States, as entrenched commercial interests advantaged by existing financial 
rules obstructed policy changes. The global system encouraged competition among nations 
over trade and private investment even though trade and private investment were volatile 
and inadequate as sole bases for development. In the context of global competition, 
developing country Governments were seriously constrained in efforts to mobilize domestic 
resources for their own development. Manual Montes recommended financial reforms to 
reduce excessive competition among and between corporations and Governments and the 
reform of international organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund, to better 
protect developing countries. He asserted that the international community had to overcome 
crises in politics, policy and morality to undertake systemic financial regulatory reform. </p>


<p>45. In the ensuing interactive dialogue, representatives of the Associazione Comunit&#224; 
Papa Giovanni XXIII, Social Justice in Global Development, North-South XXI and 
Webster University discussed, among other issues, the creation of a coordination 
mechanism among relevant Special Rapporteurs, Independent Experts and the Human 
Rights Council Advisory Committee to discuss issues of globalization, global governance, 
international solidarity and sustainable development; the appointment of a Special 
Rapporteur on globalization and global governance; ensuring that human rights were taken 
into account at meetings of the Group of 20; international mechanisms for improving tax 
collection; and corruption as a cause of debt problems. 
</p>
<p>46. In concluding remarks, Collins Magalasi reiterated his call for the establishment of a 
sovereign debt workout mechanism, proposing that the United Nations and its relevant 
agencies and human rights mechanisms should design and host such a mechanism. Isabel 
Ortiz emphasized the need to galvanize political will in favour of alternative 
macroeconomic policies. Manuel Montes called for neutral international mechanisms to 
promote solidarity, good governance and transparency in the international financial system. 
In summarizing the discussion, Jean Saldanha called for placing human rights at the centre 
of the global development paradigm and the response to the financial crisis by restructuring 
the banking system, promoting equitable and effective taxation, and improving global 
financial governance.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Round table: Strengthening the global partnership for development  
</b></p>
<p>47. C&#233;cile Molinier, Director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
in Geneva, stressed that the global partnership for development should be based on 
inclusive dialogue among all relevant stakeholders. In this respect, achieving human rights, 
reducing inequalities and hearing the voices of people and civil society were fundamental. 
At UNDP, the majority of resources for development were at the country level; therefore, 
UNDP encouraged local ownership. C&#233;cile Molinier highlighted the need to reflect on 
global governance and to continuously improve the programming work of the United 
Nations because much remained to be done to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, 
particularly Goal 8. She noted, for example, declining levels of official development 
assistance and called for the fulfilment of development commitments. She also emphasized 
the need to improve the quality of existing aid. In this regard, domestic factors like the 
strength of civil society, democratic processes, the rule of law and rights compliance were 
important. Finally, she called upon OHCHR and UNDP to continue working together on 
the post-2015 development agenda and on the identification of means to strengthen 
accountability, policy coherence and governance in development efforts. 
</p>
<p>48. Ali Jazairy, Head of the Innovation and Technology Transfer Section of the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), highlighted the contributions of innovation and 
intellectual property to the global partnership for development. Modern information 
technology had improved speed, quality, coherence and referenceability, reduced costs, 
made intellectual property a means for promoting global partnership, and permitted 
increasingly innovative partnerships between large research and development teams from 
corporations, States and academia working together through network processes. Expanding 
access to information and communication technologies had promoted the rapid 
dissemination of knowledge and a shifting paradigm of innovation where contributions 
increasingly came from new regions. In this sense, the notion of intellectual partnership 
might gradually replace the notion of intellectual property and innovation and serve to 
integrate people in development processes. WIPO had recommended the development of 
collaborative networks and innovation platforms to connect multiple actors and resources in 
the production of mutually beneficial solutions to common problems. </p>


<p>49. Stephen Pursey, Director of the Policy Integration Department and Senior Adviser to 
the Director-General at the International Labour Organization (ILO), linked the 
strengthening of the global partnership for development with a rights-based approach to 
development. He stated that, for most people, a decent job was the key to a decent life as 
their sense of identity and self-respect, their economic and food security, and the realization 
of their capabilities might all depend on their employment. This meant that improved 
access to decent employment could be one lens through which to approach the global 
partnership for development. The 2008 ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair 
Globalization was a fundamental reference in this regard. The tripartite structure of the ILO 
could address working conditions and social justice through negotiation. Stephen Pursey 
also stressed the importance of a social protection floor and of the 1998 ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work which committed Member States to respect and 
promote freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, to eliminate forced 
labour and child labour, and to eradicate discrimination in employment. He concluded by 
calling for more attention to be paid to the right to work and human rights at work in the 
context of the global partnership for development. 
</p>
<p>50. Hans-Peter Werner, Counsellor in the Development Division of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), stated that the WTO contributed to development by promoting 
predictable and non-discriminatory trade agreements, reducing trade barriers and ensuring 
equal access to markets. He emphasized that many developing countries were members of 
the WTO, which had taken steps to address the special needs of least developed countries, 
facilitate access to affordable medicines and promote technology transfer. The WTO, as 
part of the United Nations Task Team for the post-2015 development agenda, was an active 
member of the global partnership that collaborated with multiple agencies to articulate a 
comprehensive approach to development. Although this work was valuable, Hans-Peter 
Werner stated that member States retained the ultimate responsibility for defining and 
promoting an effective global partnership based on common positions and goals.  
</p>
<p>51. Sarah Cook, Director of the United Nations Research Institute for Social 
Development, discussed the importance of research in addressing challenges to social 
development in a globalizing world. She highlighted the importance of taking a holistic 
approach to social development and improved human well-being, particularly with regards 
to social institutions. Integrating economic and social aspects, adopting people-centred 
approaches complementary to basic economic rights, and looking at the functioning of 
institutional arrangements and their social constructions were fundamental to strengthen the 
global partnership for development. While trade unions and social movements played an 
essential role in the historical recognition of human rights, the continuing role of these 
institutions as forces for development had been neglected. Instead, Sarah Cook asserted that 
liberalization had given significant power to institutions that might not be accountable for 
social justice and human rights. She called for the restoration of social institutions, the 
development of social indicators and the prioritization of employment policy.  
</p>
<p>52. During the interactive dialogue, the independent expert on human rights and 
international solidarity, Isabel Ortiz, Xigen Wang (Professor and Vice-Dean of the Wuhan 
University Law School in China) and representatives from North-South XXI, Associazione 
Comunit&#224; Papa Giovanni XXIII, Social Justice in Global Development, the Ligue 
marocaine pour la citoyennet&#233; et les droits de l&#8217;homme and Espace Afrique International 
discussed, inter alia, the proliferation of bilateral trade and investment agreements that 
circumvented international obligations, the need for alternatives to the WTO trade model, 
the importance of rights-based development, and potential improvements of Millennium 
Development Goal 8 and the global partnership for development (e.g. the elaboration of 
further indicators to measure the implementation of Goal 8). Goal 8 was criticized for 
failing to address partnership on the basis of equality and narrowly focusing on 
development aid considerations instead of the ultimate goal of fulfilling human rights. It </p>


<p>was suggested that development cooperation should be based on equal partnership and the 
global partnership for development should be reformulated as an &#8220;international solidarity&#8221; 
goal. Finally, it was recommended that specialists in different areas, including economists 
and lawyers, should address social impacts and human rights aspects of economic decisions 
by working together. 
</p>
<p>53. In concluding remarks, Hans-Peter Werner referred to the flexibilities of the 
Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights as one means of 
ensuring access to essential medicines. He also clarified that the WTO did not monitor 
bilateral agreements for which States had the primary responsibility. However, the trade 
policy review mechanism did allow member States to question a State&#8217;s actions or inactions 
regarding human rights issues. C&#233;cile Molinier underlined the narrow scope of the current 
Goal 8 indicators related to trade, debt, access to medicine and transfer of technology and 
called for the post-2015 framework to promote human rights, equality and sustainability. 
She observed that significant progress has been made regarding human rights 
mainstreaming at the country level, where the United Nations continued to improve inter-
agency collaboration and promote ownership. Ali Jazairy emphasized the role of WIPO in 
facilitating technology transfer through different research platforms. He indicated that 
WIPO had a programme on reducing patent-related fees for least developed countries, and 
that many intellectual property rights in the domain of technology relevant to climate 
change had expired. WIPO was also working on a mechanism to protect traditional 
medicine and on a definition of technology transfer that incorporated the transfer of 
relevant technical expertise. Stephen Pursey emphasized the importance of the social 
protection floor, particularly with regards to the half of the global workforce that was 
informally employed. According to him, guaranteeing the four critical components of the 
social protection floor &#8211; an old age and disability pension; access to basic health care; 
support for children&#8217;s nutrition, education and health; and support for the unemployed &#8211; 
would only cost 2&#8211;4 per cent of gross domestic product and would have far-reaching 
economic and social benefits. Sarah Cook called for a new approach to development 
founded in solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Promoting sustainable development in the era of globalization 
</b></p>
<p>54. Angelica Navarro, Permanent Representative of the Plurinational State of Bolivia to 
the United Nations Office in Geneva, stated that global crises resulted from capitalist, 
materialist thinking and called for a paradigm shift in development approaches. She 
highlighted the concept of <i>vivir bien</i> (&#8220;living well&#8221;) as an alternative to the capitalist 
paradigm of &#8220;living better&#8221;. The latter concept implied self-interested improvement through 
the exploitation of Mother Earth and regardless of the cost to others. This approach failed to 
benefit the majority of people. Living well meant living in harmony with the cycles of 
Mother Earth, the cycles of history and all forms of life. It required listening and sharing. 
This holistic approach to living appeared in all indigenous languages and cultures. It 
included principles such as collective work, reciprocity, solidarity, respect, dignity, social 
justice and harmony. The Permanent Representative argued that by incorporating this 
traditional approach to development within its official policies and embracing legal 
pluralism, the Plurinational State of Bolivia had achieved great development successes. To 
illustrate this, she presented statistical data which highlighted poverty reduction, increased 
economic growth and improved education outcomes in her country.  
</p>
<p>55. Stephen Hale, Deputy and Advocacy Campaigns Director at Oxfam International, 
described the difficult context for global development efforts including the negative 
impacts of the economic crisis, the inequitable distribution of power and weaknesses in the 
multilateral system that make it difficult to seek global solutions to global problems. He 
highlighted the need to promote coherence and build alliances for change. Humanity </p>


<p>already consumed more than the world could produce in a sustainable manner, and 
therefore, making sustainable development a reality would require a new approach.  
Stephen Hale presented the nine planetary boundaries constraints framework for 
sustainability which was employed by Oxfam and included factors like biodiversity loss 
and climate change. He argued that we had to determine how we should live within these 
boundaries and identify the connections between social challenges and planetary 
boundaries. Oxfam aimed to promote inclusive and sustainable economic development, 
based on eleven priorities, namely food, water, income, education, resilience, voice, jobs, 
energy, social equity, gender equality and health within the planetary boundaries. This 
framework addressed the issue of coherence between sustainability and development goals 
and identified a policy space for the realization of sustainable, rights-based development.  
</p>
<p>56. Dashdolgor Dolgorsuren, Head of Foreign Relations of the Health Agency in Bulgan 
Province (Mongolia), described the traditional lifestyle of nomadic peoples in Mongolia as 
one of harmony between human beings, nature and livestock. However, a number of 
internal and external changes, most recently the transition from a centralized economy to a 
market economy and globalization, had both positively and negatively impacted the 
nomadic way of life. Mineral exploitation, for example, had led to the destruction of 
pastoral land and pollution that affected humans and animals alike, presenting unique 
public health problems. It was difficult to ensure access to health services for nomadic 
peoples and herders who, as part of the informal economy, were excluded from traditional 
health care insurance schemes. In this context, the promotion of sustainable, rights-based 
development required a multi-faceted approach that integrated the human rights concerns of 
nomadic peoples, ensured their active, free and meaningful participation in development, 
and fairly distributed the benefits of development. 
</p>
<p>57. During the interactive dialogue, representatives from International Movement ATD 
Fourth World, the Association of World Citizens and the People&#8217;s Health Movement 
discussed the need for active participation in development by all persons, the connection 
between people&#8217;s health and the environment, and the inclusion of human rights in the post-
2015 development agenda. The concept of sustainable livelihoods was proposed as a 
potential theme for the 2013 Social Forum. 
</p>
<p>58. In her concluding remarks, Angelica Navarro stated that foreign investors seeking to 
exploit natural resources in Bolivia had to do so in compliance with national laws and as 
development partners. She also called for the coherent and consistent promotion of human 
rights. Dashdolgor Dolgorsuren elaborated on the challenges and significance of facilitating 
participation by nomadic herders. Stephen Hale discussed the importance of outreach to 
make the voices of the poorest heard.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Innovative approaches to development and globalization 
</b></p>
<p>59. Yoandra Muro Valle, Vice-Rector of the Latin American School of Medicine in 
Havana, described Cuba&#8217;s international development cooperation efforts in the area of 
health. Her presentation traced Cuba&#8217;s history of international medical cooperation from its 
inception to the present, describing numerous health cooperation activities, projects and 
achievements. For more than 50 years, the Cuban National Public Health System had 
provided care to people of different countries through its Health Cooperation Programmes 
which, in the spirit of international solidarity, sent medical professionals equipped with 
medicine, materials and expertise to developing countries in need. Cuba had also assisted in 
the training of numerous foreign medical professionals. Yoandra Muro Valle  emphasized 
that this example of South&#8211;South cooperation based on the model of solidarity, not 
competition, was the type of development assistance needed today.  </p>


<p>60. Jorge M. Dias Ferreira, representing the NGO New Humanity, described his vision 
for a development paradigm based on solidarity and integrity. Profit, efficiency and 
productivity should not be the primary aims of development as they reduced people into 
means of production and did not always improve their well-being.  The elevation of these 
values above others by the neoliberal agenda had led to multiple crises, including a 
psychological crisis, that had to be dealt with in a comprehensive interdisciplinary fashion. 
He claimed that the basic purpose of States as political communities was to enable the 
societies and peoples that composed States to be masters of their own destinies. In order to 
realize this purpose, he solicited a new development paradigm that promoted solidarity and 
integral development and prevented serious human rights abuses. In this regard, he called 
for prioritizing human beings over possessions, and ethics and human rights over 
economics. 
</p>
<p>61. Xigen Wang, Professor and Vice-Dean of the Wuhan University Law School in 
China, spoke about challenges and prospects for implementing the right to development in 
the aftermath of the global financial crisis. He described several obstacles to the realization 
of the right to development including exchange rate volatility, reduced overseas investment 
and trade, excessive debts, rising poverty rates, higher unemployment, reduced economic 
growth and increased social inequality. In order to address these obstacles, he suggested 
interpreting the right to development as people-centred development with social justice, and 
developing a comprehensive strategy for its implementation, including in the financial 
sector. He further argued for additional emphasis on the links between the right to 
development and other human rights. Finally, he called for the elaboration and passage of a 
convention on the right to development as part of a comprehensive development obligation 
system that included endogenous obligations (ethics and institutions) and instrumental 
obligations (contracts and a convention).  
</p>
<p>62. In the ensuing interactive dialogue, Myrna Cunningham and representatives of 
China, ONG Hope International, North-South XXI, the Association of World Citizens, the 
People&#8217;s Health Movement and the South Asian Feminist Alliance took the floor. Speakers 
discussed issues such as land grabbing, farmers&#8217; rights, the principle of common but 
differentiated responsibilities of States, country-specific implementation of the right to 
development, innovative approaches to promoting traditional indigenous knowledge, 
South&#8211;South cooperation, the equitable distribution of the benefits of commerce, 
democratizing international institutions, international solidarity, the importance of 
education and equality of opportunity for health and development, and the recognition of 
women as economic agents and individual rights holders. It was also proposed that the 
Human Rights Council consider establishing a mechanism to address the concrete 
recommendations of the Social Forum. 
</p>
<p>63. In concluding remarks, Yoandra Muro Valle stressed that morals had to come before 
economics. While drawing up budgets, it was important to take into account the moral 
impact and the societal benefits of expenditures. The overall goal should be a better quality 
of life. Jorge M. Dias Ferreira highlighted the humanist dimension of the right to 
development, and the interdependence and interdisciplinary nature of the challenges of 
today. He stressed that the spiritual dimension of development had not been subject to 
adequate consideration. Xigen Wang elaborated on the effects of the financial crisis on 
China and made recommendations on how to overcome the impact of the crisis through 
people-centred development.  </p>


<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>To conclude the Social Forum, Martin Khor offered a summary of the 
proceedings which was followed by the Chairperson-</b>Rapporteur&#8217;s closing 
</p>
<p><b>recommendations. These recommendations are reflected in the sections that follow. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>In the era of globalization, society must develop a new people-centred 
development paradigm founded in principles of human rights, equality, solidarity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainability. People-centred development should address the entirety of the human 
</b></p>
<p><b>condition and promote mental, physical and spiritual well-being in addition to 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic growth. The continued discussion and elaboration of concepts addressed by 
</b></p>
<p><b>this Social Forum, including sustainable development, integral and humanist 
</b></p>
<p><b>development, participatory development, <i>buen vivir</i> and financing for development, 
</b></p>
<p><b>offer guidance along this path. People-centred development requires both local 
</b></p>
<p><b>control over development priorities and a globally enabling environment for 
</b></p>
<p><b>development. Adequate participation of all persons at all levels of governance, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to information, education, credit, work and adequate support networks are 
</b></p>
<p><b>critical to the spread of ideas, the empowerment of persons and movements, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>success of people-centred development.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>People-centred development requires recognition of the value of human dignity, 
livelihoods and work as foundations for human well-being. Measures should be taken 
</b></p>
<p><b>to guarantee that all persons have access to the basic resources necessary for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>constant improvement of their well-being. Particular attention should be devoted to 
</b></p>
<p><b>potentially marginalized or underrepresented groups such as women, children, 
</b></p>
<p><b>minorities, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and older persons. They 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be engaged in decision-making processes at all levels that impact their lives, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and concrete measures should be taken to prevent structural inequalities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination from impeding their development.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The basic principle of solidarity, which applies equally to people and States, 
establishes that by working together we can accomplish more than if we work apart. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The financial and economic crisis of 2008 has highlighted our interdependence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>threatened the enjoyment of our human rights. It has never been more important that 
</b></p>
<p><b>we draw upon our common humanity to pursue a shared vision of a future in which 
</b></p>
<p><b>the enjoyment of all human rights, including the right to development, is realized for 
</b></p>
<p><b>all persons without discrimination. Social movements to pr</b>omote women&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p><b>intergenerational solidarity, fair trade, financial regulatory reform, social justice and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights embody solidarity in people-centred development and play a critical 
</b></p>
<p><b>role within our society that should be recognized and, where appropriate, honoured as 
</b></p>
<p><b>a valuable form of speech and participation. Millennium Development Goal</b> <b>8, which 
calls for a global partnership for development, also articulates the concept of 
</b></p>
<p><b>solidarity, but participants agreed it must be strengthened in order to promote, inter 
</b></p>
<p><b>alia, effective, locally controlled development assistance; information and technology 
</b></p>
<p><b>sharing; innovation; and good governance.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Failure to meet development goals is unacceptable because such failures stem 
from the inequitable distribution of resources rather than lack of resources, a 
</b></p>
<p><b>problem which is also linked to the inadequate representation of developing States, 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society and marginalized groups in international financial institutions and similar 
</b></p>
<p><b>failings in governance at the national and local levels. Therefore, good governance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the coherent mobilization of all sources of financing for development are critical. </b></p>


<p><b>Participants emphasized the potential of innovative sources of financing for 
</b></p>
<p><b>development, including South</b>&#8211;<b>South cooperation and financial transaction taxes, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>called for measures to promote international tax cooperation, combat tax evasion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent the flow of illicit funds and combat corruption.</b> <b>The right to development 
offers a development paradigm which can meet the challenges of a globalized and 
</b></p>
<p><b>multipolar world facing multiple crises, and a framework in which to address gaps 
</b></p>
<p><b>and failures in responsibility, accountability and regulation in both national and 
</b></p>
<p><b>global governance. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>States, international organizations and other development actors should act to 
promote people-centred development aimed at improved human well-being by 
</b></p>
<p><b>making human rights, including the right to development, the basis of development.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>States and all other stakeholders must act together for the promotion of 
sustained, inclusive and equitable development, good governance and participation at 
</b></p>
<p><b>all levels of decision-making, a national and international enabling environment for 
</b></p>
<p><b>development, and an accommodating macroeconomic framework. This must include 
</b></p>
<p><b>the reform of international institutions, particularly in the economic field, to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>the democratic representation of developing States, civil society and marginalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups.</b> 
</p>
<p>71. <b>Economic and social policies must recognize women as individual rights holders 
and not just as members of a family, household or group, and their marital status 
</b></p>
<p><b>should not have an impact on their entitlements. Women should be engaged in 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making processes at all levels that impact their lives, including in post-war 
</b></p>
<p><b>development and peacebuilding efforts. The lively engagement of young and old 
</b></p>
<p><b>people should also be supported in order to promote solidarity through the active 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of all persons in society.   
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Development policies must address discrimination and systemic and structural 
inequalities, and steps must be taken to engage marginalized or underrepresented 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups and peoples in decisions that affect them.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Effective actions should be taken to mitigate the damages caused by the global 
crisis and prevent its repetition, including by strengthening the social safety net, 
</b></p>
<p><b>restructuring the banking system and improving global financial governance.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>In order to promote the coherent mobilization of all resources for development, 
States should establish an international arbitration mechanism to resolve excessive 
</b></p>
<p><b>debts, and they should transform the Committee of Experts on International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cooperation in Tax Matters into an intergovernmental body that can make decisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and issue action-oriented resolutions, cooperate to restore illicit financial flows to 
</b></p>
<p><b>States of origin and promote equitable and efficient tax systems, including through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>adoption of financial transaction taxes to fund development priorities</b>.  
</p>
<p>75. <b>States should promote genuine participatory development by, inter alia, 
improving access to microcredit, information, education, decent employment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice, and encouraging social movements and community-level development. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Social Forum should continue to devote particular attention to the rights of potentially 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized or underrepresented groups such as women, children and youth, 
</b></p>
<p><b>minorities, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and older persons, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>through discussion of sustainable livelihoods</b>. </p>


<p>76. <b>Additional mechanisms should be explored to promote mainstreaming of the 
right to development, including draft operational guidelines for implementing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration on the Right to Development; a mechanism to connect the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>development, international human rights treaties, economic and trade laws; and a 
</b></p>
<p><b>high-level academic forum on the right to development. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Social Forum should inform and contribute to the post-2015 development 
agenda and the establishment of Sustainable Development Goals. Studies should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducted to examine the impact of the economic and financial crisis on the ability of 
</b></p>
<p><b>States to respect, protect and fulfil human rights.</b>  
</p>
<p>78. <b>States should promote increased participation of underrepresented States, 
groups and civil society organizations in international institutions, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>international financial institutions. For example, the Human Rights Council should 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish a mechanism to follow up on the recommendations of the Social Forum in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to further strengthen the voices of civil society organizations and those they 
</b></p>
<p><b>represent in international affairs.  </b></p>
