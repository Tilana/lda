PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Development and Summary
We were incorporated in Delaware on May 11, 2011. We cttrrently have no business operations or significant assets. We are
currently seeking to acquire a business.
Recent Corporate Developments
The following corporate developments have occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. and up to the date of the filing of
this report:
On March 15, 2014, we signed a letter of intent with Boomchat Inc. (“Boomchat”) to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of
the Common Stock of Boomchat in exchange for 36,000,000 shares of our Common Stock.
On March 27, 2014. we appointed Robert Fedun our treasurer to replace outgoing treasurer Caludio Ferrer. As a result of this
change, Robert Fedun is now our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and sole director.
On April 10v 2014{ we received total of $47,910 as subscription to 63,880 shares of our common stock at $0.75. These shares were
issued on August 8, 2014.

l


On April 11, 2014 Yan Ming Lui, our former executive officer and former director, entered into a share purchase agreement, With
Robert Fedun, olir sole executive officer and director. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, Mr. Yan Ming Lui
sold 36,000,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Fedun in consideration of the payment of $3,601.]. As a result of the closing of
the Share Purchase Agreement, Mr. Fedull now owns approximately 54.49% of our common stock and Mr. Yan Ming Lui no longer
owns any shares of our common stock. As a result, there has been a change in control of the Company.
On November 5, 2014, the Company announced a private placement of 500,000 units for gross proceeds of up to USD $250,000.00
at $0.50 per unit. Each unit will consist of one common share and one common share purchase warrant. Each warrant entitles the
holder to purchase one additional common share of the Company at a price of $0.75 per share for a period of one year.
Letter of Intent with Boomchat
On March 15, 2014‘ we entered into a letter of illtent (the “Letter of Intent") with Boomchat lllc. (“Boomchat”) whereby the
Company and Boomchat agreed to negotiate a definitive agreement (the "Definitive Agreement") with the purpose of completing a
business combination between the Company and Boomchat.
The Letter of Intent provides the proposed terms of the Definitive Agreement will be as follows:
(a) We will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Boomchat and in consideration of which, we will issue the

shareholders of Boomchat a total of 36000000 shares of olir common stock; and
(b) We will make the following cash payments to Boomchat:

(i) $50,000 upon signing a Deﬁnitive Agreement;

(ii) $100,000 on or before 30 days from the date of signing the Definitive Agreement: and

(iii) $100,000 on or before 60 days from the date of signing the Definitive Agreement
In conjunction with closing the transaction, Robert Fednn, our sole executive officer and director, will resign as an executive officer
and director, and Robert Coleridge, being the principal of Boomchat, will be appointed as our new Chief Executive Officer and
director.
The parties have agreed to enter into the Definitive Agreement by April ls, 2014 which is couditioiial upon each pany couductiiig
their due diligence on the financial condition. affairs and the assets of the other party, and obtaining results that are to their
satisfaction by the close of blisiness on March 30, 2014, which due diligence period can be extended by written consent of both
parties.
Booinchat Inc. is a private Nevada corporation that provides technology solutions to smartphoiie users worldwide Boomchat's
private image and video sharing solution is based on a newly developed scripting engine that can be deployed on multiple
platforms furthermorei it is writtell for secured cloud servers and can be deployed worldwide. The system will be available for
download as an application that can be installed on majority of smartphones and will enable its users to share private media on
demand and distribute it to controlled lists of recipients for preset time only
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not finalized our due diligence process and there is no assurance that it wtll result in
the Definitive Agreement.
In the evellt that the Definitive Agreement will not be consummated, we will continue to seek to acquire a business for our
company. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in finding or acquiring a viable target business. Furthermore, no
assurance can be given that any business opportunity, which does occur, will be on terms that are favorable to us or our current
stockholders.

z


Competition
Until we sign the Definitive Agreement. we will remain an insignificant participant among the firms that engage in the acquisition
of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial organizations which have significantly greater
financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. Ill View 0t~ our combined extremely limited financial
resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a signiticant competitive disadvantage compared to our
competitors.
We expect to encounter substantial competition in our efforts to locate attractive business combination opportunities. The
competition may in part come from business development companies venture capital partnerships and corporations small
investment Companiesv and brokerage firms. Some of these types of organizations are likely to be in a better position than our
company to obtain access to attractive business acquisition candidates either because they have greater experience resources and
managerial capabilities than we have. because they are able to offer immediate access to limited amounts of cash, or for a variety of
other reasons.
Patents/Trade MarksILicenses/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
We do not currently own any patents or trademarks. and are not party to any franchise agreements concessions or labor contracts.
Expenditures on Research and Development During the Last Two Fiscal Years
We have not spent any funds on research and development activtties in the last two fiscal years. and we are not currently conducting
any research and development activities.
Employees
As of the date of this Annual Report we do not have any etuployees. Management expects to use consultantsi attorneys and
accountants as necessary. and does not anticipate a need to engage any fullrllme etuployees so long as it is going through the due
diligence process on the possible transaction with Booinchat Inc. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in
connection with the decision whether or not the Definitive Agreement will be ratified as well as the future development of the
business.
Transfer Agent
We have engaged VStock Transfer LLC as our stock transfer agent, which is located at 77 Spruce Street, Suite 201‘ Cedarhlirst,
New York [1516. Their telephone number is (212) 82878436 and their tax nlimber is (646) 5363179. The transfer agent is
responsible for all recordekeeping and administrative functions in connection with our issued and outstanding common stock.
Description of Property
Our principal office is located at 9101 West Sahara Avenue{ Suite 105 e 197. Las Vegas{ Nevada 89117. We have been allowed to
operate out of such location at no cost to the Company. We believe that this space is adequate for oIir current and immediately
foreseeable operating needs. We do not have any policies regarding investments in real estate securities. or other form of property.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
The following are cenain risk faclors that could affect our business, financial position results of operations or cash ﬂows. These
risk faclors should be considered along with the forwardrlooking slatenients contained ill this Allllual Report on Form 107K because
Ihese factors could cause our actual resulls or financial condilion to differ materially from those projected in forwardrlooking
stalements. The followtng discussion is not an allrmclllslve listing of risks. although we believe these are the more material risks
that we face. if any of the folloWing occiir, our business. financial position. results of operations or cash flows could be negatively
affected. We caulion the reader to keep these risk factors in mind and refrain from attributing undue certainty to any forward
looking statements. which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report.
We da nat expettpnsiﬁve cash ﬂnw frarn aperatians in the near term. lfwe are unable ta abtain ﬁnancing in the arnaunts and
an terms deerned acceptable to us, we may be unable ta cantinue anr business and as a result may be required ta scale back ar
cease upemtl'an: far aur business.
We do not expect positive cash ﬂow from operations in the near term. There is no assurance that actual cash requirements will not
exceed our estimates. in particular. additional capital may be required in the event that:

- we Will continue With acquisition of Boomchat lnc., as we Will be required not only make certain payments, but also

support increased operations and development of the new line of business;

- we encoiinler greater cosls associated with general and administrative expenses or offering costs.
The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events could adversely affect our ability to meet our business plans.
We will depend almost exclusively on outside capital to pay for the continued exploration and development of our properties. Such
outside capital may include the sale of additional stock and/or commercial borrowing. We can provide no assurances that any
financing Will be successfully completed.
Capital may not continue to be available if necessary to meet these continuing development costs or. if the capital is available. that it
will be on terms acceptable to us. The issuance of additional equity securities by us would result in a significant dilution in the
equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available. Will increase our
liabililies and future cash commitlnents.
If we are unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable to us. we may be unable to continue our
business and as a resull may be required Io scale back or cease operations for our business, the result of which would be that our
stockholders would lose solne or all of their investment.
We have a limited npemtl'ng histary and if we are net successful in continuing ta gmw anr business, then we may have ta scale
back ar even cease aur angaing business aperaiians.
We have no history of revenues from operations and no tangible assets. We have yet to generate positive earnings and there can be
no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. Our company has a limited operating history and must be considered in the
development stage. The success of our company is significantly dependent on a successful implementation of the new business
venture. Our company's operations Will be subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a developing enterprise and the
ullcerlaillties arising from the absence of a significant operating history. If our business plan is not successful, and we are not able to
operate profitably. investors may lose some or all of their investment in our company.

Because of the early stage of development and the nature of our business, our securities are considered highly speculative.
oiir securities must be considered highly speculative, generally because of the nature of our business and the early stage of its
development. Accordingly, we have not generated any revenues nor have we realized a profit from our operations to date and there
is little likelihood that we will generate airy revenues or realize any proﬁts in the short term. Any profitability in the future from our
business will be dependent upon our ability to acquire a new business venture. since we have not generated any revenues, we will
have to raise additional monies through the sale of our equity securities or debt in order to continue our business operations.
Because we anticipate our operating expenses will increase prior to our earning revenues, we may never achieve proﬁtability.
Prior to starting generating any revenue from our new business line, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses
without realizmg any revenues. We therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if we
are unable to generate significant revenues from the new business venture, we Will not be able to earn profits or continue operations.
There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide no
assurance that we will generate any revenues or ever achieve profitability. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our
business will most likely fail.
Any change to government regulation/administrative practices may have a negative impact on our alrility to operate anal aur
proﬁtability.
The laws, regulations, policies or current administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in any
jurisdiction may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to carry
on our business.
The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest
groups may have a detrimental effect on us. Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate
and/or our profitably.
Uur auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
oiir audited financial statements were prepared using the assumption that we will continue our operations as a going concern. We
were incorporated on May 11, 2011, and do not have a history of earnings. As a result, our independent accountants in their audit
report have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Continued operations are dependent on our
ability to secure additional equity or debt financing activities or to generate profitable operations. Such capital formation activtties
may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We may be unable to continue operations in the future as a going concern. If we cannot
continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in the Company.
Because our sole officer and director has other uutside business activities and will only he devoting up to a portion of his time to
our operations, our operations may he sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of our business
activities.
Our sole Director and officer is only engaged in our business activilies on a panrfime basis. This could result ill a conﬂict of inleresl
between the amount of time he devotes to our business activities and the amount of time required to be devoted to his other
activities. Subsequent to the completion of the proposed transaction with Boonichat, we intend to increase our business activities in
terms of business development, marketing and promotion. This increase in business activities will require that either our Director
and Officer engages in our business activities on a fullrlime basis or that we hire additional employees oiir [hirdrparly consultants;
however, at this time, we do not have sufficient funds to pursue either option.

We may in the future issue additianal shares af aur camnian stack which wauld reduce investarx’ awnership interests in the
Campany and which may dilute aur share value. We da nat need stockholder appraval in issue additianal shares.
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the Issuance of 200000000 shares of common stock par value $0.0001 per share. The
future issuance of all or pan of our remaining authorized common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of ottr
common stock held by our then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis.
The issuance of comtnoit stock for futttre services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value
of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.
Uur camman stack is subject ta the “penny stack" rules af the SEC and the trading market in ear securities is limited, which
make: transactians in ear stuck cumlrersanie and may reduce the value afan investment in ear stack
The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g79 which establishes the deﬁnition ot~ a "penny stock" for the
purposes relevaitt to its. as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or With an exercise price of less
than $5.00 per share. subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock. unless exempt, the niles require: (i)
that a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions iii penny stocks; aitd (ii) the broker or dealer receive froin the
investor a written agreement to the transactions setting forth the ideittity aitd quantity of the penny stock to be purchased In order to
approve a person's account for transactioits in penny stocks the broker or dealer must: (i) obtain financial information and
investment experience objectives of the person; and (ii) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are
suitable for that person aitd the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in ﬁnancial matters to be capable of evaluating the
risks of transactions in penny stocks
The broker or dealer inust also deliver. prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Security
and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. which in highlight form: (t) sets forth the basis on which the broker
or dealer made the suitability determination; and (ii) that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor
prior to the transaction.
Generally, brokers may be less Willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the "penny stock" rules. This may make it
more difﬁcult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock
Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and
about the commissions payable to both the brokerrdealer and the registered representative current quotations for the securities and
the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases ot't'raud in penny stock transactions. Finally. monthly statements have to be
sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account aitd information on the limited market in penny
stocks.
We da nat intend ta pay cash dividends an ear shares af caniman stack but rather, we intend ta finance the develapment and
expansian afaur lrusiness, delaying ar perhaps preventing investarsfrani receiving a return an their shares.
Because we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares ot~ common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a
return on their shares unless they sell them.
We intend to retain any future earitings to finance the development and expansion of ottr bitsiness. We do not anticipate payiitg any
cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive
a return on their shares unless they sell them at a price higher than that which they initially paid for such shares.

During the year ended December 31, 201a we used $52,251 in cash for operating expenses. We used $72,925 to cover our net loss,
$175 used for prepaid expenses and (3924.170) and $3,320 to reduce (increase) our accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
respectively. Our operations during the year ended December 31, 2014, were supponed by a net $5,172 loan we borrowed from our
sole ofﬁcer and dlrector and by $47,910 we received from the issuance of shares of common stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2013, we had no cash on hand and our dayetoeday operations were supponed by $16530 in the
form of donated capital, not expected to be repaid, which was used to pay certain vendors. In addition to the payments that were
made on our behalf, we increased our accounts payable alld accrued liabilities by $10,175 and $5,7th respectively.
We do not have sufficient funds to maintain our operations for the next twelve months as such, we continue With our ongoing
efforts to raise additional capital by conducting additional issuances of our equity and debt securities for cash. The sale of
adduional equity securities will result ill dllulion to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedlless will result 1n increased debt

our overall business prospects. We cannot assure you that any financing can be obtained or, it obtained. that it Will be on reasonable

limited operations and have not fully commenced planned principal operatlonsi
There are no known trends, events or uncertainties that have had or that are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our
revenues from continuing operations.
We currently do not own any significant plant or equipment that we would seek to sell in the near future.

Going Concern Consideration
oiir auditors have issued an opinion on our annual financial statements which includes a statement describing our going concern
stalus. Thls means that there 1s substalltial doubt that we can contlnue as an onrgolng business for the next twelve months unless we
obtain additional capital to pay our bills and meet our other financial obligations. This is because we have not generated any
revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we finalize the Transaction and start marketing the producL Accordingly we must
raise capital trom sources other than the revenue from operations. We must raise capital to implement our current project and stay in
business.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Horizon Minerals Corp.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Hortzon Mtnerats Corp. (the “Company") as at December 31, 2014 and 2013,
and the related statements of operations, shareholders' defictt attd cash ﬂows for the years then ended. These t‘tnancial statements
are the respottsibility ot’ the Company's management. Our responsibtltty ts to express an opinton on these tinanctal statements based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United Slates).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasottable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements
are tree of matertal mtsstatement. The Company ts not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audtt of its interttal
control over t‘tnanctal reporting. Our audtts tncluded constderatton of internal control over financial reporttng as a basis for
designing audtt procedures that are approprtate itt the circumstances, but not {or the purpose of expressing an optniott on the
et’t‘ecttveness ot’ the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporttng. Accordtngly, we express no such optnton. An audit also
tncludes examintng, on a test basis, evtdence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the tinanctal statements. An audtt also
tncludes assesstng the accounttng prtnctples used and stgntticant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audtts provide a reasonable basis for our opinton.
In our opinion, based on our audtts, these tinanctal statements present t‘atrly, tn all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as at December 31, 2014 and 2013 and the results ot~ its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in
cotttormtty with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assumtng that the Company wtll conttnue as a gotng concern. As
dtscussed tn Note 1 to the t‘tnanctal statements, the Company has tncurred losses in developtng its business, and further losses are
anticipated. The Company requires addittonal funds to meet its obltgatiotts and the costs of tts operattons. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company's abtltty to continue as a going concern. Management's plans tn thts regard are descrtbed in
Note 1. The financial statements do not tnclude any adjustments that mtght result from the outcome of thts uncertainty.

HORIZON MINERALS CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Horizon Minerals Corp. (the “Coiiipany") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on May 11, 2011. The
Company is currently seeking to acquire a business.
The Company's ﬁnancial statements are prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with us generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") which contemplate the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities and commitments in the llormal course
of business The company has not generated operating revenues to date, has accumulated losses of $181530 since inception and as
at December 31, 2014 had $831 cash on hand. The Company has funded its operations through the issuance of capilal stock and
debt. Management intends to obtain additional funding by borrowing funds from its directors and officers issuing promissory notes
and/or a private placement of common stock. There IS no certainty that further funding will be available as needed. These factors
raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue operating as a going concern. The Company's ability to
continue its operations as a going concern, realize the carrying value of its assets. and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
business is dependent upon its ability to raise new capital sufficient to fund its commitments and ongotng losses, and ultimately on
generating profitable operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of
assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
These financial statements alld related notes are presented in accordance with US GAAP, and are presented in United Slates dollars.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Us GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect certain of the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities al the date of the
financial statements and the reponed amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. The Company regularly evaluates
estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current t‘acts. historical experience and various
other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates To the extent
there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results. future results of operations will be affected.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts reﬂected in the balance sheets for cash and accounts payable approximate the respective fair values due to the
short maturities of these items. The Company does not hold any investments that are availablerforrsale.

HORIZON MINERALS CORP.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued)
As required by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, fair value is measured based on a threertier
fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted
prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or
indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop
its own assutnptions.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level I: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
liabilities;
Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active. or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the asset or liability;
Level 3: Prices or valliation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value ineaslirement and unobservable
(supported by little or no market activity).
Loss per Share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing losses available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilntive potential common shares outstanding during
the period. Dillitive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antirdilutive. The Company had no diliitive
common stock equivalents, such as stock options or warrants as of December 31, 2014 and 2013.
Recent Pronouncements
The Company has elected to early adopt the guidance in FASB Topic 915 and no longer provides the accounting disclosures for
development stage companies. Accordingly, the ﬁgures for the period from inception to the current period are no longer provided
and all references to development stage operations have been removed. Other recent accounting pronouncements with future
effective dates are not expected to have an impact on the Company's financial statements.
NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On February 271 2014, the Company entered into a loan agreement with its sole director and officer for CAD$11151X1 ($10,405).
The loan bore interest at 10% per annum, was unsecured and due on demand. On May 30, 2014, the Company repaid the loan in
full.
On July 11. 2014, the Company received an advance from its sole director and ofﬁcer for CAD$6,000 ($5,172) for working capital
purposes. The amount is due on demand, bears no interestr and is unsecured. As at December 31, 2014, the entire amount is still
outstanding.
For the year ended December 311 2014, the Company incurred management fees of$lXIXJ<J (2013 r $Nil) to the sole director and

ITEM 9A (T). CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ellslire that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports tiled under the Securities Exchange Act. is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
by the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this lllforlnalion is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive ofticer and chief financial officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as deﬁned in Rule 13a715(e) tinder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as alnellded) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. As a resull of this evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the period ended
December 31, 2014.

Management’s Annual Report on internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over ﬁnancial reporting is deﬁned in Rule 13a715(f) or 15d715(t) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
process designed by, or ullder the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial ofﬁcers and effected by
the company's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reponing and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:

- Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company:

- Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and

- Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or tilnely detection of unauthorized acquisilion, use or disposition of
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are Subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control,
there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
reportlllg. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to
design illto the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
12


As of December 31. 2014, management assessed the eftecliveness of our internal control over tinancial reporting based on the
criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in lnteriial Controlelntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee ot Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such
assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such inlemal controls and
procedures were effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Corporation‘s registered public accounting tirin regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management‘s report was not subject to attestation by the Corporation's registered public
accounting tirin pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Corporation to provide only the management's report in this
Annual Report.
Changes in internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our uiost recent fiscal year ended
December 31, 2014, that have materially atfecled, or reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over fillallcial
reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures no
matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. in
addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource coustraiiits and that
management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benetits ot possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

Nominees for Directors are identified and suggested by the members of the Board or management using their business networks.
The Board has not retained any executive search firms or other third parties to idelltify or evaluate director candidates alld does not
intend to in the near future. In selecting a nominee for director, the Board or management considers the following criteria:

- Whether the nominee has the personal attributes for successful service on the Board. such as demonstrated character and
integrity: experience at a strategy/policy setting level; managerial experience dealing with complex problems: an ability to
work effectively will] others; and sufficient time to devote to our affairs:

- Whether the nominee has been the chief executive officer or sellior executive of a public company or a leader of a similar
organization including industry groups, universities or governmental organizations;

- Whether the nominee, by virtue of particular experience technical expertise or specialized skills or colltacts relevant to our
currellt or future busilless, will add speciﬁc value as a Board member; and

- Whether there are any other factors related to the ability and willingness of a new nominee to serve, or an existing Board
member to contillue his service.

The Board or management has not established any specific minimum qualifications that a candidate for director must meet in order
to be recommended for Board membership. Rather, the Board or managemellt will evaluate the mix of skills and experience that the
candidate offers, consider how a given candidate meets the Board‘s current expectations with respect to each such criterion and
make a deterinirlation regarding whether a candidate should be recommended to the stockholders for election as a Director. Dliring
2014, we received no recommendation for Directors from olir stockholders
We will consider for inclusion in our nominations of new Board of Directors nominees proposed by stockholders who have held at
least 1% of our outstanding voting securities for at least one year. Board candidates referred by such stockholders will be considered
on the same basis as Board candidates referred from other sources. Any stockholder who wishes to recommend for olir
consideration a prospective nominee to serve on the Board of Directors may do so by giving the candidate's name and qualifications
in writing to our Secretary at the following address: 9101 West Sahara Avenue, Suite 105 r 197. Las VegaS, Nevada 89117.

Ethical Business Conduct
Our sole director believes good corporate governance is an integral component to the success of the Company and to lneet
responsibilities to shareholders Generally. our sole director has found that the fiduciary duties placed on individual directors by the
Company's governing corporate legislation and the common law and the restrictions placed by applicable corporate legislation on
an individual director's participation in decisions of the Board ot Directors in which the director has an interest have been Sufficient
to ensure that the Board ot Directors operates independently ot management and in the best interests oflhe Company.
Our sole director is also responsible for applying governance principles and practices and tracking development in corporate
governance, and adapting “best practices" to suit the needs of the Company. The sole director may also be a director and otticer of
other companies, and conflicts of interest may arise between his duties. Such conflicts must be disclosed in accordance with, aiid are
subject to such other procedures and remedies as applicable under the Delaware Revised Statutes.
Nomination of Directors
Our sole director has not formed a nominating colnmittee or similar committee to assist him with the nomination of directors for the
Company. Our sole director considers the size of the Board of Directors to be too small to warrant creation of such a committee: and
our sole director has contacts he can draw upon to identify new members of the Board of Directors as needed froln time to time.
Our sole director will continually assess the size. stnictiire and composition of the Board of Directors. taking into consideration its
current strengths. skills and experience. proposed retirements and the requirements and strategic direction of the Company. As
required, our sole director will recommend suitable candidates for consideration as members of the Board of Directors.
Assessments
Our sole director has not implemented a process for assessing his effectiveness. As a result of our small size and stage of
developmenL our sole director considers a formal assessment process to be inappropriate at this time. Our sole director plans to
coiltinlie evaluating his own effectiveness on an ad hoc basis.
