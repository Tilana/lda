THE STATE
Respondent

Hearing: 22nd March 2004

RULING

Because of the Appellants previous history of absconding on bail, his right to bail is rebutted. The Magistrates Court is likely to call this case within this month, so remand is not likely to be for a long time. Because of the 14 day stipulation in the Bail Act, this case to be called in the Magistrates Court on 5th April 2004 if not earlier for facts to be taken afresh. Remand in custody.
