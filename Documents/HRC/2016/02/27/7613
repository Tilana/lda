<p><i>Summary  
</i></p>
<p> The present report contains the findings and recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs), subsequent to his 
follow-up visit to Serbia, including Kosovo,* from 9 to 12 October 2013. The Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to Belgrade, Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina and other locations was conducted in 
full compliance with Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). Any reference to Kosovo, 
whether to the territory, institutions or population, is to be understood in line with the 
United Nations policy of strict neutrality on the status of Kosovo. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur examines the situation of internally 
displaced persons, taking into account the notable efforts of the Government of Serbia and 
the authorities in Kosovo to improve the situation of IDPs since the visit by previous 
mandate holder Walter K&#228;lin in 2009. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government 
of Serbia and the authorities in Kosovo to focus on effective law enforcement measures, 
political commitment and coordination in the implementation of durable solutions for IDPs. 
He commends the Government of Serbia and the authorities in Kosovo for their flexibility 
in considering local integration as a viable durable solution, alongside return or settlement.

<p> There is a window of opportunity favourable to the implementation of durable 
solutions, in the context of the current discussions with the European Union on eventual 
accession by Serbia and Kosovo. 
</p>
<p> Thousands of IDPs still live in collective centres, in dire conditions, without or with 
only limited access to running water, electricity and heating fuel, and sharing kitchens and 
bathrooms. The living conditions for other IDPs in private accommodation are not better, 
either. Among the most vulnerable IDPs are the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians, many of 
whom live in informal settlements and do not have personal documentation, rendering them 
potentially stateless and making it difficult for them to access public services. 
</p>
<p> For many IDPs, issues of property ownership remain unresolved, and it is of utmost 
urgency that these be resolved more effectively. Decisions made by the Kosovo Property 
Agency in Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina need to be enforced and adverse possession of property in the 
aftermath of decisions favourable to IDPs should be prevented by the authorities. 
Moreover, it is clear that issues of property, the registration of IDP voters, and voting 
arrangements should be a regular feature of the dialogue between Belgrade and 
Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Serbia, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of internally displaced persons, Mr. Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official follow-up 
visit to Serbia, including Kosovo, from 9 to 12 October 2013. The objective of the visit was 
to re-examine the human rights situation of IDPs and to follow up on the official visits 
made by the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons in 2005 and 2009. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that he conducted his mission in full compliance 
with Security Council resolution 1244. Accordingly, any reference to Kosovo, whether to 
the territory, institutions or population, is to be understood in line with the United Nations 
policy of strict neutrality on the status of Kosovo. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur had meetings in Serbia with the Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, the State Secretary, the Head of the Department of the United 
Nations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Commissioner for Refugees and Migration, 
the Director of the Government Office for Human and Minority Rights, and a Member of 
Parliament. In Kosovo, the Special Rapporteur met with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Kosovo, the Minister for Communities and Return, the Minister of 
Internal Affairs and other officials. The Special Rapporteur also appreciated the opportunity 
to speak with other representatives of the international community, civil society and 
internally displaced communities, and with the Ombudsperson of Serbia and the 
Ombudsperson of Kosovo, during the course of his visit. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to thank all his interlocutors for taking the time to share their perspectives with him. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited Belgrade, Sopot and Smederevo in Serbia. While in 
Kosovo he visited Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina, Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235; North and South, Zve&#269;an/Zve&#231;an, 
Fush&#235; Kosovo/Kosovo Polje and Graqanic&#235;/Gra&#269;anica. The visits were kindly organized by 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and kindly facilitated by the United 
Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, in conjunction with the authorities 
concerned. The Special Rapporteur is thankful for all the support provided during the 
course of his visit.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his sincere gratitude to the 
Government of Serbia and the authorities in Kosovo for their full cooperation. He is also 
grateful to all his interlocutors, especially IDPs, who kindly shared their experiences and 
different perspectives with him. He looks forward to a fruitful and continued dialogue both 
with authorities and with other stakeholders on the implementation of the recommendations 
contained in the present report. 
</p>
<p>6. The present report is intended to provide an assessment of the human rights situation 
of IDPs. Section 2 provides a brief overview of current political and economic conditions in 
Serbia and Kosovo and also of the present situation of IDPs. Section 3 analyses the dire 
situation of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian IDPs and the measures that the authorities have 
taken to improve their situation. Issues related to land, housing and property are analysed in 
section 4, and this is followed by a discussion of the legal framework for IDPs. The report 
then looks at durable solutions and the steps that are necessary in order to achieve them. 
Finally, the report presents the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations to the Government 
of Serbia, to the authorities in Kosovo and to the international community. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Internal displacement situation 
</b></p>
<p>7. Since the conflict that took place in Kosovo in 1998 and 1999, thousands of people 
have lost their homes and are unable to return to their places of origin. Serbia, including 
Kosovo, currently has one of the largest numbers of IDPs in Europe. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed by the Government of Serbia that there is a total number of 
227,112 IDPs in Serbia, including in Kosovo, and that this includes 209,112 in Serbia and 
an estimated 18,000 in Kosovo. However, according to estimates provided by the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the IDPs in need of 
assistance number 97,000 in Serbia and 17,500 in Kosovo.  
</p>
<p>8. Few IDPs are able or willing to return to their places of origin, despite the large 
number of IDPs and the difficult living conditions that many of them are facing. The year 
2013 was marked by a low rate of return, which is not expected to rise. The main obstacles 
to sustainable return in Kosovo involve a lack of security, a lack of mechanisms for the 
protection of rights, unresolved issues in relation to property and reconstruction, restricted 
access to public services, and a lack of economic opportunities, among others. The lack of 
security and marginalization of returnees often leads to secondary displacement. The 
Special Rapporteur found that the problem of return has remained the same as when it was 
examined by his predecessor (see A/HRC/13/21/Add.1, section on obstacles to sustainable 
returns (p. 8)). Freedom of movement in Kosovo is still an issue. For example, in the north 
of Kosovo, cars with licence plates from Serbia have difficulty in entering certain parts of 
the towns where Albanians are in the majority. Conversely, cars with licence plates from 
Kosovo have similar difficulties in entering areas where Serbs are in the majority.  
9. Many IDPs are still living in collective centres, in dire conditions. Whereas in 1999 
there were 700 collective centres, today there are 23 formal collective centres 
accommodating 1,398 people, of which 14 collective centres accommodating 1,016 people 
are located in central Serbia and the remaining 9 centres accommodating 382 people are 
located in Kosovo and Metohija.<b> </b>The number of these centres has fallen due to the 
provision of assistance to IDPs that resulted in the planned closure of collective centres. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. Nevertheless, entire families have been living in spaces of about 12 square metres 
for over a decade, with limited access to running water, electricity and heating fuel, and 
sharing kitchens and bathrooms. After 14 years of displacement, new generations have little 
knowledge of their places of origin and have developed ties to their places of displacement. 
</p>
<p>11. The vast majority of IDPs (75 per cent) from Kosovo and Metohija are of Serb 
ethnicity, about 10 per cent are Roma, and the remainder belong to a total of 29 different 
minority groups (A/HRC/13/21/Add.1, para. 6). Among the extremely vulnerable IDPs are 
the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians, who represent 10 per cent of the overall IDP population 
in Serbia and 5 per cent in Kosovo. However, they share common challenges in terms of 
difficulties in obtaining personal documentation, limited access to basic public services 
such as health care and education, limited penetration in the formal economy, low housing 
and hygiene standards, discrimination and evictions. The Special Rapporteur notes that 
there were limited yet important improvements in comparison to the dramatic situation 
facing Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians in Serbia and in Kosovo that his predecessor, the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons, encountered at the time of his visit. 
</p>
<p>12. Problems in relation to IDPs&#8217; properties in Kosovo are numerous; they include 
indirect discrimination against IDPs, limited restitution of property documentation, illegal 
occupation and fraudulent transactions. The Kosovo Property Agency is the mass claims 
mechanism for dealing with property claims and it works in parallel with the courts of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>Kosovo. It is overburdened with a huge backlog of pending cases and lacks effective 
capacity to resolve property issues; moreover, many of its decisions remain unenforced. 
</p>
<p>13. More than 19,000 claims for compensation for destroyed property were submitted to 
the courts in Kosovo, but the majority of the courts declared that they were not competent 
to examine such claims. Additionally, there are some 1,500 claims before the courts in 
Kosovo for property damaged during the riots of 17 March 2004. Thus far, none of the 
aforementioned claims have produced a positive decision. 
</p>
<p>14. In order to address the complex situation of IDPs, a number of positive steps 
towards attaining durable solutions have been taken. In Kosovo, the Ministry of 
Communities and Return is in charge of working out durable solutions, in parallel with 
local authorities. In Serbia, temporary and durable solutions are being implemented by the 
Commissariat for Refugees and Migration of the Republic of Serbia, which is the 
governmental body officially in charge of providing assistance to IDPs, while the Office for 
Kosovo and Metohija of the Government of the Republic of Serbia is in charge of the 
overall situation of IDPs and their sustainable return to Kosovo.  
</p>
<p>15. The economic level of Serbia and Kosovo has been low since the 2008 world 
economic crisis. The lack of economic prospects represents a serious challenge to putting 
durable solutions in place, particularly as regards IDPs&#8217; local integration and livelihoods.  
</p>
<p>16. Employment opportunities are lacking for IDPs. In addition, there is a linguistic 
obstacle with regard to the free use of the Serbian or Albanian languages in certain areas. 
This is despite the fact that, according to the Government of Serbia, over 90 per cent of 
IDPs registered and displaced in Serbia speak the Serbian language, as do many of the 
Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians.  
</p>
<p>17. The talks currently being held with the European Union on eventual accession by 
Serbia and Kosovo are a positive opportunity for seeking durable solutions for IDPs, and 
they have brought about a spirit of political cooperation between the Government of Serbia 
and the authorities in Kosovo. On 19 April 2013, the First Agreement on Principles 
Governing the Normalization of Relations was signed, as a result of the ongoing dialogue 
between Belgrade and Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina, facilitated by the European Union. This new 
framework has also provided opportunities for addressing problems regarding IDPs as well 
as the remaining obstacles to durable solutions. The momentum provided by the new 
framework should be sustained in line with chapter 23, on the judiciary and fundamental 
rights, and chapter 24, on justice, freedom and security, of the acquis on membership of the 
European Union.  
</p>
<p>18. The municipal elections held in November 2013 and the parliamentary elections 
held in March 2014 should build confidence and bring about enhanced opportunities for 
exploring durable solutions for IDPs. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Profile of internally displaced persons and the specific case 
of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians 
</b></p>
<p>19. In Serbia, there are about 20,000 Roma IDPs, representing just over 10 per cent of 
the overall IDP population, according to information received from Roma leaders and 
confirmed by UNHCR. Many Roma IDPs are accommodated in one or another of 593 
settlements, 217 of which are informal settlements. Of the 593 settlements, 140 are in the 
Belgrade area. In Kosovo, UNHCR estimates that there are about 810 Roma, Ashkali and 
Egyptians, who account for 4.6 per cent of the IDP population.  
</p>
<p>20. Among IDPs&#8217; most urgent protection needs is obtaining documentation to enable 
them to access basic public services. The Special Rapporteur witnessed how the lack of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>documentation forces Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian IDPs to live in informal, substandard 
and overcrowded settlements without electricity, energy, water or sanitation.  
</p>
<p>21. A considerable proportion of Roma IDPs do not have birth certificates as their birth 
was never legally registered, while some lost their birth certificates during flight and remain 
without access to official registration books. Generations are being affected, as thousands 
of people are &#8220;legally invisible&#8221; and potentially stateless. Not having a birth certificate 
impedes registration and the issuance of an identity card, on which access to public services 
such as health care, education, housing programmes and employment programmes, as well 
as social integration in general, depends.  
</p>
<p>22. In Serbia, for example, urgent admissions to hospitals are available for IDPs, but 
regular treatment and medication is only available in Kosovo at IDPs&#8217; place of origin. In 
Kosovo, access to public services for the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities varies 
greatly, depending on where they are resident and whether the IDP concerned seeks 
services from Kosovan or Serbian administrative institutions. Each administrative 
institution requires its own documents (Serbian or Kosovan) before granting access to 
services. However, documents issued by one are not recognized by the other. The Roma 
community, to a larger extent, relies on Serbian administrative structures for public services 
in the areas of health, education and social assistance. Conversely, the Ashkali and 
Egyptian communities rely more on Kosovan institutions. This dichotomy should be 
addressed in a spirit of cooperation between the Government of Serbia and the authorities 
in Kosovo. Differential treatment for Roma children extends to education, as Roma face 
constraints on their access to schools. It also involves language barriers, as not all Roma 
speak Serbian and not all Roma speak Albanian. In addition, Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian 
IDPs suffer from differential treatment due to the combination of their ethnicity and their 
displacement. There is a clear need for awareness-raising among the general population, 
that is designed to combat discrimination against Roma IDPs. Principle 1 of the Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2) requires that IDPs enjoy, in 
full equality, the same rights and freedoms as do other persons in their country, and that 
they not be discriminated against on the ground that they are internally displaced.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of Serbia and the authorities in 
Kosovo to provide IDPs with personal documentation in accordance with principle 20 
(2) and (3) of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. The lack of such 
documentation does not take away the right of IDPs to recognition everywhere as persons 
before the law, in the terms stipulated in Principle 20 (1). The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes steps being taken by the Government of Serbia to decrease the cost related to the 
process of subsequent birth registration and to simplify legal and administrative procedures. 
Approval and implementation of the Draft Law on Free Legal Aid, which will allow non-
governmental organizations to assist IDPs in need for free, should be accelerated, as should 
the elaboration and implementation of an action plan for the Strategy for the Prevention and 
Protection against Discrimination, which was developed by the Serbian Government&#8217;s 
Office for Human and Minority Rights, to address measure 4 of the Refugee, Internally 
Displaced Persons and Other Vulnerable Migrant Group.1 The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the authorities in Kosovo, at the national and municipal levels, to undertake 
fully the registration of the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian population. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Measure 4 refers to &#8220;simplifying the procedure for issuing of personal documents for internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons and returnees under the Readmission Agreement, for the purpose of obtaining 
complete equality of rights with other citizens of the Republic of Serbia and solving numerous cases 
of &#8220;legally invisible&#8221; internally displaced persons, the majority of whom are of Roma nationality&#8221;.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>24. In addition, the Special Rapporteur calls for closer regional collaboration to facilitate 
the issuance of personal documentation for IDPs who need to regularize their civil status 
while still in displacement. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the support of 
the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) in connection with the 
handover of certified copies of complete civil registry books from Serbia to the Civil 
Registration Agency of Kosovo. Certified copies of about half of the 12,000 registry books 
in Serbia have been handed over to the authorities in Kosovo via EULEX.2 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the vulnerable population could benefit 
from mobile teams dealing with registration in Serbia and in Kosovo. The experience of 
mobile teams of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, gained during its 
support for the 2013 election, could be valuable for the purposes of facilitating access to 
identity documentation. It would be helpful to include qualified staff of Roma origin in 
social welfare centres and at birth registration contact points to enable communication with 
the Roma IDP population.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Housing, land and property 
</b></p>
<p>26. The process of resolving property issues in Kosovo faces many challenges, 
hindering returns and the prospects for IDPs to freely choose between returning and other 
durable solutions. Some of the main challenges are the caseload of unresolved 
compensation claims (numbering around 22,000), problems with evictions and re-evictions, 
the lack of an effective response to fraudulent transactions, illegal occupation of 
agricultural land and other property, and a lack of effective protection for empty 
reconstructed property. Other issues relate to limited access to courts, including lengthy and 
expensive proceedings, non-recognition of the Serbian language and non-recognition of 
Serbian property documentation. In the case of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian IDPs, there are 
also challenges regarding the allocation of land for new settlements.  
</p>
<p>27. A large number of IDPs are unable to exercise their right to use their property, or 
their ownership over it, due to the illegal occupation of properties in Kosovo. The 
mechanisms for mass restitution of dispossessed property put in place by the international 
administration in Kosovo and Metohija have proven ineffective in respect of the return of 
immovable property, which has also had a significant effect on the process of IDP returns.<b> 
</b>Authorities are often unable to enforce repossession decisions, particularly in cases of 
reoccupation of property, frustrating the legitimate aspirations of IDPs to regain their 
properties. Similarly, Serb IDPs face the challenge of repossession of properties as well as a 
lack of access to rental and compensatory schemes. The lack of compensation schemes 
often denies IDPs the opportunity to receive indemnification for the loss of their property 
and, consequently, deprives them of the possibility of securing alternative housing solutions 
for themselves with their own means.  
</p>
<p>28. It was brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur that two of the main 
challenges in terms of housing rights for Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian returnees are the 
insufficient allocation of land by municipalities and the lack of recognition of occupancy 
rights in informal settlements prior to the conflict. Although most Roma, Ashkali and 
Egyptian IDPs had a private house, their land occupancy rights were never registered and 
they lack personal documentation and title records for their homes. The vast majority of 
propertyless returnees belong to the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities, and they 
find it increasingly difficult to be included in house reconstruction projects. About 30 per 
cent of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian returnees end up in secondary displacement. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>29. IDPs are not exempt from the property taxes that were introduced in 2011 and they 
are asked to pay them retroactively, even for properties that they do not occupy. There are 
no mechanisms for challenging the levying of these taxes. Potentially, if the taxes are not 
paid, IDPs are denied access to copies of their property documents and are prevented from 
regaining their property.  
</p>
<p>30. Property issues should be high on the political agenda, including that of the dialogue 
between Belgrade and Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina, because of their critical importance to putting in 
place durable solutions.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Legal framework for IDPs, and its implementation 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the progress made by the Government of Serbia 
as well as by the authorities in Kosovo regarding the legal framework for protecting IDPs.  
</p>
<p>32. In Serbia, the Law on Permanent and Temporary Residence of Citizens and the 
amendment to the Law on Non-Contentious Procedures are aimed at regulating the 
procedures for obtaining personal documentation. The Law on Permanent and Temporary 
Residence of Citizens governs the granting of permanent and temporary residence in 
respect of the whole population of Serbia. Changes have been made to article 11 in order to 
facilitate access to temporary residence for Roma living in informal settlements. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes these changes, as they are relevant for the issuance of 
documentation to members of the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian IDP population who do not 
have documents and are living in informal settlements. He encourages the full and prompt 
implementation of these two pieces of legislation.  
</p>
<p>33. As part of its systematic and strategic approach for the resolution of issues 
connected with IDPs, Serbia has adopted or amended numerous laws and strategies, such as 
the National Strategy for Resolving the Problems of Refugees and Internally Displaced 
Persons, the Strategy for Sustainable Return, and the Strategy for the Prevention and 
Protection against Discrimination developed by the Serbian Government&#8217;s Office for 
Human and Minority Rights. Nevertheless, an action plan for the Strategy for the 
Prevention and Protection against Discrimination should be elaborated and published.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reference to IDPs in certain legal 
frameworks in Kosovo. He believes that this is a valuable starting point for the protection 
of IDPs and that it could be further enhanced in accordance with the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2). 
</p><p>35. Kosovo has incorporated many international human rights instruments into its legal 
system. Nevertheless, it still lacks a domestic legal framework on internal displacement as 
well as a comprehensive policy or strategy focused on protecting IDPs&#8217; rights and 
supporting durable solutions. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the development by the 
Ministry of Communities and Return &#8212; the main body for coordinating voluntary returns 
and supporting protection of minority communities &#8212; of a durable solutions strategy for 
2014 and beyond. The Special Rapporteur suggests that the strategy should focus strongly 
on all durable solutions for all IDPs, including return, local integration, or settlement in 
another part of the country, regardless of their ethnic background, and that an action plan 
should be elaborated shortly after the adoption of such a strategy.  
</p>
<p>36. There are procedural difficulties in the legal systems of Kosovo and Serbia that 
impede access to justice by IDPs. For example, courts do not recognize powers of attorney 
verified by the authorities in Serbia. For this reason, IDPs are forced to travel to Kosovo in 
order to get their powers of attorneys verified. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>37. The 1999 conflict forced a large number of IDPs to abandon their jobs in socially 
owned companies. Those employment relations were never officially terminated and no 
compensation was paid. Those companies are now entering the liquidation procedure, 
which includes the payment of outstanding salaries. IDPs are regularly excluded from this 
procedure by the Privatization Agency of Kosovo. One project funded by the European 
Union3 is insisting on their inclusion, relying on the notorious fact, verified by the Supreme 
Court of Kosovo, that IDPs were massively affected by discrimination after the 1999 
conflict.  
</p>
<p>38. Another aspect that drew the attention of the Special Rapporteur is the pension issue 
of IDPs and the connection of IDPs with former employers. The Government of Serbia and 
the authorities in Kosovo need to work together in order to resolve the issue of pensions for 
IDPs in a dignified way. IDPs should also benefit from the privatization schemes of the 
companies that they had to stop working for on account of their displacement.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Durable solutions for internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>39. Primary responsibility for establishing the conditions and providing the means for 
the achievement of durable solutions lies with States and with the competent authorities. 
Durable solutions are achieved when IDPs no longer have specific assistance and protection 
needs linked to their displacement and can enjoy their human rights without suffering 
discrimination on account of their displacement.4 
</p>
<p>40. In line with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the Framework on 
Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons, the solutions include sustainable 
reintegration at the place of origin (return), sustainable local integration in areas where 
IDPs have settled (local integration) or sustainable integration in another part of the country 
(settlement elsewhere in the country). For these solutions to be considered &#8220;durable&#8221;, 
a number of conditions must be met, such as enjoyment of the protection of the State of 
nationality (for citizens), the voluntariness of the decision to return or settle elsewhere, real 
prospects for restitution of or compensation for lost property, no discrimination in the 
enjoyment of their rights, and equal access to public services and economic opportunities.5 
</p><p>41. Circumstances are now conducive for seeking to attain durable solutions for IDPs as 
a matter of priority, after 14 years of protracted displacement. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes all steps taken towards this end and commends both the Government of Serbia 
and the authorities in Kosovo for their flexible approach to all durable solutions as 
pragmatic and viable options, which has come about on the basis of consultation, informed 
participation and IDPs&#8217; choices. However, the key to these solutions lies principally in the 
Regional Housing Project for IDPs in Serbia and Kosovo.  
42. With regard to Serbia, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the steps taken towards 
durable solutions, including the Law on Migration Management which regulates the issue 
of programmes for support of the entire IDP population. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur notes that the European Union has supported the regional 
durable housing project for refugees. He strongly urges that similar support be provided for

<p>the durable housing project for IDPs, for the purpose of facilitating local integration as a 
matter of priority. The efforts to find durable housing solutions with support from UNHCR 
are notable. Among the good housing solutions found are social housing in supportive 
environment buildings, local integration housing projects in rural areas, and local 
integration housing projects where assistance with building materials is given.  
</p><p>44. The Special Rapporteur welcomes all the efforts to bring about durable housing 
solutions and strongly urges that there be more initiatives supporting the social and 
economic inclusion of IDPs, so as to address directly the vulnerability of the displaced 
population. Durable solutions also require guarantees so that IDPs do not face obstacles to 
earning a livelihood or accessing employment on account of their displacement. 
</p>
<p>45. The Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance remains a major facility for supporting 
durable solutions, along with assistance provided by other international actors. The 
European Union is committed to closing down all collective centres for IDPs by the end of 
2015, and the Government of Serbia is fully cooperating with it in this, and with local 
authorities and UNHCR. According to UNHCR, there are 16 collective centres in Serbia at 
present, accommodating about 1,500 IDPs. Residents of collective centres are reported to 
be among the most vulnerable IDPs, as they have few opportunities to earn a livelihood and 
are fully dependent upon the assistance they receive. Extreme vulnerability is found in 
informal settlements, which usually house minority groups, such as Roma. On the other 
hand, IDPs living in private accommodation also need assistance. The Special Rapporteur 
strongly believes that there is an urgent need for special protection for Roma, Ashkali and 
Egyptians, as these IDPs have a high degree of vulnerability and require tailor-made 
protection, including in finding durable solutions. At this stage, it is crucial to have accurate 
data on their social and economic needs, in order to be able to determine what assistance to 
them would entail. The Special Rapporteur was informed that Serbia is committed to the 
closure of all collective centres by the end of 2015 and that, in this regard, the Government 
is strategically planning and utilizing Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance funds 
alongside those derived from State and local budgets. He is also aware that Serbia has 
already conducted a study on the social and economic needs of IDPs and has developed a 
system for local action planning (entailing local action plans being carried out in every 
municipality in Serbia for refugees and IDPs) that serves as a programming tool in the 
provision of assistance. 
</p>
<p>46. In Kosovo, the Special Rapporteur notes the efforts of the Ministry of Communities 
and Return, and the existence of the Strategy for the Integration of the Roma, Ashkali and 
Egyptian Communities in Kosovo and the associated action plan. This strategy was 
developed in 2008, and although it dedicates an introductory section to IDPs, it does not 
differentiate between the specific needs of the IDPs. The Ministry of Communities and 
Return has been particularly committed, with housing programmes for Serb IDPs, and is 
also working to establish a new strategy for IDPs. The Special Rapporteur encourages 
completion and implementation of the new strategy as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that the recommendation that his predecessor 
made in 2005 is still largely true and needs to be urgently addressed once and for all. That 
recommendation states: &#8220;Thousands of IDPs continue to live in very difficult conditions in 
collective centres and irregular settlements, among them elderly, ill, disabled, severely 
traumatized individuals, witnesses in war crime investigations and trials, female-headed 
households and families of missing persons, i.e. the most vulnerable among the IDPs whose 
situations have not been satisfactorily resolved&#8221;.6

<p><b> VII. Profiling for durable solutions  
</b></p>
<p>48. In order to plan durable solutions well, it is necessary to be well informed about the 
characteristics and needs of the IDP population that is to be served and protected. In Serbia, 
the Special Rapporteur noted with satisfaction the Assessment of the Needs of Internally 
Displaced Persons, carried out jointly by the Government, UNHCR and the Joint IDP 
Profiling Service in 2010. In Kosovo, however, there is still a lack of reliable data on the 
number, location and needs of IDPs, 14 years after the conflict. The available data and 
figures are based on estimates made by UNHCR and the local authorities. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the joint initiative of UNHCR, the Danish 
Refugee Council and the Ministry for Communities and Return, supported by the Joint IDP 
Profiling Service, to carry out the first IDP profiling for Kosovo, which is scheduled for 
</p><p>2014. This is intended to be a comprehensive profiling of internal displacement in Kosovo; 
it aims to reach consensus on the population figures and to assess the extent to which those 
who had been displaced have achieved durable solutions. The conclusions from this 
assessment will be an excellent starting point for designing durable solutions that will 
address the needs of IDPs in Kosovo. The Special Rapporteur invites the authorities in 
Kosovo to extend their full collaboration to the Joint IDP Profiling Service, so as to 
facilitate this crucial exercise which entails the development of a governmental durable 
solutions strategy and of regulations concerning IDPs. 
</p>
<p>50. Once the profiling is completed, it will be important to document all IDPs in 
Kosovo, who will be the specific target group of the future strategy that the Ministry of 
Communities and Return is willing to elaborate. On that note, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates the need for a technical agency in charge of the implementation of durable 
solutions for IDPs. At present, lessons may be learned from the experiences of the 
Commissariat for Refugees and Migration of the Republic of Serbia. 
</p>
<p>51. With regard to Serbia, the Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of Serbia 
to undertake a needs assessment of Roma IDPs, in order for the Government to be able to 
propose creative durable solutions that are specially tailored to the needs of this most 
vulnerable segment of the population. Other stakeholders will certainly also benefit from a 
thorough understanding of the needs of internally displaced Roma and of how to support 
them better.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Political will and leadership for durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the steps already taken towards 
durable solutions for IDPs. This includes the formation of the Task Force on Durable 
Solutions, under the United Nations Strategic Framework for Kosovo, which is aimed at 
reinforcing governmental and international efforts towards achieving durable solutions. He 
is concerned, however, that durable solutions require a higher degree of effective political 
will, and he believes that effective political leadership based on dialogue and cooperation 
between the Government of Serbia and the authorities in Kosovo will pave the way for 
achieving durable solutions.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur visited several places in Serbia where durable solutions had 
been implemented and local integration had been facilitated. Full local integration has been 
achieved, for example, in the rural area of Sopot and in Smederevo.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> IX. Governmental coordination for durable solutions 
and protection of IDPs 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur deems necessary the establishment of clear governmental 
mechanisms, including protection working groups, to work on durable solutions 
consistently. Durable solutions and protection working groups can be highly effective, but 
their composition should include representatives of different groups of IDPs, of line 
ministries and of relevant governmental technical agencies, and representatives of the 
international community as well as of local municipalities.  
</p>
<p>55. While in Serbia this mechanism would have its focus at the Commissariat for 
Refugees and Migration of the Republic of Serbia together with the Office for Human and 
Minority Rights, in Kosovo the Ministry of Communities and Return and the Kosovo 
Property Agency would be involved, as well as municipal authorities and representatives of 
communities.  
</p>
<p>56. The Commissariat for Refugees and Migration of the Republic of Serbia is the 
governmental body officially established in 1999 to be in charge of providing assistance to 
IDPs, and it has the necessary technical expertise. As such, a clear mechanism has been 
established which, in turn, coordinates with relevant ministries and State offices that 
address specific problems of IDPs. The Commissariat coordinates with the Office for 
Human and Minority Rights on issues pertaining to Roma IDPs because the focus of the 
mandate given to the Office for Human and Minority Rights includes issues relating to the 
Roma population. Importantly, Serbia established, in 2012, its Office for Kosovo and 
Metohija, which provides assistance to IDPs. 
</p><p>57. In Kosovo, in addition to having the Ministry of Communities and Return at the 
centre of arrangements for coordinating durable solutions, the Special Rapporteur suggests 
that the mandate of the Ministry urgently be expanded to include protection of the rights of 
IDPs within Kosovo. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur encourages the authorities in 
Kosovo to establish a technical agency for IDPs to be responsible for implementing IDP 
protection and assistance strategies, including durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>58. The Government of Serbia retains several institutions operating in Kosovo. There 
are 17 collective centres accommodating Serb IDPs under the supervision and management 
of the Commissariat for Refugees and Migration of the Republic of Serbia. Therefore, any 
initiative related to the collective centres and the Serb IDPs residing in collective centres 
needs to be coordinated with the representatives/trustees of the Commissariat. 
</p>
<p>59. It would be beneficial to improve dialogue between the Commissariat, the Kosovo 
Property Agency and the Human Rights Advisory Panel. 
</p>
