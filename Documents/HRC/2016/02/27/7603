<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eighteenth session 
from 27 January to 7 February 2014. The review of Yemen was held at the 6th meeting on 
29 January 2014. The delegation of Yemen was headed by Hooria Mashhoyr Ahmed, 
Minister for Human Rights. At its 10th meeting held on 31 January 2014, the Working 
Group adopted the report on Yemen. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Yemen: the Congo, the Czech Republic and 
Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Yemen: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/YEM/1);  
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/YEM/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/18/YEM/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Island and the United States of America was 
transmitted to Yemen through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of 
the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation expressed deep appreciation for the support for the 
respect, promotion and protection of human rights in Yemen demonstrated directly or 
indirectly by the international community. She also expressed appreciation for the follow-
up by various treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that there had been substantial developments since the 
submission of the first UPR report in 2009. Key among them was the outbreak of the young 
people&#8217;s popular revolution as part of the Arab Spring events that began in late 2010 and  
persisted in diverse forms, with the people pitting themselves against forces fiercely 
determined to stifle change and prevent the attainment of desired goals. Those forces could 
never succeed, since the people had tasted freedom and sacrificed some of their finest 
offspring. The delegation counted on the continued support of the international community 
for the people&#8217;s choices and their right to systems of good governance that protected their 
rights and freedoms and achieved justice. 
</p><p>7. The delegation highlighted that the Working Group had no doubt  that the realization 
and promotion of human rights were closely linked to the rules and principles of good </p>


<p>governance. While all such values were enshrined in Yemen&#8217;s heritage and culture, they 
had occasionally been abused or neglected in practice.  
</p>
<p>8. The delegation noted that the Government of National Reconciliation, formed in late 
2011 following the signing of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative and its 
Implementation Mechanism, was inspired by the principles and values of the revolution and 
the international human rights standards reflected in Security Council resolutions 2014 and 
2051 and incorporated in the Government programme for the transitional phase. The 
Government had called on the international community to assist it in meeting its 
humanitarian and development needs at that complex and difficult stage. The delegation 
urged Yemenis to support the political settlement and the national reconciliation.  
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that the cases of southern Yemen and Saada had been the most 
complex issues faced by the National Dialogue Conference due to the injustices that had 
been ongoing there for more than a decade. All parties and political and social forces had 
eventually reached a consensus on core issues, such as the type of State envisaged, the 
nature of the political system and the criteria for the distribution of wealth and power. A 
consensus had been reached on transitioning from a centralized State to a federal structure. 
A balanced distribution of power and wealth between the centre and the periphery would be 
specified in the new Constitution. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation expressed pride at the successful conclusion of the National Dialogue 
Conference after ten months. It was fully aware that while some legal commitments had 
been fulfilled, the achievement of basic human rights in the period ahead presented major 
challenges in the areas of security, stability, construction and development. Work would 
now proceed on a new constitution focusing on good governance, the rule of law, the 
promotion of democracy and human rights. High priority would be given to those 
challenges by the Ministry of Human Rights, other government agencies with human rights 
responsibilities and civil society organizations, with the support of the regional and 
international communities and the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation highlighted the most important achievements outlined in its report, 
namely submission of the draft law on the national human rights institution based on the 
Paris Principles to the House of Representatives. It emphasized the important role played 
by advocacy and pressure by human rights bodies in ensuring the speedy enactment of 
laws, such as the Transitional Justice Act, accession to the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CPED) and the Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court (ICC). 
12. The delegation emphasized that the Government had complied with its obligation 
regarding the marriageable age and stated that the bill was pending before Parliament. The 
House of Representatives was discussing the bill on human trafficking, and the Government 
would shortly submit bills on enforced disappearances, the Optional Protocol to CAT, the 
Protocol against trafficking in human beings and others aimed at the protection and 
promotion of human rights.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>13. The delegation emphasized that priority attention was being given to the rights of 
marginalized and vulnerable groups such as women, children, people with disabilities, 
minorities and refugees. A Yemeni delegation had recently met with the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child to discuss the country&#8217;s third periodic report, and the Committee&#8217;s 
recommendations would be implemented. The eighth periodic report to the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women was also due to be reviewed. The 
prominent participation of Yemeni women in public life was an important achievement, and 
women would doubtlessly make a significant contribution to public life in the future. Their 
role was currently based on constitutional guarantees and would eventually be reflected in 
other laws and public policies and programmes. </p>


<p>14. The Ministry of Human Rights and its partners in the Government and civil society 
had elaborated a national human rights strategy and a national strategy to combat 
trafficking. Preparations for the creation of a national observatory to monitor child rights 
violations were also under way. 
</p>
<p>15. Priority was being given to capacity-building programmes for human rights workers 
in the field of human rights and to the development of partnerships with civil society, the 
international community and the private sector. High priority was also being given to 
transparency and the fight against corruption,  
</p>
<p>16. Responding to concerns about outstanding benefits and obligations, the delegation 
stated that progress was being made in that regard, with the most significant being the 
appointment of members of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the events of 2011 
and the enactment of the Transitional Justice Act. It had been necessary to undertake 
measures reflecting the application of and approaches to transitional justice prior to the 
promulgation of the law, including the formation of committees to address land issues, the 
case of those forcibly dismissed from employment in the southern provinces after the 1994 
war and the submission of apologies to the people of the south and of Saada for violations 
that had occurred in those regions. The Act would be considered in the light of national 
dialogue outcomes concerning the establishment of committees based on equity and 
reconciliation that would act in accordance with international norms of transitional justice. 
</p><p>17. According to the delegation, the Government had approved a comprehensive 
national strategy for combating terrorism based on respect for human rights. The existing 
draft law would be amended to include an accurate definition of terrorist crimes so that it 
would not be used abusively against political opponents. The National Dialogue 
Conference had demanded the cessation of the use of drones. The House of Representatives 
had adopted the same position and insisted that the means used to fight against terrorism 
should not harm civilians and should be based on human rights standards. The Government 
was preparing to receive detained citizens from Guantanamo, particularly those who had 
not been charged with terrorism, so that they could be rehabilitated and integrated into 
society. The United States of America had lifted restrictions on the detainees and 
authorized their return. Yemen would continue to fight terrorism, since it undermined 
development and greatly increased humanitarian requirements. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation reaffirmed its determination to ensure respect for human rights 
despite the obstacles created by the legacy of past abuses and the continuing repercussions 
of capacity limitations. 
</p>
<p>19. The head of the delegation noted that Yemen had responded to the advance 
questions and inquiries submitted by Germany, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Sweden, the 
United Kingdom, the United States, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Mexico, Norway, 
Slovenia and Spain. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the interactive dialogue, 78 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>21. Canada enquired about progress in ensuring access for women to education and 
equal treatment in custody cases, and in creating support mechanisms for divorcees and 
women victims of violence, particularly sexual violence. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Chad noted considerable improvements in the human rights situation 
notwithstanding the ongoing disturbances. It also noted that the report had been prepared in 
consultation with all human rights institutions. Chad made recommendations. </p>


<p>23. Chile commended the progress made during the political transition, the commitment 
to promote and protect human rights and the efforts made to implement Human Rights 
Council resolutions. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. China appreciated the commitment for the promotion and protection of human rights 
and welcomed the protection of the rights of women, children and other vulnerable groups.

attention to the difficulties faced by Yemen and provide assistance accordingly. China 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>25. Colombia welcomed the initiation of the process aimed at strengthening the rule of 
law, the institutional framework and democracy. Colombia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. The Congo commended efforts to stabilize the sociopolitical and economic 
environment and encouraged Yemen to continue promoting national dialogue. It expressed

conflict with the law, among others. The Congo made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Cuba commended action to address existing challenges during the political 
transition, including the drafting and adoption of a new Constitution. It noted with 
satisfaction the reform of the legal system, the strengthening of the rule of law and 
measures to combat corruption. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. The Czech Republic expressed concern about a number of human rights challenges 
that required urgent action. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Denmark welcomed the human rights action plan and the recommendations of the 
National Dialogue Conference. It enquired about progress in removing juvenile prisoners 
from death row and implementing the National Action Plan for the eradication of female 
genital mutilation (FGM). It acknowledged the recommendation to introduce a minimum 
marriageable age of 18 years. Denmark made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Djibouti commended the establishment of a national human rights institution based 
on the Paris Principles and the ratification of core international human rights treaties. 
Djibouti made recommendations. 
</p><p>31. Ecuador welcomed the adoption of the Action Plan on child labour, the creation of 
the Rehabilitation and Welfare Fund for Persons with Disabilities and efforts to promote 
immunization against, and eradication of, endemic and infectious diseases. Ecuador made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Egypt<b> </b>appreciated the open approach in dealing with the international mechanisms

<p>33. Eritrea noted with satisfaction the ongoing efforts to restore peace and stability. 
Eritrea made recommendations. 
</p>

and Development and measures to strengthen the rule of law, reform the judicial system 
and combat corruption. It noted the progress made in primary education and in promoting 
gender parity in education. Ethiopia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. France was pleased to note that the National Dialogue Conference had discussed the 
human rights situation and it supported efforts to promote a democratic political transition. 
France made recommendations. </p>


<p>36. Germany acknowledged the efforts to improve the human rights situation during the 
political transition and the successful conclusion of the National Dialogue Conference. 
Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Guatemala welcomed the holding of the National Dialogue Conference, the National 
Human Rights Conference and the National Conference for Women. It noted the measures 
taken to promote the participation of women in political and economic life and to end 
discrimination against women under domestic law. It was concerned about the lack of 
constitutional protection of children&#8217;s rights and of a clear and consistent definition of the 
child applicable in all legal texts. Guatemala made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>38. Indonesia commended efforts to ensure that the promotion and protection of human 
rights remained a key priority in the transitional process. It was pleased to note that the 
National Human Rights Institution Bill had been submitted to Parliament. Indonesia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Iraq welcomed the conclusion of the inclusive National Dialogue Conference and 
commended the development of the Transitional Program for Stabilization and 
Development and efforts made to combat financial and administrative corruption. Iraq 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>40. Ireland expressed concern about the death penalty for juveniles, widespread 
malnutrition among children under five and the critical problem of stunting. It was 
concerned that a minimum marriageable age had not been set and that child marriage was a 
major factor in malnutrition and a root cause of female illiteracy. Ireland made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Italy was concerned about the imposition of the death penalty, especially for non-
violent crimes. It welcomed measures taken to increase women&#8217;s participation in public life 
and business. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Japan hoped that the national dialogue would address transitional justice, promotion 
of women&#8217;s rights and the empowerment of women. It was concerned about unequal school 
enrolment rates for boys and girls, early marriage and reports of unlawful arrests and torture 
by law enforcement authorities. Japan made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>43. Jordan appreciated the Prime Minister&#8217;s approval on the draft law establishing a 
national human rights institution in addition to drafting a law against money-laundering and 
the financing of terrorism. Jordan also welcomed Yemen&#8217;s accession to CPED and the 
Rome Statute. Jordan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Kenya welcomed the ratification of human rights instruments, compliance with 
treaty reporting obligations and measures to enhance women&#8217;s role in society and decision-
making processes. It encouraged Yemen to take further action in support of the 
participation of vulnerable and marginalized groups in all spheres of life. Kenya made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>45. In response to questions concerning women, children, marginalized people and 
minorities, the head of the delegation said that Yemeni women had suffered from 
marginalization and major gender imbalances in education and political life. Yemeni 
women had played a high-profile role in the peaceful and popular youth revolution and 
were therefore difficult to ignore. They had acquired the strength and resilience to persist in 
their efforts to secure all their demands and rights. Yemen had taken steps to improve the 
status of Yemeni women and to actively involve them in all areas, but it was unable to meet 
all obligations pertaining to the establishment of full equality. Women represented 30 per 
cent of all components of the national dialogue and played a significant role in the process. </p>


<p>46. The delegation highlighted the effective participation of women in the National 
Dialogue Conference that had led to the adoption of a resolution requiring that women 
accounted for at least 30 per cent of all State authorities. That provision would enable 
women to participate effectively in the development process. Women were also represented 
in and sometimes led civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>47. Many measures had been taken to protect girls from the dangers of early marriage 
and to specify the marriageable age. A bill setting the minimum age of 17 years had been 
approved by the House of Representatives in February 2009, but it had not yet been 
promulgated. Steps were being taken to promote its promulgation. The Government and 
NGOs had undertaken numerous activities aimed at raising awareness of the problem. The 
national dialogue outcomes were binding and required the House of Representatives to 
specify the marriageable age in the Personal Status Law. The head of the delegation was 
confident that that aim would be achieved with the backing of civil society, OHCHR, the 
international community and the global media.  
</p>
<p>48. The delegation highlighted the submission to the House of Representatives of the 
draft law on the independent human rights institution based on the Paris Principles. It stated 
that the law would definitely be enacted shortly, in coordination with the representatives 
and that there would be no objections from political parties. 
</p><p>49. With regard to the issue of violence against women and, in particular, FGM, the 
Government had agreed to conduct a study on gender-based violence, including against 
refugees. FGM was deemed to constitute violence against women and was a priority issue. 
The Government had suspended health workers who practised FGM. 
</p>
<p>50. The delegation highlighted the national dialogue outcomes as a contribution to the 
promotion of economic and social rights and the equal distribution of wealth and power. 
However, the Government faced many challenges, such as the high unemployment rate and 
poverty index. The adoption of a three-year national youth employment plan providing for 
more than 150,000 jobs had been adopted. The Transitional Programme for Stabilization 
and Development included a number of policies and action programmes that gave priority 
to the creation of employment opportunities for youth and the development of human 
resources. 
</p>
<p>51. A draft amendment to the Judicial Authority Act had been prepared to enhance the 
independence of the judiciary. It contained provisions designed to limit the powers of the 
Minister of Justice in matters relating to judges; to expand the powers of the Supreme 
Judicial Council; and to provide for the transfer of the functions of the Judicial Inspectorate 
and the Office of the Public Prosecutor to the Supreme Judicial Council. 
</p>
<p>52. Yemen was among 97 States that had not abolished the death penalty. It imposed the 
penalty for the most serious crimes, in line with the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR). There was no article in Yemeni law that authorized the 
imposition of the death penalty on juveniles. A committee had been established with the 
assistance of experts from Jordan to ensure that children were not executed. Of the 25 
detainees on death row suspected of being children, only three had been found to be under 
18 and their sentences had been revised, even though they had been ratified by the 
President and returned to the High Court. 
</p>
<p>53. A woman occupied the position of Vice-President of the Supreme Court. Women 
also headed appeal courts and held positions in the Juvenile Court. 
</p>
<p>54. Kuwait noted the difficulties Yemen facing regarding its stability and security and 
the positive steps taken during the national dialogue, which included all Yemenis, among 
them political parties and civil society organizations. Kuwait made a recommendation. </p>


<p>55. Latvia welcomed the recommendations of the National Dialogue Conference aimed 
at advancing the situation of women and encouraged Yemen to continue aligning its 
policies and legislation with relevant obligations under the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Latvia made recommendations. 
56. Lebanon<b> </b>noted the submission to Parliament of the draft law on the establishment of 
a national human rights institution and the establishment of a national committee to combat 
trafficking in persons. Lebanon made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Libya welcomed efforts made by the Ministry of Human Rights to establish a 
national human rights institution in compliance with Paris Principles and the development 
of national strategy for human rights. It welcomed the recommendations of the National 
Dialogue Conference. Libya made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>58. Lithuania noted efforts to eliminate discrimination against women but remained 
concerned about honour killings and forced marriages. It was also concerned about the 
execution of juvenile offenders and about assaults on journalists and bloggers by public 
authorities and non-governmental groups. Lithuania made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Malaysia noted the adoption of the Transitional Programme for Stabilization and 
Development and the efforts to establish an independent national human rights institution 
based on the Paris Principles. It commended the efforts to develop the National Human 
Rights Strategy. Malaysia made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>60. The Maldives commended Yemen on its commitment to bringing peace and 
prosperity to its citizens and on its human rights progress, while urging it to address 
grievances and ensure that past atrocities were thoroughly investigated. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Mauritania commended the ratification of a number of international conventions and 
optional protocols related to human rights, such as International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 
Mauritania made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Mexico noted efforts to establish a national human rights institution. It urged Yemen 
to give priority to respect for human rights in the new Constitution and in the forthcoming 
presidential elections. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Montenegro shared the concerns of the Human Rights Committee about the 
imposition of the death penalty for minors in Yemen. It asked whether steps had been taken 
to amend the Criminal Code to reduce capital punishment and abolish the death penalty for 
minors. Montenegro made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Morocco commended the efforts taken towards drafting a law to establish an 
independent national institution for human rights in compliance with Paris Principles and 
the establishment of a national committee to combat trafficking in persons. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>65. The Netherlands commended Yemen on successfully concluding the National 
Dialogue Conference, which included women and young persons. It welcomed the personal 
commitment of the Minister of Human Rights to establish a human rights framework and 
her active stance against child marriage. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Nicaragua encouraged Yemen to take the results of the UPR review into account in 
the national dialogue, in which civil society, including women and young people, 
participated. Nicaragua made recommendations. </p>


<p>67. Norway welcomed the National Dialogue Conference, in which many women and 
young people participated. It was concerned about reports of discrimination and violence 
against those vulnerable groups and that a law proposing a minimum marital age had not 
yet been ratified by Parliament. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Oman noted the efforts made to enhance and protect human rights by the 
development of many strategies and national plans to improve education, training and youth 
employment. Oman made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>69. Pakistan commended the administrative and legal measures aimed at strengthening 
national institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights. It acknowledged the 
challenges, including poverty, unemployment and non-availability of health services. 
Pakistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. The Philippines was encouraged by the commitment to assisting refugees and 
migrants, despite resource constraints, and the continued upgrading of its institutions, 
policies and programmes to better promote and protect human rights. It lauded the inclusion 
of women and youth in the National Dialogue Conference. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Poland commended progress achieved by the National Dialogue Conference and in 
universal primary education, gender parity and the refugee asylum process. It was 
concerned about the high number of executions and extrajudicial killings and reports of 
violence against vulnerable groups. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Portugal noted efforts made by the Government to enhance the promotion and 
protection of human rights, especially within a framework of national reconciliation and 
institutional capacity-building. Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Qatar congratulated Yemen on the success of the inclusive National Dialogue 
Conference in approving the national document and welcomed the efforts to develop the 
Transitional Program for Stabilization and Development (TPSD). Qatar made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. The Republic of Korea acknowledged the efforts to promote fundamental freedoms 
and enhance human rights, particularly through the National Dialogue Conference. The 
Government&#8217;s cooperation in the opening of the OHCHR office could serve as a model for 
other countries. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Saudi Arabia commended Yemen&#8217;s cooperation in both the international and 
national spheres, including with the United Nations and praised the establishment of a 
committee to combat trafficking in persons. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Senegal welcomed the efforts to enhance the protection and promotion of human 
rights and to implement the Transitional Programme for Stabilization and Development. It 
highlighted the programmes developed specifically for children with special needs and 
from poor backgrounds. Senegal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. The delegation stated that the Transitional Justice Bill that had been withdrawn 
would be reconsidered in the light of the national dialogue outcomes. A committee 
established for the purpose had concluded that it would be based on equity and 
reconciliation in order to comply with international transitional justice standards.  
</p><p>78. In principle, Yemen always approved requests for visits by Special Rapporteurs. 
However, in view of the exceptional circumstances experienced by the country during the 
previous UPR cycle, requests had been deferred until the completion of the national 
dialogue. Yemen confirmed its readiness to welcome visits whenever the Special 
Rapporteurs saw fit.  </p>


<p>79. Commenting on the country&#8217;s media and press, the head of the delegation stated that 
once the House of Representatives had concluded its consideration of the Audiovisual 
Media Bill, it would be possible to establish many private radio and television channels in 
addition to existing public and private channels. The Government had demonstrated a 
genuine willingness to promote and protect the freedoms of opinion and expression, the 
press and information, and the right of access to data. Some violations were attributable to 
influential people responding to criticism, but they did not reflect government policy or 
practice and judicial action was an option in such cases. 
</p><p>80. Singapore noted the efforts to strengthen the rule of law, reform the judiciary,  
improve living standards, support low-income households, particularly in rural areas and 
vulnerable groups, and set up training programmes for youth. Singapore made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. Slovakia asked what further measures were envisaged to abolish the death penalty 
for juveniles. It deplored the unsatisfactory situation of women, who continued to face 
discriminatory practices, and called for a more targeted approach. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. Slovenia, as a strong supporter of the abolition of the death penalty, was concerned 
that capital punishment for juvenile offenders was still imposed de facto and that child 
recruitment into the armed forces continued in Yemen. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Somalia paid particular attention to social cohesion and stability in Yemen because 
they had a direct impact on Somalia. Somalia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>84. Spain commended the Transitional Programme for Stabilization and Development, 
the National Human Rights Conference and the National Human Rights Strategy. It hoped 
that the new Constitution would incorporate fundamental rights and freedoms that would 
serve as the basis for lasting peace and stability. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>85. The State of Palestine welcomed the opening of the OHCHR office in Yemen and its 
readiness to cooperate with different United Nations mechanisms. Palestine also noted the 
steps taken to guarantee freedom of opinion and expression, progress in the field of 
education and to achieve gender equality. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>86. Sudan congratulated Yemen on the conclusion of the national dialogue process and 
praised Yemen for holding the first conference on human rights in December 2012 and for 
working to establish national monitoring mechanisms such as the national institution for 
human rights. Sudan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>87. Sweden welcomed the work carried out by the Ministry of Human Rights to 
implement CEDAW. It requested further information on action being taken in that area, 
especially regarding discriminatory practices such as male guardianship. Sweden made
