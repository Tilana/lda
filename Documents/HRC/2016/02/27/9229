<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its first session from 7 to 18 April 
2008. The review of Morocco was held at the fourth meeting held on 8 April 2008. The delegation

</b></p>
<p><b>I.  SUMMARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE REVIEW PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the fourth meeting of the Working Group on 8 April 2008, the Minister of Justice, 
H.E. Mr. Abdelwahad RADI, introduced the national report of Morocco. Morocco had adopted a 
participatory approach for the preparation of this report, involving all stakeholders, in accordance 
with the guidelines of the Human Rights Council. The consultations and dialogue had been 
constructive, and it is planned to institutionalize this collaboration by establishing a standing 
consultation committee, which would bring together relevant stakeholders. Morocco&#8217;s approach to 
the promotion and protection of human rights involved reinforcement of the Constitution, 
harmonization of legislation and the establishment of a truth, justice and reconciliation commission, 
the Equity and Reconciliation Instance (<i>Instance Equite et reconciliation</i> - IER). Furthermore, this 
approach involves the ratification of relevant international human rights instruments, and 
cooperation with treaty bodies and special procedures. 
</p>
<p>6. With regard to accession to international human rights treaties, Morocco noted its recognition 
of the competence of the respective committees provided for in articles 14 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) and 22 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
(CAT), and the withdrawal of its reservations to article 20 of CAT and 14 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (CRC), as well as to certain provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). It also highlighted that the process of </p>

 <p> 
adherence to the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), and the Optional Protocols to CEDAW and CAT is under way. 
</p>
<p>7. Since the 1990s, Morocco has developed an institutional infrastructure, including by creating 
a national institution in accordance with the Paris Principles, the <i>Conseil Consultatif des Droits de 
l&#8217;Homme </i>(CCDH), the establishment of a Ministry for Human Rights, Administrative Courts of 
Appeal, the <i>Diwan Al Madhalim</i> (Ombudsman), the High Authority of Audiovisual 
Communication, the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture, the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan 
Affairs and the Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad. 
</p>
<p>8. Regarding standard-setting and reforms, initiatives to harmonize domestic legislation with 
international standards included the adoption of a new Code of Criminal Procedure; the Family and 
Labour Codes; and the Law on political parties. Amendments were introduced also in the Criminal 
Code, including the criminalization of torture. The reform of the Communal Charter aimed at 
strengthening local democracy and streamlining the management of communal resources is 
currently in discussion. The reform of the Press Code is the subject of a broad debate involving all 
stakeholders; it aims at meeting international standards and striking a balance between public and 
private rights and human dignity, and the freedom of expression. Currently, discussions focus on 
the limited number of prison sentences provided for in the draft press code. In this context, 
Morocco stressed the importance of individual and collective freedoms for the preservation of a 
social equilibrium, and noted that an increasing number of associations were founded and 
assemblies were authorized, and that efforts were made to support the work of human rights 
defenders throughout the entire national territory. Reforms adopted to implement the legislative 
framework covered civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. The protection of individual 
freedoms, the presumption of innocence and fair trial standards were the underlying principles of 
the new Criminal Code. In the framework of the National Charter for Justice, the judiciary had 
undergone a reform strengthening its independence and efficiency. As to the fight against terrorism, 
Morocco, which has been a victim of this plague, has adopted legislation in accordance with 
international standards unanimously by the Parliament. Relevant departments were bound by this 
legislation. 
</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, Morocco highlighted its efforts to promote a culture of human rights, both 
through school curricula and through the media and training courses for law enforcement personnel. 
At the international level, Morocco, together with Switzerland, had initiated the elaboration of a 
United Nations declaration on human rights education and training. 
</p>
<p>10. Morocco paid special attention to the rights of persons with disabilities, as well as to children, 
including by establishing the Parliament of Child (<i>Parlement de l&#8217;enfant</i>) and the adoption of a 
national plan of action. A number of initiatives had been adopted with a view to empowering 
women, such as a national strategy for the integration of a gender perspective in development 
policies, and measures to promote the role of women in political and economic life, which had led 
to an increased representation of women in Parliament and Government. 
</p>
<p>11. The approach adopted by Morocco to facilitate the promotion of economic, social and cultural 
rights was consistent with sustainable development, and was limited only by available economic 
resources. It focused on issues such as restoring regional balances, the protection of property rights, 
strengthening of infrastructures and policies to facilitate access to housing, medical benefits and 
education. 
</p>
<p>12. The Equity and Reconciliation Commission has been set up to address past human rights 
violations and to achieve the four strategic goals of transitional justice:  (a) establishment of the 
truth on these violations; (b) compensation for damages suffered by victims, including through </p>

 <p> 
financial compensation, medical coverage and rehabilitation, social reinsertion and community 
reparation; (c) reconciliation through public debate; and (d) recommendations on reforms aimed at 
ensuring non-repetition and fighting impunity. The CCDH was tasked with the follow-up of the 
implementation of the various recommendations emanating from the Commission, in close 
cooperation with the Government and other stakeholders. The process facilitated public debate on 
human rights and thus contributed to democratic transition. 
</p>
<p>13. His Majesty King Mohammed VI launched in 2005 the National Initiative of Human 
Development (INDH), which constitutes an action plan for the promotion of economic, social and 
cultural rights by placing the human being at the centre of development efforts. The initiative aimed 
at promoting the full realization of the right to development, and is characterized by its participatory 
and collaborative character involving a number of stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>14. While noting its important achievements in the field of human rights, Morocco is at the same 
time aware of remaining deficits in light of its own ambitions. Finally, the delegation underlined the 
care with which the national report had been prepared and that its composition demonstrated the 
importance Morocco attached to the UPR exercise. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>15. During the ensuing interactive dialogue, statements were made by delegations. 
</p>
<p>16. Palestine recalled that Morocco is an old civilization that remains a bridge between the North 
and the South. Morocco had paid special attention to education, free at all levels, which places it at 
the forefront of educational development. Palestine further noted that Morocco promotes cultural, 
economic and social rights, with women participating in a large number of fields related to human 
rights. Noting that the majority of the Moroccan population are children, Palestine reminded that 
Morocco was a party to all relevant conventions including the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. Noting that Morocco was faced with an increased migratory flow, Palestine enquired about 
the extent to which the countries of origin and destination contributed to facing this challenge. 
</p>
<p>17. Kuwait praised the political will of Morocco to protect all human rights, political, civil and 
social and economic, and to consolidate the role of civil society, noting also its close cooperation 
with international mechanisms and all parties at all levels. With reference to the National Plan on 
Childhood for the period 2006-2015 Kuwait requested further information on the objectives of this 
programme. 
</p>
<p>18. Pakistan reiterated the unique position of Morocco in the UPR process as Morocco was the 
architect of this mechanism, and praised Morocco&#8217;s respect for pluralism, tolerance and diversity. 
Pakistan referred to INDH, Morocco&#8217;s network of voluntary associations, steps it has taken to 
harmonize national laws with international instruments to ensure gender equality, and its 
engagement with the human rights machinery. It referred to the economic constraints, such as 
drought, faced by Morocco, which stresses the Government&#8217;s need for assistance. Morocco was 
requested to explain steps undertaken to oppose and fight terrorism through the early warning 
system. 
</p>
<p>19. The Russian Federation, while commending Morocco on the considerable progress achieved 
and the political will to move forward, emphasized the need to continue to take concrete steps in 
implementing economic, social and cultural rights. As regards measures taken to implement a 
gender perspective, Morocco&#8217;s annual reports on gender issues, since 2005, also focus on gender 
budgeting. The Russian Federation requested further details on this innovative practice which 
according to CEDAW is used in only 40 States. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>20. The Syrian Arab Republic highlighted Morocco&#8217;s implementation of all its commitments to 
promote human rights through a constructive and frank dialogue with the United Nations. It 
requested more information on the steps taken by Morocco to lay the foundation for a human rights 
culture, especially within its institutional framework, and recommended that Morocco pursue its 
efforts in disseminating and consolidating a culture of human rights. 
</p>
<p>21. Senegal commended Morocco&#8217;s efforts to incorporate international norms into its domestic 
legislation and invited Morocco to provide information on the latest progress regarding the rights of 
women and the situation of Moroccan citizens living abroad. 
</p>
<p>22. Mauritius commended Morocco on the wide-ranging legislative and institutional measures it 
had undertaken. It highlighted, as an example of best practice, the IER and its pivotal role in 
redeeming the victims of gross human rights violations. Mauritius requested further information on 
the status of the draft law on violence against women and to what extent it will take into account 
domestic violence and protection of the victims of such violence. Finally, Mauritius referred to the 
INDH and enquired about its main achievements and the kind of support it obtained from the 
international community to implement the Initiative. 
</p>
<p>23. Malaysia, commending Morocco on its strong commitment to promote and protect human 
rights, noted the obstacles and the challenges it faced, in particular the economic constraints which 
are severely hampering the implementation of national policies and actions in the field of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>24. Yemen noted the achievements made by Morocco in its consolidation of civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights and its commitments to the implementation of human rights. It 
referred to the new measures adopted by IER and asked about the procedures for collective 
compensation that were envisaged. 
</p>
<p>25. Ghana welcomed the harmonization of domestic legislation with international instruments 
and Morocco&#8217;s willingness to honour treaties to which it is party through cooperation with the 
special procedures. Ghana highlighted the adoption of an anti-corruption plan that will contribute to 
maximizing national wealth and suggested that Morocco share its experience on the implementation 
of these measures. It also suggested that Morocco&#8217;s National Human Development Plan be referred 
to as a good practice to be shared. Finally, in view of the constraints and challenges faced by the 
country, Ghana supported Morocco&#8217;s request for assistance. 
</p>
<p>26. In reply to the questions put forward by various delegations, the representative of Morocco 
referred to migration as a global issue. Morocco is a host country, a transition country and a country 
of origin, which poses a threefold problem for Morocco. Despite the heavy burden to harbour 
migrants Morocco remains a hospitable country and manages migrant issues with an integrated 
approach, incorporating co-development and shared responsibility. Morocco was an initiator of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families, and the first country to initiate a dialogue between European and African countries 
on migration and to provide, in this process, a collective response to this issue. 
</p>
<p>27. In response to Kuwait&#8217;s question on the situation of children, Morocco shared its hope to 
improve the situation of children for their full enjoyment of rights to access to education and 
protection. Morocco has made budgetary allocations to protect children under the National Plan of 
Action given the importance Morocco placed on human development. In conformity with its 
international obligations, it has amended its legislation on child labour and developed programmes 
to ensure that children do not stay on the street. A reference plan was also elaborated that would 
lead to a national strategy to ensure equality between girls and boys. Morocco has established </p>

 <p> 
equality between men and women in the budget in the context of its economic reform. In 2008, 
Morocco carried out a budget analysis with the support of UNFPA, and has worked towards 
improving its national capacity. 
</p>
<p>28. With regard to terrorism, Morocco referred to how terrorism had struck the country and to the 
resources it had mobilized to combat it. Moroccan counter-terrorism laws were no different than 
other laws, apart from including the right to inspection, freezing and confiscation of property and 
money used to finance terrorism of those convicted for terrorism. Morocco endeavoured to involve 
citizens in combating terrorism and in these programmes. Morocco stated that it had proposed 
financial compensation for victims of serious violations of human rights in the past and was 
undertaking an ambitious programme to propose collective compensation. Morocco has also set up 
national archives to maintain a collective memory, in particular in regions where violations took 
place, in order to raise public awareness. Finally, Morocco referred to its plans for the consolidation 
of a human rights culture since the adoption of a national programme in 1994 that generated a 
dynamic movement to promote human rights and to raise awareness of Moroccan citizens. Morocco 
believes that working through schools will help shape the society of the future. Thus, Morocco has 
optimized this platform with the participation of all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>29. Egypt praised Morocco&#8217;s pioneering role in the UPR process. It raised the issue of adequate 
housing and the need for further information on the efforts undertaken to increase the number of 
persons benefiting from decent housing. 
</p>
<p>30. Bangladesh noted with particular attention the creation of IER, CCDH and the Ombudsman. 
It requested information on actions taken to promote and implement child rights and on how the 
INDH will help implement economic, social and cultural rights. Bangladesh recommended that the 
request by Morocco for technical cooperation be included in the report of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>31. Saudi Arabia welcomed the reforms and commitment of Morocco to the promotion of human 
rights, and recommended that Morocco&#8217;s achievements in the field of human rights be included in 
the report. Saudi Arabia also asked for further clarification on the INDH. 
</p>
<p>32. Oman asked for further information on the initiative with Switzerland related to human rights 
education, and on local actions taken in this respect. 
</p>
<p>33. Germany noted the achievements of the IER and that the Constitutional Council on Human 
Rights will ensure follow-up to the Commission&#8217;s recommendations. Germany expressed 
satisfaction at the high priority given to these recommendations, specifically the strengthening of 
human rights guarantees in the Constitution and other laws, and requested more information 
regarding the follow-up and activities generated as a result of these recommendations. Germany 
enquired about the adoption of the <i>code de la presse</i> and, when drafting this law, how the 
importance of protecting freedom of expression will be incorporated. 
</p>
<p>34. Mali thanked Morocco for its contribution to the development of the UPR mechanism and its 
efforts to promote and protect human rights. Mali was in particular attentive to the rights of the 
child and found the reply to its questions on the content of the plan &#8220;Morocco Worthy of its 
Children&#8221;, satisfactory. 
</p>
<p>35. Bahrain, noting Morocco&#8217;s adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, asked 
about the steps Morocco has taken to adapt its national legislation to the Convention. 
</p>
<p>36. Belgium noted the role of the Ambassador of Morocco as facilitator of the establishment of 
the UPR mechanism, and welcomed the institutional steps taken by Morocco to promote and </p>

 <p> 
protect human rights, particularly the reorganization of the CCDH on the basis of the Paris 
Principles. Belgium also welcomed the establishment of the Ombudsman responsible for 
considering complaints by persons seeking redress. While highlighting the Family Code of 2004 
and the progress made by Morocco in the area of equality between men and women, Belgium noted 
that the Family Code was not well known among the judiciary, as pointed out by CEDAW, and 
inquired what measures Morocco envisaged to take to raise the awareness of judges of the Code in 
all regions of the country. 
</p>
<p>37. Canada welcomed the establishment of the IER and Morocco&#8217;s commitment to protecting 
human rights. It also noted that violations still exist: journalists risk prosecution, prison and 
prohibition of their publications if they report on certain subjects. Canada enquired about legislative 
reforms, and wanted to know whether Morocco is planning to enact legislation concerning 
defamation and libel. Concerning the reform of the 2004 Family Code, Canada requested 
information on how Morocco will train and educate the judiciary in order to raise their awareness of 
the rights of women. It noted that the figures reveal an alarming situation and asked about the 
measures Morocco intends to take to address this emergency and to comply with the 
recommendations of CEDAW. 
</p>
<p>38. France commended Morocco&#8217;s transparency, spirit of cooperation and commitment. It noted 
the role of the Ambassador of Morocco in defining the UPR modalities, and the organization, with 
the support of OHCHR, of a seminar in Rabat on UPR. Morocco&#8217;s report and statements illustrate 
that it has taken firm steps on human rights, in particular with the establishment of the IER and the 
National Council for Human Development. France requested information on Morocco&#8217;s needs in 
regard to technical cooperation and highlighted the following issues: micro-projects in 
communities, exchange of best practices, support from OHCHR for the preparation of a national 
action plan, and training aimed at facilitating access to rights. 
</p>
<p>39. Sweden noted that Morocco&#8217;s presentation showed an impressive number of institutions and 
legal initiatives promoting respect for human rights. Sweden asked Morocco to share the legal 
reasoning on which its fight against terrorism is based and the relation to its international human 
rights obligations. Sweden holds that Morocco&#8217;s clarification is particularly relevant regarding its 
provisions on detention and the definition of terrorism in the 2003 anti-terrorism law. Sweden also 
requested information regarding the future reform of Morocco&#8217;s press legislation. 
</p>
<p>40. Guinea expressed interest in the recent progress of the IER, and hoped that Morocco will 
increase its cooperation with the Human Rights Council and benefit from its recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Mexico commended Morocco on its progress in the promotion and protection of human 
rights. Mexico requested information on the conclusions and work of the IER and the difficulties 
encountered by Morocco in bringing to justice individuals responsible for violations, enforced 
disappearances and torture. Mexico was also interested in the commitments Morocco has made to 
overcome such difficulties. It recommended that Morocco continue to ensure respect for the human 
rights of migrants, irrespective of their migratory condition, and in particular those in a vulnerable 
position. It also recommended that Morocco ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons against Enforced Disappearance and the 
International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>42. Indonesia noted Morocco&#8217;s promotion of measures aimed at ensuring the respect for 
fundamental freedoms and of strategies that integrate human rights at local and national levels. 
Indonesia applauded Morocco for its independent national press, and highlighted strategies aimed at 
promoting gender equality. It asked if Morocco considers the rights of women as the major 
challenge to their efforts to modernize the application of human rights, and requested information </p>

 <p> 
about Morocco&#8217;s long-term commitments to gender equality and how international human rights 
mechanisms will help to achieve them. 
</p>
<p>43. Mauritania welcomed the steps taken by Morocco to promote and protect human rights, and 
noted the reform of the Family Code, the press code and the establishment of the IER, which was a 
first for the Arab-Muslim world. 
</p>
<p>44. Brazil recognized the progress made regarding equality and discrimination of women, 
children, civil liberties and right to a fair trial. It expressed concern at the implementation and 
results of measures taken, specifically with regard to gender equality. It asked how Morocco 
assessed the results of its initiatives meant to ensure women&#8217;s rights, and welcomed Morocco&#8217;s 
ratification of CEDAW. 
</p>
<p>45. Italy expressed satisfaction that Morocco has, since 1994, maintained a de facto moratorium 
on the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>46. India was impressed with the initiatives undertaken by Morocco to protect and promote 
human rights. It noted Morocco&#8217;s design of a national strategy and plan of action for human rights 
education. Also noting the addition of the Office of the Ombudsman, responsible for the 
consideration of cases of human rights violations, to the CCDH, India asked how the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
mandate differs from that of the CCDH. It highlighted the success of Morocco&#8217;s initiatives aimed at 
increasing the presence of women in politics and asked which legislative changes and aspects of the 
voluntary quota system made this possible. 
</p>
<p>47. The United Kingdom highlighted the new Family Code, changes to the Nationality Code, 
which both carry improvements to the legal protection of women, and the legislative elections open 
to international observers. It recommended that Morocco set a date to sign and adopt the Optional 
Protocol to CAT. The United Kingdom was concerned about issues of censorship, restrictions of the 
media, and the prosecution of prominent journalists and asked what steps Morocco is taking to 
ensure freedom of expression and speech, especially for media personnel. Prison conditions are also 
an issue for the United Kingdom, noting that the Moroccan Prison Observers reported extreme 
overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions. The United Kingdom encouraged Morocco to continue 
its efforts to improve these conditions and is interested in further initiatives planned in this area. 
</p>
<p>48. The United Arab Emirates noted that Morocco attaches importance to international treaty 
mechanisms and cooperation with treaty bodies. It thanked Morocco for its efforts to improve the 
circumstances and provide a better standard of living for women and children. It is convinced that 
Morocco is on the right track for the promotion and protection of human rights, and noting that the 
INDH, resulting from commitments to the United Nations, is a good example, asked for more 
information about it. 
</p>
<p>49. In response to various questions, Morocco provided the following answers. Regarding 
collective reparation, programmes adopted on the basis of a rights-based and participatory 
approach, taking into account a gender perspective, have been set up and implemented with the 
participation of all stakeholders. Budget resources are allocated for these programmes, including 
several projects to combat poverty, with a participative approach. The delegation also gave 
information and explanations on the INDH. It also gave information about promoting adequate 
housing rights. Concerning the freedom of the press, Morocco referred to the Constitution and the 
press code which regulates this freedom. The press code is now under review with the participation 
of all stakeholders. Journalists are not prosecuted for expressing their opinions but for committing 
crimes, such as defamation; and there is no censorship in Morocco. As regards the family, there are 
special courts for family affairs. The Family Code is evaluated annually, at the anniversary of its </p>

 <p> 
adoption. With reference to IER, compensation has been granted to victims of ill-treatment. 
Regarding prisoners, there is legislation prohibiting torture, and trainings are organized for prison 
guards with the support of several partners. The overcrowding of prisons can be dealt with through 
budgetary or legal measures, or by identifying alternatives to prison terms. For the first time in 
Morocco, a definition of torture in accordance with CAT has been adopted and many measures 
have been taken to prevent torture. Regarding technical cooperation needs, Morocco referred to the 
national report, which provides some ideas by way of indication, and added areas such as the 
elaboration and implementation of training programmes. Another example is the organization of 
meetings on best practices regarding the preparation of national reports, and support to the 
publication and dissemination of documentation for the general public and adapted to different age 
groups. A further example is the support to the development of specific radio and television 
programmes in the area of human rights, and the organizations of training seminars for law 
enforcement officials. As for human rights education, human rights are now part of schools&#8217; 
curricula. In this respect, Morocco recalled its initiative in collaboration with Switzerland, which 
led to the adoption of the Human Rights Council resolution on human rights education. 
</p>
<p>50. Belarus noted the consultation and broad participation of civil society actors in the 
preparation of the report, and Morocco&#8217;s institutional structure to promote and protect human 
rights. Belarus invited Morocco to share its positive experience with the work of the CCDH, 
especially where recommendations have been implemented by the Government. 
</p>
<p>51. The Islamic Republic of Iran appreciated the valuable contribution of Ambassador Loulichki 
to the UPR process, and commended Morocco&#8217;s commitment to the UPR process and its valuable 
efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights. It asked Morocco to elaborate further on 
the steps taken by the Government to promote a culture of human rights. 
</p>
<p>52. Bosnia and Herzegovina expressed appreciation for the contribution of the Ambassador 
during the institution-building process. It referred to the fact that the Moroccan judiciary has 
confirmed the primacy of international human rights law over the domestic law in a number 
of decisions, and asked for clarifications on the status of international human rights instruments vis-
&#224;-vis national law, especially CEDAW, as well as on the definition of the principle of equality and 
the definition of discrimination on the basis of sex. 
</p>
<p>53. The Netherlands made comments, in addition to the questions submitted in writing to 
Morocco. It encouraged Morocco to closely look at remaining IER recommendations. The 
Netherlands recommended that Morocco extend a standing invitation to all special procedures. It 
also commended Morocco on its efforts to bring its national legislation in line with its international 
human rights obligations and recommended that Morocco further harmonize its domestic law with 
international standards in areas such as the press code and the right to privacy. 
</p>
<p>54. Jordan noted Morocco&#8217;s efforts regarding the promotion and protection of human rights, as 
well as legislative reforms. It asked for further information on measures adopted to include human 
rights education in the school curricula. 
</p>
<p>55. Benin welcomed the progress achieved in the field of human rights and referred to the 
workshop organized on the UPR mechanism in Rabat.
