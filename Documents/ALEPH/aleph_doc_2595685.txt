EBITDAX (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, depletion, exploration and evaluation and impairment), EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) and underlying profit/(loss) 
are non-IFRS measures that are presented to provide an understanding of the underlying performance of Santos’ operations. Underlying profit excludes the impacts of asset 
acquisitions, disposals and impairments, as well as items that are subject to significant variability from one period to the next, including the effects of fair value adjustments and 
fluctuations in exchange rates. Please refer to page 4 for the reconciliation from net profit/(loss) to underlying profit/(loss) for the period. The non-IFRS financial information is 
unaudited however the numbers have been extracted from the financial statements which have been subject to review by the Company’s auditor.
Production and Sales 
Santos’ record first half production in 2016 of 31.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) was 10% higher than the 
corresponding period due primarily to the start-up of GLNG train 1 on 24 September 2015.
Both PNG LNG and Darwin LNG continued to perform strongly and oil production from Mutineer Exeter / Fletcher 
Finucane was higher than the previous half due to the Floating Production and Storage Offloading (FPSO) facility being 
back  on  line  following  maintenance  for  repairs.  Partly  offsetting  this  strong  production  profile  was  lower  crude  oil 
production from the Cooper Basin due to natural field decline and higher downtime as a result of heavy rain. Lower oil 
production was also recorded from Vietnam due to natural field decline and lower condensate production recorded 
from the Bayu Undan field also due to natural field decline.
Sales volumes rose 32% to 40.9 mmboe, reflecting the higher production outcome and third-party gas volumes from 
GLNG.
Sales revenue fell 6% to $1.2 billion for the half-year.  The positive effect of higher sales volumes was offset by significantly 
lower crude oil prices.  The average realised crude oil price for the half-year was US$42.79 per barrel, 29% lower than 
the corresponding period.
Santos continued to take positive steps in the first half to strengthen the Company’s financial position in the lower oil 
price  environment,  including  significant  reductions  to  both  capital  and  operating  expenditure.    First  half  capital 
expenditure (excluding capitalised  interest) of $283 million was 58% lower than the prior half-year while upstream 
production costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 15% lower.

Santos Limited Half-year Financial Report – 30 June 2016
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Review of Operations 
Mr Kevin Gallagher joined Santos as Chief Executive Officer on 1 February 2016. Mr Gallagher is a senior executive 
with more than 25 years’ experience in managing oil and gas operations in Australia, the USA and North and West 
Africa. Prior to joining Santos, Mr Gallagher was Chief Executive Officer of the engineering services group, Clough 
Limited.
On 1 April 2016, the Company announced a new Executive team and organisational structure. The restructure resulted 
in a move away from geographic-based business units to an asset-focused model with strong technical capabilities in our 
primary business of exploration, development and the production of oil and natural gas.
Santos’ operations for the 2016 half-year are reported as four business units based on the different geographic regions 
of the Company’s operations: Eastern Australia; Western Australia and Northern Territory; Asia Pacific and GLNG. 
From the 2016 full-year results, reporting will align to our new asset-based organisational structure.
Eastern Australia 
Santos is a leading producer of natural gas, gas liquids and crude oil in eastern Australia.  Gas is sold primarily to domestic 
retailers, industry and GLNG, while gas liquids and crude oil are sold in the domestic and export markets.
Eastern Australia Business Unit EBITDAX was $57 million, 72% lower than the first half of 2015 primarily due to lower 
sales revenue impacted by lower global oil prices.
Santos’ share of Cooper Basin sales gas and ethane production of 31.5 petajoules (PJ) was in line with the corresponding 
period. Higher sales gas yield and lower downtime were offset by natural field decline. Santos’ share of Cooper Basin 
condensate production was 0.5 million barrels (mmbbl), also in line with the corresponding period.  Santos’ share of gas 
production from the Denison, Scotia, Spring Gully and Combabula fields in Queensland and the Otway Basin, offshore 
Victoria, was 15 PJ, 9% higher than the corresponding period.
Santos’ share of Cooper Basin oil production of 1.3 mmbbl was 6% lower than the corresponding period due to natural 
field decline and higher downtime due to heavy rain.
Western Australia and Northern Territory 
Santos is one of the largest producers of domestic natural gas in Western Australia and is also a significant producer of 
gas liquids and crude oil.  Santos also has an interest in the Bayu-Undan/Darwin LNG project.
Western Australia and Northern Territory Business Unit EBITDAX was $166 million, 9% higher than the first half of 
2015.
Santos’ Western Australia gas production of 26.0 PJ was in line with the corresponding period. Condensate production 
of 254,600 barrels was down 7% on the corresponding quarter due to natural field decline.
Santos’ share of Western Australia oil production of 1.3 mmbbl was 83% higher than the corresponding period following 
extended maintenance of the Mutineer Exeter / Fletcher Finucane FPSO in 2015.
Darwin LNG continued to perform strongly, with high operating efficiency and excellent cost performance.  Santos’ net 
entitlement to gas production of 10.6 PJ was 8% higher than the corresponding period due to continued high availability 
and capacity utilisation.
Asia Pacific 
Santos has a focussed position in South-East Asia with producing assets in three countries: Papua New Guinea, Indonesia 
and Vietnam, and exploration interests in these countries as well as Malaysia and Bangladesh.
Asia Pacific Business Unit EBITDAX was $259 million, 26% lower than the first half of 2015 mainly due to the impact of 
lower oil prices.
In Papua New Guinea, the PNG LNG project continued to perform well, with both trains consistently operating above 
nameplate  capacity.    Santos’  share  of  gas  and  condensate  production  in  the  first  half  was  30.4  PJ  and  0.7  mmbbl 
respectively.
Santos’ net entitlement to oil production in Vietnam of 1.3 mmbbl was 10% lower than the corresponding period due 
to natural field decline and a planned 10-day maintenance period.
Santos’ net entitlement to gas production in Indonesia of 11.9 PJ was in line with the corresponding period.

Santos Limited Half-year Financial Report – 30 June 2016
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
GLNG 
GLNG produces natural gas from coal seam gas fields in south-western Queensland and converts it, along with third-
party sourced gas, into liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the GLNG plant on Curtis Island, Queensland. Sanctioned in 
January 2011, the GLNG project (30% Santos interest) produced first LNG from train 1 on 24 September 2015 and first 
LNG from train 2 on 26 May 2016.
The LNG plant produced 1,958,000 tonnes of LNG during the first-half of 2016 and shipped 32 cargoes, taking the total 
to 39 cargoes since start-up in September 2015. Gross gas delivered to the LNG plant during the half was 119.9 PJ from 
GLNG’s supply portfolio including GLNG indigenous production, Santos’ portfolio and third-party purchased quantities. 
Santos’ share of LNG domestic gas and sales gas to LNG production was 15.2 PJ.
The GLNG Business Unit results include domestic gas production and sales from the GLNG coal seam gas fields in 
south-western Queensland. Santos’ share of GLNG domestic gas production was 2.7 PJ in the first half, in line with the 
corresponding period.
GLNG Business Unit EBITDAX was $46 million.
Following a review of key production assets, Santos recognised an impairment charge against the carrying value for 
GLNG of $1,050 million after tax in the 2016 half-year accounts.  It was a non-cash charge that will not affect the 
Company’s debt facilities.
Sustained low oil prices continue to constrain capital expenditure and impact GLNG.  During the course of 2016 there 
has been a slower ramp-up of GLNG equity gas production and an increase in the price of third party gas.  This caused 
Santos to adjust its upstream gas supply and third party gas pricing assumptions for GLNG.  This will not affect GLNG’s 
ability to meet its LNG off-take commitments.
Net Loss 
The 2016 first half net loss was $1,104 million; compared with a net profit of $30 million in 2015. The decrease in profit 
is primarily due to the $1,050 million after-tax impairment of GLNG, as well as lower sales revenue from lower global 
oil prices.
Net loss includes items after tax of $1,099 million (before tax of $1,604 million), referred to in the reconciliation of net 
profit/(loss) to underlying profit/(loss) below.

Santos Limited Half-year Financial Report – 30 June 2016
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
EQUITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY HOLDERS OF SANTOS LIMITED / DIVIDENDS 
Equity attributable to equity holders of Santos Limited at 30 June 2016 was $6,369 million.
On 19 August 2016, the Directors resolved not to pay an interim dividend in relation to the half-year ended 30 June 
2016.
CASH FLOW 
The net cash inflow from operating activities of $291 million was 30% lower than the first half of 2015.  This decrease 
is principally attributable to lower sales revenue impacted by lower global oil prices.  Net cash provided by investing 
activities of $20 million was $1,012 million higher than the first half of 2015 primarily due to the proceeds realised from 
the disposal of Kipper and a reduction in capital expenditure in response to lower global oil prices. Cash flows from 
financing activities were $380 million lower than the first half of 2015 predominantly due to there being no drawdowns 
on debt facilities during 2016.
OUTLOOK 
Santos maintains production guidance in the range of 57 to 63 mmboe for 2016.

On 19 August 2016, the Directors of Santos Limited resolved not to pay an interim dividend in relation to the half-year

Santos Limited Half-year Financial Report – 30 June 2016
NOTES TO THE HALF-YEAR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Section 1:
Basis of Preparation
This section provides information about the basis of preparation of the half-year financial report.
1.1  Corporate Information
Santos Limited  (“the  Company”)  is  a  company  limited  by  shares  incorporated  in  Australia  whose  shares  are 
publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”).  The condensed consolidated financial report of 
the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2016 (“the half-year financial report”) comprises the Company 
and its controlled entities (“the Group”).  Santos Limited is the ultimate parent entity in the Group.  
The half-year financial report was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 19 
August 2016.
1.2  Basis of Preparation
This general purpose half-year financial report has been prepared in accordance with AASB 134 Interim Financial 
Reporting and the Corporations Act 2001. 
The half-year financial report does not include all notes of the type normally included within the annual financial 
report and therefore cannot be expected to provide as full an understanding of the financial performance, financial 
position and financing and investing activities of the Group as the annual financial report. 
It is recommended that the half-year financial report be read in conjunction with the annual financial report for 
the  year  ended  31 December 2015  and  considered  together  with  any  public  announcements  made  by  the 
Company during the six months ended 30 June 2016, in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations 
of the ASX listing rules. 
Change in presentation currency  
The Directors have elected to change the Group’s presentation currency from Australian dollars to United States 
(US) dollars effective from 1 January 2016. The change in presentation currency is a voluntary change which is 
accounted for retrospectively.  All other accounting policies are consistent with those adopted in the annual 
financial report for the year ended 31 December 2015.  The financial report has been restated to US dollars 
using the procedures outlined below: 
1.
Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows have been translated into US dollars using average foreign 
currency rates prevailing for the relevant period.
2.  Assets and liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position have been translated into US dollars at the closing
foreign currency rates on the relevant balance sheet dates.
3.  The equity section of the Statement of Financial Position, including foreign currency translation reserve, 
retained earnings, share capital and the other reserves, has been translated into US dollars using historical 
rates.
4.  Earnings per share and dividend disclosures have also been restated to US dollars to reflect the change in
presentation currency.
1.3  Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions
The significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions adopted in the half-year financial report are 
consistent  with  those  applied  in  the  preparation  of  the  Group’s  annual  financial  report  for  the  year  ended 
31 December 2015.

Santos Limited Half-year Financial Report – 30 June 2016
NOTES TO THE HALF-YEAR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Section 2:
Financial Performance
This section focuses on the operating results and financial performance of the Group. It includes disclosures of 
segmental financial information and dividends.
2.1  Segment Information
The Group has identified its operating segments to be the four business units of Eastern Australia; Western 
 
Australia  and Northern  Territory  (“WA & NT”); Asia  Pacific;  and  Gladstone LNG (“GLNG”), based on the 
different geographical regions and the similarity of assets within those regions.  This is the basis on which internal 
 
reports are provided to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) for assessing performance and determining the 
 
allocation of resources within the Group.   
The CEO monitors the operating results of the business units separately for the purposes of making decisions 
about allocating resources and assessing performance.  Segment performance is measured based on the following: 
•  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, depletion, exploration and evaluation, impairment and
gains/losses on sale of non-current assets and controlled entities (“EBITDAX”); and
•  Earnings before interest, tax, impairment, exploration and evaluation, and gains/losses on sale of
non-current assets and controlled entities (“EBITX”).
Corporate and exploration expenditure and inter-segment eliminations are included in the segment disclosure 
for reconciliation purposes. 
Changes in Group structure during 2016 
The Group has announced, and is in the process of implementing, a revised operating and reporting structure. 
The new structure moves away from geographic-based segments to an asset-focussed business. 
As the Group transitions to the revised structure, it is anticipated that segment information to be disclosed in 
the 31 December 2016 year-end financial report will also change to reflect asset-based reporting to the CEO.

2 Reclassification: foreign exchange losses/(gains) previously included the effects of foreign exchange on certain tax bases. Such amounts are 
now classified as tax gains/losses. Consequently a $29 million gain in 2016 resulting from the effect of foreign exchange on certain tax 
balances has been classified within tax expense, and a $94 million loss in 2015 has been re-classified from foreign exchange gains/(losses) 
to tax benefit/(expense).

The carrying amounts of the Group’s oil and gas assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment.  Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable 
amount is made. 
The expected future cash flow estimation is based on a number of factors, variables and assumptions, the most 
important  of  which  are  estimates  of  reserves,  future  production  profiles,  commodity  prices,  costs  and  foreign 
exchange rates. In most cases, the present value of future cash flows is most sensitive to estimates of future oil price 
and discount rates. 
Estimates  of  future  commodity  prices  and  forecasts  of  the  foreign  exchange  rate  for  foreign  currencies  are 
unchanged from the previous reporting date. 
Future prices (US$/bbl) used were:
2016 
40.00
2017 
60.00
2018 
70.00
20191 
80.77

82.79
20211 
84.86
1.  Based on US$75/bbl (2016 real) from 2019 escalated at 2.5%. 
The  future  estimated  foreign  exchange  rate  applied  is  A$/US$0.70  in  2016  and  2017,  and  A$/US$0.75  in  all 
subsequent years. 
The discount rates applied to the future forecast cash flows are based on the Group’s weighted average cost of 
capital, adjusted for risks where appropriate. The range of pre-tax discount rates that have been applied to non-
current assets is between 9.0% and 17.4%. 
In the event that future circumstances vary from these assumptions, the recoverable amount of the Group’s oil and 
gas assets could change materially and result in impairment losses or the reversal of previous impairment losses. 
Due to the interrelated nature of the assumptions, movements in any one variable can have an indirect impact on 
others and individual variables rarely change in isolation.  Additionally, management can be expected to respond to 
some movements, to mitigate downsides and take advantage of upsides, as circumstances allow.  Consequently, it is 
impracticable to estimate the indirect impact that a change in one assumption has on other variables and hence, on 
the  likelihood,  or  extent,  of  impairments  or  reversals  of  impairments  under  different  sets  of  assumptions  in 
subsequent reporting periods.
GLNG 
Sustained low oil prices continue to constrain capital expenditure and impact GLNG. During 2016 there has been a 
slower ramp-up of GLNG equity gas production and an increase in the price of third party gas and this has led to a 
change in upstream gas supply and third party gas pricing assumptions. 
As a consequence, the GLNG asset carrying value has been written down and an impairment charge of $1,500 
million before tax ($1,050 million post tax) has been recognised in the half-year ended 30 June 2016. 
The recoverable amount of GLNG has been calculated using the value-in-use method. At 30 June 2016, GLNG’s 
recoverable amount, before deduction of the carrying value of restoration liabilities, was $5,463 million. 
Sensitivity 
When modelled in isolation, it is estimated that an increase in discount rate of 0.50% will result in an additional 
impairment  of  approximately  $340  million  and  a  decrease  in  oil  price  of  US$5/bbl  in all  years  will  result  in  an 
additional impairment of approximately $600 million. 
As identified above, the impact of changes in key assumptions are significant on the determination of recoverable 
amount. Due to the number of factors that could impact any of these assumptions, as well as any actions taken to 
respond to adverse changes, actual future determinations of recoverable amount may vary from those stated above.

3.4  Impairment of Non-current Assets (continued)
Other 
In addition to the above, the Group recognised a net impairment loss of $4 million relating to Gunnedah exploration 
and evaluation assets, and $12 million relating to the Minerva, Mereenie and Patricia Baleen oil and gas assets.  
The  impairment  charges  have  arisen  primarily  as  a  consequence  of  the  reduction  or  delay  in  future  capital 
expenditure that diminishes or removes the path to commercialisation.

FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
4.3  Financial Risk Management
Exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk arises in the 
normal course of the Group’s business.  The Group’s overall financial risk management strategy is to seek to ensure 
that the Group is able to fund its corporate objectives and meet its obligations to stakeholders.  Derivative financial 
instruments may be used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity 
prices. 
The Group uses various methods to measure the types of financial risk to which it is exposed.  These methods 
include Cash Flow at Risk analysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity price risk, and ageing 
analysis for credit risk.   
Financial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department which operates under Board-approved 
policies.  The policies govern the framework and principles for overall risk management and covers specific financial 
risks, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, approved derivative and non-derivative financial 
instruments, and liquidity management. 
(a)  Foreign currency risk
Foreign  currency  risk  arises  from  commercial  transactions  and  valuations  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are 
denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.   
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk principally through the sale of products denominated in US 
dollars,  borrowings  denominated  in  US  dollars  and  euros  and  foreign  currency  capital  and  operating 
expenditure.  In order to economically hedge foreign currency risk, the Group from time to time enters into 
forward foreign exchange, foreign currency swap and foreign currency option contracts. 
The Group has certain investments in domestic and foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign 
currency translation risk. Currency exposures arising from the net assets of these operations are managed 
primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currency. 
All foreign currency denominated borrowings of Australian dollar functional currency companies are either 
designated as a hedge of US dollar-denominated investments in foreign operations (2016: $1,632 million; 2015: 
$2,340 million), swapped using cross-currency swaps to US dollars and designated as a hedge of US dollar 
denominated investments in foreign operations (2016: $1,410 million; 2015: $1,410 million), or matched to US 
dollar denominated deposits (2016: $700 million, 2015: nil).  As a result, there were no net foreign currency 
gains  or  losses  arising  from  translation  of  US  dollar-denominated  borrowings  recognised  in  the  income 
statement in the first half-year ended 2016. 
Monetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional 
currency of an  operation,  are periodically restated  and the associated  gain or loss is taken to the  income 
statement.  The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for restoration at 
operating sites that are capitalised in oil and gas assets.
(b)  Market risk
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from its borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group 
to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate 
risk. 
The  Group  adopts  a  policy  of  ensuring  that  the  majority  of  its  exposure  to  changes  in  interest  rates  on 
borrowings is on  a floating rate basis.  Interest rate swaps  have been entered into  as fair value hedges of 
medium-term notes, long-term notes and subordinated debt.  When transacted, these swaps had maturities 
ranging from 1 to 20 years, aligned with the maturity of the related notes.   
The Group’s interest rate swaps had a notional contract amount of $1,824 million (2015: $1,824 million) and a 
net  fair  value  of  $95 million  (2015: $91 million).  The  net  fair  value  amounts  were  recognised  as  fair  value 
derivatives. 
Cash flow hedge accounting  
The Group has issued €1,000 million subordinated notes with an average fixed interest rate of 8.25%. 
In order to reduce the variability of the cash flows arising from the euro principal and interest payments to 
September 2017, the Group entered into cross-currency interest rate swap contracts in March 2011, under 
which it has a right to receive interest at fixed euro rates and pay interest at floating US dollar interest rates.

FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
4.3  Financial Risk Management (continued)
(b)   Market risk (continued)
Cash flow hedge accounting (continued) 
These contracts are in place to cover principal and interest payments on €950 million of the subordinated 
notes through to September 2017. 
Subordinated notes totalling €50 million have been swapped to a fixed US dollar interest rate of 8.48% through 
to September 2017. 
The Group has entered into US dollar interest rate swap contracts, under which it has a right to receive 
interest at floating US dollar rates and pay interest at fixed US dollar interest rates.  These contracts are in 
place to cover coupon payments on $670 million of uncovered export credit agency supported loans through 
to the end of 2016. 
The  cross-currency  and  interest  rate  swap  contracts  are  recognised  at  fair  value  and  all  gains  and  losses 
attributable to the hedged risks are recognised in the hedge reserve and reclassified into the income statement 
when the interest expense is recognised.
(c)   Fair values
The  initial  fair  values  of  receivables,  payables,  interest-bearing  liabilities  and  other  financial  assets  and 
liabilities which are not subsequently measured at fair value approximate their carrying value.  
The following  summarises  the significant methods  and  assumptions used in estimating  the fair values of 
financial instruments: 
Derivatives 
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the 
terms of maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the reporting 
date.  Where these cash flows are in a foreign currency, the present value is converted at the foreign exchange 
spot rate prevailing at reporting date. 
Financial liabilities 
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the 
market rate of interest at the reporting date.  Where these cash flows are in a foreign currency, the present 
value is converted at the foreign exchange spot rate prevailing at reporting date. 
Interest rates used for determining fair value 
The interest rates used to discount estimated future cash flows, where applicable, are based on the market 
yield  curve  and  credit spreads at the reporting  date.   The interest rates including  credit spreads used  to 
determine fair value were as follows:

Derivatives 
Loans and borrowings
30 June 2016  31 Dec 2015

The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments 
by valuation technique:
% 
(0.1) – 4.1 
(0.1) – 4.1
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value 
are observable, either directly or indirectly; 
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are 
not based on observable market data.
All of the Group’s financial instruments were valued using the Level 2 valuation technique.

To the members of Santos Limited
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Santos Limited, which comprises the 
statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the income statement, the statement of 
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the half-year 
ended on that date, and other selected explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the 
consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the half-year end or from 
time to time during the half-year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that 
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations 
Act 2001 and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the 
preparation of the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We 
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 
Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state 
whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us 
believe that the financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a 
true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its 
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Santos Limited 
and the entities it controlled during the half-year, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical 
requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible 
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations 
Act 2001. We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence 
Declaration, a copy of which is included in the Directors’ Report.
