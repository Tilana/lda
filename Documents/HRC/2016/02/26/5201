<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Annual meetings of special rapporteurs/representatives, experts and chairpersons of 
working groups of the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights and the Human 
Rights Council have been held since 1994. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 
adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 underlined the importance 
of preserving and strengthening the system of special procedures and specified that the 
procedures and mechanisms should be enabled to harmonize and rationalize their work through 
periodic meetings (A/CONF.<footnote name="1">8. Participants discussed the increase in the scope of activities and responsibilities mandated 
by the Council to special procedures and the need for commitment to implement and follow 
through special procedures&#8217; recommendations. Participants also discussed perceived attempts to 
curtail the independence and effectiveness of the special procedures, in particular in the context 
of the implementation of the Code of Conduct. </footnote>57/24 (part II), para. 95). 
</p>
<p>2. The sixteenth annual meeting of special procedures was convened in Geneva from 29 June 
to 3 July 2009. It had before it a provisional annotated agenda and documents prepared by 
mandate holders, the Secretariat and other sources. 
</p>
<p>3. During the meeting, the mandate holders held exchanges of views with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, the President of the Human Rights Council and members 
of the Bureau, and the former President of the Council. Participants held a joint meeting with 
participants attending the twenty-first meeting of persons chairing the human rights treaty 
bodies, and had exchanges of views with the Chair of the Committee on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on violence against 
children and the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide. They 
met with representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and national human rights 
institutions (NHRIs). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ORGANIZATION OF WORK 
</b></p>
<p>4. The meeting was opened by Asma Jahangir, Chairperson of the fifteenth annual meeting 
and Chair of the Coordination Committee (hereafter &#8220;the Committee&#8221;) of special procedures. 
</p>
<p>5. Santiago Corcuera was elected Chair of the sixteenth annual meeting and of the Committee 
and Najat M&#8217;jid Maalla as Rapporteur of the meeting and a member of the Committee. The three 
remaining members elected by consensus to the Committee on 1 July were Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, 
Frank William La Rue Lewy and Manfred Nowak. Ms. Jahangir would continue as an ex officio 
member of the Committee during the next year. 
</p>
<p>6. Participants expressed deep appreciation for the work carried out throughout the year by 
the outgoing Chairperson and the other members of the Committee, in particular in connection 
with the process of the review of mandates conducted by the Council, the selection of new 
mandate holders and the coordinated approach to human rights situations of concern. The 
outgoing Chair also thanked the Special Procedures Division of the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for its support to the Committee and for 
keeping mandate holders informed about Council developments throughout the year. Mandate 
holders approved the agenda. 
</p>
<p>7. Outside the formal agenda of the meeting, a briefing for mandate holders was organized by 
the research director of a project on the impact of United Nations human rights mechanisms on </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/47 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>the Brookings Institution. Mandate holders held individual meetings with the Chief of the Travel 
Unit of OHCHR, and there was an opportunity to meet with staff of the OHCHR Documents 
Processing Unit. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ACTIVITIES OF THE COORDINATION COMMITTEE 
</b></p>
<p>8. The outgoing Chair briefed participants on the activities of the Committee under her 
chairpersonship and suggested further discussion on how best to guarantee the independence of 
mandate holders. She thanked all mandate holders for their valuable contributions to its work, as 
well as for the encouragement and confidence expressed over the past year. The Committee also 
gratefully acknowledged the professional and efficient support provided by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>9. The main activities of the Committee in 2008/09 related to interaction with the Council and 
other stakeholders with regard to special procedures&#8217; involvement in the work of the Council, 
including its special sessions; the safeguarding of the independence of special procedures; the 
review of special procedures mandates; and the selection and appointment of mandate holders. 
The Chair of the Committee and members had engaged in dialogue with the Council and other 
stakeholders. The Chair, inter alia, held meetings with the High Commissioner, the Deputy 
High Commissioner, the President of the Council, members of the Consultative Group and 
coordinators of the Council&#8217;s regional and other groups during the tenth session of the Council 
and on other occasions. During those meetings, the Chair had stressed the importance of the 
effectiveness and the independence of the special procedures system and the need for greater 
support by States for the work of the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>10. Regarding working methods, the former Chair noted that the final version of the Manual of 
Operations of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council was made public in 
September 2009. No objections had been raised formally through the Internal Advisory 
Procedure since the adoption of the Manual at the fifteenth meeting in June 2008. The Chair had 
engaged in discussions with the President of the Council regarding concerns about the apparent 
lack of commitment by some States to cooperate, with improper language used by those States in 
their interaction with special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>11. Participants asserted that the Committee should have an even more strategic and active role 
in promoting the effectiveness and independence of the system and ensuring constructive 
dialogue with the Human Rights Council, notably in relation to the implementation and 
interpretation of the Code of Conduct. 
</p>
<p>12. The Committee held a meeting in Geneva and telephone conferences about every 
two months. Mandate holders had been consulted by email, telephone and other means on 
various occasions, with a view to facilitating cooperation and responses to issues that had arisen 
during the year. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  EXCHANGE OF VIEWS WITH THE HIGH COMMISSIONER  
</b></p>
<p>13. Participants had an exchange of views with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
Navanethem Pillay. The High Commissioner, inter alia, informed participants about the current 
strategic planning process and future priorities of her Office. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/47 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>14. The High Commissioner noted that special procedures constituted the Human Rights 
Council&#8217;s most active and unique fact-finding, monitoring and advocacy mechanisms. She 
acknowledged the challenges special procedures were facing, but noted that their involvement in 
assessing and proposing solutions to crisis situations had enhanced their visibility. She welcomed 
the appointment of new mandate holders under the new selection procedure and thanked the 
Committee, as well as OHCHR staff members supporting it, for their support for the 
independence of the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>15. The High Commissioner asked the mandate holders to use the Outcome Document of the 
Durban Review Conference in their work. She also welcomed the synergies developed between 
the universal periodic review (UPR) and the independent expertise of special procedures, whose 
mandates covered the human rights themes identified as the thematic priorities of the Office in 
the framework of the planning process for 2010-2011. She assured the mandate holders of her 
commitment and her Office&#8217;s support for their work. 
</p>
<p>16. Mandate holders raised a number of issues, including strengthening the independence and 
effectiveness of the special procedures and the integration of the work of special procedures in 
the priority areas of work of the Office, such as the human rights-based approach to 
development. Participants were concerned about the lack of attention given by the Human Rights 
Council to country mandates, and discussed the need to address urgent human rights situations in 
an expeditious manner with States.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>V. THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL AND THE  
SPECIAL PROCEDURES SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Update on recent developments 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Director of the Special Procedures Division of OHCHR briefed the participants on 
developments at the Council. She noted that the review of mandates had been completed in 
September 2008 and resulted in the extension of all thematic mandates. New mandates had also 
been created. While four country mandates had been discontinued in the last two years, country 
situations continued to be addressed under UPR, at special sessions and increasingly through the 
activities of thematic mandate holders. The Director referred to important contributions made by 
special procedures in relation to a number of United Nations human rights mechanisms and 
activities, inter alia four special sessions of the Council held between June 2008 and April 2009, 
substantive thematic panels at Council sessions, the Durban Review Conference in April 2009, 
the inaugural Forum on Minority Issues in December 2008, the first session of the Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in October 2008, and the Social Forum in 
September 2008. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>B.  Exchange of views with the former President of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>19. H.E. Ambassador Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, Permanent Representative of Nigeria to 
the United Nations Office at Geneva and former President of the Human Rights Council, stressed 
that victims of human rights violations should remain the ultimate concern of the Council and its 
mechanisms. He highlighted the crucial role of special procedures, in particular for the Council, 
and gave assurances that he would make use of good offices to mediate for the mechanisms. He 
noted that resolution 11/11 adopted by the Council at its eleventh session had strengthened and 
acknowledged the role of special procedures. 
</p>
<p>20. Ambassador Uhomoibhi suggested that the Committee should engage more visibly with all 
stakeholders. Mandate holders acknowledged his spirit of cooperation and noted efforts to 
harmonize working methods through their Manual; they raised issues of concern with regard to 
the interpretation of the Code of Conduct over the past year, which they had attempted to prevent 
and address through the creation of an Internal Advisory Procedure to review practices and 
working methods that was open to relevant stakeholders. Participants also raised issues regarding 
the importance of follow-up to the special procedures&#8217; recommendations. Ms. Jahangir thanked 
the Ambassador for his cooperation and support for further strengthening of the work of mandate 
holders. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Exchange of views with the President of the Human Rights Council  
and members of the Bureau 
</b></p>
<p>21. Participants had an exchange with the President of the Human Rights Council, 
H.E. Ambassador Alex Van Meeuwen (Belgium), and with members of the Bureau, 
H.E. Ambassador Carlos Portales (Chile) , H.E. Ambassador Hisham Badr (Egypt), 
H.E. Ambassador Dyan T. Djani (Indonesia) and H.E. Ambassador Andrej Logar (Slovenia). 
22. The President noted the importance of strengthening the special procedures system by 
assessing the impact of mandate holders&#8217; reports and building confidence in the system as a 
whole. Furthermore, he underlined the importance of the independence and autonomy of 
mandate holders in the fulfilment of their mandates as well as the need for full cooperation from 
States in order to ensure the effectiveness of the special procedures. The President reiterated his 
willingness to cooperate and work closely with all of the Council&#8217;s mechanisms in order to make 
the work of the Council more beneficial and efficient in the promotion and protection of human 
rights around the world. Bureau members referred to the adoption of resolution 11/11, called the 
Code of Conduct to be respected, and recalled the need for full cooperation by States with the 
special procedures. Constructive dialogue, cooperation and the independence of mandate holders 
were of the utmost importance. 
</p>
<p>23. Participants raised issues such as active involvement in the work of the Council, 
cooperation with special procedures by States, compliance with the Code of Conduct, and the 
perceived selective approach of some Council members regarding special procedures. 
Participants noted with appreciation the President&#8217;s and the Bureau&#8217;s intention to maintain an 
open door policy with respect to special procedures. The President assured mandate holders that 
he would continue the practice of the previous President of inviting them to all special sessions, 
through the Coordination Committee. </p>

</p>
<p><b>VI.  WORKING METHODS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Strengthening the effectiveness of the special procedures: 
a joint report on communications 
</b></p>
<p>24. Participants were briefed by the Secretariat on the steps taken so far to produce a joint 
report on communications. Following the discussion on a common report at the fifteenth annual 
meeting collated on a country-by-country basis, the Secretariat had examined the technical and 
substantive issues that such a report would entail. Provided the upgrading of the thematic 
database was completed by September 2009, the first joint communications report could be 
submitted in September 2010. 
</p>
<p>25. It was agreed that such a report would harmonize the working methods of mandate holders 
reporting on the same communications to the Human Rights Council; avoid unnecessary 
duplication of work; reduce some mandate holders&#8217; and staff workload or free up time for work 
on other substantive issues; streamline documents; permit the examination and an assessment of 
cross-cutting human rights issues; and ensure that the content of communications and any 
follow-up given to them would feed into the UPR process more effectively. 
</p>
<p>26. Mandate holders decided to produce a joint communications report, under the guidelines 
suggested by the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The universal periodic review mechanism and the special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Secretariat briefed participants on UPR and its relevance to the special procedures. 
The third, fourth and fifth sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review had 
been held over the last year with 16 countries reviewed at each session. Special procedures&#8217; 
recommendations and other information had been included in the compilation reports prepared 
by OHCHR. Several were referred to by States during the interactive dialogue with the States 
under review. A number of recommendations were included in the reports of the sessions and 
expressly accepted by the States under review. 
</p>
<p>28. It was noted that UPR had given more visibility to special procedures and provided an 
additional channel for a number of special procedures&#8217; recommendations to be raised in the 
Council. The interactive dialogue and recommendations made by States might, inter alia, rely on 
issues raised by special procedures. 
</p>
<p>29. An added value of the UPR sessions for special procedures was the commitment of States 
to increased cooperation with special procedures, inter alia the extending of country visit 
invitations, standing invitations to special procedures mandate holders and the implementation of 
specific recommendations. Such commitment had been observed to varying degrees. In addition, 
the wealth of information contained in the country-related UPR documents prepared prior to the 
sessions could also be used by special procedures to inform themselves about the findings of 
other United Nations human rights mechanisms as well as NGOs and United Nations 
organizations. It was suggested that those documents could guide special procedures when 
engaging with countries, and that UPR final reports could serve as a tool for mandate holders to 
reinforce specific recommendations. Mandate holders were encouraged to consider the UPR 
calendar in scheduling visits to countries, consult UPR documents prior to their missions and use </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/47 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>recommendations contained in the UPR reports in future communications. It was noted that the 
UPR process would be subject to review in the context of the review of the Human Rights 
Council by the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>30. Participants also discussed challenges, noting that UPR was complementary to and not a 
substitute for existing mechanisms. Its outcomes should not supplant those recommendations of 
specific mandate holders which were either not included in recommendations accepted by the 
State, or not considered by the Working Group or the plenary. It was stressed that UPR 
follow-up by mandate holders should not infringe upon their independence. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Lessons learned and recent developments in relation to common approaches  
to human rights situations:  follow-up to the fifteenth annual meeting and  
developments in 2008/09 
</b></p>
<p>31. Mandate holders had a discussion of their working methods, in particular common 
approaches to human rights situations, following up on a discussion started at the fifteenth 
annual meeting. 
</p>
<p>32. Participants noted the responsibility of all special procedures, as mandated by the Council, 
to take effective measures to enhance the promotion and protection of human rights, and 
discussed providing guidance to the Coordination Committee in developing a more systematic 
approach to situations where collective responses by special procedures could be justified and 
desirable while not pre-empting ongoing joint action by some mandate holders. The Committee 
was requested to keep in mind that such situations should be particularly serious ones involving 
gross and systematic violations of human rights, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, 
genocide, or the risk of those violations; or situations in which other serious violations of human 
rights were being committed or threatened and which cut across a wide range of rights as 
provided in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; or in cases where the ability of mandate 
holders to pursue their work was being obstructed, or their independence jeopardized. </p>
<p><b>D.  Planning and resources 
</b></p>
<p>33. Participants were briefed on interpretation by officials from the Interpretation Service of 
the Conference Services Division of the United Nations Office at Geneva. It was noted that 
while the workload had been steadily growing and country missions represented a challenge, 
considerable progress had been achieved. Close and constructive cooperation with the Secretariat 
was welcomed. The use of the Guidelines Regarding Interpretation Services during Missions 
with Human Rights Mechanisms was encouraged. For cooperation to be successful, attention 
must be paid to the mission&#8217;s preparatory stage and to time management. Overly long working 
hours could compromise the quality of the interpretation, in particular in politically and 
security-sensitive missions. 
</p>
<p>34. Mandate holders commended the quality and professional services provided by the 
interpreters, noting their crucial support. Participants also noted that different missions had 
different requirements and arrangements should therefore be flexible. Good practices were 
shared during the dialogue, such as the use of portable equipment. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/47 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>35. Representatives of the OHCHR Communications Section briefed the participants on the 
importance of public-friendly news releases and their strategy to improve the media profile of 
special procedures. During the exchange of views, participants discussed issues relating to the 
timing and outreach of news releases and their effects on and consequences for country missions. 
Suggestions for the effective use of other communications tools were also discussed. 
</p>
<p>36. Participants were briefed on financial resources and related country-visit planning by the 
OHCHR Chief of the Programme Support and Management Services and the Chief of the 
Finance and Budget Section, and discussed a number of specific issues relating to administrative 
support to mandate holders in the area of travel and medical insurance. It was highlighted that 
activities and responsibilities given to special procedures by the Human Rights Council had 
increased and had mostly had to be absorbed within existing resources. 
</p>
<p>37. Mandate holders discussed logistical issues in relation to the exercise of their mandates, as 
well as queries regarding visa and identification documents. The Secretariat gave an update on 
the progress and negotiations with partners towards improvement of travel-related and financial 
matters. 
</p>
<p><b>VII. INTEGRATING HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACHES AND MECHANISMS  
INTO THE WORK OF THE SPECIAL PROCEDURES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Protection of victims and witnesses 
</b></p>
<p>38. Participants discussed the protection of victims and witnesses as well as human rights 
defenders who cooperated with the special procedures. They noted that this issue touched upon 
the core of the work of special procedures and underlined the importance of ensuring that 
persons who assisted in fact-finding and in submitting reports about human rights violations 
were not subjected to reprisals. Whereas all mandate holders had the responsibility not to do any 
harm, as set out in a number of guiding documents, it was noted that the main responsibility for 
protection lay with States. 
</p>
<p>39. Participants shared experiences and good practices in that regard, including obtaining the 
consent of victims and witnesses to the extent possible, and the mechanism of letters as a means 
of prompt intervention. Participants highlighted the principle of informing the source of the 
different options available for the use of the information they provided, one being anonymity. 
They noted the dichotomy between the expectations of people willing to cooperate with them 
and their lack of means to provide security to witnesses and victims of reprisals. The attention of 
the Secretary-General had been drawn to this issue. Participants also noted the importance of 
raising awareness among United Nations field staff and non-State actors during country visits. 
The need for guidelines, inter alia for mandate holders, was discussed, including on the question 
of child victims of reprisals. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights and climate change 
</b></p>
<p>40. Participants heard a briefing by a representative of the Center for International 
Environment Law on a human rights approach to addressing climate change. He noted 
the challenge of the need to both address climate change and ensure the realization and 
protection of human rights, which required mechanisms and processes for mainstreaming </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/47 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>based on the understanding of human rights adding value and contributing to efforts on climate 
change. He invited the special procedures to take a more proactive role with regard to this issue. 
Mandate holders also had a private discussion on human rights and climate change. 
</p>
<p>41. Participants expressed their grave concern about the impact of climate changes as a threat 
cutting across many of the human rights addressed by their mandates. While several mandates 
were taking up the issue of climate change, participants noted a lack of a common strategy and 
resources in addressing the issue in an effective and systematic manner. They also underlined the 
importance of taking a more human rights-based approach to the issue by giving priority to the 
rights of the most vulnerable and, inter alia, encouraging technology transfer in order to combat 
climate change. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Human rights and disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>42. Participants had an exchange of views with the Chair of the Committee on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, Mohammed Al-Tarawneh, who said that the adoption of the 
Convention marked a new era in which persons with disabilities would no longer have to suffer 
from an unequal application of human rights, but positive measures were essential to enable 
persons with disabilities to enjoy their human rights on equal terms with the other members of 
society. He welcomed the fact that the special procedures had included disability issues in their 
agenda and noted that his Committee was considering including a specific reference to 
cooperation with the special procedures in its working methods. 
</p>
<p>43. Participants welcomed the adoption of the Convention and the creation of the Committee 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. They noted the need to include attention to the rights 
of persons with disabilities in their mandates and to create enhanced avenues for cooperation. 
Mandate holders raised issues regarding the vulnerability of impaired children; victims of 
terrorism facing disabilities; the possibility of persons with disabilities to exercise their legal 
capacity; persons with disabilities in conflict or post-conflict situations suffering traumatic stress 
or who had become physically disabled as result of a conflict. Participants also expressed their 
readiness to cooperate with the Committee. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  COOPERATION WITH HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY BODIES 
</b></p>
<p>44. Participants held their annual exchange of views with the chairpersons of treaty bodies on 
questions relating to the coordinated follow-up to special procedures&#8217; and treaty bodies&#8217; 
recommendations, including in the context of UPR. The meeting was co-chaired by the Chair of 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Na&#233;la Gabr. 
</p>
<p>45. The need for and importance of mutual cooperation was highlighted. The mandates of the 
special procedures and the treaty bodies included cross-cutting issues and they should mutually 
support each others&#8217; roles, joining in initiatives in order to enhance the indivisibility of human 
rights. Treaty body chairs suggested that special procedures mandate holders during their country 
visits should support the signature and ratification of the conventions and their optional 
protocols, and remind States of their reporting obligations. The need to institutionalize and 
mainstream the follow-up of recommendations of special procedures and treaty bodies, as well 
as those made in the framework of UPR, was discussed. Treaty body chairs also noted that </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/47 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>reports of special procedures, in particular country mandates, were sources of valuable 
information for the examination of State party reports and called for a more active and 
continuous dialogue in that regard. 
</p>
<p>46. Participants highlighted the importance of the committees&#8217; general comments in their 
work. New dimensions or focus areas should be included in the work of special procedures, for 
example, migration, in particular by the mandate holders on housing and trafficking; children 
living in prisons with parents; considering people in conflict and post-conflict situations as 
victims of discrimination; torture and inadequate housing; and the situation of people with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>47. Mandate holders suggested to the treaty bodies the progressive development of human 
rights law and concepts, including through the consideration of human rights and climate change, 
the food crisis, biofuels, the financial crisis and other matters. The treaty bodies intended to 
continue to invite mandate holders to participate in regular sessions of the committees and to 
include them in the committees&#8217; activities and thematic debates. 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  CONSULTATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Consultations with non-governmental organizations  
and national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>48. Participants held a discussion with representatives of civil society and national human 
rights institutions who had been invited to discuss increased interaction to strengthen follow-up 
to the work of the special procedures, including communications, country visits and thematic 
studies. Both mandate holders and civil society representatives highlighted the importance of a 
joint effort to better assess human rights situations and the implementation of recommendations 
made by special procedures, treaty bodies and other human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>49. All the representatives of civil society and national human rights institutions expressed 
their strong support for the special procedures system. Among the various issues raised were the 
relationship between special procedures mandate holders and the Human Rights Council; 
transparency and objectivity in the proceedings of the consultative group for the selection of 
mandate holders; the need for a follow-up mechanism for recommendations; reprisals against 
individuals cooperating with United Nations mechanisms; the need to consult local NGOs and 
NHRIs concerning country visits; the commitment of States to implement recommendations; the 
mainstreaming of thematic mandates; and the impact of climate change on the enjoyment of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>50. A representative of the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights 
Institutions and the Head of the National Institutions Unit of OHCHR emphasized the 
fundamental role of NHRIs in promoting the effective implementation of recommendations 
resulting from international mechanisms in a coordinated manner. The need to further develop 
the involvement of mandate holders in all the phases of the partnership between NHRIs and 
special procedures, including the preparation and conduct of country visits, the presentation of 
reports by special procedures at the Human Rights Council and in the context of UPR, was 
raised. </p>

</p>
<p>51. Mandate holders emphasized the crucial role of civil society and NHRIs in the work of the 
special procedures, in particular during country visits. National institutions and civil society in 
the field were in a good position to support follow-up and implementation of the 
recommendations. Mandate holders discussed the suggestion that civil society and special 
procedures should interact more with the UPR process. On the relationship of special procedures 
with the Council, mandate holders highlighted the need to strengthen support for the 
independence and effectiveness of the Council; they noted positive experiences and added that 
the President of the Council had welcomed their involvement in special sessions. Participants 
also encouraged NHRIs and NGOs to broaden their scope of support to the mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  United Nations bodies and regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p>52.  Marta Santos Pais, the newly appointed Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
violence against children, presented her priorities in an exchange of views with mandate holders, 
highlighting the framework provided by the recommendations of the United Nations Study on 
Violence against Children and emphasizing the importance of mainstreaming the agenda at the 
national level, achieving change in legislation to ban all forms of violence against children, and 
promoting data collection and analysis in every country. She stressed the need for close 
collaboration with stakeholders, consolidating partnerships with United Nations organizations 
and with human rights bodies and mechanisms. She emphasized in particular collaboration with 
special procedures, anticipating the promotion of synergies across mandates, the sharing of 
information, the identification of good practices, and the cross-fertilization of experiences to 
prevent and combat all forms of violence against children. 
</p>
<p>53.  Participants expressed their intention to work in close collaboration with her office and 
noted that as a cross-cutting issue, violence against children would be addressed by various 
mandates, requiring close cooperation. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, 
Francis Deng, briefed participants on the inclusive and comprehensive approach of his mandate. 
He noted that sovereignty and the responsibility to protect were responsibilities primarily of 
States; in case of failure of the State to protect, intervention might be required from the 
international community. The mandate also constituted an early warning mechanism as the 
Special Adviser made recommendations to the Secretary-General and, through him, to the 
Security Council. Denial by perpetrators and those who had the responsibility to protect was one 
of the main challenges. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Adviser was developing a framework for analysis as a basis for gathering 
information while giving Governments an opportunity for self-examination. That framework 
would help identify best practices. Mr. Deng expressed his desire to work closely with special 
procedures and to invite them to participate in consultations and training organized by his office. 
He noted that there was a need for more sustainable and systematic cooperation, synergizing 
with special procedures. 
</p>
<p>56. Mandate holders expressed their readiness to cooperate with the Special Adviser. 
Participants were interested in indicators that would determine the need for a measure beyond 
monitoring. They also discussed the role of the State as a determining factor in the propagation 
of violence which affected the most vulnerable, and noted that a common phenomenon of 
genocides was the absence of the rule of law resulting in the aggravation of disparities. </p>
