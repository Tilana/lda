persons belonging to religious minorities, and paying tribute to the commitment of States to 
prevent these acts,  
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that educational institutions may offer unique possibilities for

affect members of religious minorities, 
</p>

religion or belief, which includes the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of

<p>including<b> </b>the right to change one&#8217;s religion or belief;  
</p>
