<p><b>  15/&#8230; Impunity for terrorist hostage-takers, ransom payments and 
 human rights 
</b></p>
<p> At its &#8230;&#8230;.. meeting, on &#8230;&#8230;.., the Human Rights Council decided to adopt the 
following text: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Council on the promotion and protection of human rights while 
countering terrorism, human rights and terrorism and hostage-taking; </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i>, in particular, that peace and security, development and human 
rights are the interrelated pillars of the United Nations system, reaffirming also its 
unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods, practices and financing of terrorism, 
in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever committed, 
regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renewing its 
commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism; 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of 
human rights are not conflicting goals but are complementary and mutually 
reinforcing;  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern </i>at the increase in incidents of kidnapping and hostage-
taking committed by individuals, groups, undertakings and entities included in 
terrorism-related sanctions lists and at the payment of ransoms to, and/or the release 
of, individuals involved in acts of terrorism, which are tantamount to financing 
terrorism and promoting impunity for human rights violations, thus exposing an 
increased number of innocent individuals to such human rights violations; 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i>, therefore, the need to reflect on the issue of human rights in the 
context of hostage-taking, ransom payments and impunity for the terrorists involved; 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides </i>to convene, within existing resources, at its sixteenth session, 
a panel discussion on the issue of human rights in the context of hostage-taking, 
ransom payments and impunity for the terrorists involved; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to liaise with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of human rights while countering terrorism and all concerned parties and 
stakeholders, including relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to 
ensuring their participation in the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report 
on the outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary.&#8221;
