<p><b>12/...  Draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, regardless of 
their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and manifestations are 
particularly severe in developing countries, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
 <p></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective 
enjoyment of human rights and that its immediate alleviation and eventual elimination must 
remain a high priority for the international community, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>in this regard the commitments made at relevant United Nations 
conferences and summits, including those made at the World Summit for Social Development, 
held in Copenhagen in 1995, the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the 
General Assembly on 8 September 2000, and the 2005 World Summit Outcome, adopted by the 
Heads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that respect for all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent 
and interrelated, is of crucial importance for all policies and programmes to fight extreme 
poverty at the local and national levels,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, annexed 
to resolution 2006/9 adopted by the Subcommission for the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights on 24 August 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its resolutions 2/2 of November 2006 and 7/27 of March 2008, as well as its 
resolution 8/11 of June 2008, in which it extended the mandate of the independent expert on the 
question of human rights and extreme poverty, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the seminar held in Geneva on 27 and 28 January 2009 on the draft guiding 
principles on extreme poverty and human rights, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note </i>of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
on the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights (A/HRC/11/32), revealing a 
widespread commitment to advancing the project of elaborating guiding principles on extreme 
poverty and human rights; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Invites</i> the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To pursue further work on the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and 
human rights with a view to integrate the contributions of Member States and other relevant </p>

 <p></p>
<p>stakeholders, as well as the results of the consultations undertaken by the Office of the 
High Commissioner in 2007 and 2008 and the conclusions of the seminar held in Geneva 
on 27 and 28 January 2009; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To consult Member States further, including through relevant regional organizations, 
and other relevant stakeholders in the course of this process; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To submit a progress report presenting her recommendations on how to improve the 
draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights to the Council no later than its 
fifteenth session, to allow the Council<b> </b>to take a decision on the way forward with a view to a 
possible adoption of guiding principles on the rights of persons living in extreme poverty 
by 2012; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the independent expert 
with the necessary support to allow her to implement this mandate.
