<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report presents the findings and recommendations of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on her follow-up mission to 
Guatemala undertaken from 18 to 22 February 2008. 
</p>
<p> The purpose of the follow-up mission was to evaluate progress and challenges in 
implementing the recommendations of the Special Representative six years after her first visit. 
</p>
<p> While acknowledging some progress since the 2002 visit, particularly in the area of 
establishing institutions and in self-protection initiatives of defenders, the Special Representative 
is deeply concerned at the deterioration in the environment in which human rights defenders 
operate, characterized by endemic impunity for crimes and violations committed against them. 
</p>
<p> The following table compares the situation of human rights defenders as assessed during 
the visit in 2002 with the assessment made during the follow-up visit of 2008. It provides a 
schematic overview of developments that have occurred in the last six years, which were the 
focus of the follow-up mission. The table does not summarize all the findings contained in this 
report, particularly those not directly related to issues and concerns raised in the first mission. 
</p>
<p><b>Comparative situation of human rights defenders 2002 and 2008 
</b></p>
<p>First mission - 2002a Follow-up mission - 2008 
</p>
<p>The context in which defenders work 
</p>
<p>Progress in the implementation of the Peace 
Accords has been extremely slow with a 
heavy pending legislative agenda for their 
implementation. The implementation of the 
Peace Accords is a necessary condition for 
the existence of a safe environment for 
human rights defenders and for the 
promotion and protection of human rights 
in Guatemala (paras. 9, 24 and 101b). 
</p>
<p>Twelve years after the signature of the Peace 
Accords, it is disappointing to observe little 
progress in their implementation and their 
de facto disappearance from political discourse, 
despite the persistence of the problems that the 
Peace Accords were meant to tackle (para. 11c). 
</p>
<p>Low position of the country in the human 
development index vis-&#224;-vis the 
Latin American region (para. 7). 
</p>
<p>Guatemala is the third most unequal country in 
Latin America in terms of wealth distribution, 
with the worst position in the human 
development index of the region (para. 12). 
</p>
<p>High level of violence in the country 
(reported throughout the report). 
</p>
<p>The level of violence and killings is extremely 
high. At the time of the first visit of the Special 
Representative, the average of killings was 9 per 
day while at the time of the second visit it had 
reached 17 (para. 13).

</p>
<p>Human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative was impressed 
by the maturity of civil society 
organizations and their resilience in the 
face of difficult circumstances (para. 100). 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative was able to confirm 
the very good level of organization of the 
defenders&#8217; community, their continued efforts to 
work together and establish or strengthen 
mechanisms and initiatives to better protect 
themselves (para. 16). 
</p>
<p>High level of attacks against defenders 
(throughout the report). 
</p>
<p>The number of attacks against human rights 
defenders has increased and basically doubled in 
the last five years with an average of one attack 
against defenders every other day (para. 23). 
</p>
<p>Violations against defenders included 
killings, attacks on their physical integrity, 
threats, intimidation, harassment and 
stigmatization (paras. 42-52 and 104). 
</p>
<p>The same violations have continued to occur. 
Another form of harassment of defenders that has 
emerged more prominently is the criminalization 
of human rights defenders (paras. 25-26). 
</p>
<p>Journalists who reported on cases of 
corruption or on investigations of past 
abuses were among the groups of defenders 
most affected by human rights violations 
(para. 55). 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative is able to confirm that 
reporting on organized crime, drug trafficking, 
corruption and other criminal activities, where the 
responsibilities of parallel powers may surface or 
become public through the activities of 
investigative journalism, remains highly 
dangerous (para. 43). 
</p>
<p>Serious violations of the right to organize, 
including death threats, wrongful dismissal 
and persecution of union leaders and 
members (para. 52). 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative reports with concern 
that trade unionists continue to be the target of 
many attacks and confirms the existence of 
worrying levels of anti-union violence (para. 49). 
</p>
<p>The institutional response 
</p>
<p>A law on access to information was 
pending before Congress (para. 26). 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative welcomes the 
adoption of the law on access to information in 
the second half of 2008 (para. 55). 
</p>
<p>The Presidential Commission for the 
Coordination of Human Rights Policies 
(COPREDEH), inter alia, coordinates 
Government action in the area of human 
rights and provides information to 
international human rights mechanisms 
(paras. 30-31). 
</p>
<p>Inclusion of representatives of the defenders&#8217; 
community in governmental structures, 
particularly in COPREDEH and the Presidential 
Secretariat for Peace (SEPAZ). Over the years 
COPREDEH has been responding to the 
communications of the Special Representative 
proving to be an interlocutor engaged in a 
constructive dialogue (paras. 56-57). </p>

</p>
<p>First mission - 2002a Follow-up mission - 2008 
</p>
<p>The Office of the Ombudsperson is an 
important institution with national coverage 
and a wide mandate to monitor human 
rights and investigate complaints of human 
rights violations (para. 29). 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative was impressed by the 
achievements of the Office of the Ombudsperson 
in addressing complaints and in gaining people&#8217;s 
trust. Staff working in the Office of the 
Ombudsperson and the Ombudsperson himself 
are often victims of attacks and threats 
(paras. 63-66). 
</p>
<p>There is no trust in the police. Many people 
prefer not to report threats for fear of 
retaliation. Victims of threats under the 
protection of the police fear that those in 
charge of their protection have links with 
the perpetrators of threats and attacks 
(paras. 64 and 66). 
</p>
<p>The police should be reformed to gain the trust of 
the population (para. 74). Protection offered by 
the police is selective, inefficient and at times is 
even a cause of further risk when the police 
themselves are believed to be involved in attacks 
against defenders (para. 67). Defenders at risk 
receive some protection mainly because of 
international pressure (para. 68). The hotline set 
up by the police to respond to attacks and threats 
against defenders is a positive development. The 
service is however underused by defenders 
(para. 72). 
</p>
<p>In Guatemala there is almost total de facto 
impunity for violations of human rights, 
including those committed against human 
rights defenders (para. 63). 
</p>
<p>The reported figure of 98 per cent of impunity for 
attacks against human rights defenders makes 
justice an empty word in Guatemala (para. 75). 
</p>
<p>There is a general view that the inefficiency 
of investigations is due to the lack of 
technical means and proper training of the 
police and prosecutors (para. 67). 
</p>
<p>Since the first visit of the Special Representative, 
the Office of the Attorney-General has received 
more resources. Despite the increase in resources 
and the establishment of specialized units in the 
Office of the Attorney-General to facilitate 
investigations, the inaction of prosecutors in 
investigating and prosecuting cases is 
disappointing (para. 76). 
</p>
<p>Poor coordination between the police and 
prosecutors was also indicated as a reason 
for inefficient investigations (para. 67). 
</p>
<p>Despite monthly meetings and internal decisions 
to improve collaboration between the police and 
prosecutors, poor coordination between the two 
institutions remains a problem, as it was in 2002 
(para. 77). 
</p>
<p> The Special Representative was, however, 
encouraged by some initiatives to increase police 
performance and better protection. Among these, 
the new Unit on Human Rights of the Criminal 
Investigation Division of the National Civil 
Police established in January 2008 and the Body 
for the Analysis of Attacks against Human Rights 
Defenders (para. 70). </p>

</p>
<p>First mission - 2002a Follow-up mission - 2008 
</p>
<p>In May 2002, a specialized prosecutor to 
investigate crimes against human rights 
defenders was appointed (para. 36). 
</p>
<p>The Human Rights Prosecutor is in charge of 
investigating crimes against defenders. However, 
specialized prosecutors only exist in the capital. 
For cases which occur outside the capital, the 
back and forth of the file between the specialized 
prosecutor in the capital and those with territorial 
competence is a factor impeding investigations 
(para. 77). 
</p>
<p>Judges, prosecutors and witnesses in 
judicial proceedings in cases of human 
rights violations or corruption are 
threatened (para. 65). 
</p>
<p>Judges investigating sensitive human rights cases 
are often threatened and exposed to attacks by the 
media, which is largely controlled by parallel 
powers. This makes them vulnerable to further 
violence while the security measures for their 
protection are often inadequate. Judges in the first 
instance based outside the capital and peace 
judges are the least protected (para. 79).

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders conducted a mission to Guatemala from 18 to 20 February 2008. The Special 
Representative would like to thank the Government for extending the invitation to visit 
the country and for the collaboration they provided to ensure a fruitful visit. The Special 
Representative also expresses her gratitude to the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Guatemala for the outstanding assistance 
provided in the organization of the mission. 
</p>
<p>2. The visit to Guatemala was a follow-up mission aimed at identifying progress and 
challenges in the situation of human rights defenders six years after the visit undertaken by the 
Special Representative from 26 May to 1 June 2002.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Representative held 15 meetings during her visit to the country; all were held 
in Guatemala City. She met with government representatives, members of the judiciary and the 
parliament, the Ombudsperson (<i>Procurador de los Derechos Humanos</i>), the international 
community, and human rights defenders. In particular, she met with the President and a member 
of the Human Rights Commission of the Congress, with the Vice-President of the Republic, the 
Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Interior (<i>Ministerio de Gobernaci&#243;n</i>), the head 
of the Presidential Commission for the Coordination of Human Rights Policies (<i>Comisi&#243;n 
Presidencial de Derechos Humanos,</i> COPREDEH), the head of the Presidential Secretariat for 
Peace (<i>Secretar&#237;a de la Paz</i>, SEPAZ), the President of the Constitutional Court, the President of 
the Supreme Court of Justice, the Attorney-General, the Ombudsperson (<i>Procurador de 
Derechos Humanos</i>), the Director of the Institute of Public Penal Defence, representatives of the 
Association of Judges and Magistrates, the head of the International Commission against 
Impunity in Guatemala (<i>Comisi&#243;n Internacional contra la Impunidad en Guatemala</i>, CICIG), 
and some 30 representatives of the diplomatic community. She also met a wide range of 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), journalists, trade unionists and other groups from the 
dynamic civil society of the country. The Special Representative expresses her appreciation for 
the coordinated way in which civil society interacted with her. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  THE CONTEXT IN WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS WORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>4. The purpose of the visit to Guatemala, as a follow-up mission, was not to make a full 
assessment of the situation of human rights defenders but rather to evaluate progress and 
challenges in implementing the recommendations of the Special Representative six years after 
her first visit. 
</p>
<p>5. The previous report was used as a basis for assessing progress and gaps in the subsequent 
six years. To facilitate the assessment, a matrix was prepared containing a list of some 30 issues, 
which captured the main findings and recommendations of the first report in a schematic manner. 
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>For each item, information on developments that occurred between 2002 and 2008 was sought 
before and during the mission. This allowed immediate identification of areas in which progress 
has been evident, versus other areas where change and improvements have not taken place. 
</p>
<p>6. The information gathered during the visit, however, went beyond the issues raised in 
the 2002 report. The present report gives an account of both aspects, i.e. the follow-up 
assessment and an updated overview of the situation of human rights defenders in Guatemala. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  From the Peace Accords to a renewed commitment while problems persist 
</b></p>
<p>7. Guatemala remains a country with daunting challenges. It ranks among the most unequal in 
terms of income distribution. Violence and organized crime are rampant, the level of impunity is 
almost total and the influence of parallel powers impedes change. This has caused a dramatic 
deterioration in the environment in which defenders operate. 
</p>
<p>8. The Peace Accords, signed in 1996 to turn a page after 36 years of internal armed conflict 
and to build a country through peace and democracy on the solid foundations of human rights 
(the backbone of the Accords), were meant to shape the political agenda for the following years. 
</p>
<p>9. To assist the country in the implementation of the Peace Accords, the United Nations 
Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) was established in 1997. At the time of the first 
mission of the Special Representative, MINUGUA actively supported the visit and was 
struggling with the difficulties that the country was facing in the implementation of the Peace 
Accords. In her report, the Special Representative remarked that &#8220;progress in the implementation 
of the peace agreements has been extremely slow&#8221; and that &#8220;the pending legislative agenda for 
the implementation of the peace agreements is still very heavy&#8221;.<b>2</b> In her recommendations, the 
Special Representative made it clear that &#8220;the implementation of all the peace agreements is a 
necessary condition for the existence of a safe environment for human rights defenders and, 
more generally, for the promotion and protection of human rights in Guatemala&#8221;.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>10. The mandate of MINUGUA expired in 2004. The involvement of the international 
community and the United Nations in supporting the implementation of the Peace Accords 
continued with the establishment in 2005 of the OHCHR office in Guatemala, in agreement with 
the Government, with a mandate to monitor the human rights situation in order to advise State 
institutions and civil society. 
</p>
<p>11. Twelve years after the signature of the Peace Accords and six years after the first visit 
of the Special Representative and her subsequent recommendations, it is disappointing to 
observe little progress in the implementation of the Peace Accords. The weak implementation of 
the Peace Accords was confirmed by most interlocutors with whom the Special Representative 
met, and mainly attributed to a lack of political will. The Special Representative noted not 
only limited progress in the implementation of the Peace Accords, but also their de facto 
</p>

</p>
<p>disappearance from the agenda and vocabulary of all her interlocutors. This is a silent though 
eloquent indication of the diminished expectations regarding the actual implementation of the 
Peace Accords. The country wants to move forward and rid itself of the legacies of the past, 
which the Peace Accords seem to embody for some quarters of society and the political 
establishment. However, the problems that an effective implementation of the Peace Accords 
was meant to tackle are still there. 
</p>
<p>12. In 2002, the Special Representative observed the unequal distribution of wealth and the 
low position of the country in the Human Development Index vis-&#224;-vis the rest of 
Latin America.<b>4</b> Six years later, Guatemala is the third most unequal country in Latin America in 
terms of wealth distribution<b>5</b> with the worst human development index of the region.<b>6</b> 
Inequalities in the distribution of land are acute. In 2000, 1.5 per cent of the population 
controlled approximately a third of the land of the country. Land disputes are a constant; in 
December 2005, there were some 1,050 pending disputes on land and large numbers of farmers 
and their families had been displaced. 
</p>
<p>13. The level of violence and killings is extremely high. In 2007, there were 5,781 violent 
deaths and a homicide rate that makes Guatemala one of the most violent countries in the region 
and the world.<b>7</b> Regrettably, after a sharp decline in homicides following the signing of the Peace 
Accords in 1996, killings began to rise dramatically after 1999, with rates nearly doubling from a 
high base in just seven years. The chances of conviction were as little as 2 per cent.<b>8</b> At the time 
of the first visit of the Special Representative, the average of killings was 9 per day while at the 
time of the second visit it had reached 17. 
</p>
<p>14. &#8220;There are many mysterious powers&#8221; said the Vice-President of the Republic to the Special 
Representative in reference to the vicious linkages between violence, poverty, organized crime 
and parallel powers. In this environment, attacks, threats and violence against defenders have 
proliferated as the analysis in the following sections of this report shows. 
</p>
<p>15. &#8220;Human rights are our priority&#8221; the Vice-President of the Republic assured the Special 
Representative, who was encouraged by the commitment expressed by the Government. She 
hopes that this commitment will be sustained and determined enough to take the country through 
the reform processes and transformation that will enable Guatemala to tackle structural 
problems, including inequalities, violence and impunity, that impede the enjoyment of human

<p>rights of the people of Guatemala and put those who defend those rights at great risk. While 
welcoming the inclusion of some members of the human rights defenders&#8217; community in the 
Cabinet as a signal of the Government&#8217;s commitment towards human rights, she reminds the 
Government that an effective and credible human rights policy must go beyond the appointment 
of a few experts in different institutional structures. To make tangible progress, human rights 
must be part and parcel of the political agenda and permeate all sectors of Government action. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Monitoring mechanisms and other initiatives for self-protection 
</b></p>
<p>16. In 2002, the Special Representative was impressed by the maturity of civil society 
organizations and their resilience in the face of difficult circumstances.<b>9</b> The defenders&#8217; 
community reported that the first visit of the Special Representative helped them in giving 
recognition to their work and legitimacy to their claims. In her follow-up visit, the Special 
Representative was able to confirm the very good level of organization of the defenders&#8217; 
community, their continued efforts to work together and establish or strengthen mechanisms and 
initiatives to better protect themselves. 
</p>
<p>17. In particular, she welcomed the establishment and strengthening of the NGO Unit for the 
Protection of Human Rights Defenders (<i>Unidad de Protecci&#243;n de Defensores y Defensoras de 
Derechos Humanos, UDEFEGUA</i>) as a monitoring entity within the National Movement for 
Human Rights (<i>Movimiento Nacional por los Derechos Humanos</i>) set up by the civil society 
sector to enhance the protection of human rights defenders from within the human rights 
community. Established in 2003, UDEFEGUA monitors attacks against human rights defenders; 
regularly reports on them, including by providing an analysis of patterns and by bringing them to 
the attention of international and regional human rights mechanisms; undertakes additional 
research on complex and emblematic cases; facilitates mediation between defenders attacked and 
local institutions; supports defenders in approaching public prosecutors concerning attacks they 
have been victims of, including by providing some legal assistance; and coordinates with public 
structures, such as COPREDEH, the Ombudsperson, the Ministry of Interior and the police, on 
protection measures for defenders at risk. In 2007, UDEFEGUA processed 259 cases reporting 
attacks against defenders, three quarters of which were considered by UDEFEGUA as attacks on 
the right to defend human rights, the remaining quarter being considered episodes of common 
crime. 
</p>
<p>18. In addition to UDEFEGUA, in recent years other monitoring mechanisms have been 
established to monitor attacks against specific sectors of civil society. They are: (a) the Centre

<p>19. The Special Representative appreciates the capacity-building initiatives undertaken by 
defenders, both by national and international organizations, to enhance their self-protection in 
the areas of risk prevention and risk analysis, security plans, and IT security. An additional form 
of protection that is being practised in the country is the accompaniment of defenders by 
international organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communications sent to Guatemala between the two visits 
</b></p>
<p>20. The increased number and intensity of attacks against human rights defenders in 
Guatemala were among the factors that prompted the follow-up visit of the Special 
Representative. In the time between her two visits, the Special Representative addressed to the 
Government 87 communications of allegations of human rights violations affecting defenders. 
While reiterating the caveat that the picture resulting from the communications sent by the 
Special Representative does not reflect human rights violations against defenders in the 
magnitude they occur worldwide but only those reported to her, Guatemala emerged among the 
countries of greatest concern among those on which the Special Representative received 
information. The 87 communications of the Special Representative reported allegations of 
human rights violations affecting over 170 defenders, a third of whom were women, and some 
100 organizations, including trade unions; women&#8217;s organizations; farmers&#8217; organizations and 
those working on land rights; environmentalist organizations; youth associations, students&#8217; 
networks and children&#8217;s rights organizations; media associations; organizations working on 
justice and the right to truth, including associations of the families of victims of past abuses; 
indigenous organizations; associations to protect the rights of displaced persons; organizations 
working on economic, social and cultural rights; organizations providing legal aid and 
assistance; organizations working on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people; 
religious organizations engaged in humanitarian, social and human rights work; organizations 
working on migrants&#8217; rights; international NGOs; and staff of the Office of the Ombudsperson. 
</p>
<p>21. The Government responded to approximately 50 per cent of the communications with a 
different level of responsiveness from year to year. The responsiveness of the Government was 
satisfactory until 2004 with a sharp decline in 2005 and 2006, while in 2007 the rate of replies 
increased to about 60 per cent of communications sent. 
</p>
<p>22. Overall the responses of the Government illustrate a general will to provide protection to 
human rights defenders at risk and report a good deal of information on the implementation of 
protection measures to that end, in some cases prompted by decisions of the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). However, the main flow of State response has been in 
the areas of investigation, prosecution and conviction of perpetrators, where the impunity of 
perpetrators is the rule. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Overview of attacks and violations against human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>23. The alarming picture that the Special Representative was getting through the 
communications mechanism on the intensity and seriousness of attacks against human rights 
defenders was confirmed in situ. The number of attacks against human rights defenders 
increased and basically doubled in the last five years with an average of one attack against 
defenders every other day. Fifty defenders were killed between July 2002 and December 2007, 
of which 23 killings took place between 2005 and 2007. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>24. As already captured by the communications sent by the Special Representative, all sectors 
of the human rights community are affected by attacks and violations against them. Defenders 
working on economic, social and cultural rights are among the most affected groups. 
Organizations working on justice and the right to truth are also targeted. This also includes some 
defenders from the Institute of Public Penal Defence (<i>Instituto de la</i> <i>Defensa P&#250;blica Penal</i>) 
working on sensitive cases. Other sectors of the defenders&#8217; community suffer attacks specific to 
their area of work. These are, among others, trade unions, journalists, women defenders, 
peasants&#8217; organizations, indigenous organizations and youth defenders, as well as international 
NGOs. 
</p>
<p>25. The same violations against defenders as identified in the previous report have continued 
to occur, including an alarmingly high level of killings, attacks against the physical integrity of 
human rights defenders, threats, intimidation and harassment. Another form of harassment of 
defenders that emerged more prominently during the second visit was the criminalization of 
human rights defenders. This phenomenon most affects defenders working on land rights, the 
environment and the rights of indigenous peoples, whose enjoyment of those rights is perceived 
to interfere with strong economic interests linked to projects such as the construction of a cement 
factory or the functioning of a gold mine. Available data on the criminalization of defenders is 
considered to underestimate the real extent of the problem, but the reported figure of 
45 proceedings against defenders registered in the last few years gives the phenomenon the 
dimension of a pattern rather than a series of isolated cases. Human rights defenders are charged 
with crimes like terrorism, activities against the security of the nation, or aggravated theft of 
land. In two cases, court proceedings have already resulted in convictions. Considering the 
overall immobility of the judiciary in providing justice, prosecutions against defenders appear to 
be conducted with inexplicable speed and efficiency. 
</p>
<p>26. The final recommendation of the first report of the Special Representative urged the 
Government &#8220;to take further steps to gain the trust of the civil society, particularly human rights 
defenders, and to discourage tendencies amongst public officials to see human rights defenders 
as adversaries to be challenged&#8221;.<b>10</b> Findings of ongoing stigmatization and criminalization of 
defenders from some sectors of the political establishment and the media are disappointing and 
worrying. By taking away credibility and legitimacy from the work of defenders, the open or 
subtle hostility of some politicians and some media makes them more vulnerable to attacks. 
</p>
<p>27. As a result, impunity is the general rule for violations committed against defenders and is 
probably the major cause for the high number, continuity and intensity of such violations. 
Another element that proved to contribute to increased levels of violence against defenders was 
the pre-election context of 2007. 
</p>
<p>28. In the second half of 2007, however, a decrease in the attacks against defenders was 
observable. Several factors are linked to this decrease. On 28 June 2007, the OHCHR office in 
Guatemala organized a public event to condemn attacks against human rights defenders. A 
number of representatives of the diplomatic and international community as well as State

<p>

</p>
<p>institutions and civil society organizations took part in the event. This event marked a turning 
point in terms of fewer attacks against defenders, accompanied by a number of initiatives at 
Government level. 
</p>
<p>29. The Minister of Interior personally initiated a process of dialogue with human rights 
organizations with the aim of jointly analysing patterns of aggression against defenders. This 
process was formalized by Ministerial Agreement 103-2008 of 10 January 2008, which provided 
for the establishment of the Body for the Analysis of Attacks against Human Rights Defenders 
(<i>Instancia de An&#225;lisis de Ataques contra Defensores de Derechos Humanos en Guatemala</i>). 
30. Human rights defenders consider that these initiatives and the personal engagement of the 
Minister of Interior, especially in addressing the flaws of the police, may have contributed to a 
decrease of up to 30 per cent in attacks against defenders. This shows how political will alone 
can make a tangible difference to the security of defenders. 
</p>
<p>31. The graph below shows the increase and decrease in attacks against defenders explained in 
these paragraphs.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32. On 11 January 2008, the new Human Rights Unit of the Criminal Investigation Division of 
the National Civil Police (<i>Unidad de Derechos Humanos de la Divisi&#243;n de Investigaci&#243;n 
Criminal de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil</i>) was officially created.

</p>
<p>33. The establishment of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala 
(CICIG) was also considered a contributing factor to a more secure environment for defenders. 
Even if not yet operational at the time of the visit, its mere establishment was a strong signal that 
the endemic impunity in the country is being addressed. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Defending the rights of indigenous peoples, land rights, 
the environment and livelihoods of local communities 
</b></p>
<p>34. Guatemala&#8217;s economy continues to be largely based on agriculture. Disputes over land, 
therefore, remain a source of social tension and conflict. Conflicting interests between 
landowners and farmers on land access and use or between large-scale industrial projects, 
including in the mining sector, the cement industry, and the construction of waterpower plants, 
impact negatively on the livelihoods of indigenous communities. This generates social unrest and 
violence that targets farmers&#8217; organizations and their leadership, with a worrying pattern of 
criminalization of social movements defending the rights of indigenous peoples and land rights. 
</p>
<p>35. In addition to the criminalization of their claims, defenders working on these issues are 
targeted with killings, death threats, office searches, and stigmatization campaigns. 
</p>
<p>36. The lack of consultation with indigenous peoples on the decisions related to awarding 
mining licences was among the many human rights violations related to the exploration or 
exploitation of natural resources put forward by human rights defenders. The obligation of 
consulting indigenous peoples through their own representative institutions whenever 
consideration is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect them 
directly is established in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples<b>12</b> as 
well as in International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries<b>13</b> that Guatemala has ratified. Despite a 
decision on a complaint of the ILO Governing Body in June 2007, reiterated by an individual 
observation of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and 
Recommendations published in 2008, requesting the Government &#8220;to initiate a process of 
consultation before granting any exploration and exploitation licences &#8230; and to maintain 
consultation and participation procedures with all the communities concerned which occupy or 
otherwise use these lands, whether or not they hold title of ownership &#8230;&#8221;,<b>14</b> the Special 
Representative was informed of the disappointing attitude of the Government and concerned 
private actors, who ignore or disregard the results of consultative initiatives set up by defenders 
of affected communities. In particular, the Special Representative was informed of the initiative

<p>to resolve any consequences of the granting of the exploration licence including by assessing, in 
consultation with the communities concerned, whether and to what degree their interests have 
been prejudiced, and where such prejudice was found, to ensure that fair compensation was 
provided [&#8230;]&#8221;, para. 73 (b). </p>

</p>
<p>&#8220;community consultations&#8221; (<i>consultas comunitarias</i>) initiated in the municipality of Sipakapa 
calling on the population to express its position on the presence of a mine on their territory. 
Seventeen other municipalities carried out community consultations with the participation of 
almost all the population. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Defenders working on justice and the right to truth 
</b>37. Defending the right to truth and claiming justice for past abuses have marked topical 
moments of the recent history of Guatemala and its politics. Calling for compliance with the 
Peace Accords, the filing of cases of genocide before the Office of the Attorney-General, 
claiming justice through the Spanish judiciary (see paragraph 81 below) or advocating for the 
establishment of an international commission against impunity, and other major battles carried 
out by human rights defenders claiming justice and truth, have profoundly marked the political 
environment. There has been an inadequate response to the quest for justice and to its polarizing 
effect within the institutional setting and among parallel powers, leaving defenders engaged in 
this struggle exposed to intense and continued violence and attacks. 
</p>
<p>38. In 2007, about 30 per cent of attacks against defenders targeted those working on justice 
and the right to truth. In the last eight years, some 350 attacks against defenders have been 
registered. Most of those are threats of various kinds but they also include kidnappings and 
killings (13). The sophistication of some attacks indicates the likely use of State intelligence in 
their perpetration. The number and intensity of the attacks have increased since 2004 and tend to 
intensify at critical moments, when a case is about to be submitted to the public prosecutor, a 
court decision is awaited, or when witnesses are preparing to testify with the help and support of 
defenders. The continuity of attacks over time is intended to dissuade defenders from pursuing 
justice at the different stages of judicial proceedings. 
</p><p>39. The absolute impunity of those committing crimes and making attacks against defenders 
engaged in seeking justice is disconcerting. Data submitted to the Special Representative 
indicates that in 68 per cent of cases, an investigation of the alleged crimes against defenders 
simply does not exist and, more dramatically, in none of the cases reported has there been a court 
sentence of whatever kind. Paradoxically, in eight cases, human rights defenders, from being the 
victims of crimes became the accused parties in the course of the proceedings. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The Institute for Public Penal Defence (<i>Instituto de la</i> <i>Defensa P&#250;blica Penal</i>) </b> 40. The Institute for Public Penal Defence has some 800 staff in 34 offices throughout the 
country, which provide legal assistance in penal proceedings of an often sensitive nature and 
with clear human rights implications. Members of staff of the Institute working on these cases 
are often the target of threats against which inadequate protection is provided and investigations 
of which do not yield tangible results. To cope with the insufficient measures for protecting staff 
at risk, sensitive cases are assigned to a group of staff instead of one or two individuals who 
could easily become the target of threats. Nevertheless, the Special Representative learned of a 
sensitive case on which all five staff members asked to be reassigned in fear for their lives. This 
is one, among the many, emblematic examples of the degree of danger to which the Institute is 
exposed. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>41. The Ombudsperson was indicated as the main and basically only source of support and 
protection. When informed of attacks against staff of the Institute, the Ombudsperson intervenes 
by issuing statements condemning the attacks and supporting the work of the Institute and helps 
in furthering investigations within the limits of his mandate. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Representative found that the work of the Institute is not recognized as work 
in defence of human rights and not protected as such, although it should be. It should also 
receive more resources. The 2 per cent of the budget of the judiciary, which she understood as 
being the current amount of resources assigned to the Institute, is not adequate to meet the 
challenges confronting it, particularly when the institutional response, including from within the 
judiciary itself, is so weak and the Institute has to cope with threats and attacks against its staff 
from its own means. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Defending freedom of expression and the right to information 
</b></p>
<p>43. In her previous report, the Special Representative indicated that &#8220;journalists who report on 
cases of corruption or on investigations of past abuses&#8221; were among the groups of defenders 
most affected by human rights violations.<b>15</b> During her follow-up visit, the Special 
Representative was able to confirm that reporting on organized crime, drug trafficking, 
corruption and other criminal activities, where the responsibilities of parallel powers may surface 
or become public through the activities of investigative journalism, remain highly dangerous. 
Cases of death threats, physical and verbal attacks and a total of eight killings from 2003 to 2007 
remain a concern. In addition, defenders pointed to the deterrent effect of the presence of, and 
the threat represented by, parallel powers on journalists who tend to apply self-censorship 
regarding information denouncing organized crime, corruption or other violations for fear of 
retaliation. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Women defenders 
</b></p>
<p>44. Women&#8217;s human rights organizations work mainly on assisting women victims of 
violence. Their analysis suggests that current acts of violence against women represent a 
continuum of the violence perpetrated during the armed conflict and that the impunity for such 
violence and for the attacks against women defenders indicates that the social and cultural root 
causes of gender-based violence are still present in the country despite the end of the armed 
conflict. Women defenders are exposed to, and the target of, gender-specific attacks against 
them, namely sexual violence, against which the country did not have a specific law until 
April 2008. While justice and redress would break the vicious cycle of violence, impunity and 
the gender-based bias with which parts of the judiciary and the institutional framework are 
imbued, perpetuate it. 
</p>

<p> A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Youth defenders 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Representative was pleased to see a considerable number of youth defenders 
engaged in the defence of human rights in different areas, such as supporting young people who 
lost their parents during the armed conflict, students&#8217; associations working on the right to 
education, those working on the broad human rights situation of youth, and organizations 
affiliated to the Catholic Church and engaged in a wide range of social activities in support of 
youth rights. 
</p>
<p>46. The engagement of youth in the defence of human rights has a high educational value. For 
most youth defenders, their engagement in youth associations is among their first experiences of 
public participation and human rights defence. Ensuring a conducive environment for youth 
defenders is a social investment, as well as a responsibility of the Government under the 
Declaration on human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>47. While reiterating her appreciation for a well-organized group of youth defenders, the 
Special Representative finds their accounts of the hostile environment around them particularly 
concerning. Youth defenders are stigmatized and discouraged in their activities and all 
organizations reported specific episodes of attacks targeting them. Some attacks are clearly acts 
of retaliation specifically targeting student defenders, like threats of expulsion from school or 
university. 
</p>
<p>48. A youth organization working on the rights of lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender 
people is exposed to attacks linked to the stigmatization around sexual orientation and gender 
identity and reported, inter alia, constant harassment from the police. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Trade unions 
</b></p>
<p>49. In her first mission, the Special Representative noted serious violations of the right to 
organize, including death threats, wrongful dismissal and persecution of union leaders and 
members.<b>16</b> The Special Representative reports with concern that trade unionists continue to be 
the target of many attacks and confirms the existence of worrying levels of anti-union violence. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Representative concurs with the conclusions of the monitoring mechanisms of 
the ILO<b>17</b> and acknowledges some measures of protection granted to trade unionists under threat 
but remains deeply concerned about the almost total impunity of those who launch attacks 
against trade unionists.

</p>
<p><b>8.  International non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>51. Between 2004 and 2005, attacks against international NGOs were concentrated against 
organizations engaged in international accompaniment of local organizations. In 
April-May 2007, the target of attacks shifted to international cooperation agencies, i.e. those 
offering financial and political support to national organizations. All the attacks were denounced 
to the competent authorities but impunity for the alleged perpetrators has remained a rule without 
exception. In one case, the organization attacked even hired a lawyer and other experts to support 
the investigations, with the purpose of generating a positive precedent in the identification and 
prosecution of perpetrators that would have hopefully contributed to improving the response to 
attacks against defenders. Despite these efforts and their symbolic value, no concrete results have 
been achieved in the investigation of the case. 
</p>
<p>52. This regrettably shows that international cooperation agencies are unwelcome in the 
country, they are not immune to direct attacks and face similar levels of impunity as national 
organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  THE INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The parliament 
</b></p>
<p>53. &#8220;I love Guatemala but it lacks justice&#8221; (&#8220;<i>Amo Guatemala pero falta la justicia</i>&#8221;), said a 
member of the Human Rights Commission of the parliament to the Special Representative. 
Members of the Commission showed awareness of the human rights violations affecting 
defenders and expressed their will to be receptive to their plight. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Representative encourages the parliament, in particular through its Human 
Rights Commission, to make more efforts to acknowledge and value the work of defenders 
through public statements and become a source of political and institutional support for them. 
She also encourages the parliament to institutionalize consultations with civil society and human 
rights organizations when drafting and debating human rights legislation. 
</p>
<p>55. She welcomes the adoption of a law on access to information in the second half of 2008 
and recommends the Government adopt adequate measures for its full implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Structures and policies 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Presidential Commission for the Coordination of Human Rights Policies 
(COPREDEH) continues to be the coordinating entity for government action on human rights. 
As mentioned in paragraph 15 above, the Special Representative noted with interest the inclusion 
of representatives of the defenders&#8217; community in government structures, particularly in 
COPREDEH and SEPAZ. While referring to the reservations stated above and the apprehensions 
she has in this regard, she nevertheless hopes that having former civil society leaders in 
government structures is improving the accessibility to State institutions for human rights 
defenders and civil society organizations. </p>

<p> A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Representative acknowledges that COPREDEH, as the government institution 
responding to and following up on her communications, has proved to be an effective 
interlocutor engaged in a constructive dialogue on the issues she has been raising over the years. 
This has taken place through the Coordination Protection Unit (<i>Unidad Coordinadora de 
Protecci&#243;n</i>), a specialized unit within COPREDEH established in 2004 to coordinate, adopt, and 
monitor protection measures, and to report to international and regional mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>58. At the end of 2007, COPREDEH drafted the Public Policy for Prevention and Protection of 
Human Rights Defenders 2007-2017 (<i>Pol&#237;tica P&#250;blica de Prevenci&#243;n y Protecci&#243;n para 
Defensores de Derechos Humanos, Sujetos Procesales, Periodistas y Comunicadores Sociales 
2007-2017</i>), with five specific objectives: (1) fighting against impunity; (2) improving and 
strengthening human rights protection mechanisms and programmes; (3) promoting a culture of 
human rights; (4) designing and implementing a national plan of action to promote and 
implement the Declaration on human rights defenders; and (5) the establishment of an early 
warning mechanism. 
</p>
<p>59. Among the measures to improve and strengthen protection mechanisms, the policy 
envisages the implementation of a programme of protection measures with a range of possible 
actions to protect defenders with different degrees of intensity based on an assessment of the 
level of risk, threat, or vulnerability. The purpose of the programme is not only to organize 
protection measures in a coherent system but also to offer a standard and transparent service 
without discrimination against or unequal treatment of those in need of protection. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Representative recommends the Government report on how the policy is being 
implemented with a frank analysis of challenges and achievements. It would be interesting to 
receive information on the national plan of action to implement the Declaration on human rights 
defenders. Considering that 2008 is the tenth anniversary of the Declaration, renewed efforts to 
promote its implementation should be made known at the international level. In its dialogue with 
the current mandate holder, the Government could also provide information on the early warning 
mechanism and how it is working, with an evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Representative identified two main challenges facing COPREDEH and 
SEPAZ as the two government institutions with a human rights mandate. On the one hand, they 
have to integrate the human rights agenda in overall government action. A human rights 
programme within a specialized institution will not bring about the change needed to improve 
the human rights situation of the country. Ministries such as the Ministries of Interior, Justice, 
Finance, Labour, Education to name a few, are key to implementing a human rights agenda, 
which will also have to permeate the actions of the other State powers, namely the judiciary and 
the Congress. Are COPREDEH and SEPAZ in a position to be the engine of the human rights 
agenda? Is the commitment to human rights of the President and of those in high-level positions 
of the executive strong, determined and sustained enough to take the country through the reform 
process and transformation it needs? These are questions that can only be answered with 
reference to the performance of these institutions and by measuring this performance against the 
increase in the level of security of defenders in real terms. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>62. On the other hand, a stronger effort is needed to make remedies and protection known and 
accessible to the individuals in need. While the defenders&#8217; community was overall quite aware of 
the protection measures they could ask for and who to ask them of (leaving aside considerations 
about their effectiveness), outside of the defenders&#8217; circle, i.e. human rights organizations 
organized in networks, other categories of individuals exposed to similar threats and attacks, like 
judges or staff of the Institute for Public Penal Defence, did not know much about COPREDEH 
or the programme of protection measures.

<p>63. The Special Representative was impressed by the achievements of the Office of the 
Ombudsperson in addressing complaints and in gaining people&#8217;s trust. With a convening 
capacity of some one thousand organizations, the Office of the Ombudsperson is a reference for 
Guatemalan civil society and other institutions like the Institute for Public Penal Defence 
(see paragraph 41). In 2007, the Office of the Ombudsperson received some 60,000 complaints 
and indicated it had solved 1,600. There were 179 complaints concerning human rights 
defenders. The Ombudsperson considered that defenders working on the right to truth are 
particularly at risk. 
</p>
<p>64. The Office of the Ombudsperson itself is in the front line of the efforts being made in the 
country on the right to truth, with the gigantic archive of over 70,000 documents concerning 
past crimes that it managed to recover. It is the biggest archive of its kind in Latin America. 
Five attempts to burn the archive have already taken place. The Ombudsperson would like to 
turn the archive into a museum of historic memory and is gathering resources to analyse the 
documents. At the time of the visit, some 200 people had been recruited to go through the 
documents of the archive. Resources gathered were however temporary and mostly coming from 
international donors, which reduces the sustainability of the efforts under way. 
</p>
<p>65. The Ombudsperson is also engaged in efforts aimed at addressing the structural causes of 
impunity and has requested authorization to oversee the functioning of the police and the Office 
of the Attorney-General. The Ombudsperson reported an increase in the resources allocated to 
his office, which were however mainly used in infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>66. Members of staff working in the Office of the Ombudsperson and the Ombudsperson 
himself are often the victims of attacks and threats. The Special Representative has brought some 
of these attacks to the attention of the Government in her communications. In the years between 
her two visits to the country, she sent seven communications on threats and attacks against staff 
of the Office of the Ombudsperson. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The police 
</b></p>
<p>67. Physical protection of human rights defenders, as well as of other individuals under threat, 
is provided by the National Civil Police (PNC). Given the deterioration in the security situation 
of the country, with large numbers of individuals at risk, many of the resources of the police are 
devoted to individual protection, which is often unevenly distributed among the individuals and </p>

<p> A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>population at risk, with more concentration of police protection efforts in rich areas and less in 
highly populated but poorer areas. In addition, the Special Representative was told by defenders 
that protection offered by the police is selective, inefficient and at times is even a cause of 
further risk when the police themselves are believed to be involved in attacks against defenders. 
</p>
<p>68. Defenders noted that police protection is generally given only to defenders whose cases 
have been brought to the attention of the Government through a communication from the Special 
Representative or when the IACHR has requested the provision of protection measures (<i>medidas 
cautelares</i>). While this shows the effectiveness and importance of international and regional 
human rights mechanisms in protecting human rights defenders, it is a concern that defenders at 
risk receive some protection only when there is international pressure. Even when protection is 
provided through the intervention of an international or regional mechanism, the implementation 
of protection measures is often deficient and is resisted by the police or the Ministry of Interior. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Representative was provided with an illustrative case in this respect. In 
May 2003, IACHR requested protection measures for 22 members of the organization HIJOS 
(<i>Hijos por la Identidad y la Justicia contra el Olvido y el Silencio</i>). In June 2003, HIJOS and 
COPREDEH agreed that protection measures would consist of surveillance of the premises of 
the organization undertaken by uniformed PNC police. For the rest of the year, the security 
situation of the organization improved significantly. However, the police reduced their protection 
at the beginning of 2004 and as of March of the same year, a number of attacks occurred. 
Members of the organization were followed, some received death threats, and in June 2004 two 
young men with the same names as HIJOS members were killed. However, in August 2004 a 
COPREDEH report to IACHR recommended protection measures be removed. HIJOS prepared 
a report detailing the attacks and threats that had occurred and managed to have the protection 
measures extended for six more months. In December 2004, the organization informed the police 
of a change of premises taking place in January 2005 and requested the police to protect the new 
premises. On 9 January 2005, the inauguration day of the new premises, the organization was 
searched and documents removed by unknown individuals while the police re-established 
protection measures only on 23 February. In the following months new attacks occurred, 
including an attempted kidnapping of a member of the organization. In view of the deterioration 
in the security situation, HIJOS decided to change its premises again in August 2005 and 
requested COPREDEH and the police to provide protection to the new premises. At the time of 
the visit of the Special Representative, nearly three years later, protection had not yet been 
provided. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Representative was however encouraged by some initiatives recently 
undertaken by the Government to increase police performance and better protection. These 
include the Human Rights Unit of the Criminal Investigation Division of the National Civil 
Police established in January 2008 and the Body for the Analysis of Attacks against Human 
Rights Defenders (see paragraphs 32 and 29 above). The Body is under the responsibility of the 
Vice-Minister for Security and its remit is the analysis of the context and pattern of attacks 
against human rights defenders. It is meant to function for four years and is composed of 
representatives of the Ministry of the Interior, the police, the General Direction for Civil 
Intelligence (DIGICI) and national and international NGOs. The Special Representative was 
pleased to learn that since April 2008, representatives of the Office of the Attorney-General and 
the OHCHR office in Guatemala have also taken part in the work of this entity. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>71. The Ministry of the Interior informed the Special Representative of the efforts being made 
to improve its investigative capacity, including the existence of five investigators specialized in 
investigating attacks against human rights defenders and the training of some 2,000 police staff 
on how to deal with attacks against defenders. 
</p>
<p>72. The police have set up a hotline to respond to attacks and threats against individuals, 
including defenders. The service, which was used at the very beginning, was later rather 
underused by defenders who admitted they could make better use of the hotline and stressed the 
necessity of enhancing the capacity of the police assigned to this service. 
</p>
<p>73. Among the concerns about the flaws in, and weaknesses of, the police, the Special 
Representative calls attention to the absence of an independent oversight mechanism. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Representative shares the view of several of her interlocutors in calling for a 
reform of the police to redress the flaws and weaknesses of the police in a more holistic and 
systematic manner and to address the need to gain the trust of the population, including 
defenders.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  The quest for justice 
1.  The judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>75. &#8220;In Guatemala there is almost total de facto impunity for violations of human rights, 
including those committed against human rights defenders.&#8221; These were the words of the Special 
Representative in 2002.<b>19</b> &#8220;The reported figure of 98 per cent of impunity for attacks against 
human rights defenders makes justice an empty word in Guatemala.&#8221; These were her words after 
her follow-up visit in February 2008. 
</p>
<p>76. While in 2002, the lack of technical means and proper training were indicated as being 
among the causes of the inefficiency of investigations,<b>20</b> in the following years the Office of the 
Attorney-General was given more resources. Despite the increase in resources and the 
establishment of specialized units in the Office of the Attorney-General to facilitate 
investigations, the inaction of prosecutors in investigating and prosecuting cases is disappointing, 
and there is neither a disciplinary system in place to sanction the lack of diligence of public 
prosecutors nor an external oversight mechanism. 
</p>
<p>77. The Human Rights Prosecutor (<i>Fiscal&#237;a de Derechos Humanos</i>) within the Office of the 
Attorney-General is in charge of investigating crimes against human rights defenders. However, 
specialized prosecutors only exist in the capital. For cases which occur outside the capital, the 
</p>

<p> A/HRC/10/12/Add.3

</p>
<p>back and forth of the file between the specialized prosecutor in the capital and those with 
territorial competence is a factor impeding investigations. Despite monthly meetings and internal 
decisions to improve collaboration between the police and prosecutors, poor coordination 
between the two institutions remains a problem, as it was in 2002.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>78. Witness protection is a major concern. &#8220;In this country we will never succeed with 
impunity if we do not protect witnesses&#8221;, said the Ombudsperson. Despite the fact that the law 
on witness protection is deficient, investigations are still heavily and mainly based on witnesses 
and not on technical evidence. 
</p>
<p>79. Judges investigating sensitive human rights cases are often threatened and exposed to 
attacks by the media, which is largely controlled by parallel powers. This makes them vulnerable 
to further violence while the security measures for their protection are often inadequate. Judges 
in the first instance based outside the capital and peace judges are the least well protected. 
</p><p>80. In this discouraging panorama, the Constitutional Court disappointed hopes for justice in 
an emblematic decision adopted in December 2007. The Court denied the extradition request 
formulated by the Spanish judiciary to try in Spain five people accused of having committed 
terrorism, murder and kidnapping during the armed conflict. Without entering into the merit of 
the decision of the Constitutional Court, the Special Representative regrets that, in a country in 
such urgent need of signals against impunity as Guatemala, the Constitutional Court did not seize 
the opportunity of sending such a signal by interpreting the Constitution as an instrument that 
can provide justice instead of denying it. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) 
</b>81. An agreement between the Government and the United Nations, which entered into force 
in September 2007, led to the establishment of the International Commission against Impunity in 
Guatemala (<i>Comisi&#243;n International Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala</i>, CICIG). 
</p>
<p>82. CICIG is functionally an independent entity assisting national institutions in the 
investigation and prosecution of crimes allegedly committed by illegal security forces and 
clandestine security organizations. 
</p>
<p>83. CICIG is not an independent prosecutor but has the power to prompt the initiation of 
criminal prosecutions by filing criminal complaints with the relevant authorities, with the 
possibility of joining a criminal proceeding as a private prosecutor (<i>querellante adhesivo</i>). Legal 
action remains a prerogative of the public prosecutor, however CICIG can request the removal of 
public prosecutors who do not collaborate with it. 
</p>
<p>84. The participation and involvement of civil society and human rights defenders are 
fundamental to achieving the daunting objective of CICIG to pursue a few emblematic cases that 
would have a domino effect in breaking the vicious cycle of impunity. Witness protection is 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>21
</b>  Ibid., para. 67. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>another essential component of this endeavour that requires the support of the international 
community. A number of agreements on witness protection with third countries have been 
signed and others are on the way. 
</p>
<p>85. Finally and most importantly, the collaboration and will of the national political and 
institutional environment are fundamental for enabling CICIG to make a meaningful attempt to 
fight impunity. The success of CICIG would not benefit Guatemala only but could become a 
model for other countries in the region and in post-conflict contexts. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Representative is deeply concerned at the deterioration in the security 
situation of human rights defenders and the pervasive impunity affecting the vital 
functions of democracy and the rule of law. She considers that the situation of human 
rights defenders and of human rights more broadly is unlikely to improve without a clear 
turning point on impunity. For this reason, a number of her recommendations go beyond 
the specific situation of human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Representative has recognized some progress since her first visit in 2002, 
namely: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The well organized community of human rights defenders and their ability to 
establish and coordinate mechanisms for self-protection, including the NGO Unit for the 
Protection of Human Rights Defenders; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The achievements of the Office of the Ombudsperson in addressing complaints 
and in gaining people&#8217;s trust; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The establishment of the International Commission against Impunity in 
Guatemala (CICIG), tasked with the investigation of crimes allegedly committed by illegal 
security forces and clandestine security organizations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations for the consideration of the Government 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Turn the commitment to human rights into a political agenda permeating 
Government action with specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound 
(SMART) objectives on the achievement of which the Government holds itself accountable. 
</b>89. <b>Adopt a policy on the protection of human rights defenders in consultation with 
human rights defenders and relevant stakeholders. Report on its implementation, including 
on the programme of protection measures, to relevant human rights mechanisms, such as 
the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Take concrete and visible steps to give political recognition and legitimacy to the 
work of human rights defenders. This can be done by firmly condemning attacks against 
defenders and by acknowledging the importance of their work. </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/10/12/Add.3 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p>91. <b>Institutionalize consultation processes between the Government and civil society 
organizations on relevant areas of Government action. For human rights matters, 
COPREDEH should ease access of civil society organizations and human rights defenders 
to Government structures and facilitate consultations. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Ensure coordination among institutions responsible for the investigation of cases, 
particularly between the police and the Office of the Attorney-General. The Body for the 
Analysis of Attacks against Human Rights Defenders is an appropriate mechanism to this 
end, if all concerned institutions and organizations participate in, and contribute to, its 
work. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Undertake a comprehensive reform of measures and protocols for witness protection. 
The recommendations made by OHCHR in this respect can guide the reform process.22</b> 
<b>Ensure the inclusion of protection measures for human rights defenders acting as witnesses 
or supporting witnesses in judicial proceedings. 
</b>94. <b>Undertake reform of the police tackling its flaws and weaknesses, including the need 
to gain the trust of the population. Establish a functioning oversight mechanism. The 
advisory services of OHCHR and other human rights actors and mechanisms should be 
sought to support the reform process. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Take measures to ensure and monitor the full collaboration of relevant institutions, 
particularly the Office of the Attorney-General, in the implementation of the 
recommendations and findings of the Ombudsperson and CICIG. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Provide the Institute for Public Penal Defence with protection for staff under threat 
and with adequate resources to carry out its important institutional mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Provide the Ombudsperson with adequate resources and political support to maintain 
and process the archive of documents on past crimes and to make its information 
accessible. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations for the consideration of the parliament, particularly the  
Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Make concrete efforts to acknowledge and value the work of defenders through 
public statements and become a source of political and institutional support for them. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Institutionalize consultations with civil society and human rights organizations when 
drafting and debating human rights legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Collaborate more actively with institutions with a human rights mandate, such as 
COPREDEH and the Ombudsperson.

</p>
<p><b>Recommendations for the consideration of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Strengthen networks and coalitions of defenders both within and outside the country 
to enhance the protection that defenders can provide to each other through these networks. 
Maintain an inclusive approach to the notion of &#8220;who defends human rights&#8221;. Staff of the 
Institute for Public Penal Defence and some judges working on human rights cases face 
similar risks and attacks to those suffered by human rights organizations. Coordination of 
strategies with them, including on self-protection initiatives, can be of mutual benefit. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Seek and use all available opportunities to participate and be consulted in 
decision-making processes of public institutions, including approaching the Commission on 
Human Rights of the Congress. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations for the consideration of the international community 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Continue monitoring the situation of human rights defenders and express support for 
their work through, inter alia, the interventions of international and regional human rights 
mechanisms, the work of the OHCHR office in Guatemala, and the actions envisaged in the 
European Union Guidelines on human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Special Representative welcomes the inclusion of a number of recommendations 
addressing the situation of human rights defenders made by member States of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the Human Rights Council on the 
occasion of the review of Guatemala under this new mechanism.23 While further efforts are 
needed to improve the quality and consistency of recommendations, the commitment of 
member States to thoroughly monitor the situation of human rights defenders in the 
framework of the UPR is a meaningful contribution to improve their situation.
