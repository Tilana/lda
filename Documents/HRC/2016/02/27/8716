<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to the Human Rights Council resolution 8/12, the Special Rapporteur is 
mandated to respond effectively to reliable information on alleged human rights violations 
with a view to protecting the human rights of actual or potential victims of trafficking.  This 
addendum sets out summaries of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur from 1 
January 2009 to 31 March 2010. It also includes summaries of Government replies received 
from 1 January 2009 to 10 May 2010. Government replies received after 10 May 2010 will 
be included in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s next communications report to the Human Rights 
Council.  
</p>
<p>2. For reasons of confidentiality, privacy and protection, the names of victims appear 
only in initials in this report.  The Special Rapporteur has also used initials for certain other 
persons concerned in order to minimise the risk of possible further victimization.  
Moreover, with a view to preserve the presumption of innocence, only initials are used for 
the names of alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, nine communications were sent to seven countries 
in total.  The overview of these communications is provided in the table in Section II.  Eight 
of the communications were sent jointly with: the Special Rapporteur on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes 
and consequences, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders.  
The Special Rapporteur received five replies to the communications as of 10 May 2010 and 
regrets that she still has not received replies to the remaining 4 communications.  The 
Special Rapporteur wishes to recall the obligations of the Governments under the Human 
Rights Council resolution 8/12 to provide her with all the necessary information related to 
the mandate to enable her to fulfil the mandate effectively, and urges the Governments to 
submit replies to her communications in a timely manner to this end.   
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur received increasing information on child trafficking and 
some of the communications sent during this period concerned trafficking of children for 
the purpose of forced labour.  A pattern of trafficking of women for the purpose of sexual 
exploitation was also reported to the Special Rapporteur and communicated to the 
Governments concerned.  Further, the Special Rapporteur observed that the lack of 
effective remedies for victims of trafficking seemed to be a common problem.   
</p>
<p>5. In framing her interventions in these cases, the Special Rapporteur was guided by 
the legal framework and principles set out in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (&#8220;the Protocol&#8221;), other international 
human rights instruments, as well as the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking, launched by the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights in July 2002 (&#8220;Recommended Principles and Guidelines&#8221;).  She 
frequently recalled paragraph 1, article 9 of the Protocol, which provides that: &#8220;States 
Parties shall establish comprehensive policies, programmes and other measures: (a) To 
prevent and combat trafficking in persons; and (b) To protect victims of trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, from revictimization&#8221;.  She also referred to 
paragraph 3, article 6 of the Protocol, which is the key provision in ensuring that the States 
Parties provide adequate assistance to victims of trafficking in rehabilitation and 
reintegration.  It provides that: &#8220;Each State Party shall consider implementing measures to 
provide for the physical, psychological and social recovery of victims of trafficking in 
persons, including, in appropriate cases, in cooperation with non-governmental </p>

<p>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>organizations, other relevant organizations and other elements of civil society, and, in 
particular, the provision of: (a) Appropriate housing; (b) Counselling and information, in 
particular as regards their legal rights, in a language that the victims of trafficking in 
persons can understand; (c) Medical, psychological and material assistance; and (d) 
Employment, educational and training opportunities&#8221;.  In addition, the Special Rapporteur 
often recalled paragraph 7, guideline 5 of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines, 
which provides that States should consider: &#8220;Sensitizing police, prosecutors, border, 
immigration and judicial authorities, and social and public health workers to the problem of 
trafficking and ensuring the provision of specialized training in identifying trafficking 
cases, combating trafficking and protecting the rights of victims&#8221;.  Where the 
communications concerned allegations of trafficking in children, the Special Rapporteur 
often stressed paragraph 2, guideline 8 of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines, 
which recommends States to consider: &#8220;Ensuring that procedures are in place for the rapid 
identification of child victims of trafficking&#8221;.

</p>
<p><b>  India 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication of 21 January 2009  
</b></p>
<p>7. By letter dated 21 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, its causes and consequences, sent a letter of 
allegation to the Government of India concerning two separate cases: the first case 
concerned allegations that a 16 year old girl, L, was kidnapped, abused and sold to a brothel 
to work as prostitute.  The second case concerned a 15 year old girl, A, who was allegedly 
kidnapped and trafficked into sexual exploitation. In both cases, it was reported that the 
police did not conduct effective investigations despite the fact that complaints were 
submitted.   
</p>
<p>8. According to the information received, on 3 September 2006, a friend of L&#8217;s, N, 
took L to meet P and A, also residents of Mohalla, Munshipura.  The victim was reportedly 
given an intoxicating substance and kidnapped by P and A.  She was then taken to an 
unknown place where P, A, and other people beat, threatened and raped her. They allegedly 
filmed this incident and took photographs, threatening the victim that they will distribute 
this material in the Mau district, and to kill her if she reported the facts to anyone.  
</p>
<p>9. L was allegedly moved by her traffickers to Shivdaspur, Manduadih Police Station, 
Varanasi where she was sold to a woman, A.B. for INR 30,000 (USD 648) by P, A, N and 
others.  A.B. kept L in the brothel she runs in the red light district. L was forced into 
prostitution and pornography by A.B. and her associates by means of physical and 
psychological violence, including: burning with a hot rod; beating; gang-raping; using 
abusive language; threatening to kill her; and providing food only once a day or none when 
her earnings where not deemed sufficient.  Any earnings were taken by A.B. and the rest of 
the group for their own use and as punishment for no earnings she was forced to go without 
food. 
</p>
<p>10. During this captivity, L became pregnant and gave birth to a child, which exposed 
her to harsher violence, due to the reduced income she would generate for the brothel. L 
managed to get help to escape from a regular customer, and on the morning of 17 June 
2008, she fled from the brothel and was able to reach her mother&#8217;s house.  
</p>
<p>11. It was reported that a First Information Report (Case No. 769/06) was recorded at 
Kotwali Police Station, Mau district on 4 November 2006; allegedly the Police took no 
action.  After her escape on 17 June 2008, L and her mother wrote a letter to the District 
Magistrate of Mau &#8211; Receipt No. EU 400010193 IN &#8211; and to the Superintendent of Police, 
Mau &#8211; Receipt No. EU 400010202 IN &#8211; and to the Station House Officer of Kotwali, Mau &#8211; 
Receipt No. EU 400010180 IN &#8211; on 9 July 2008. These letters were aimed at having L&#8217;s 
statement recorded by the Information Officer and the Magistrate, which it seemed they did 
not manage to achieve.  It was moreover reported that no action, investigation or arrests 
were made by the police at Kotwali station despite the notoriety of the brothel-owners and 
human traffickers involved in this case, and despite the Indian Penal Code which includes a 
number of relevant prohibitions. 
</p>
<p>12. In the red-light district of Shivadspur (Varanasi), A.B., P, A, J, and T are reportedly 
well-known for kidnapping girls through fake marriage, intoxication or simply through 
force; girls are then sold to brothels where they are forced to work as prostitutes and for the 
production of pornographic material (known as blue films).  
</p>
<p>13. The second case concerned the abduction of a 15 year-old girl, A., who was taken to 
Varanasi and sold by human traffickers for sexual exploitation. According to the 
information received, A was reported missing in March 2008.  After A went missing, her </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>family gathered information on what had happened the day she disappeared:  apparently, 
while A. was on her way to Dudhi from Jorukhand village, she was taken by an auto 
rickshaw driver from Ramnagar village to Dudhi. From there she was taken by another auto 
rickshaw driver and sold in the Ramnagar area of Varanasi district.  The family was 
informed that their daughter was being forcibly held in the Ramnagar area of Varanasi 
district, an area notorious for the presence of brothels and the endemic trafficking of 
women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  
</p>
<p>14. Allegedly A's father tried to lodge a complaint at the Vindhamganj Police Station 
about his missing child but the police refused to cooperate; no investigation or other action 
was taken on the part of the police. It was reported that on 27 August 2008, he sought help 
to find his daughter from NGOs and the representative of Babhni block. Together they took 
the initiative to ask the people in the Jorukhand village for any clue, and apparently they 
traced the brothel where A was suspected to be held captive. 
</p>
<p>15. On 30 August 2008, a rescue operation located A in a brothel at 3/120 Rattapur, 
Ramnagar, Varanasi.  When the rescuers entered the house, they found that there were five 
other girls also held in the house along with A. Three of these girls were from the 
Chhattisgarh state and two were from Varanasi. The brothel keeper and his 'manager' from 
Chhattisgarh state, were arrested during the rescue operation. 
</p>
<p>16. The First Information Report (FIR) (No. 195/08) was lodged at the Ramnagar Police 
Station, Varanasi under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (ITP), 1956. Apparently this 
case was registered against the brothels keeper and manager, as well as the five girls who 
were rescued from the house.  According to the information received, the police named the 
five girls along with the actual criminals with an intention to undermine the prosecution of 
the actual culprits in the case.  This was allegedly due to the fact that prostitution in 
Varanasi is a business carried out with the blessings of the local police.  The police was 
also said not to have been serious enough in the investigation of A&#8217;s case, as they had not 
tried to identify those who were connected with the brothel keeper and manager in their 
alleged human trafficking activities. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government whether the facts alleged in the 
summary of the cases were accurate, and also whether complaints had been lodged by or on 
behalf of the alleged victims. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteurs then requested details, and where available results, of any 
investigation, judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to 
these cases. If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have been inconclusive, the Special 
Rapporteurs requested the Government to explain why.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteurs also inquired whether the victims or the families of the 
victims had access to adequate procedures of compensation for damages from those legally 
responsible.  The Special Rapporteurs further requested information on the current policies 
and the preventive and awareness raising measures taken to tackle the issue of human 
trafficking in Uttar Pradesh, particularly in the Varanasi area, as well as information on the 
measures taken to ensure L&#8217;s safety, protection, rehabilitation and reintegration.  
</p>
<p>20. In relation to A&#8217;s case, the Special Rapporteurs requested full details of the 
prosecutions undertaken in relation to her case and asked whether any action had been 
taken in order to have the names of five girls who were rescued along with A removed from 
the list of accused in FIR 195/08 of Ramnagar Police Station, as per the Immoral Traffic 
Prevention Act.  Finally, the Special Rapporteurs requested information on the measures 
taken to ensure A&#8217;s safety, protection, rehabilitation and reintegration. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of 14 July 2009  
</b></p>
<p>21. By letter dated 14 July 2009, the Government of India replied to the communication 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on 21 July 2009.  In response, the Government stated that 
the matter was investigated in March 2007 and a charge sheet was produced in the court in 
June 2007.  Upon the return of L in June 2008, the matter was investigated and the victim&#8217;s 
testimony against A.B. was recorded and filed in the court.  According to the Government, 
the matter was<i> sub judice </i>and a petition to obtain non-bailable warrants against the accused 
was under the consideration at the time of the reply.   
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the reply of the Government of India.  She 
regrets, however, that the reply did not provide any information on the second case 
concerning A.  The Special Rapporteur remains interested in receiving further information 
about these two cases, including the outcome of the trial which was proceeding at the time 
of the reply.     
</p>
<p><b>  Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication of 20 October 2009  
</b></p>
<p>23. By letter dated 20 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government of Kazakhstan concerning an Uzbek boy who was trafficked to Kazakhstan to 
work in a forced labour situation and whose whereabouts were unknown.  
</p>
<p>24. According to the information received, B.I., aged 17, is a resident of the Khiva town 
of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan.  In May 2008, B.I. and four young Uzbek men were 
recruited by B.B., a citizen of Uzbekistan aged 56, to travel to Kazakhstan as labor 
migrants.  B.B. promised them and their parents that he would take care of their 
employment in Kazakhstan.  He also assured them that being the oldest in the group, he 
would look after the young men during their stay in Kazakhstan.  
</p>
<p>25. Upon their arrival in Kazakhstan, the young men were taken to a house of N.M., 
located in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast.  B.B. received $5,000 from N.M. in 
exchange of the young men and handed over their passports to N.M. before he disappeared.  
The young men were forced to carry out a variety of work in N.M.&#8217;s house, including 
construction work.  They were forced to work under harsh conditions and without 
appropriate food and compensation.  Approximately two months after the young men left 
for Kazakhstan, B.B. appeared in Khiva.  B.I.&#8217;s mother went to see B.B. to ask how her son 
was.  B.B. assured the mother that all the young men were well and that they would soon be 
sending money they earned in Kazakhstan.  However, B.I.&#8217;s mother never heard from her 
son, as all the young men were not given any opportunity to contact their families in 
Uzbekistan.  The young men except B.I. eventually managed to escape the house and return 
to Khiva.        
</p>
<p>26. In December 2008, B.I.&#8217;s mother lodged an appeal to the Department of Internal 
Affairs in the Khiva district and to the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 
Uzbekistan to search for her son.  However, she did not receive any responses from the 
authorities.  Concerned for her son&#8217;s safety and desperate to find him, she travelled to 
N.M.&#8217;s house in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast on 12 June 2009.  When she arrived at 
N.M.&#8217;s house, he shouted at her in the Kazakh language, throwing the passports of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>young Uzbek men who were forced to work in his house.  He told her that B.I. was taken 
by a Police Major from Shimkent city in Yuzhno-Kazakhstanskaya oblast. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government to verify the accuracy of the facts 
alleged in the summary. They also requested the Government to provide the full details of 
any actions or measures undertaken to identify the whereabouts of B.I. and to ensure his 
safety and protection.  They further asked whether complaints were lodged by or on behalf 
of the alleged victims against N.M.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteurs also requested the Government to provide the details of any 
actions taken against N.M. in his alleged involvement in the crime of trafficking as well as 
the details of any actions taken to ascertain the identity of the Police Major and his role in 
the trafficking and disappearance of B.I., and in particular whether B.I. was being held in 
captivity by him. 
</p>
<p>29. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide the 
details, and where available the results, of any other investigation, judicial or other inquiries 
which may have been carried out in relation to this case.  They also requested information 
on the details of any measures or actions undertaken by the Embassy of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan in Uzbekistan in response to the appeal submitted by B.I.&#8217;s mother and whether 
the victims or the families of the victims had access to adequate procedures of 
compensation for damages from those legally responsible.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteurs asked information on the current policies and the 
preventive and awareness raising measures taken to tackle the issue of human trafficking in 
Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast, Kazakhstan. They also asked information on whether 
law enforcement agencies, especially the Police, Immigration, Border Guards and Labour 
Inspectors, had received appropriate training on identification of victims of trafficking and 
protection of their human rights. Finally, the Special Rapporterus requested the 
Government to provide statistical information on prosecution of cases of trafficking in 
court, including the number of cases in which conviction was secured.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of 20 December 2009 
</b></p>
<p>31. On 20 December 2010, the Government replied to the communication sent on 20 
October 2009, highlighting that the internal affairs organs of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
were conducting investigations in order to ascertain the facts regarding the economic 
exploitation of a citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan by N.M., a citizen of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan. With a view to making a thorough and objective appraisal of the evidence and 
issuing a procedural ruling, the Office of the Procurator and the Department of Internal 
Affairs of the province of Kyzylorda were preparing a request to the law enforcement 
agencies of the Republic of Uzbekistan that they question B.I. in order to fully clarify the 
circumstances of the case. 
</p>
<p>32. The Government also highlighted that the Criminal Police Committee of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan received an application from a human rights 
group based in Khorezm for assistance in the search for B.I. It further added that the 
internal affairs agencies of Kazakhstan spearheaded the hunt for the missing person by 
undertaking criminal investigations and inquiries, and medical establishments likewise 
made some checks in an endeavour to establish his whereabouts. 
</p>
<p>33. In its response, the Government informed that pursuant to paragraph 27 of the 
Instruction concerning a unified procedure for conducting interstate searches for persons, 
which was approved by the decision of the Council of Ministers of Internal Affairs of the 
States Parties of the Commonwealth of Independent States of 7 September 2007, the above-
mentioned application was forwarded to the Central Department for Criminal Investigation 
and Counterterrorism of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan with a view to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>initiating investigations and an international search for B.I. It further highlighted that the 
staff of the internal affairs agencies of Kazakhstan again contacted the human rights group 
in order to exchange information on B.I&#8217;s whereabouts. According to the letter from the 
human rights group dated 3 December 2009, B.I. was then at home. 
</p>
<p>34. The Government also informed that in May 2008, B.B. approached N.M. in order to 
propose the services of his 10-person &#8220;team&#8221; to work on building sites &#8211; to which N.M. 
agreed. In June 2008, B.B. and his building team, minus B.I. who was then at another 
N.M.&#8217;s building site, received the sum of US$3,000 and vanished without completing the 
building. B.I. stayed on for two to three months.  
</p>
<p>35. During that time, he regularly spoke to his parents by telephone. He received food 
and clothing and did odd jobs. They did not subject him to pressure or force. In the autumn 
of 2008, B.I. left the house and did not return. N.M. tried in vain to find him. In the spring 
of 2009, B.I&#8217;s mother came to the town of Kyzylorda to search for her son. On meeting her, 
N.M. explained that B.I. had worked for him and lived at his house, but that he did not 
possess any information regarding his current whereabouts. B.I. did not lay a complaint 
with law enforcement agencies regarding any unlawful actions on the part of N.M or 
officials of the Department of Internal Affairs of South Kazakhstan or the province of 
Kyzylorda.  
</p>
<p>36. The Government also provided information and contact details of the Police Major 
and highlighted that no information was available about any investigations, judicial or other 
inquiries in relation to this case. According to information supplied by the Embassy of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan in Uzbekistan, it did not receive any complaints or applications 
from B.I.&#8217;s mother, or anyone else, in connection with this case at any point in 2008. 
</p>
<p>37. The Government also referred to some of the provisions of the code of criminal 
procedure, notably article 163 and 162, paragraphs 1 and 2 and described the governmental 
structure in place to deal with human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>38. In its response, the Government also highlighted that it was gradually implementing 
plans to combat and prevent crimes related to human smuggling and have launched 
information campaigns to counter human trafficking.  It further informed that in 2009, as a 
result of the latest steps, anti-trafficking units initiated criminal proceedings in 265 cases. 
The Government also provided extensive information on the activities and programmes 
being implemented in its territory. 
</p>
<p>39. Finally, the Government informed that according to the statistical data supplied by 
the Legal Statistics Committee and in particular by the Office of the Procurator General on 
enforceable sentences for crimes under article 128 of the Criminal Code (human 
trafficking), the number of convictions was as follows: in 2007, three persons; in 2008, five 
persons; and in the first nine months of 2009, five persons. The number of convictions for 
crimes under article 133 of the Criminal Code (trafficking in minors) was as follows: in 
2007, three persons; in 2008, one person; and in the first nine months of 2009, six persons. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed response provided by the 
Government of Kazakhstan and commends its efforts in successfully locating B.I. who was 
missing at the time.  The Special Rapporteur regrets, however, that the reply did not include 
sufficient information concerning any actions against the citizens of Kazakhstan who were 
potentially implicated in the disappearance and trafficking of B.I.  The Special Rapporteur 
continues to monitor the situation in the country, particularly the implementation of the 
plan of action to combat and prevent human trafficking.     </p>

<p><b>  Mexico 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication of 30 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>41. By letter dated 30 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government of M&#233;xico concerning children missing from Mexican care 
institutions run by a Christian organization called &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada Cristiana&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>42. According to the information received, J.C.C.B. (10 years old), A.G.C.B. (13 years 
old); and D.L.B.H. (12 years old), were missing from the institution named &#8220;Centro de 
Adaptaci&#243;n e Integraci&#243;n Familiar A.C.&#8221; (&#8220;CAIFAC&#8221;), located in San Nicol&#225;s de los Garza, 
Nuevo Le&#243;n, M&#233;xico.  I.M.C.M. (10 years old when entering the centre in 2007), J.A. (1 
year old when entering the centre in 2007) and the brothers A.I.J.O., N.I.J.O. and H.M.J.O. 
(respectively 15, 13 and 11 years old when entering the centre in 2006), were missing from 
the institution &#8220;Casitas del Sur&#8221; in San Pedro M&#224;rtir and in San Miguel Xicot&#233;ncatl, in 
Tlalpan, Distrito Federal.  
</p>
<p>43. Concerning the situation occurring in CAIFAC, J.C.C.B. and A.G.C.B. have been in 
the custody of this centre since they were 1 year old and 2 years old respectively. Their 
mother was very poor and did not have any means to support her children, except to beg on 
the street.  P.M., the director of CAIFAC, found them on the street and offered to take the 
children, assuring the mother that she could go and visit them anytime.  Similarly, 
D.L.B.H.&#8217;s mother did not have any financial resources to support her. Thus she left 
D.L.B.H. with CAIFAC in 2006, so that she could be properly taken care of.   
</p>
<p>44. The whereabouts of the children were unknown.  The mothers saw their children last 
in July 2008 and had been denied access to them since then, despite their requests on 
several occasions.  In December 2008, the mothers of the children presented a complaint 
against CAIFAC before the &#8220;Agencia del Ministerio P&#250;blico Especializado en Justicia 
Familiar&#8221; (the District Attorney&#180;s Office Specialized on Family Justice) for denying access 
to their children. While the District Attorney&#8217;s Office apparently interviewed P.M., the said 
Office did not order CAIFAC to allow the mothers to see their children.   
</p>
<p>45. There were concerns with respect to the welfare of these children, particularly in 
light of the allegation that B.C.B.H., who is D.L.B.H&#8217;s sister, and other children in the 
custody of CAIFAC were locked in a wardrobe with their hands tied and forced to eat 
rotten food as a punishment, after B.C.B.H. unsuccessfully attempted to escape from 
CAIFAC.  
</p>
<p>46. Concerning the situation occurring in Casitas del Sur, Distrito Federal, it was 
reported that the children held in that centre have been subjected to ill-treatment. In 
particular, they were allegedly beaten, left without food for 1 or 2 days, closed in dark 
rooms or in closets for up to 2 days, and prevented from seeing their parents. 
</p>
<p>47. Following an order of apprehension issued by a local judge, 116 children were 
rescued from two institutions in San Pedro M&#224;rtir and in San Miguel Xicot&#233;ncatl, in 
Tlalpan on 29 January 2009. However, 11 minors were missing from these centers, 
including the five minors mentioned above. Their parents or family members had 
previously gotten back the legal custody on the children through a judicial order, but the 
director of the centre, E.C.M., had repeatedly refused to hand over the children. She told the 
father of the three missing brothers A.I.J.O., N.I.J.O. and H.M.J.O., that he would not get 
his children back and asked him to sign papers that authorized her to adopt his children, 
which he refused to do. The whereabouts of the missing children were still unknown.  
</p>
<p>48. According to the father, his three sons were initially handed to a temporary centre of 
the Procuradur&#237;a general de Justicia del Distrito Federal (PGJDF), the Public Prosecution </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>Office of the Federal District. However, later on the parents realized that two weeks later 
their children were transferred to Casitas del Sur, without their consent and without being 
informed of the transfer. Also, the father applied for permission to visit his children, but he 
was not allowed to do so for 6 months because the granting of the authorization was 
delayed by the responsible officers of Agency 5-B of the PGJDF, who also refused to give 
him information about his children. The responsibilities of these two PGJDF officers in 
delaying the visits and withholding information, and of the director and attorney of the 
PGJDF centre, in relation to the transfer of the children to Casitas del Sur, had still not been 
clarified. 
</p>
<p>49. It was reported that the care institutions founded by &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada Cristiana&#8221;, 
including CAIFAC and &#8220;Casitas del Sur&#8221;, have been implicated in the disappearance of 
children across Mexico. Moreover, according to testimonies of some of the children who 
have been rescued from the &#8220;Casitas del Sur&#8221;, a man accompanied by foreigners repeatedly 
came to the centre and took away children who never came back. Also according to a 
former member of the &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada Cristiana&#8221;, the disappearance of minors has been 
a reality for many years because the members of the congregation &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada 
Cristiana&#8221; were just taking some children of their liking without papers or following any 
adoption procedures.  
</p>
<p>50. In this connection, the &#8220;Subprocuradur&#237;a de Investigaci&#243;n Especializada en 
Delincuencia Organizada&#8221; (the Agency of Specialized Investigation on Organized 
Delinquency, under the umbrella of the Federal Attorney&#8217;s Office) commenced 
investigation of the case for the crime of organized delinquency and trafficking.  On 16 
August 2009, a Federal Judge signed an order of apprehension against three individuals &#8211; 
namely, the director of &#8220;Casitas del Sur&#8221;, the preacher of &#8220;Iglesia Restaurada Cristiana&#8221;, 
and an English teacher.  The order against P.M. was issued but not executed, as she 
apparently fled the country.  According to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, these individuals 
were suspected of trafficking and executing an illegal transfer of children to overseas 
without the consent of their parents.  In particular, they were implicated in the 
disappearance and trafficking of 14 children, including the three above named children 
missing from CAIFAC. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government whether the facts alleged in the 
summary were accurate.  The Special Rapporteurs then requested full details of the 
progress of the prosecutions undertaken against E.C., A.E.C.C., L.A.C., and P.M.  They 
also requested the Government to provide details, and where available results, of any other 
investigation, judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to this 
case, including in relation to officers of the PGJDF.   
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteurs further requested full details of any action undertaken to 
verify whether the children were in the custody of CAIFAC or Casitas del Sur, or, if they 
were missing, to identify the whereabouts of the missing children.  They also requested 
information on: the preventive measures taken to ensure that competent oversight of care 
institutions for minors in Mexico was exercised (including regular controls of the facilities 
and verifications that visits by parents were regularly allowed) in order to ensure the safety 
and protection of children in the custody of these institutions; measures or steps taken to 
ensure that parents and legal guardians were provided with appropriate assistance in raising 
children in a manner which respects and promotes the rights of children as enshrined in the 
CRC; and the current policies and the preventive and awareness raising measures taken to 
tackle the issue of human trafficking and sale of children in Mexico. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteurs finally asked the Government to indicate whether the 
families of the victims had access to adequate procedures of compensation for damages 
from those legally responsible. </p>

<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Mexico has not provided a 
reply to the communication to date.  The Special Rapporteur therefore calls upon the 
Government to provide information as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p><b>  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication of 9 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>55. By letter dated 9 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent a letter of 
allegation to the Government concerning 988 Pakistani children who were previously 
trafficked to the United Arab Emirates as child camel jockeys and have not received 
compensation to date. 
</p>
<p>56. According to information received, Rahimyar Khan District of Punjab Province, 
Pakistan, is said to be the leading source district for children who were trafficked for the 
purpose of camel racing in the Gulf States.  According to the research conducted by Save 
the Children Sweden in June 2004, it was estimated that approximately 15,000 children 
from the Rahimyar Khan District were trafficked as camel jockeys to the Gulf States, most 
notably to the United Arab Emirates (&#8220;UAE&#8221;).  It was reported that most of the children 
were sold to traffickers by their parents, who were very poor and lured to promises that 
their children would earn significant profits for their families as camel jockeys.  Reports 
also indicated that there were other groups of individuals who kidnapped children and sold 
them to the trafficking mafia.  The trafficked children were reportedly treated in an 
inhumane manner and suffered from physical injuries as well as from psychological trauma.  
They were kept in camel farms for 24 hours a day and were not allowed to leave the farms 
except when they took the camels out for exercise.  The living conditions in the farms were 
harsh in that the children slept on the ground and were poorly fed so that their weight was 
kept under 20 kilograms, which is deemed as the maximum optimal weight for camel 
jockeying.  They were also often subject to sexual abuse and beating, including electric 
shocks.  They were made to work from dawn until dusk, and constantly faced risks of death 
or serious injuries during the race.   
</p>
<p>57. Since 2005, the UAE intensified its efforts in eradicating the use of child camel 
jockeys and signed an agreement with United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (&#8220;UNICEF&#8221;) on 7 
May 2005 to repatriate child camel jockeys to their country of origin and to assist in their 
rehabilitation and reintegration.  With respect to the former child camel jockeys from 
Pakistan, the Ministry of Interior of the UAE and the Overseas Pakistani Division of the 
Ministry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis of the Republic of Pakistan 
reportedly established a Claims Settlement Facility in accordance with the Memorandum of 
Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) on 25 April 2007 to hear and determine individual claims of 
physical and non-physical injury by former child camel jockeys.  The Claims Settlement 
Facility is administered by an Administrative Board, which consists of two members 
appointed by the Government of Pakistan and one appointed by the Ministry of Interior of 
the Government of the UAE.   
</p>
<p>58. According to the information received, the Claims Settlement Facility allegedly 
failed to provide former child camel jockeys with compensation.  Firstly, it was alleged that 
the former child camel jockeys were not well-informed about the existence of the Claims 
Settlement Facility.  A newspaper notice about the offer of financial relief to former child 
camel jockeys by the Government of the UAE reportedly appeared in Daily Khabrian in 
Multan on 13 May 2008 and on 23 June 2008, and in Daily Dawn in Lahore on 24 June 
2008 respectively.  It was alleged that these notices did not serve their purpose, as most of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>the former child camel jockeys are illiterate and live in remote areas where these 
newspapers do not reach.  Secondly, while the Administrative Board was required under the 
MOU to designate one or more NGO(s) to extend legal or other assistance to the claimants 
to submit claims, the Administrative Board assigned the tasks to the Child Protection and 
Welfare Bureau of the Government of Punjab, whose officers were allegedly not properly 
trained to assist the claimants.  There were allegations that the officers failed to consider 
claims in light of all evidence available.  According to the information received, there are 
currently 988 former child camel jockeys whose claims are still pending and have not been 
provided compensation.   
</p>
<p>59. On 18 September 2009, a complaint about the ineffectiveness of the Claims 
Settlement Facility was submitted to the Secretary of the Social Welfare and Women 
Development Department, Government of Punjab, Lahore.  The complaint was also 
reportedly submitted to the following Ministries and Government departments on 28 
September 2009:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Secretary, Ministry of Labour &amp; Overseas Pakistanis, Government of Pakistan, 
Islamabad; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Secretary, Ministry of Social Welfare &amp; Special Education, Government of 
Pakistan, Islamabad;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Director General, UAE Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of 
Pakistan, Islamabad;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Director General, Federal Investigation Agency, Government of Pakistan, 
Islamabad;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Secretary, Home Department, Government of Punjab, Lahore; and  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Director General, Child Protection &amp; Welfare Bureau, Government of Punjab, 
Lahore.  
</p>
<p> It was alleged that these Ministries and Government departments have not taken any 
action about the complaint. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteurs asked whether the facts alleged in the summary were 
accurate and requested the Government to provide information on the status of claims 
submitted on behalf of the 988 former child camel jockeys concerned in this case.  The 
Special Rapporteurs asked whether the claims have been considered by the Claims 
Settlement Facility and if they have been refused, asked the Government to explain grounds 
on which the claims were refused. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteurs further requested full statistical information on the 
compensation process, including the number of claims which have been submitted to the 
Claims Settlement Facility, the number of claims which have been accepted, the amount of 
disbursement made to date, and how these disbursements have reached the former child 
camel jockeys.  The Special Rapporteurs also requested information on: measures taken to 
ensure that only the child camel jockey victims benefited from the Claims Settlement 
Facility;  awareness-raising efforts undertaken to inform former child camel jockeys of the 
existence of the Claims Settlement Facility; any measures undertaken to rehabilitate and 
reintegrate the former child camel jockeys who have been repatriated to Pakistan; NGO(s) 
who were in partnership with the government in relation to extending legal or other 
assistance to the claimants in respect of the Claims Settlement Facility for the former child 
camel jockey victims; and any measures undertaken to ensure that the former child camel 
jockeys will not be re-trafficked or be subject to other forms of exploitation. </p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has not provided a 
reply to the communication to date and continues to receive information that the children 
concerned still have not been provided any compensation.  The Special Rapporteur calls 
upon the Government to provide information on the questions raised in the communication 
as soon as possible.   
</p>
<p><b>  Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>63. By letter dated 10 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation 
to the Government of the Republic of Korea concerning women victims of human 
trafficking who enter the Republic of Korea under the E-6 work Scheme. 
</p>
<p>64. According to the information received, many Filipino women are regularly recruited 
as singers in the Philippines under the E-6 work scheme to work in bars and night clubs in 
US military camp towns in South Korea, such as Dongducheon, Pyeongtaek, Songtan and 
Uijeongbu.  There are approximately 4,970 migrant workers who hold a visa granted under 
the E-6 work scheme (&#8220;E-6 visa&#8221;), which is usually valid for 6 months and granted largely 
to female migrant workers to work as singers, dancers and for other types of entertainment.  
77 percent of the E-6 visa workers are women, and it was alleged that this visa was often 
used to traffic women for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  Once they arrived in South 
Korea, these women reportedly realized that their real job was to serve and solicit drinks 
from male US soldiers.  It was alleged that if the women did not solicit enough drinks to 
meet a quota (which ranges from 200 to 500 drinks per month), their employer forced them 
to have sex with their clients.  It was claimed that the women were effectively forced to 
continue working under these conditions, as they were already in debt to their employers 
for a variety of expenses, such as their flight ticket, visa costs, agents&#8217; fees, food and 
accommodation.  The employers also reportedly used verbal abuse and control movements 
of the women in order to prevent them from escaping.  In addition, if the women refused 
sexual advances from the customers or to have sex with them, the employers allegedly 
threatened to cancel their work permits and send them back to the Philippines.  It was 
reported that in some cases, the employers also confiscated the passport and alien card of 
the E-6 visa workers.  This practice allegedly breaches article 7 of the Labour Standards 
Act which prohibits forced labour, as well as article 33(2) of the Immigration Control Act 
which prohibits withholding of passport &#8220;for the purpose of using it as a means to secure a 
contract for job or the fulfilment of obligation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>65. The information received suggested that E-6 visa workers faced difficulties in 
accessing justice, due to the lack of knowledge of their rights or the lack of trust in the 
authorities.  Further, it was often difficult for E-6 visa workers to escape from their 
employers and approach the authorities for help, as their employers would report them to 
the Korea Immigration Service and they would then lose their regular status within two 
weeks.  It was even more difficult for women who lost their E-6 visa status for various 
reasons to file a complaint at the labour office or police station, as they ran the risk of being 
reported to the Korea Immigration Service as illegal immigrants.   
</p>
<p>66. Even when E-6 visa workers sought help from the authorities, they allegedly faced 
obstacles in accessing appropriate judicial or other assistance as victims of human 
trafficking.  It was reported that article 4(3) of the Act on the Punishment of Procuring 
Prostitution and Associated Acts only criminalizes trafficking for prostitution, which is 
much narrower than the international standards.  Because the definition of trafficking is 
linked to prostitution, the authorities allegedly failed to properly identify E-6 visa workers 
who do not work as prostitutes but have been trafficked for sexual exploitation.  Reports 
also suggested that the relevant authorities were not sensitized to the issues of human </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>trafficking in general and that the Korea Immigration Service and the Ministry of Justice 
were often unwilling to intervene in trafficking cases, as they treated the matter as strictly a 
law enforcement issue which should be addressed by the police.  In addition, the Ministry 
of Labour, which is responsible for monitoring workplaces that employ E-6 visa workers, 
did not distinguish them from other foreign workers, thereby failing to properly identify 
potential victims of human trafficking.  While the Ministry of Labour apparently monitored 
some workplaces employing E-6 visa workers in Dongducheon, the monitoring was 
reportedly ineffective for it often took place during hours when the women were not 
working or present.   
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur asked the Government to verify whether the facts alleged in 
the summary were accurate.  The Special Rapporteur then requested details of any 
investigations, judicial or other inquiries which have been carried out in relation to claims 
that many women have been trafficked to the Republic of Korea through the E-6 work 
scheme.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur also requested information on: measures undertaken to 
prevent the use of E-6 visas for the purpose of trafficking; measures undertaken to monitor 
working conditions of E-6 visa workers in order to identify any victims of human 
trafficking;  the protection and assistance framework for the victims of human trafficking; 
measures implemented to ensure that victims of human trafficking were protected and on 
the types of assistance provided to them, including access to shelters, to medical, 
psychological and legal counselling, and to rehabilitation services;  any training or 
capacity-building activities for law enforcement, immigration and other relevant officers 
carried out or planned to ensure that they are properly sensitized to the problem of 
trafficking and equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills to identify trafficking cases, 
combat trafficking and protect the rights of victims. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of 13 April 2010 
</b></p>
<p>69. By letter dated 13 April 2010, the Government of the Republic of Korea replied to 
the communication of 10 February 2010.  Concerning the use of E-6 visas, the Government 
responded that since 2003, it decided to discontinue the issuance of visas to female dancers 
employed in bars and night clubs altogether.  The Government denied the allegation that the 
Immigration Service and the Ministry of Justice were often unwilling to intervene in human 
trafficking case of E-6 visa holders, as public officials have an obligation to report a crime 
of human trafficking pursuant to the Criminal Procedures Act.  Further, the Government 
stated that the Ministry of Justice was taking active measures to protect female foreign 
victims of trafficking by granting the postponement of departure and special permission to 
sojourn, as well as maintaining a system of cooperation with the diplomatic missions of the 
victims&#8217; countries for the purpose of the civil and criminal relief of the victims&#8217; rights.    
Further, the Government informed that the Ministry of Gender Equality directed a survey 
on the issue in 2007 and applied the outcomes to its policies for combating trafficking.  The 
Government stated, however, that it was difficult to provide information on individual cases 
under investigation since the current statistics did not categorize the cases by nationality.  
</p>
<p>70. With respect to the monitoring of working conditions, the Government stated that 
the Immigration Service and the Ministry of Justice continuously carry out on-site surveys 
and determine whether any payment of wage is delayed when investigating cases of visa 
extension for Arts and Performance Status (E-6) visa holders.  Moreover, the Immigration 
Service monitors workplaces and reports to competent authorities, including the 
government office for labor, any businesses engaged in illegal placement of workers, 
delayed payments of wages, solicitation or sexual exploitation.  In addition, the Ministry of 
Labor has intensified its inspection of entertainer dispatch agencies.  In 2009, the Ministry 
checked 66 such agencies and as a result, discovered 157 labor law violations.   </p>

</p>
<p>71. The Government further informed that the protection system of victims of human 
trafficking in Korea mainly targets of victims trafficked for sexual exploitation.  Pursuant to 
the Act on the Punishment of Procuring Prostitution and Associated Acts and the Act on the 
Prevention of the Prostitution and Protection of Victims Thereof, the Government has been 
protecting and assisting victims of human trafficking and forced prostitution.  Protection 
and services for victims are rendered mainly through facilities and support centres operated 
by civic groups with financial support of the central and local governments.  Women 
victims of human trafficking and prostitution may receive services for up to 18 months and 
the types of assistance and services available to victims include: counselling and treatment 
for psychological stability and social integration; medical support and medical facilities to 
treat diseases and manage health; accompaniment to investigations conducted by the 
authorities and to witness testimonies in court; submission of requests for cooperation and 
support by legal aid organizations; rehabilitative training and access to employment 
information; support for applications for any eligible social security payments in 
accordance with such statutes as the National Basic Livelihood Security Act; technical 
training and any other activity mandated to the support activities by other statutes.  In 
addition, free legal counselling services are provided to foreigners residing in Korea 
through the Council for Promoting Rights and Interests, as well as by the Korea Legal Aid 
Corporation.  
</p>
<p>72. In response to the question concerning training activities, the Government replied 
that the Ministry of Justice runs human rights training for immigration officials through 
role-playing, lectures, dissemination of references focusing on human rights.  The 
Government also created a new training program for the armed forces, as well as combined 
training for civil servants in the central and local governments and the police force.  These

<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the comprehensive reply provided by the 
Government of the Republic of Korea.  The Special Rapporteur continues to monitor the 
situation and welcomes any further information on this issue.  In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur would appreciate further information on any practical difficulties in 
implementing the relevant laws which require the immigration control officials to report 
any crimes of human trafficking and to provide necessary protection and assistance to the 
victims.

<p><b>  Communication of 16 November 2009  
</b></p>
<p>74. By letter dated 16 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, sent a letter of allegation concerning Ms. 
Fatima Zahra Moussa, a Moroccan national and allegedly a victim of human trafficking 
who submitted her case for consideration before the United Arab Emirates National 
Committee to Combat Human Trafficking (&#8220;NCCHT&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>75. According to the information received, Ms. Moussa submitted a case of alleged 
trafficking in persons to the NCCHT through the official website of the NCCHT in May 
</p><p>2009.  In this case, Ms. Moussa claimed that she was trafficked to and within the United 
Arab Emirates by her former employers, the Emirates Centre for Strategic Studies and 
Research (&#8220;ECSSR&#8221;) and the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry (&#8220;DCCI&#8221;).    </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>76. Ms. Moussa was first offered a position of Editor by ECSSR on 25 July 2005.  Upon 
arrival in Abu Dhabi, she surrendered her passport to ECSSR for the duration of her one 
year contract, which was stipulated to be part of the employment conditions.  She was 
informed that it was possible for her to have her passport back as and when necessary.  The 
employment conditions also stipulated that 10 percent of her salary would be withheld each 
month. The sum withheld would be accumulated and subsequently paid back at the end of 
the year.  She was informed by ECSSR that this was a standard practice in the United Arab 
Emirates.     
</p>
<p>77. On 19 July 2006, after having worked one year for ECSSR, she was requested to 
renew her contract for another year.  Although she refused to sign the contract, she was 
allegedly forced to do so, as personnel of the Human Resource Department of ECSSR 
allegedly intimidated her and told her that she would not be allowed to leave the room 
unless she signed. Allegedly, she had no option but to sign it, particularly because ECSSR 
was in possession of her passport at the time and she feared for ECSSR&#8217;s retaliation.  She 
contacted the Ministry of Labour in Abu Dhabi and informed them of ECSSR&#8217;s practice, 
but the Ministry did not assist her on the basis that it only deals with cases of employees 
working for private companies.   
</p>
<p>78. On 16 January 2007, Ms. Moussa submitted a letter of resignation to ECSSR.  She 
was informed that her resignation would be approved after she submitted a clearance letter 
from the bank confirming that she has no outstanding loans or debts.  After she submitted 
the clearance letter to ECSSR, however, ECSSR allegedly cancelled Ms. Moussa&#8217;s 
residence permit without complying with a requirement to pay her back the accumulated 
salaries owed to her.  It then filed a criminal complaint against her at Al Shaabiyah police 
station in Abu Dhabi to evict her from the accommodation which belonged to ECSSR and 
to expel her from the UAE.  She alleged that ECSSR did this to harass her and to retaliate 
against her.    
</p>
<p>79. In Abu Dhabi Court of first instance, she was fined 2,000 UAE dirhams in the case 
filed by ECSSR.  She sought to appeal against this decision and went to the Abu Dhabi 
Public Prosecution office.  While she was waiting to see the Chief Public Prosecutor in the 
office, it was claimed that two police officers suddenly handcuffed her and aggressively 
dragged her until another police officer intervened to stop them.  While the police officer 
apologized for the mistreatment, he allegedly insisted that she pay the fine of 2,000 dirhams 
immediately.  She paid the fine, so that she could leave the office.  Subsequently, one of the 
two police officers filed a case against her on the basis that she insulted the police officer 
during the course of her duties.  When she reported to the police station for questioning, she 
was arrested and put in jail.  She was released only after a colleague came to the police 
station and left his passport as a guarantee.  In Abu Dhabi Court of first instance, she was 
again fined 2,000 UAE dirhams, which she was allegedly forced by the police to pay on the 
same day.  In both cases, there appeared to be no investigations and Ms. Moussa did not 
have a lawyer.       
</p>
<p>80. On 20 March 2007, Ms. Moussa was offered a position of business editor with 
DCCI.  She was required to surrender her passport to DCCI as a guarantee to receive 
housing allowances, although this was not stipulated as part of the employment conditions.   
Ms. Moussa complained to the Ministry of Labour in Dubai about this practice, but the 
Ministry did not offer her any assistance.  On 17 July 2007, she was dismissed by DCCI 
without any satisfactory explanations for the dismissal. Following the dismissal, DCCI 
issued an absconder notice against Ms. Moussa on 28 July 2007.  On 26 August 2007, she 
departed the UAE and the absconder notice was still in effect to date.  
</p>
<p>81. Ms. Moussa submitted a complaint to the NCCHT, alleging that ECSSR and DCCI 
trafficked her.  The NCCHT registered her case under the reference number NC000032.  
Ms. Moussa also called the NCCHT and provided further details of her case.  She claimed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>that she was informed during the telephone conversation that her case would be referred to 
the Public Prosecution without delay.  However, on 7 June 2009, she was informed by the 
NCCHT by email that her case would not be reviewed as its official website cannot be used 
to notify the NCCHT about individual cases of human trafficking.  This was contrary to the 
information publicly released by the National Media Council on 13 May 2009 that the 
official website of the NCCHT features an &#8220;important interactive feature &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; that 
allows contact with officials via email, thus enabling users to send complaints and notify 
the committee about cases related to human trafficking&#8221;.  While Ms. Moussa sought 
explanations from the NCCHT of its refusal to handle her case, it was alleged that the 
NCCHT did not respond to her request.  Moreover, under the &#8220;Contact us&#8221; page of the 
NCCHT webpage, it was stated that &#8220;[c]omplaints filed through this channel will not be 
processed&#8221;, in contradiction with the information released by the NCCHT in the mentioned 
official press release of 13 May 2009 related to the creation of its website. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to verify the accuracy of the 
facts alleged in the summary. They also requested the Government to provide details of 
how the NCCHT considered Ms. Moussa&#8217;s case and to elaborate on the ground(s) on which 
the NCCHT determined not to respond to Ms. Moussa&#8217;s case.   
</p>
<p>83. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to clarify and 
provide information on the current framework for reporting potential cases of human 
trafficking to the authorities in the United Arab Emirates. In particular, the Special 
Rapporteurs asked what specific measures were adopted to provide victims with an easily 
accessible way to submit complaints and obtain assistance or redress. They also inquired on 
the role of the NCCHT and its website in this regard. 
</p>
<p>84. Finally, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide information 
on the measures taken to prevent trafficking and violations to the rights of migrant workers, 
in particular to those being held in forced labour and facing practices similar to slavery and 
servitude such as surrender of passports to employers. They also requested it to provide 
information on the implementation in the United Arab Emirates of the right to consular 
protection in cases involving migrants. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication of 9 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>85. By letter dated 9 February 2010, Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, sent a letter of 
allegation to the United Arab Emirates concerning 988 Pakistani child camel jockeys who 
were previously trafficked to the United Arab Emirates and who have not been provided 
with compensation to date.   
</p>
<p>86. According to the information received, Rahimyar Khan District of Punjab Province, 
Pakistan, is said to be the leading source district for children who were trafficked for the 
purpose of camel racing in the Gulf States.  According to the research conducted by Save 
the Children Sweden in June 2004, it was estimated that approximately 15,000 children 
from the Rahimyar Khan District were trafficked as camel jockeys to the Gulf States, most 
notably to the United Arab Emirates.  It was reported that most of the children were sold to 
traffickers by their parents, who were very poor and lured to promises that their children 
would earn significant profits for their families as camel jockeys.  Reports also indicated 
that there were other groups of individuals who kidnapped children and sold them to the 
trafficking mafia.  The trafficked children were reportedly treated in an inhumane manner 
and suffered from physical injuries as well as from psychological trauma.  They were kept 
in camel farms for 24 hours a day and were not allowed to leave the farms except when 
they took the camels out for exercise.  The living conditions in the farms were harsh in that 
the children slept on the ground and were poorly fed so that their weight was kept under 20 
kilograms, which is deemed as the maximum optimal weight for camel jockeying.  They </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>were also often subject to sexual abuse and beating, including electric shocks.  They were 
made to work from dawn until dusk, and constantly faced risks of death or serious injuries 
during the race.   
</p>
<p>87. Since 2005, the Government reportedly intensified its efforts in eradicating the use 
of child camel jockeys and consequently signed an agreement with United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (&#8220;UNICEF&#8221;) on 7 May 2005 to repatriate child camel jockeys to their 
country of origin and to assist in their rehabilitation and reintegration.  With respect to the 
former child camel jockeys from Pakistan, the Ministry of Interior of the UAE and the 
Overseas Pakistani Division of the Ministry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis 
of the Republic of Pakistan reportedly established a Claims Settlement Facility in 
accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) on 25 April 2007 to hear 
and determine individual claims of physical and non-physical injury by former child camel 
jockeys.  The Claims Settlement Facility is administered by an Administrative Board, 
which consists of two members appointed by the Government of Pakistan and one 
appointed by the Ministry of Interior of the Government of the UAE.   
</p>
<p>88. According to the information received, the Claims Settlement Facility allegedly 
failed to provide former child camel jockeys with compensation.  Firstly, it was alleged that 
the former child camel jockeys were not well-informed about the existence of the Claims 
Settlement Facility.  A newspaper notice about the offer of financial relief to former child 
camel jockeys by the Government of the United Arab Emirates reportedly appeared in 
Daily Khabrian in Multan on 13 May 2008 and on 23 June 2008, and in Daily Dawn in 
Lahore on 24 June 2008 respectively.  It was alleged that these notices did not serve their 
purpose, as most of the former child camel jockeys are illiterate and live in remote areas 
where these newspapers do not reach.  Secondly, while the Administrative Board was 
required under the MOU to designate one or more NGO(s) to extend legal or other 
assistance to the claimants to submit claims, the Administrative Board assigned the tasks to 
the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau of the Government of Punjab, Pakistan, whose 
officers were allegedly not properly trained to assist the claimants.  There were allegations 
that the officers failed to consider claims in light of all evidence available.  According to 
the information received, there are currently 988 former child camel jockeys whose claims 
are still pending and have not been provided compensation.  Thirdly, the Claims Settlement 
Facility was to be terminated upon distribution of the awards in the manner determined by 
the Administrative Board in accordance with section 6 of the MOU.  However, the 
Government allegedly terminated the Claims Settlement Facility already on 31 March 2009 
without providing compensation to the 988 claimants concerned. 
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government to verify whether the facts alleged 
in the summary of the case were accurate.  The Special Rapporteurs also inquired about the 
status of claims submitted on behalf of the 988 former child camel jockeys concerned in 
this case and whether the claims have been considered by the Claims Settlement Facility.  If 
they have been refused, the Special Rapporteurs sought explanations from the Government 
on the grounds on which the claims were refused. 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteurs also requested full statistical information on the 
compensation process, including the number of claims which have been submitted to the 
Claims Settlement Facility, the number of claims which have been accepted, the amount of 
disbursement made to date, and how these disbursements have reached the former child 
camel jockeys.  Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs requested information on: measures 
taken to ensure that only the child camel jockey victims benefit from the Claims Settlement 
Facility;  awareness-raising efforts undertaken to inform former child camel jockeys of the 
existence of the Claims Settlement Facility; any bilateral support provided to the 
Government of Pakistan to facilitate the rehabilitation and reintegration of the former child 
camel jockeys who have been repatriated to Pakistan.   </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Communication of 12 March 2010 
</b></p>
<p>91. By letter dated 12 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, joint with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegation to the Government 
of the United Arab Emirates regarding the situation of S.M.  S.M. is the founder of a non-
governmental organization aimed at protecting women subjected to violence including rape, 
human trafficking, domestic violence, sexual abuse, incest and abuse of domestic workers 
in the United Arab Emirates (&#8220;the Organization&#8221;). The Organization also provided support 
to children victims of trafficking for the purpose of camel jockeying.  In this context, two 
shelters were opened in Dubai 2001 and 2005.  
</p>
<p>92. According to the information received, on October 2007, 35 women and 10 children 
in the Organization were allegedly transferred by the authorities to a new government-run 
shelter, the Dubai Women and Children&#8217;s Foundation. It was alleged that the transfer was 
an attempt by the authorities to close the Organization by merging it with the Dubai 
Women and Children's Foundation.   
</p>
<p>93. On 24 November 2007, S.M. wrote a letter to the Vice-President of the United Arab 
Emirates and the then Minister of Labour denouncing the attempt to merge the two shelters 
as a way to forcibly close down the Organization.  
</p>
<p>94. On 9 March 2008, the newspaper Gulf News reportedly published an article 
suggesting that S.M. was selling the stories of women living in the Organization to 
newspapers against their will. In late March 2008, the Organization was allegedly closed 
and the women from the shelters were transferred to the Dubai Women and Children's 
Foundation. 
</p>
<p>95. On 21 May 2008, Gulf News stated that S.M. was involved in the sale of children. 
Following these publications, the Consulate of the United States advised S.M. to leave the 
United Arab Emirates for her own safety.  She now lives in the United States while her 
family remains in the United Arab Emirates. It was alleged that her family members have 
been harassed and threatened since she has left the country. 
</p>
<p>96. On 11 January 2010, the newspaper Emirat Alyoum, published an article referring to 
S.M.&#8217;s appearance on a BBC show on 14 December 2009. It was alleged that the article 
stated that S.M. had psychological problems, that she was involved in trafficking and sale 
of children and that she was involved in the misappropriation of funds. 
</p>
<p>97. On 26 January 2010, Al Bayan website published an article about domestic violence. 
The article quoted Mr. Afra Al Basti, the director of the Dubai Women and Children&#8217;s 
Foundation, suggesting that S.M. had misappropriated 300 000 UAE dirhams. This 
publication coincided with the consideration of the United Arab Emirates&#8217; report by the 
United Nations Committee on Discrimination against Women where experts asked the 
United Arab Emirates&#8217; delegation to comment on the widely reported closure of the the 
Organization&#8217;s shelter. The head of delegation responded that the shelter had begun 
operating without authorization and that the building of such centres should have been in 
compliance with State laws. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteurs asked the Government to verify the accuracy of the facts 
alleged in the summary.  They then inquired whether a complaint has been lodged by S.M., 
her family or on their behalf.   
</p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteurs also requested information concerning the legal grounds 
for the closure of the Organization and how these measures are compatible with 
international norms and standards as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and other relevant international instruments.  They further requested the Government to 
provide details, and where available results, of any investigation and judicial or other </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>inquiries carried out in relation to this case.  If no inquiries have taken place, or if they have 
been inconclusive, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to explain why. 
</p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteurs also requested information on any shelters provided by the 
Government and/or by civil society organizations in the country, including specialized 
shelters for victims of domestic violence, as well as information on partnerships and 
cooperation with civil society organizations that the Government may have in ensuring the 
adequate provision of protection and assistance to victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>101. By letter dated 23 April 2010, the Government of United Arab Emirates responded 
to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication of 16 November 2009.  The reply is currently 
translated to English and will be published in the next report to the Human Rights Council.   
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United Arab Emirates 
has not provided replies to the communications sent on 9 February 2010 and 12 March 
2010 to date and calls upon the Government to provide information on the questions raised 
in the communications as soon as possible.   
</p>
<p><b>  Uzbekistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication of 20 September 2009 
</b></p>
<p>103. By letter dated 20 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government of Uzbekistan concerning the Uzbek boy who has been trafficked to 
Kazakhstan to work in a forced labour situation and whose whereabouts were unknown.  
</p>
<p>104. According to the information received, B.I., aged 17, is a resident of the Khiva town 
of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan.  In May 2008, B.I. and four young Uzbek men were 
recruited by B.B., a citizen of Uzbekistan aged 56, to travel to Kazakhstan as labor 
migrants.  B.B. promised them and their parents that he would take care of their 
employment in Kazakhstan.  He also assured them that being the oldest in the group, he 
would look after the young men during their stay in Kazakhstan.    
</p>
<p>105. Upon their arrival in Kazakhstan, the young men were taken to a house of N.M., 
located in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast.  B.B. received $5,000 from N.M. in 
exchange of the young men and handed over their passports to N.M. before he disappeared.  
The young men were forced to carry out a variety of work in N.M.&#8217;s house, including 
construction work.  They were forced to work under harsh conditions and without 
appropriate food and compensation.  Approximately two months after the young men left 
for Kazakhstan, B.B. appeared in Khiva.  B.I.&#8217;s mother went to see B.B. to ask how her son 
was.  B.B. assured the mother that all the young men were well and that they would soon be 
sending money they earned in Kazakhstan.  However, B.I.&#8217;s mother never heard from her 
son, as all the young men were not given any opportunity to contact their families in 
Uzbekistan.  The young men except B.I. eventually managed to escape the house and return 
to Khiva.        
</p>
<p>106. In December 2008, B.I.&#8217;s mother lodged an appeal to the Department of Internal 
Affairs in the Khiva district and to the Embassy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in 
Uzbekistan to search for her son.  However, she did not receive any responses from the 
authorities.  Concerned for her son&#8217;s safety and desperate to find him, on 12 June 2009, she 
travelled to N.M.&#8217;s house in Zhalagash aul, Kizil-Ordinski oblast by her own means.  When </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>she arrived at N.M.&#8217;s house, he shouted at her in the Kazakh language, throwing the 
passports of the young Uzbek men who were forced to work in his house.  He told her that 
B.I. was taken by a Police Major from Shimkent city in Yuzhno-Kazakhstanskaya oblast.       
</p>
<p>107. It was reported that B.B. has deceived a number of individuals from the Khorezm 
region in a similar manner and the Department of Internal Affairs in the Khiva district 
commenced criminal proceedings against him under Article 135 of the Uzbek Criminal 
Code (Human Trafficking).  However, B.B. had not been apprehended and the whereabouts 
of B.I. were unknown.     
</p>
<p>108. The Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to verify the accuracy of the 
facts alleged in the summary. They also asked the Government to provide full details of: 
any actions or measures undertaken to identify the whereabouts of B.I. and to ensure his 
safety and protection, and the progress of the prosecution undertaken against B.B.  Further, 
they requested the Government to provide the details, and where available the results, of 
any other investigation, judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out in 
relation to this case.   
</p>
<p>109. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide 
information on the measures taken to ensure rehabilitation and reintegration of the four 
young Uzbek men who managed to escape from the house of N.M.. They also requested the 
Government to indicate whether the victims or the families of the victims had access to 
adequate procedures of compensation for damages from those legally responsible.  
</p>
<p>110. Finally, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide information 
on the current policies and the preventive and awareness raising measures taken to tackle 
the issue of human trafficking in Uzbekistan and on what action were being taken by the 
Government to address the root causes of trafficking such as poverty and high youth 
unemployment. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government of 25 November 2009  
</b></p>
<p>111. By letter dated 25 November 2009, the Government of Uzbekistan responded to the 
Special Rapporteurs' communication of 20 October 2009.  The Government responded that 
the investigative section of the Department of Internal Affairs of Khiva district instituted 
criminal proceedings against B.B..  The investigation revealed that B.B. deceived B.I. and 
other citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan by promising monthly wages of US$500 and 
taking them to the Kyzyl-Ordinsk province of the Republic of Kazakhstan where he forced 
them to work in various places without pay.  
</p>
<p>112. The Government also informed that on 8 November 2009, B.B. was arrested and 
placed in remand centre No. 6 in Urgench. Criminal proceedings were instituted against 
B.B. on 8 November 2009 and investigations were still continuing. It was ascertained that 
B.I. returned to Uzbekistan on 8 November 2009 and he was living with his parents in the 
district of Khiva.    
</p>
<p>113. The Government informed that it was taking steps to improve national legislation to 
counter and combat this kind of criminal activity.  For example, the Act on countering the 
trafficking in persons was adopted on 17 April 2008 and the definition of the term 
&#8220;trafficking in persons&#8221; contained therein is consonant with that set forth in article 3 of the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized 
Crime.   
</p>
<p>114. In its response, the Government highlighted that pursuant to this law, the 
presidential decree of 8 July 2008 approved a national plan of action to boost the 
effectiveness of the fight against trafficking in persons for the period 2008&#8211;2010.  The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/32/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>presidential decree established the Republican Interdepartmental Commission to Counter 
Trafficking in Persons, which is a coordination body consisting of the heads of government 
bodies and community organizations, including the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Foreign 
Affairs, Justice, the Economy, Finances, Health and Labour and Social Welfare, the 
National Security Service, the State Customs Committee, the Women&#8217;s Committee, the 
National Human Rights Centre, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Oliy Majlis 
(ombudsman), the Mahalla Foundation, the Central Council of the Kamolot youth 
movement and the Ijtimoii Fikr public opinion research centre. Local interdepartmental 
commissions to counter the trafficking in persons were set up in all regions of the country.   
</p>
<p>115. The Government informed that as part of the implementation of the law and the 
national plan, the Cabinet adopted a resolution on the establishment of a national 
rehabilitation centre to assist and protect victims of human trafficking.  The construction of 
the centre was almost complete and the centre was equipped with necessary equipment to 
provide the victims with effective medical, psychological, legal and social support.  
</p>
<p>116. The Ministry of Internal Affairs established a special unit to counter human 
trafficking on 26 February 2004.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs formulated and issued 
guidelines on the investigation of offences linked to human trafficking. In accordance with 
the 2008&#8211;2010 national plan of action to combat trafficking in persons, sociological and 
criminological surveys of problems connected with human trafficking were constantly 
conducted in conjunction with the Ijtimoii Fikr centre and the Manaviyat Va Marifat social 
centre. Special investigative units were also set up in the Republic of Karakalpakstan, in the 
provinces and in the municipality of Tashkent for the thorough investigation of offences 
related to the trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>117. In its response, the Government also informed that in order to stop clandestine 
labour migration, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare provided advice on the labour 
and migration laws in common destination countries at the Centre for Pre-departure 
Adaptation and Training and the Agency for Foreign Labour Migration.  The Ministry also 
actively conducted information campaigns through television advertisements, banners, 
posters, theatre plays, publications, seminars and conferences. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>118. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the detailed response provided by the 
Government of Uzbekistan and commends its efforts in successfully prosecuting the 
perpetrator and identifying whereabouts of B.I. who was missing at the time.  The Special 
Rapporteur would appreciate further information on measures implemented by the 
Government to ensure rehabilitation and reintegration of the children concerned upon their 
return to Uzbekistan.  The Special Rapporteur also remains interested in receiving 
information on measures undertaken by the Government to address the root causes of 
trafficking, such as poverty and high youth unemployment.
