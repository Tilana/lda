Operating Highlights
·      A strong revenue performance, driven by Asia Pacific, partially offsetting weaker than expected margins
in the UK resulting in 25% reduction in group operating profit
o  The UK business performed below expectation as operating margins were adversely affected by
weakness in the offshore North Sea and thermal coal power generation markets, and poor commercial
performance on the ExxonMobil contract at Fawley
o  The Asia Pacific business performed above expectation driven by increased project activity in Australia,
South Korea and Singapore
o  The Middle East business delivered a solid performance with a strong contribution from the SOCAR-
Cape joint venture in Azerbaijan mitigating the effect of increased cost pressures from clients across the
region
·      The Redhall Engineering Solutions acquisition, rebranded as Cape Engineering Services, is
now fully integrated into the UK                business and has performed ahead of expectations
·      The UK business is being restructured to maximise capability for growth through delivering the
full portfolio of services to the                Group's customer base whilst reducing overhead costs
Financial Highlights
·      Order intake during the first half decreased to £309m (H1 2015: £399m), largely due to the timing of key
contract awards resulting in an order book of £820m at period end (5 July 2015: £800m; 31 December
2015: £861m)
·      Revenue increased by 10% to £396.3m (H1 2015: £359.5m) with a small benefit from exchange rate
movement and a full period from the Redhall Engineering Solutions acquisition completed in May 2015. At
constant currency organic revenues increased by 6%
·      The Group achieved an excellent cash conversion of 73%, resulting in a period-end adjusted net debt
of £113.7m (5 July 2015: £131.3m; 31 December 2015: £109.9m)
·      Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 8.9p (H1 2015: 13.2p)
·      IDC provision increased by £8.7m largely reflecting the result of recent litigation in respect of employer
liability claims being brought by Aviva
·      The Group has declared an interim dividend of 4.5p (H1 2015: 4.5p) per share underlying the Board's
confidence in the business
·      Expectations for the full year unchanged with a higher profit weighting in the second half driven by
increasing project activity, the effects of the restructuring in the UK and the benefit of foreign exchange
tailwinds.

INTERIM MANAGEMENT REVIEW
Summary
Trading for the first six months of 2016 has been mixed with increased volume and margin in the Asia
Pacific region but lower than anticipated margins in the UK. Despite challenging market conditions, Cape
delivered solid revenue growth driven by an increase in activity on key projects in Asia Pacific along with
the impact of a full six months of trading for Cape Engineering Services (previously Redhall Engineering
Solutions). The Board expects a higher than normal weighting for earnings in the second half of the year as
project volumes increase, the benefit of cost reductions is realised in the UK business and from favourable
translational effect of current exchange rates. The Board has declared a dividend of 4.5p per share.
Order intake for the first half of 2016 decreased by 23% to £309 million (H1 2015: £399 million) reflecting
the timing of key maintenance contract renewals and challenging conditions in a number of the Group's key
markets. The business continues to be successful in securing target contracts with a number of key awards
in the period, including a new 5 year maintenance contract for ConocoPhillips at its Seal Sands facility and
a 3 year extension of the Group's multidisciplinary maintenance contract with SABIC in the UK. Bidding
activity in the UK is currently high including the recent submission of a bid for the renewal of the UK
business' five year BP Federal Maintenance contract which is expected to be determined in the second half
of the year. Bidding activity in the Middle East remains high and the Group has secured a number of
strategic contract awards including a multi-country master services agreement with General Electric Power
Services to provide access and insulation services to its 64 power facilities across the region, and further
scope expansion on the important Jazan project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ("KSA").
The Group's order book was £820 million at 3 July 2016 in comparison to £861 million at 31 December
2015 and £800 million at 5 July 2015. The reported order book excludes the order book value associated
with joint ventures where the Group holds a minority interest. Cape's share of the SOCAR-Cape joint
venture order book in Azerbaijan was £54 million at 3 July 2016 (31 December 2015: £55 million; 5 July
2015: £37 million).
Group revenue from continuing operations increased by 10% to £396.3 million (H1 2015: £359.5 million).
Positive foreign exchange movements accounted for 1% of this increase with a further 3% from a full six
month contribution from Cape Engineering Services which was acquired in May 2015. The organic growth
of 6% was largely driven by the ramp-up of activity on key projects in Asia Pacific including Chevron's
Wheatstone LNG plant and Woodside's Karratha Gas Plant life extension programme (KLE).
Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations decreased to £18.9 million (H1 2015: £25.1 million)
with adjusted operating margin falling to 4.8% (H1 2015: 7.0%). The reduction in margin was largely driven
by the UK business which was impacted by a significant reduction in demand for its specialist services from
the offshore North Sea market and poor commercial performance on maintenance and shutdown work for
the ExxonMobil contract at the Fawley refinery. Margins in the Middle East business remained resilient as
anticipated at a lower level than the first half of 2015 as the business benefited from a number of one-off
favourable contract settlements in the prior period.
The Asia Pacific region delivered a much improved performance with revenue increasing by 50% and
adjusted operating profit increasing by 108% largely due to increasing volumes on a number of key projects
in Australia, Singapore and South Korea.
The Group achieved an adjusted operating cash inflow for the first half of 2016 of £13.8 million (H1 2015:
£1.2 million). Adjusted net debt of £113.7 million (H1 2015: £131.3 million; 31 December 2015: £109.9
million) has been positively impacted by the improved working capital position.
Progress on strategy
Cape continues to make progress on the implementation of its strategy, despite the considerable
challenges in a number of its markets. The importance of having geographical diversity is demonstrated by
the improved results from our business in Azerbaijan and Asia Pacific mitigating a weaker than anticipated
performance in the UK. In line with our stated strategy, the Group expanded its geographic footprint in the
first half of the year by signing a joint venture agreement with Olio Resources to serve the Malaysian market
and by securing a number of key construction contracts in Kuwait. The recently signed contract with GE
Power Services across the Middle East will also enable the Group to expand its operations into Iraq.
The value of developing close relationships with key clients, supported by excellence in operational
delivery is demonstrated by the recently secured contract to provide the cryogenic insulation for Shell's
Prelude Floating LNG vessel being constructed in South Korea.  This important project will provide a strong
reference for Cape in this new market segment.
Operational Excellence remains the cornerstone of our strategy as it enables Cape to deliver better value to
our clients whilst protecting margins in today's challenging market conditions. We continue to invest in both
our processes and people in order to drive improvement in productivity and operational safety, delivering
increased value to our clients.
We have continued with our strategy to sustain a steady revenue stream from maintenance services which
has provided stability in volatile markets. Revenue from maintenance activities in the first half of 2016 were
£237 million (H1 2015: £256 million) representing 60% of total revenue. The reduction in maintenance
volume stems primarily from the closure of the Longannet and Ferrybridge power stations in the UK and
reduced maintenance activity in Australia.
We continue to expand the range of services we offer to our clients. Although progress on expanding our
tank construction and maintenance business into the Middle East has been slower than we had hoped, the
Group now has this capability firmly established in the region with work underway on a small number of
storage tank contracts in the UAE. The market for storage tank services in the Middle East remains
substantial and we continue to target this work across the region. The award of the mechanical service
contract by ConocoPhillips at their Seal Sands facility was an important milestone for the UK business in
the development of our broader service offering in this market.

Revenue from continuing operations increased by 10% to £396.3 million (H1 2015: £359.5 million) of which
1% relates to foreign exchange movements, 3% from a full six month contribution from Cape Engineering
Services and 6% from organic growth. The underlying increase of 6% was largely driven by increased
volume from a number of projects in the Asia Pacific region.
Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations decreased to £18.9 million (H1 2015: £25.1 million)
primarily driven by margin reduction in the UK business, in particular for its specialist services offering for
the offshore North Sea market and the poor commercial performance on the maintenance contract at the
Fawley refinery.
This reduction has been partially offset by:
·      a 3% favourable translation impact of foreign exchange
·      a 15% saving in central overheads due to favourable transaction impact of foreign exchange and
changes to the group management structure.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 8.9p (H1 2015: 13.2p) on adjusted
earnings attributable to equity shareholders of £10.8 million (H1 2015: £16.0 million).
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 0.1p (H1 2015: 10.5p) after reflecting the
increase in the Industrial Disease Claims provision of £8.7 million which was recognised in the first half of
the year. The increase in the provision has been shown within other items in the Consolidated Income
Statement on page 13.

Regional review (continued)
UK
Market conditions
Market conditions in the UK region continued to be challenging throughout the first half of the year.  Given
the further reduction in the oil price, which reached a low of US$28/bbl in early 2016, the offshore market in
the North Sea has experienced a particularly difficult period with customers choosing to defer discretionary
spending, causing a significant decline in demand for the Group's specialist services.  Customers continue
to seek ways in which to reduce their costs and this is likely to bring increased pricing pressure across this
sector.
As anticipated, demand from the thermal coal power station market reduced, with the closure of Longannet
and Ferrybridge power stations in March 2016.  Demand from the downstream and general industrial
segments remained robust.
Results
Order intake decreased by 27% to £162 million (H1 2015: £223 million) due to the combination of
challenging market conditions and the timing of contract renewal dates.  Nonetheless, the business was
successful in securing a number of key target contracts including a three year renewal of its
multidisciplinary maintenance contract with SABIC UK and a five year contract for fabrication, mechanical,
engineering and instrumentation services at ConocoPhillips' Seal Sands facility.
Revenue increased by 1% from the prior period to £194.0 million (H1 2015: £191.8 million), with a decline
in revenue from contracts in the North Sea being offset by increased volumes from Motherwell Bridge and a
full six month contribution from Cape Engineering Services. Excluding the benefit of the Cape Engineering
Services acquisition, organic revenues reduced by 6%.
The region continues to be predominantly maintenance based with 82% (H1 2015: 88%) of revenues
derived from maintenance activity.
Adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 4.3% (H1 2015: 8.2%) driven by the effects of reduced
demand and resultant low utilisation in the specialist services businesses serving the offshore North Sea
market, reduced volumes of shutdown work in the coal power generation sector, and a continuation of the
poor commercial performance in delivering maintenance and shutdown work for ExxonMobil at the Fawley
refinery. The business is implementing a new organisational structure in order to both drive revenue
synergies whilst reducing overhead costs. This restructuring will be completed in the second half of 2016.
The business was proud to receive a number of safety awards during the first half of 2016 including the
Zero Harm Innovation award from EDF Energy. This award relates to an innovative training package
currently being delivered across the Cape business that utilises 360-degree virtual reality technology for
safety training in our continuous journey towards achieving Zero Harm.
Middle East
Market conditions
Market conditions have shown considerable variation across the region.  Demand in KSA continues to be
robust, driven by a stable maintenance requirement and increasing activity on construction projects
predominantly in the downstream/petrochemical segment. In the UAE, maintenance demand remained
robust but pricing pressure increased as clients adjusted to the lower oil price environment. The lower
levels of project activity seen in 2015 continued in 2016. In Qatar, activity in new oil & gas projects remains
low with investment being directed toward infrastructure development.  Project demand has been low in
Oman throughout the first half with a number of projects having been delayed into the latter part of the year. 
The business continues to see a ramp-up in construction activities in Kuwait, with a number of significant
downstream projects moving forward.
Results
Order intake decreased by 28% to £89 million (H1 2015: £124 million) largely driven by delays in the timing
of a number of contract awards across the region.  The business secured its first multi-country, multi-
disciplinary award with a contract to support a total of 64 power facilities of GE Power Services across the
Middle East. A further contract award was received during the first half to provide access services at Saudi
Aramco's Jazan Refinery and Terminal for Nasser S. Al Hajri Corporation adding to the previous contract
awards to provide refractory and fireproofing works. The business continues to build on its long term client
relationships with a number of important awards including the insulation contract at the BP Khazzan site in
Oman for the construction of a central processing facility and a four year contract extension for refractory
maintenance for Qatalum in Qatar.
Revenue decreased by 1% from the prior period to £94.2 million (H1 2015: £95.4 million).  The business
benefited from a 6% favourable impact of foreign exchange with the underlying decrease at constant
currency of 7% being driven by a reduction of volume in Qatar partially offset by an increase in activity in
KSA, UAE and Kuwait.
A key element of our strategy is to have a balanced business and stable revenue streams from
maintenance contracts across all regions. We have continued to sustain a strong maintenance business in
the Middle East with approximately 50% of revenues coming from maintenance work, compared to 50% at
H1 2015 and 40% at H1 2014. We aim to sustain a strong maintenance revenue base in the region to
provide stability over time.
Adjusted operating profit was £13.0 million, a decrease of 17% from prior year (H1 2015: £15.7 million) and
includes a 5% favourable gain from foreign exchange rate movement. At constant currency, adjusted
operating profit decreased by 22%. As expected, the adjusted operating margin in H1 2016 of 13.8% was
reduced compared to the prior period (H1 2015: 16.5%) which benefited from a favourable close-out on a
number of contracts. Our SOCAR-Cape joint venture in Azerbaijan continued to perform strongly both
operationally and financially.  A strong performance from the KSA business, largely driven by increased
scope on the Jazan refinery project and continued progress on the expansion of Petro Rabigh's Refining
and Petrochemical Complex, added to by Qatar's successful completion of a number of shutdowns, offset a
poor performance from the Oman business where delays in project initiation have led to reduced volumes
and low utilisation.
Regional review (continued)
The Group has been recognised with a number of safety awards in the region from core clients such as
SABIC at their Al-Jubail site in KSA for zero lost time injuries and from ADGAS in the UAE for achievement
of 250,000 man-hours without a lost time incident.
Asia Pacific
Market conditions
Market conditions within the Asia Pacific market remain mixed.  Demand for maintenance activity in Asia
was steady although competition, in particular from local competitors, remained strong.  The offshore
market across the region has been negatively affected by the low oil price driving a significant fall in
demand for both new project and refurbishment work. Bidding activity has been high for the RAPID project
in Malaysia, although competition, in particular from local suppliers is more severe than expected.  Activity
levels in the LNG construction sector have been high with much of the module work in Asian yards
completing early in the period and an increase in activity in Australia across the three major LNG plants
currently under construction.  This strong demand from the LNG project sector offset continued weakness in
the Australian maintenance market as the iron ore miners in particular continue to seek ways to reduce
capex and operating expense.
Results
Order intake increased by 12% to £58 million compared to the first half of 2015 (H1 2015: £52 million),
largely driven by the award of the Shell Bukom contract in Singapore, where the business is providing
access, insulation and painting services to Shell's Ethylene Cracker Complex, and an increase in scope of
work for Chevron's Wheatstone LNG project in Australia.
Revenue increased by 50% to £108.1 million (H1 2015: £72.3m) with 51% growth at constant currency
being marginally offset by a 1% impact of foreign exchange rate movement. The strong growth was driven
by a continued ramp-up of work on the Wheatstone LNG project and mobilisation of two important new
contracts secured in late 2015: the Shell Prelude Floating LNG project in South Korea and the Karratha
Gas Plant life extension project for Woodside in Australia. The Singapore business also achieved a
substantial increase in activity in both project and maintenance work for key clients such as Shell,
ExxonMobil and Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. Volumes across much of the remainder of Asia and
in the maintenance segment in Australia were subdued.  The recent entry into Malaysia has progressed
more slowly than anticipated, in part due to project delays and in part due to stronger than anticipated
competition from local competitors. The business has secured a small contract on the RAPID project and
continues to tender a number of packages of work for this project.
The business achieved a very substantial increase in adjusted operating profit, up 108% compared to prior
year at £5.0m (H1 2015: £2.4m) with organic growth at constant currency of 112% partly offset by a
decrease of 4% due to foreign exchange movement.  The growth was driven by an increase in both volume
increase and operating margin as the benefits of the improvement actions taken in Australia in 2015 more
than offset a reduction in margin in a number of businesses in Asia due to low utilisation on reduced
volumes.
During the period, the Group was recognised by ExxonMobil for achieving 5 million man-hours without a
lost time incident on the Aurora EOS site in Singapore. In Australia, the Group was awarded Safety
Subcontractor of the Month on the Wheatstone LNG project in June.
Outlook
As stated in the AGM statement, the Board's expectations for the full year remain unchanged with a higher
than usual weighting of earnings in the second half of the year as the weaker first half is offset by increasing
levels of activity and the continued benefit of current favourable foreign exchange rates. The Group is
expected to deliver an improved performance in the second half of the year, with increasing project activity
in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, and a small improvement in margin in the UK business as the benefits
of the ongoing restructuring start to take effect.
The overall outlook for 2017 for the markets in which the Group operates is uncertain but our expectation is
that the level of demand will be similar to 2016 with continued weakness in the upstream market, in
particular in the UK and Asia, being offset by solid project demand for the Group's Middle East and
Australian businesses.  Despite the challenging market conditions, the Group continues to invest in the
delivery of its strategy, both in the continued drive for operational excellence and growth through expanding
its geographic footprint and service offering.
Financial review
Revenue
Revenue from continuing operations increased by 10% to £396.3 million (H1 2015: £359.5 million). There
was a 1% favourable impact of foreign exchange to revenue with organic growth at constant currency of 6%
largely from projects in the Asia Pacific region with the Wheatstone and KLE in Australia, Shell Prelude in
South Korea and Shell Bukom in Singapore. The inclusion of a full six month period for Cape Engineering
Services Limited, which was acquired in May 2015, provided a 3% increase to group revenue.
Revenue from maintenance contracts decreased to £237 million or 60% of total revenue (H1 2015: £256
million or 71% of total revenue). Revenue invoiced to the largest client represented 15% of total revenue
(H1 2015: 12%) relating to activities in the Asia Pacific region and the top 10 clients represented 52% of
revenue (H1 2015: 44%).
Adjusted operating profit
Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations decreased by 25% to £18.9 million (H1 2015: £25.1
million) mainly as a result of lower demand in the UK business for its specialist services from the offshore
North Sea market, higher costs on the Fawley shutdown contract and lower margins in the Middle East
compared to the same period in 2015 when the business enjoyed the benefit of one-off favourable
settlements from the completion of a number of contracts. Favourable translational foreign exchange
movements accounted for a 3% growth in the adjusted operating profit from continuing operations and there
was a 3% benefit from reporting a full half year of Cape Engineering Services.
Other items
Other items increased to £12.1 million (H1 2015: £1.9 million) mainly due to the increase in the Industrial
Disease Claims ("IDC") provision of £9.7m (see IDC commentary below), £0.6 million of IDC costs (H1
2015: £0.2 million) and £1.8 million (H1 2015: £1.7 million) of post-acquisition charges, including
amortisation of acquired intangible assets relating to Motherwell Bridge and Cape Engineering Services.
Share of post-tax profit from joint ventures
The post-tax profit of £2.8 million (H1 2015: £0.1 million) is attributable to the joint venture in Azerbaijan
driven by increased volumes from construction projects and the BP maintenance contract.
Operating profit
Operating profit from continuing operations was £6.8 million (H1 2015: £22.8 million) comprising an
adjusted operating profit of £18.9 million (H1 2015: £25.1 million) less exceptional and other items of £12.1
million (H1 2015: £2.3 million).
Finance costs
Net finance costs increased to £5.4 million (H1 2015: £5.2 million) including a £1.6 million (H1 2015: £1.7
million) non-cash charge relating to the unwinding of the discount on the long-term IDC provision, interest
income on the IDC scheme funds in the period of £0.2 million (H1 2015: £0.2 million) and interest income
on the defined benefit pension assets of £0.1 million (H1 2015: £0.2 million).
Adjusted finance costs increased to £4.1 million (H1 2015: £3.9 million) with interest cover (calculated by
dividing adjusted operating profit by the adjusted finance costs) decreasing to 4.6 times (H1 2015: 6.4
times).
Profit before tax
Profit before tax from continuing operations was £1.4 million (H1 2015: £17.6 million) reflecting an
operating profit of £6.8 million (H1 2015: £22.8 million) less net finance costs of £5.4 million (H1 2015: £5.2
million).
Taxation
The tax charge on business performance profit before tax was £3.0 million (H1 2015: £4.5 million) equating
to an effective tax rate of 20% (H1 2015: 21%).
Earnings per share
For continuing operations adjusted diluted earnings per share were 8.9p (H1 2015: 13.2p) and adjusted
basic earnings per share were 8.9p (H1 2015: 13.2p). For total operations the basic earnings per share
were 0.2p (H1 2015: 10.3p). The diluted weighted number of shares increased to 121.4 million (H1 2015:
121.1 million).
Dividend
Taking account of these financial results, current market conditions and the underlying prospects of the
Group, an interim dividend of 4.5p  per share, in line with the 2015 interim dividend (H1 2015: 4.5p), was
approved by the Board on 22 August 2016. The dividend will be payable on 7 October 2016 to
shareholders on the register as at 9 September 2016.

1 The Interim Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement is available within the primary statements of this document, and is
supported by note 16 of these interim results.
2 Prior year figures have been restated to exclude Hong Kong operations which were discontinued in 2015.
Working capital
Investment in trade and other receivables and inventories increased by £41.2 million to £252.7 million (31
December 2015: £211.5 million) although largely offset by an increase in trade and other payables of £30.8
million to £151.6 million (31 December 2015: £120.8 million) resulting in an overall increase in net working
capital of £10.4 million (at balance sheet rates) to £101.1 million (31 December 2015: £90.7m).
Key drivers to the working capital increase are:
·      higher working capital requirement in the UK for the ExxonMobil contract at Fawley
·      increased working capital investment in the Middle East region
The increase in working capital is less than the equivalent period last year and this drives the improvement
in adjusted operating cash flow to adjusted operating profit to 73.0% (H1 2015: 4.8%).
Capital expenditure
Gross capital expenditure was £8.0 million (H1 2015: £7.4 million) mainly comprising the purchase of
additional scaffold and other equipment for projects in newer locations. The Asset Replacement Ratio
(calculated by dividing gross capital expenditure spend by the depreciation charge) decreased to 92% (H1
2015: 94%).
Financing
The Group's adjusted net debt decreased by £17.6 million at 3 July 2016 to £113.7 million compared to the
same period in the prior year (5 July 2015: £131.3 million) including finance lease obligations of £3.0
million (5 July 2015: £2.9 million).  This includes £1.6 million of banking fees relating to the banking facility
entered into in February 2014 and £2.1 million of fees relating to the amendment of the banking facility in
June 2016 (5 July 2015: £2.4 million). Balance sheet gearing, excluding ring-fenced IDC Scheme funds,
decreased to 80% (31 December 2015: 85%; 5 July 2015: 103%).
During the first half of the year, the Company agreed to amend and extend its existing revolving credit
facility, increasing the facility by a further £5 million to £300 million and retaining the £50 million accordion
feature. The facility has a contractual maturity of 23 June 2020, extending the existing debt facility by two
years, with an option to extend the facility by a further year by mutual consent.
Financial review (continued)
Provision for pensions
The defined benefit pension scheme had a net surplus of £4.8 million as at 3 July 2016 (H1 2015: £12.2
million) and continues to be restricted to £nil in the accounts under IFRIC 14.
Provision for estimated future asbestos related liabilities and IDC Scheme funds
As previously disclosed, Cape and the Scheme are subject to new legal developments and new types of
claim as legal precedent in the area of industrial disease claims continues to evolve.  Aviva has brought
one such new type of claim, seeking to establish contribution and indemnity claims ("Insurer EL Claims")
from Cape towards employee liability settlements that it has made in response to policies that Aviva
underwrote for a liquidated Cape subsidiary during the period 1956 to 1966 and for which Aviva has
already benefited from the associated insurance premiums.
Following a sequence of court hearings culminating in a determinant judgment on 19th July 2016, some
elements of the judgment were found in favour of Cape and some against.  Cape is seeking leave to appeal
a number of aspects of this litigation.  Nevertheless the Board believes it to be prudent to increase the
provision held against industrial disease claims by £9.7 million to take account of the current
judgment.  This provision represents the Board's best estimate, based on the current information available
to it, of both the liability relating to the Insurer EL Claims currently being brought by Aviva and the
discounted present value of potential future claims of a similar nature, using the same actuarial and
economic assumptions as disclosed in note 28 to the Group's 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
Given the increase in the provision, and subject to the outcome of any appeal, the Company currently
intends to make an additional payment of approximately £9 million by 31st December 2016 into the ring-
fenced Scheme Fund in order to meet the funding requirements of the Scheme. This will permit the
Company to continue to make dividend payments without recourse to the Scheme trustees.
The discounted provision increased to £104.2 million (31 December 2015: £95.5 million) reflecting the
unwinding of the discount of £1.6 million in the half year (H1 2015: £1.7 million), £2.6 million (H1 2015: £3.5
million) utilised in the period and the increase of £9.7 million to take account of the recent judgment.
The ring-fenced IDC Scheme funds reduced by £0.7 million (H1 2015: £2.4 million reduction) comprising
cash settlements and costs paid to scheme claimants of £1.4 million (H1 2015: £2.6 million) offset by a top-
up receipt of £0.5 million (H1 2015: nil) and income interest of £0.2 million (H1 2015: £0.2 million) in the
period, shown as finance income other items in the Condensed Consolidated Income Statement.
Other provisions
Other provisions have fallen from £8.2 million at 31 December 2015 to £7.6 million as at 3 July 2016 as a
result of utilisations of £0.7 million, offset by foreign exchange of £0.1 million.
Related parties
As at 3 July 2016, there was a balance of £6.9 million (H1 2015: £11.5 million; 31 December 2015: £7.4
million) owed by joint ventures.
Currencies
Nearly all operating costs are matched with corresponding revenues of the same currency and as such
there is little transactional currency risk in the Group. Currency translation had a 1% favourable impact on
revenue for the half year, due to weakening of Sterling against the US dollar and the Australian dollar.
The following significant exchange rates against Sterling applied during the half year:

Re-domiciliation
Further to the passing by shareholders of Resolution 16 at this year's AGM (as confirmed on the 11 May
2016), Cape completed its re-domiciliation of the Company's centre of management to the UK from
Singapore with effect from 4 July 2016.
Financial review (continued)
Changes to segmental reporting
The Group has re-organised its geographical reporting segments during the period as outlined below. The
change in reporting segments has been performed to align external reporting with the revised internal
management structure. All prior year figures have been restated accordingly.

Principal risks
Cape operates globally in the energy and natural resources sectors and in varied geographic markets.
Cape's performance and prospects may be affected by risks and uncertainties in relation to the industry and
the environments in which it undertakes its operations around the world. Those risks range from external
geo-political, security and economic conditions such as geo-political events, sanctions, terrorist events,
disease outbreaks or environmental hazards; key client and market dependency risks; operational risks
including HSE, contracting, project execution; and generic financial risks. In 2016 the price of oil has
remained low; the Group has assessed this risk and will continue to monitor the situation closely and
respond with mitigating actions as appropriate.
There are two specific sources of risk associated with the Group's historical IDC legacy liabilities. The first
relates to the inherent uncertainty in predicting the future level of asbestos related industrial disease claims
and of the costs arising from such claims relating to the existing liabilities for which the Board believes the
Group to be liable. There can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will
result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred. As such, the provision may be
subject to potentially material revisions from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of
future events.
The second source of IDC risk relates to any change in legal precedent or judgment that leads to a material
expansion of the scope of liability for which the Group is held to be liable in the future. The Group has
previously disclosed an increase in the number of product liability claims received from insurance
companies ("Insurer PL Claims") that have been experienced by the Group. The Board has received legal
advice from leading counsel that these Insurer PL Claims place very substantial evidential burdens upon
the insurer claimants, are based upon novel legal arguments and are without precedent. Accordingly, the
Board believes these claims to be without merit and the Group is vigorously defending them. The risks
relating to industrial disease claims and the associated impact on the Group and its stakeholders are
described in note 35 to the Group's 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
Following the decision by the UK to exit the European Union, the adverse impact on the value of the IDC
provision from changes in economic factors has been mitigated by favourable movements in other actuarial
assumptions. When determining the appropriate level of provision, the Board has considered various
potential, threatened and actual claim types which, relying on appropriate legal advice, it does not believe
to have legal merit and which are, accordingly not provided for.
The Board currently considers that there is no material direct impact on the Group's trading following the
decision of the UK to leave the European Union.
We operate across a number of economies and jurisdictions which therefore exposes the Group to a range
of tax laws that vary significantly and are rapidly evolving toward global transparency and harmonisation.
Uncertainty may occur when the Group is required to interpret laws and treaties.
The Group is alert to the challenges of managing risk and has systems and procedures in place across the
Group to identify, assess and mitigate major business risks. As part of the long term, strategic Operational
Excellence programme the Group continues to improve its detailed process of project risk identification and
mitigation from contract tender through to project completion.
The Directors have reviewed risk and related controls at the half year. The Directors consider that the
nature of the principal risks and uncertainties which may have a material effect on the Group's performance
in the second half of the year is unchanged from those detailed on pages 18 to 25 of the Group's 2015
Annual Report and Accounts.
Going concern
After making the appropriate enquiries, the Directors have reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore
continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its interim condensed consolidated financial
statements.

Statement of Directors' Responsibilities
The Interim Report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The Directors are
responsible for preparing the Interim Report in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules
("DTR") of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA").
The DTR require that the accounting policies and presentation applied to the half yearly figures must be
consistent with those applied in the latest published annual accounts, except where the accounting policies
and presentation are to be changed in the subsequent annual accounts, in which case the new accounting
policies and presentation should be followed, and the changes and the reasons for the changes should be
disclosed in the Interim report, unless the United Kingdom's FCA agrees otherwise.
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge the condensed set of financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting'
as adopted by the European Union give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and
profit and loss of the Group, as required by DTR 4.2.2 and in particular include a fair review of:
•      the important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact
on the interim condensed consolidated set of financial statements as required by DTR 4.2.7R;
•      the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining half of the year as required by DTR 4.2.7R; and
•      related party transactions that have taken place in the first half of the current financial year and changes
in the related party transactions described in the previous annual report that have materially affected the
financial position or performance of the Group during the first half of the current financial year as required by
DTR 4.2.8R.
The Directors of Cape plc are listed in the Group's 2015 Annual Report and Accounts. During the current
period Samantha Tough has resigned as a director with effect from 31 August 2016 and Mary Reilly has
been appointed to the Board with effect from 1 September 2016.

Independent review report to Cape plc
Introduction
We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half
yearly financial report for the six months ended 3 July 2016 which comprises the Interim Condensed
Consolidated Income Statement, Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income,
Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, Interim Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Changes in Equity, Interim Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related
explanatory notes. We have read the other information contained in the half yearly financial report and
considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information
in the condensed set of financial statements.
This report is made solely to the company in accordance with guidance contained in International Standard
on Review Engagements 2410 (UK and Ireland) "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Auditing Practices Board. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company, for our work, for this
report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
Directors' Responsibilities
The half yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The
directors are responsible for preparing the half yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in note 2, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRSs
as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements included in this half yearly
financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim
Financial Reporting", as adopted by the European Union.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements
in the half yearly financial report based on our review.
Scope of Review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and
Ireland) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity"
issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial
information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than
an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of
financial statements in the half yearly financial report for the six months ended 3 July 2016 is not prepared,
in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted by the
European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct
Authority.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1.     Corporate information
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cape plc and its subsidiaries, collectively "the
Group" for the period ended 3 July 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the
Directors on 22 August 2016.
Cape plc, "the Company" or "the Parent", is a limited company incorporated in Jersey and resident in the
United Kingdom and Jersey whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The
registered office is located at 47 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey JE1 0BD. The Group is principally engaged
in the provision of critical industrial services focused on the energy and natural resource sectors.
2.   Basis of preparation
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended 3 July 2016 have been
prepared in accordance with IAS 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union and
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. The interim condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the Group's
annual audited consolidated financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the Group's
annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 which are
prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.
The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in preparation of the Group's interim
condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those followed in the preparation of the
Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, except for the
adoption of new standards and interpretations effective as of 1 January 2016.
Adoption of new standards and interpretations
Several new standards and amendments apply for the first time in 2016, however they do not have a
significant impact on the annual financial statements of the Group or the interim condensed consolidated
financial statements of the Group. These new standards and amendments are listed below:
-   Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests
-   Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and
Amortisation
-   Amendments to IAS 27: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements
-   Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
-   Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception
-   Annual Improvements Cycle 2012-2014
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but
is not yet effective.
Restatement of prior year comparatives
As a result of the discontinuation of operations in Hong Kong during 2015, the prior period figures for the
period ended 5 July 2015 in the interim condensed consolidated income statement and the interim
condensed consolidated cash flow statement have been restated, together with any associated notes.
The Group has re-organised its geographical reporting segments during the period as outlined in note 5.
The change in reporting segments has been performed to align external reporting with the revised internal
management structure. All prior period figures have been restated accordingly in note 5 'Segment
Information'.
Estimates
The preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
In preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the significant judgements made
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty
were in line with those that applied to the Group's annual audited consolidated financial statements for the
year ended 31 December 2015.
Foreign exchange
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in two key currencies. The movements in exchange rates for
these two currencies against Sterling are detailed below:

3.   Cape specific accounting measures
To be able to provide readers with clear, meaningful and consistent presentation of financial performance,
the Group reflects its underlying financial results in the 'business performance' column within the interim
condensed consolidated income statement. Business performance excludes 'Other items' and 'Exceptional
items', which are considered non-operational in their nature and which are reported separately in a different
column within the interim condensed consolidated income statement.
Other items
Other items are those items which the Directors believe are relevant to the understanding of the result for
period and which are excluded from the adjusted measures. Other items include administration expenses,
financial incomes and financial costs associated with industrial disease claims and certain post-acquisition
charges, including amortisation of acquired intangibles arising from business combinations.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items which are of a non-recurring nature and, in the judgement of the
Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence. Items which may be
considered exceptional in nature include significant write-downs of goodwill and other assets, significant
changes in asset values as a result of changes in accounting estimates and restructuring costs.
4.   Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Certain of the Group's accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve subjective
judgements and the use of assumptions, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain
and susceptible to change.
Judgements
Areas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the interim
condensed consolidated financial statements are:
(i) Revenue recognition and assessment of long term contract performance
The Group generally accounts for long term construction contracts using the percentage of completion
method as performance of the contract progresses. This method requires judgement to determine accurate
estimates of the extent of progress towards contract completion and may involve estimates of the total
contract costs, remaining costs to completion, total revenues, contract risks and other judgements.
(ii) Carrying value of property, plant and equipment
Assessing whether property, plant and equipment may be impaired requires a review for indicators of
impairment and, where such indicators exist, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount by reference to
value in use. Management are required to exercise significant judgement in reviewing for and identifying
asset indicators of impairment and subsequently calculating value in use.
(iii) Trade and other receivables
The Group provides for likely non-recovery of receivables to the extent that the carrying value is less than
the present value of expected future cash flows.  Assessing the value of the provision requires significant
management judgement and review of individual receivables based upon individual customer
creditworthiness, current economic trends and analysis of historical bad debts.
(iv) Tax
The Group recognises deferred tax assets on all applicable temporary differences where it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available for utilisation. This requires management to make judgements and
assumptions regarding the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised based on the magnitude and
likelihood of future taxable profits.
The Group has a number of uncertain tax positions that are yet to be resolved.  Provisions have been made
where it is probable an economic outflow will be required to settle an obligation and where the amount can
be reliably estimated. The Board believes no further provision or disclosure is required in respect of these
uncertain positions.
(v) Defined benefit pension plans
The cost and the obligation of the Group's defined benefit pension plans are based on a number of
selection assumptions; these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, longevity and expected
return on the assets of the plans. Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in
assumptions will be reflected in future periods.
Estimates
The key assumptions affected by future uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing material
adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are:
(i) Onerous contracts
Provision is made for future losses on long term contracts where it is considered that the contract costs are
likely to exceed revenues in future years. Estimating future losses involves assumptions of contract
performance targets and likely levels of future cost escalation over time.
4.   Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
(ii) Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. This requires estimation of the value in use of the cash-
generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Calculation of value in use requires estimation of
expected future cash flows from each of the cash-generating units and also to determine a suitable discount
rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Management have reviewed the assumptions made
as part of the goodwill impairment review carried out for the year ended 31 December 2015 and have not
identified an impairment of goodwill in any of the cash generating units.
(iii) Provision for industrial disease claims
To the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated as at 3 July 2016, a provision has been made for the
costs which the Group is expected to incur in respect of lodged and future industrial disease claims for
which the Board believes the Group to be liable arising on alleged exposure to previously manufactured
asbestos products, notwithstanding the matters disclosed under note 18 'Industrial disease claim provision
and contingent liabilities'. The most recent full actuarial valuation was performed in 2013 and the next full
valuation is scheduled to be completed in early 2017 in respect of the period up to 31 December 2016. The
amount of the provision is based on historic patterns of claim numbers and monetary settlements as well as
published tables of projected disease incidence. Key assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level
of provision include the period over which future claims can be expected, the nature of claims received, the
rate at which claims will be filed, the rate of successful resolution as well as future trends in both
compensation payments and legal costs. Management monitors claims received on an ongoing basis as
well as any other factors which would require a change to the assumptions or trigger a full actuarial review
in the current year. During the period, the value of the provision was increased by £8.7 million, largely
reflecting the adverse legal judgement in Insurer EL claims, as reported in note 18.
(iv) Income tax
Group entities can be subject to routine tax audits and also a process whereby tax computations are
discussed and agreed with the appropriate authorities. Whilst the ultimate outcome of such tax audits and
discussions cannot be determined with certainty, management estimates the level of required tax
provisions on the basis of professional advice and the nature of current discussions with the tax authority
concerned.
5.   Segment information
The Group has re-organised its geographical reporting segments during the period. The change in
reporting segments has been performed to align external reporting with the revised internal management
structure. Sakhalin is now reported within 'Asia Pacific' and both Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are now
reported within 'Middle East', with these having all previously been reported within 'UK, Europe & CIS'.
Additionally, the 'UK, Europe & CIS' segment has been renamed 'UK' and 'MENA' has been renamed
'Middle East'. All prior period figures have been restated accordingly. The following tables represent
revenue and profit information for the Group's operating segments for the period ended 3 July 2016 and 5
July 2015 respectively:

10. Income tax
The Group's effective tax rate on its business performance of 20% (H1 2015: 21%) is calculated using the
tax rate that would be applicable to the expected total annual earnings. The income tax expense for the
period decreased by £3.9m to £0.2m (H1 2015: £4.1m) due to a decrease in profits and a change in the
geographic mix of profits.
Factors affecting current and future tax charges
Profits arising in the Company for the 2016 year of assessment will be subject to Jersey tax at the standard
corporate income tax rate of 0%.
As a Group involved in worldwide operations, Cape is subject to several factors that may affect future tax
charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, tax rates imposed and tax
regime reforms. Legislation has been enacted in the UK to reduce the standard rate of corporation tax to
19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020.
11. Earnings per ordinary share
The basic earnings per share calculation for the half year ended 3 July 2016 is based on the profit
attributable to equity shareholders of £0.2 million (H1 2015: £12.4 million) divided by the weighted average
number of 25p ordinary shares of 121,019,813 (H1 2015: 121,072,777).
The diluted earnings per share calculation for the half year ended 3 July 2016 is based on the profit
attributable to equity shareholders of £0.2 million (H1 2015: £12.4 million) divided by the diluted weighted
average number of 25p ordinary shares of 121,429,319 (H1 2015: diluted weighted average of
121,072,777). Share options and awards are considered dilutive when the average share price during the
period is higher than the average exercise price of the option or award and attainment of attaching
performance criteria can be determined with appropriate certainty.

The adjusted earnings per share calculations have been calculated after excluding the impact of other
items and exceptional items (note 7), finance income and costs associated with industrial disease claims
(note 9) and the tax impact of these items. Options are dilutive at the level of adjusted profit from continuing
operations level. If options are dilutive, then in accordance with IAS 33, these are treated as dilutive for the
purpose of adjusted diluted earnings per share.
12. Dividend
A final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015 of 9.5 pence per share, amounting to £11.5
million, was paid in the period ended 3 July 2016.
An interim dividend of 4.5 pence (H1 2015: 4.5 pence) per share, in line with the 2015 interim dividend, was
approved by the Board on 22 August 2016. The dividend will be payable on 7 October 2016 to
shareholders on the register as at 9 September 2016.
13. Property, plant and equipment
During the period ended 3 July 2016, the Group acquired assets with a cost of £8.0 million (H1 2015: £7.4
million) and received proceeds from asset sales of £0.9 million (H1 2015: £0.3 million) arising from assets
with a carrying amount of £1.0 million (H1 2015: £0.2 million). Net capital expenditure of £7.1 million (H1
2015: £7.1 million) shown in the cash flow statement represents the actual cash outflow and therefore
excludes purchases funded through finance leases.

The fair values of short term deposits, loans and other borrowings with a maturity of less than one year are
assumed to approximate to their book values. In the case of the bank loans and other borrowings due in
more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting
the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar
financial instruments.

The fair value of the investment property is based upon a valuation as at 31 December 2015 performed by
an accredited independent valuer, who is a specialist in valuing investment properties. Fair values of the
Group's interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by using a DCF method with a discount rate
that reflects the issuer's borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period.
There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the period.

As at 3 July 2016, 84,404 (5 July 2015: 31,160) treasury shares were held in an employee benefit trust.
During April 2016, the Cape plc Employee Benefit Trust purchased 330,000 ordinary shares in the capital
of the Company for the purpose of enabling the Trustee to satisfy existing awards and future awards
granted by the Company. As at the period ended 3 July 2016, 276,756 options had been exercised, with
the remaining 53,244 shares being held in the employee benefit trust in addition to the amount previously
held of 31,160.
plc Scheme Share
The plc Scheme Share is held by the Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc on behalf of the Scheme
creditors.
The rights attaching to the share are designed to ensure that Scheme assets are only used to settle
Scheme claims and ancillary costs and do not confer any right to receive a distribution or return of surplus
capital save that the holder will have the right to require the Company to redeem the share at par value on
or at any time after the termination of the Scheme.
The share carries two votes for every vote which the holders of the other classes of shares in issue are
entitled to exercise on any resolution proposed during the life of the Scheme to engage in certain activities
specified in the Company's Articles of Association. The Company will not be permitted to engage in certain
activities specified in the Company's Articles of Association without the prior consent
of the holder of the share.

18. Industrial disease claim provision and contingent liabilities
The Board considers that the provision of £104.2m for industrial disease claims as at 3 July 2016 captures
all expected material industrial disease scheme liabilities for which the Board believes the Group to be
liable at the balance sheet date.
The Group continues to receive claims, from both individuals and insurance companies, in connection with
historical alleged exposure to asbestos. Where claims are determined to have merit, the costs are provided
for and claims are settled in the ordinary course, otherwise claims are defended. As legal precedent in the
area of industrial disease claims continues to evolve, new developments and new types of claims give rise
to inherent uncertainty in both the future level of asbestos-related disease claims and of the legal and other
costs arising from such claims. If any such claims were to be successful, it might lead to future claims
against the Group which may result in significant additional liability over and above that recognised under
the current provision.
Aviva plc has brought one such new type of claim, seeking to establish contribution and indemnity claims
("Insurer EL Claims") against Cape Intermediate Holdings Limited ("CIH") in respect of employee liability
settlements that it has made in response to policies that Aviva underwrote for a liquidated Cape subsidiary
during the period 1956 to 1966 and for which Aviva has already benefited from the associated insurance
premiums. CIH is a Cape Scheme company and the Board has received legal advice from leading counsel
that the Insurer EL Claims would constitute scheme claims as defined in the Cape Scheme. Details of the
Cape Scheme have been filed with the Registrar of Companies and can also be found on the Cape plc
website (http://www.capeplc.com/corporate-responsibility/asbestos-scheme-of-arrangement.aspx).
18. Industrial disease claim provision and contingent liabilities (continued)
A sequence of preliminary court hearings in respect of the Insurer EL Claims culminated in a determinant
judgment on 19 July 2016, with some issues found in favour of CIH and some against. CIH is seeking leave
to appeal a number of aspects of this litigation. Nevertheless, the Board announced on 20 July 2016 that it
believed it to be prudent to increase the provision held against industrial disease claims by £9.7 million to
take account of this judgment. This provision represents the Board's best estimate, based on the current
information available to it, of both the liability relating to the Insurer EL Claims currently being brought by
Aviva and the discounted present value of potential future claims of a similar nature, using the same
actuarial and economic assumptions as disclosed in note 28 to the Group's 2015 Report and Accounts.
Given the increase in the provision, and subject to the outcome of any appeal, the Company currently
intends to make an additional payment of approximately £9 million by 31 December 2016 into the ring-
fenced Scheme Fund in order to meet the funding requirements of the Cape Scheme. This will permit the
Company to continue to make dividend payments without recourse to the Cape Scheme trustees.
Additionally, the Group has previously disclosed a number of product liability claims received by the Group.
In particular, CIH has received claims from both Aviva plc and RSA Group in respect of historic and current
payments made by them in their capacity as providers of employer liability insurance in relation to claims by
employees and former employees of third-party companies arising from asbestos-related diseases ("Insurer
PL Claims"). All the Insurer PL Claims relate to damages and costs paid by the relevant insurer in respect
of claims arising from mesothelioma disease.
A six-week trial in respect of the Insurer PL Claims has been listed to commence on 16 January 2017. The
Board has received legal advice from leading counsel that the Insurer PL Claims place very substantial
evidential burdens upon the claimants. As a result of the legal advice received, the Board continues to
believe that these Insurer PL claims are without merit and they are therefore being vigorously defended;
accordingly no provision has been made. The Board intends to provide an updated disclosure in the event
of any material change in the legal position in respect of the Insurer PL Claims as progress is made in the
preparation for the trial in January 2017. The Board has also received legal advice from leading counsel
that these Insurer PL Claims would constitute scheme claims as defined in the Cape Scheme.
Cape's potential liability in respect of the Insurer PL Claims outlined above and from any potential further
claims and associated costs cannot be accurately estimated at this time. Notwithstanding that the Board
believes that the Insurer PL claims do not have a realistic chance of succeeding, an adverse decision of the
court could have material and continuing impacts on the Group and its stakeholders, including but not
limited to impacting the implementation of the Group's strategic plans, potentially including the Company's
capacity to pay a dividend and a material reduction in the percentage of each claim paid out to individual
claimants (in respect of damages and claimant legal costs) under the Cape Scheme.
During 2014, a fatality of a Cape employee was suffered at a client's offshore installation. The investigation
by the enforcing authorities is ongoing. At the date of the statement of financial position no amounts have
been provided in respect of this matter. It is not practicable to provide an estimate of the financial effect and
there is uncertainty relating to the amount or timing of any outflow.
The Group is responding to an enquiry by HMRC with regard to the UK tax consequences of a transfer of
intellectual property to Singapore in 2011. HMRC has challenged the accounting treatment adopted in the
audited financial statements, and the gain arising thereon. Cape's analysis is that the accounting treatment
applied is correct and in line with the relevant accounting standards. A recent tax tribunal determined that
the accounting treatment adopted in a case which has similarities with the accounting for the transfer of the
Cape intellectual property was in line with the accounting standards being applied, and that a company
cannot be forced to apply a different interpretation where the treatment adopted is valid. The Board expects
to successfully defend against the HMRC challenge based on tax and accounting advice received. The
possible UK corporation tax liability that may arise in connection with the enquiry is up to £14 million as at 3
July 2016.
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees and bonds entered into in the normal course
of business, in respect of which no loss is expected. The Group is required to issue trade finance
instruments to certain customers; these include tender bonds, performance bonds, retention bonds,
advance payment bonds and standby letters of credit. As at 3 July 2016, the Group's bank facilities relating
to the issue of bonds, guarantees and letters of credit amounted to £72.2 million (H1 2015: £52.6 million).
19. Related parties
As at 3 July 2016, there was a balance of £6.9 million (H1 2015: £11.5 million; 31 December 2015: £7.4
million) owed by joint ventures. These amounts are unsecured, have no fixed date of repayment and are
repayable on demand. Amounts owed by joint ventures are assessed for recoverability and, where
necessary, provided for in line with normal commercial transactions. Revenue arising from transactions
with joint ventures in the first half of 2016 was £6.8 million (H1 2015: £10.9 million; 31 December 2015:
£20.6 million).
