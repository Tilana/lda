<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 62/161 entitled, &#8220;The right to development&#8221;, the General Assembly 
reaffirmed the request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 
mainstreaming the right to development, to undertake effectively activities aimed at 
strengthening the global partnership for development between Member States, development 
agencies and the international development, financial and trade institutions, and to reflect those 
activities in detail in her next report to the Human Rights Council. The General Assembly also 
requested the Secretary-General to submit a report at its sixty-third session, an interim report to 
the Council on the implementation of resolution 62/161, including efforts undertaken at the 
national, regional and international levels in the promotion and realization of the right to 
development, and invited the Chairperson of the Working Group on the Right to Development to 
present a verbal update to the Assembly at its sixty-third session. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted in accordance with the above-mentioned requests. 
</p>
<p><b>ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
 RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
continued to provide organizational, substantive and analytical support to the open-ended 
Working Group on the Right to Development, which is mandated to monitor and review progress 
made in the promotion and implementation of the right to development, providing 
recommendations and further analysing obstacles to its full enjoyment. 
</p><p>4. In addition, OHCHR continued to provide similar support to the high-level task force on 
the implementation of the right to development, established under Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2004/7. The objective of the task force is to provide the necessary expertise to the 
Working Group to enable it to make appropriate recommendations to various actors on the 
issues identified for the implementation of the right to development. The task force 
comprises five experts nominated by the Chairperson of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development. 
</p>
<p>5. The criteria adopted by the Working Group in 2006 for the periodic evaluation of global 
partnerships for development - as identified in Millennium Development Goal 8 - from the 
perspective of the right to development (&#8220;the right-to-development criteria&#8221;) and their 
subsequent application, refinement and progressive development constitute important steps 
forward towards the operationalization of the right to development, reflecting the concrete and 
pragmatic approach taken by the Working Group in its deliberations. The efforts to 
operationalize the right to development through the progressive development of the criteria have 
contributed to the creation of an environment conducive to undertaking activities aimed at 
strengthening global partnerships for development between Member States, development 
agencies and the international development, financial and trade institutions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A. Implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group 
on the Right to Development at its eighth session 
</b></p>
<p>6. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 4/4 of 30 March 2007, which 
endorsed the recommendations of the eighth session of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights undertook preparations 
for the implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group recommended that the task force adopt a gradual approach based on 
rigorous empirical analysis and constructive consolidation of its findings in a phased manner, 
identifying three phases of a work programme. In phase I, covering work in 2007, the task force 
was requested to deepen its study on the three development partnerships considered in its third 
session, and take up an additional partnership, namely the Cotonou Partnership Agreement 
between African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the European Union (EU). In 
phase II, covering work in 2008, the task force is requested to study additional partnerships with 
a view to broaden its coverage of the regions implementing development partnerships, as well as 
its analysis of thematic issues of international cooperation identified under Millennium 
Development Goal 8 and as agreed by the Working Group at its ninth session. Finally, in 
phase III, covering work in 2009, the task force is requested to consolidate its findings and 
present a revised list of right-to-development criteria, along with corresponding operational 
sub-criteria and to outline suggestions for further work, including aspects of international 
cooperation not covered until then, for the consideration of the Working Group 
(see A/HRC/4/47, paras. 54 and 56). 
</p>
<p>8. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in furtherance of the 
implementation envisaged for phase I, provided organizational, research and analytical support 
to three technical missions conducted by the high-level task force to respective institutions 
involved in the implementation of the identified partnerships, namely the African Peer Review 
Mechanism (APRM), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)/Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee 
(OECD-DAC) Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness in the context of the New 
Partnership for Africa&#8217;s Development (NEPAD), the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 
and the Cotonou Partnership Agreement between ACP countries and the EU. The technical 
missions carried out in Paris, Brussels and Addis Ababa were aimed at establishing and 
continuing dialogue with respective partners providing an empirical basis for progressively 
developing and refining the right-to-development criteria. The respective partners included 
OECD-DAC, ECA, the ACP secretariat, the Directorates-General of Trade and Development of 
the European Commission and civil society representatives. In addition, OHCHR commissioned 
and oversaw the preparation of three expert studies on the various partnerships to provide 
substantive input into the fourth session of the task force. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Fourth session of the high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>9. The fourth session of the task force was held from 7 to 15 January 2008 in Geneva. The 
task force continued its tradition of encouraging a constructive dialogue amongst the various 
actors, including task force members, experts who prepared the commissioned studies, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>representatives of the institutional members of the task force, and representatives of the 
organizations involved in the above-mentioned partnerships. Member States participated as 
observers in the rich and fruitful discussions at the session. 
</p>
<p>10. The task force concluded its assessment of three of the four partnerships which had been 
assessed at its third session and undertook a preliminary review of the Cotonou Partnership 
Agreement between European Union (EU) and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. 
The task force also initiated a preliminary discussion of phase II of the work plan regarding 
additional partnerships in the context of Goal 8. 
</p>
<p>11. Building upon the experience gained through pilot applications of the criteria to the 
selected global partnerships, the task force reviewed and refined the criteria to be applied 
during phase II (2008) as an intermediary step towards a more significant refinement in  
phase III (2009). 
</p>
<p>12. In its report (A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF.2), the task force recommends a continued dialogue and 
follow-up activities with the institutional partners mentioned above, such as the provision of 
input to the second report of the ECA/OECD-DAC Mutual Review of Development 
Effectiveness, a second round of technical missions for the Cotonou Partnership Agreement and 
the APRM, as well as participation, subject to an invitation, at the third High Level Forum on 
Aid Effectiveness to be held in Accra in September 2008. The task force also recommended, 
in the context of additional partnerships for assessment, that priority be given to the region of 
Latin America and the Caribbean in terms of geographical expansion and to the issues of access 
to affordable essential drugs, debt relief, and trading and financial systems in terms of thematic 
expansion. 
</p>
<p>13. The report of the task force, including its conclusions and recommendations, will be 
submitted to the ninth session of the Working Group on the Right to Development. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Legal framework for implementing the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>14. OHCHR participated in an expert meeting organized by the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation to 
discuss legal perspectives involved in implementing the right to development, which was held in 
Bossey, Switzerland, from 4 to 6 January 2008. The meeting was attended by a number of 
international experts, including some members of the task force and the Chairperson of the 
Working Group on the Right to Development who participated in their personal capacities. 
Discussions during the meeting focused on the right to development as a legal norm and the 
experience with existing standards relating to the right to development at the global and regional 
levels. The expert meeting also covered practical issues regarding a legal framework for 
implementing the right to development and its impact at the international and national levels. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Aid effectiveness and the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>15. Aid effectiveness, with its emphasis on ownership, harmonization, alignment, managing 
for results and mutual accountability, aims to increase the impact of aid in reducing poverty and 
inequality and accelerating the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. OHCHR has 
followed closely various initiatives undertaken in preparation for the next High Level Forum on 
Aid Effectiveness, which will take stock of and review progress in implementing the Paris </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Declaration and broaden consensus on the critical importance of aid effectiveness and 
development results. The links between aid effectiveness and the right to development were 
explored during the third and fourth sessions of the high-level task force on the implementation 
of the right to development. The main challenge identified by the task force is for donors and 
creditors to improve aid relationships within the framework of the international human rights 
obligations, with particular emphasis on ensuring that aid efficiency is not at the expense of its 
effectiveness in achieving gender equality, poverty reduction and human rights, in particular, the 
right to development.  In this context and building upon the work of the high-level task force and 
the Working Group on the Right to Development, OHCHR has gradually been forging informal 
partnerships with relevant international development institutions and United Nations agencies 
with a view to integrating a perspective of human rights, including the right to development in 
particular, in the aid effectiveness agenda. 
</p>
<p>16. In this regard, OHCHR also participated in a two-day workshop in London, held on 12 
and 13 March 2008, hosted by the Department for International Development (DFID) of the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on &#8220;Strengthening the development 
results and impacts of the Paris Declaration on aid effectiveness through work on gender 
equality, social exclusion and human rights&#8221;. The workshop&#8217;s objectives were to consolidate 
evidence and good practice emerging from the implementation of the partnership commitments 
of the Paris Declaration to achieve social inclusion, human rights, environmental sustainability 
and gender equality and to identify key political messages and actionable commitments for the 
Accra Action Agenda. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Millennium Development Goals and poverty reduction 
</b></p>
<p>17. OHCHR continued to work closely with development partners at the international and 
national levels to explore how human rights, including the right to development, can support 
Member States&#8217; efforts to achieve inclusive development processes and equitable and sustainable 
poverty reduction outcomes. OHCHR continued to develop a conceptual framework to assess 
poverty reduction strategies from a human rights perspective which should contribute to further 
operationalizing the links between human rights and the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals. A draft publication on the Millennium Development Goals and human 
rights is under preparation to be launched in 2008, which is aimed at promoting a wider 
understanding among development practitioners and policymakers, on the linkages between the 
MDGs and human rights, including the close relationship between Goal 8 and the right to 
development. OHCHR also contributed to other United Nations agencies&#8217; work and publications 
on MDGs and poverty reduction strategies, emphasizing how both international and national 
responsibilities are critical for poverty reduction. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Globalization, trade and good governance 
</b></p>
<p>18. Exploring the impact of trade policies on the realization of human rights could contribute 
to the integration of the promotion and protection of the right to development in global 
development partnerships, including trade agreements. OHCHR continued its analytical and 
advocacy work on issues relating to globalization, trade and good governance, including a study 
of the relationship between trade, globalization and human rights, specifically in the areas of 
liberalization of trade in services, foreign direct investment, and trade-related aspects of 
intellectual property rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. OHCHR participated in the work and meetings of the United Nations Inter-Agency 
Taskforce on Gender and Trade, and provided input to the <i>World Investment Report 2007</i> issued 
by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). OHCHR is also in 
the process of preparing a publication designed to facilitate a better understanding of the 
interplay between human rights and trade in plain language that is understandable to human 
rights practitioners, trade practitioners and the broader public. Furthermore, the 
High Commissioner also recently contributed a chapter entitled &#8220;Placing human rights in the 
Geneva consensus&#8221; to a book entitled <i>WTO and Global Governance</i> to be published by the 
United Nations University this year. 
</p>
<p>20. OHCHR published a compilation of good governance practices for the promotion of 
human rights which illustrates specific governance reform initiatives that have had a positive 
impact on the protection of human rights. The publication consists of 21 case studies on 
governance reform initiatives selected from more than 120 submissions received from 
Governments, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations.
