GASTAR EXPLORATION INC.
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.Description of Business
Gastar Exploration Inc. (the “Company” or “Gastar”) is a pure play Mid-Continent independent
energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil, condensate,
natural gas and NGLs. Gastar’s principal business activities include the identification,
acquisition, and subsequent exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties with
an emphasis on unconventional reserves, such as shale resource plays. Gastar holds a
concentrated acreage position in what is believed to be the core of the STACK Play, an area of
central Oklahoma which is home to multiple oil and natural gas-rich reservoirs including the
Meramec, Oswego, Osage, Woodford and Hunton formations.   On April 8, 2016, Gastar sold
substantially all of its producing assets and proved reserves and a significant portion of its
undeveloped acreage in the Appalachian Basin for an adjusted sales price of $76.6 million,
subject to certain additional adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2016 (the
“Appalachian Basin Sale”).
For any date or period prior to January 31, 2014, “Gastar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and
similar terms refer collectively to Gastar Exploration, Inc. (formerly known as Gastar Exploration
Ltd.) and its subsidiaries, including Gastar Exploration Inc. (formerly known as Gastar Exploration
USA, Inc.), and for any date or period after January 31, 2014, such terms refer collectively to
Gastar Exploration Inc. and its subsidiaries.
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies followed by the Company are set forth in the notes to the Company’s
audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015 (the “2015 Form 10-K”) filed with the SEC. Please refer to the
notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K for additional
details of the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. No material
item included in those notes has changed except as a result of normal transactions in the interim
or as disclosed within this report.
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company included
herein are stated in U.S. dollars and were prepared from the records of the Company by
management in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to interim financial statements and reflect
all normal and recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to
provide a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial position for the interim
periods. Such financial statements conform to the presentation reflected in the 2015 Form 10-K.
The current interim period reported herein should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and accompanying notes, including Item 8. “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” included in the 2015
Form 10-K.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include
the estimate of proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and the related present value of
estimated future net cash flows.
The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the
consolidated accounts of all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have been made to conform to the current year
presentation; these reclassifications have no impact on net income (loss).
The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016  are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.
Subsequent Events
In preparing these financial statements, the Company has evaluated events and transactions for
potential recognition or disclosure through the date the financial statements were issued and has
disclosed certain subsequent events in these condensed consolidated financial statements, as
appropriate.
10
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are reported net of the allowance for doubtful accounts.  The allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined based on a review of the Company’s receivables.  Receivable
accounts are charged off when collection efforts have failed or the account is deemed
uncollectible.  At June 30, 2016, the Company determined that a receivable account from a third-
party natural gas and NGLs purchaser would no longer be collectible as a result of the third-party
purchaser filing for bankruptcy.  A summary of the activity related to the allowance for doubtful
accounts is as follows:

Recent Accounting Developments
The following recently issued accounting pronouncements may impact the Company in future
periods:
Compensation – Stock Compensation.  In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance as
part of its simplification initiative which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting
for stock-based compensation transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash
flows.  For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual
periods.  Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity
early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the
beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption
must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.  Amendments related to the timing of when
excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and
intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a
cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is
adopted.  Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of
cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding
requirement should be applied retrospectively.  Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax
benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating
expected term should be applied prospectively.  An entity may elect to apply the amendments
related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a
prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. The Company has not yet
determined what the effects of adopting this updated guidance will be on its consolidated
financial statements.
Leases.  In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to increase transparency and
comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the
balance sheet and enhance disclosures regarding key information about leasing
arrangements.  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
and a right-of-use asset for all leases. The new lease guidance also simplified the accounting for
sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and
lease liabilities. The amendments in this update are effective beginning on January 1, 2019 and
should be applied through a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or
entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has not yet determined what the effects
of adopting this updated guidance will be on its consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes.  In November 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance as part of its
simplification initiative for the presentation of deferred taxes.  Current GAAP requires an entity to
separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a
classified statement of financial position where such classification generally does not align with
the time period in which the recognized deferred tax amounts are expected to be recovered or
settled.  To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update
require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement
of financial position and apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial
position, resulting in the alignment of the presentation of deferred income tax assets and
liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IAS 1, Presentation of
Financial Statements. This guidance is effective for public business entities for financial
statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods
within those annual periods.  Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or
annual reporting period and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods
presented.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to materially impact its
consolidated financial statements.
11
Debt Issuance Costs. In April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance regarding simplification
of the presentation of debt issuance costs.  The updated guidance requires debt issuance costs
related to a recognized debt liability, other than those costs related to line of credit arrangements,
be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related
debt liability, similar to the presentation for debt discounts and premiums, instead of being
presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the
effective interest rate.  This guidance was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016.  The
Company’s adoption of this guidance was applied retrospectively and did not have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Going Concern.  In August 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance related to determining
whether substantial doubt exists about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern.  The
amendment provides guidance for determining whether conditions or events give rise to
substantial doubt that an entity has the ability to continue as a going concern within one year
following the date of issuance of annual and interim financial statements, and requires specific
disclosures regarding the conditions or events leading to substantial doubt.  The updated
guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual
periods and interim periods thereafter.  Earlier adoption is permitted, but the Company has not
elected to adopt the updated guidance early.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this
guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition.  In May 2014, the FASB issued an amendment to previously issued
guidance regarding the recognition of revenue, which supersedes the revenue recognition
requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,”
and most industry-specific guidance.  The FASB and the International Accounting Standards
Board initiated a joint project to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a
common standard that would (i) remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue
requirements, (ii) provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, (iii) improve
comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital
markets, (iv) provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved
disclosure requirements and (v) simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the
number of requirements to which an entity must refer.  The core principle of the guidance is that
an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services.  To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the
following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with the customer; (2) identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to
the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity
satisfies a performance obligation.  This guidance supersedes prior revenue recognition
requirements and most industry-specific guidance throughout the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification.  This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  In April 2015, the FASB
proposed to delay the effective date one year, beginning in fiscal year 2018 and such proposal
was subsequently adopted by the FASB in August 2015.  The Company is evaluating the new
guidance and has not yet determined the impact this new standard may have on its consolidated
financial statements or decided upon its method of adoption.
3.Property, Plant and Equipment
The amount capitalized as oil and natural gas properties was incurred for the purchase and
development of various properties in the U.S., located in the states of Oklahoma, Pennsylvania
and West Virginia.  On April 8, 2016, the Company sold substantially all of its producing assets
and proved reserves and a significant portion of its undeveloped acreage in Pennsylvania and
West Virginia comprising the Company’s Appalachian Basin assets.
The following table summarizes the components of unproved properties excluded from
amortization at the dates indicated:

Total unproved properties excluded from amortization $ 87,727
$ 1,533
    82,560
    8,516
  $ 92,609
The full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties requires a quarterly
calculation of a limitation on capitalized costs, often referred to as a full cost ceiling calculation.
The ceiling is the present value (discounted at 10% per annum) of estimated future cash flow
from proved oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs reserves reduced by future operating
expenses, development expenditures, abandonment costs (net of salvage) to the extent not
included in oil and natural gas properties pursuant to authoritative guidance and estimated future
income taxes thereon. To the extent that the Company's capitalized costs (net of accumulated
depletion and deferred taxes) exceed the ceiling at the end of the reported period, the excess
must be written off to
12
expense for such period. Once incurred, this impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not
reversible at a later date even if oil and natural gas prices increase. The ceiling calculation is
determined using a mandatory trailing 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-
of-the-month commodities pricing and costs in effect at the end of the period, each of which are
held constant indefinitely (absent specific contracts with respect to future prices and costs) with
respect to valuing future net cash flows from proved reserves for this purpose.  The 12-month
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodities prices are adjusted for
basis and quality differentials in determining the present value of the proved reserves.  The table
below sets forth relevant pricing assumptions utilized in the quarterly ceiling test computations for
the respective periods noted before adjustment for basis and quality differentials:

(1)For the respective periods, oil and natural gas prices are calculated using the trailing 12-
month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices based on Henry Hub
spot natural gas prices and West Texas Intermediate spot oil prices.
The Company could potentially incur further ceiling test impairments in 2016 should commodities
prices decline. However, it is difficult to project future impairment charges in light of numerous
variables involved.
The Company’s proved reserves estimates and their estimated discounted value and
standardized measure will also be impacted by changes in lease operating costs, future
development costs, production, exploration and development activities.  The ceiling limitation
calculation is not intended to be indicative of the fair market value of the Company’s proved
reserves or future results.

Appalachian Basin Sale
On February 19, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of
its producing assets and proved reserves and a significant portion of its undeveloped acreage in
the Appalachian Basin for $80.0 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.  Pursuant to
the agreement, on April 8, 2016, the Company completed the Appalachian Basin Sale for an
adjusted sales price of $76.6 million, subject to certain additional adjustments.  The Appalachian
Basin Sale is reflected as a reduction to the full cost pool and the Company did not record a gain
or loss related to the divestiture as it was not determined to be significant to the full cost pool and
did not result in a significant change to the depletion rate.
Appalachian Basin Sale Pro Forma Operating Results
The following unaudited pro forma results for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 show the effect on the Company's consolidated results of
operations as if the Appalachian Basin Sale had occurred at the beginning of the periods
presented. The pro forma results are the result of excluding from the statement of operations of
the Company the revenues and direct operating expenses for the properties divested adjusted for
(1) the reduction in ARO liabilities and accretion expense for the properties divested,  (2) the
reduction in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense as a result of the divestiture and
(3) the reduction in interest expense as a result of the pay down of debt under the Revolving
Credit Facility in conjunction with the closing of the Appalachian Basin Sale. As a result, certain
estimates and judgments were made in preparing the pro forma adjustments.

future results may vary significantly from the results reflected in such pro forma information.
Husky Acquisition
On December 16, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of additional working and net
revenue interests in 103 gross (10.2 net) producing wells and certain undeveloped acreage in
the STACK and Hunton Limestone formations in its existing AMI from its AMI co-participant
Husky Ventures, Inc. (“Husky”), Silverstar of Nevada, Inc., Maximus Exploration, LLC and Atwood
Acquisitions, LLC for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $42.2 million, reflecting
adjustment for an acquisition effective date of July 1, 2015 and which includes a $715,000
deposit into escrow pending the resolution of title defects by the seller recorded to other assets at
June 30, 2016, and the conveyance of approximately 11,000 net non-core, non-producing acres
in Blaine, Major and Kingfisher Counties, Oklahoma to the sellers, subject to certain adjustments
and customary closing conditions (the “Husky Acquisition”).  In connection with the acquisition,
the AMI participation agreements with the Company’s AMI co-participant were dissolved.
The Company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination and therefore, recorded
the assets acquired at their estimated acquisition date fair values.  The Company incurred a total
of $1.5 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition since closing
and expensed these costs as incurred as general and administrative expenses.  The Company
utilized relevant market assumptions to determine fair value and allocate the purchase price,
such as future commodity prices, projections of estimated natural gas and oil reserves,
expectations for future development and operating costs, projections of future rates of production,
expected recovery rates and market multiples for similar transactions. Many of the assumptions
used are unobservable and as such, represent Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy as
described in Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements.” The Company's preliminary assessment of the
fair value of the Husky Acquisition assets resulted in a fair market valuation of $44.6 million.  As
the fair market valuation varied less than 6% from the purchase price allocation recorded, no
adjustment was made to the purchase price allocation.
Husky Acquisition Pro Forma Operating Results
The following unaudited pro forma results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015
show the effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations as if the Husky Acquisition
had occurred at the beginning of the period presented. The pro forma results are the result of
combining the statement of operations of the Company with the statements of revenues and
direct operating expenses for the properties acquired from Husky adjusted for (1) assumption of
ARO liabilities and accretion expense for the properties acquired and (2) additional depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense as a result of the Company's increased ownership in the
acquired properties. The statements of revenues and direct operating expenses for the Husky
Acquisition assets exclude all other historical expenses of Husky. As a result, certain estimates
and judgments were made in preparing the pro forma adjustments.

4.Long-Term Debt
Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility
On June 7, 2013, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement among the Company, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent, Swing Line Lender and Issuing Lender and the lenders named therein
(the “Revolving Credit Facility”). At the Company's election, borrowings bear interest at the
reference rate or the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin.  The reference rate is the greater
of (i) the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent, (ii) the federal funds rate
plus 50 basis points and (iii) LIBOR plus 1.0%.  The applicable interest rate margin varies from
1.0% to 2.0% in the case of borrowings based on the reference rate and from 2.0% to 3.0% in the
case of borrowings based on the Eurodollar rate, depending on the utilization percentage in
relation to the borrowing base and subject to adjustments based on the Company's leverage
ratio.  An annual commitment fee of 0.5% is payable quarterly on the unutilized balance of the
borrowing base.  The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity of November 14, 2017.
The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by all of the Company's future domestic
subsidiaries formed during the term of the Revolving Credit Facility.  Borrowings and related
guarantees are secured by a first priority lien on certain domestic oil and natural gas properties
currently owned by or later acquired by the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding de minimis
value properties as determined by the lender.  The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a first
priority pledge of the capital stock of each domestic subsidiary, a first priority interest on all
accounts receivable, notes receivable, inventory, contract rights, general intangibles and material
property of the issuer and 65% of the stock of any foreign subsidiary of the Company.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains various covenants, including, among others:
·Restrictions on liens, incurrence of other indebtedness without lenders' consent and common
stock dividends and other restricted payments;
 ·Maintenance of a minimum consolidated current ratio as of the end of each quarter of not less
than 1.0 to 1.0, as adjusted;
 ·Maintenance of a maximum ratio of net indebtedness to EBITDA of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0,
subject to the modifications in Amendment No. 5 set forth below; and
 ·Maintenance of an interest coverage ratio on a rolling four quarters basis, as adjusted, of
EBITDA to interest expense, as of the end of each quarter, to be less than 2.5 to 1.0, subject to
the modifications in Amendment No. 5 set forth below.
All outstanding amounts owed become due and payable upon the occurrence of certain usual
and customary events of default, including, among others:
·Failure to make payments;
 ·Non-performance of covenants and obligations continuing beyond any applicable grace period;
·Non-performance of covenants and obligations continuing beyond any applicable grace period;
and
 ·The occurrence of a change in control of the Company, as defined under the Revolving Credit
Facility.
On March 9, 2015, the Company, together with the parties thereto, entered into a Master
Assignment, Agreement and Amendment No. 5 to Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement (“Amendment No. 5”).  Amendment No. 5 amended the Revolving Credit Facility to,
among other things, (i) increase the borrowing base from $145.0 million to $200.0 million, (ii)
adjust the total leverage ratio for each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2015 but prior to
September 30, 2016, to 5.25 to 1.00; for the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2016, to 5.00
to 1.00; for the fiscal quarter ending on December 31, 2016, to 4.75 to 1.00; for the fiscal quarter
ending on March 31, 2017, to 4.25 to 1.00; and for each fiscal quarter ending on or after June 30,
2017, to 4.00 to 1.00, (iii) adjust the interest coverage ratio for each fiscal quarter ending on or
after March 31, 2015 but prior to March 31, 2016, to 2.00 to 1.00 and for each fiscal quarter
ending on or after March 31, 2016, to 2.50 to 1.00, and (iv) add the senior secured leverage ratio
covenant, such ratio not to exceed, (a) for each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2015
but prior to June 30, 2016, 2.25 to 1.00 and (b) for each fiscal quarter ending on or after June 30,
2016, 2.00 to 1.00 provided that this senior secured leverage ratio shall cease to apply
commencing with the first fiscal quarter end occurring after June 30, 2016 for which the total
leverage ratio is equal to or less than 4.00 to 1.00.
On December 22, 2015, the Company, together with the parties thereto, entered into Amendment
No. 6 to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 6”).  Amendment
No. 6 amended the Revolving Credit Facility to permit the Company to exchange its outstanding
Notes constituting Second Lien Debt under the Revolving Credit Facility for equity interests in the
Company.
On January 29, 2016, the Company, together with the parties thereto, entered into Limited Waiver
and Amendment No. 7 to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No.
7”).  Pursuant to Amendment No. 7, the Company obtained (i) a waiver until March 10, 2016 of
any potential defaults at December 31, 2015 of its leverage ratio and senior secured leverage
ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) a permanent waiver of any defaults of the
restricted payment covenant under the
16
Revolving Credit Facility resulting from (a) cash distributions paid on December 31, 2015 in
respect of its Series A Preferred Stock and its Series B Preferred Stock and (b) the issuance on
January 28, 2016, as a dividend on the Company’ common stock, of the right to purchase Series
C Junior Participating Preferred Stock pursuant to the Company’s Rights Agreement dated as of
January 18, 2016 as part of the Company’s previously disclosed tax benefits preservation
plan.  The Revolving Credit Facility was also amended to permit the Company to make dividends
and distributions of preferred equity interests or rights to purchase certain preferred equity
interests.  The entry into Amendment No. 7 permitted the Company to pay monthly cash
dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock and its Series B Preferred Stock on February 1, 2016.
On March 9, 2016, the Company, together with the parties thereto, entered into Waiver and
Amendment No. 8 to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No.
8”).  Pursuant to Amendment No. 8, the Company obtained the following relief with respect to its
financial covenant compliance:
(i)a permanent waiver of the defaults at December 31, 2015 of its leverage ratio and senior
secured leverage ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility;
(ii)relief from compliance with its leverage ratio through the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017,
but the Company must maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0 for
each fiscal quarter ending on or after June 17, 2017;
(iii)an adjustment to the interest coverage ratio for each fiscal quarter ending on or after June 30,
2016 but prior to June 30, 2017, to 1.10 to 1.00 and for each fiscal quarter ending on or after
June 30, 2017 to 2.50 to 1.00; and
(iv)an adjustment to its senior secured leverage ratio for each fiscal quarter ending on or after
June 30, 2016 but prior to June 30, 2017, to 2.50 to 1.00 provided that during such period the
Company may subtract all cash on hand in calculating the senior secured leverage ratio for
such periods and for each fiscal quarter ending on or after June 30, 2017, to 2.00 to 1.00
provided that during such period the Company may only subtract up to $5 million of cash on
hand in calculating the senior secured leverage ratio for such periods.
As consideration for the financial covenant relief provided for in Amendment No. 8, the Revolving
Credit Facility was also amended to, among other things:
(i)set the interest margin at (a) 4.0% per annum for Eurodollar rate borrowings and (b) 3.0% per
annum for borrowings based on the reference rate;
(ii)reduce the borrowing base from $200.0 million to $180.0 million until the earlier of the closing
of the Appalachian Basin Sale or April 10, 2016, at which point the borrowing base would
automatically be reduced to $100.0 million and require borrowings in excess of such amount
be repaid immediately;
(iii)require additional automatic reductions of the borrowing base in connection with asset sales
in excess of $5.0 million or the termination of any hedge agreements governing hedges with
a settlement date on or after July 1, 2016;
(iv)provide for an additional interim borrowing base redetermination in August 2016;
 (v)require the consent of the lenders to any asset sales in excess of $5.0 million; and
 (vi)restrict the Company after March 2016 from making any distributions or paying any cash
dividends to the holders of its preferred equity, including its outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.
Borrowing base redeterminations are scheduled semi-annually in May and November of each
calendar year, although an additional scheduled redetermination will occur in August 2016, as
set forth in Amendment No. 8.  The Company and its lenders may each request one additional
unscheduled redetermination during any six-month period between scheduled
redeterminations.  In connection with Amendment No. 8 and in conjunction with the closing of the
Appalachian Basin Sale, the borrowing base was reduced from $180.0 million to $100.0 million
on April 8, 2016.  At June 30, 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility had a borrowing base of $100.0
million, with $99.6 million borrowings outstanding and $370,000 of letters of credit issued under
the Revolving Credit Facility.  As of August 1, 2016, there were $99.6 million borrowings
outstanding and $370,000 of letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.  Future
increases in the borrowing base in excess of the original $50.0 million are limited to 17.5% of the
increase in adjusted consolidated net tangible assets as defined in the indenture pursuant to
which the Company's senior secured notes are issued (as discussed below in “Senior Secured
Notes”).
On May 10, 2016, the requisite lenders under the Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement permanently waived an unintended technical default under the Revolving Credit
Facility resulting from the timing of the last monthly cash dividend payments made by the
Company in March 2016 on the Company’s two outstanding classes of preferred stock.
At June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the
Revolving Credit Facility.
Senior Secured Notes
The Company has $325.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8 5/8% Senior Secured Notes
due May 15, 2018 (the “Notes”) outstanding under an indenture (the “Indenture”) by and among
the Company, the Guarantors named therein (the “Guarantors”), Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as Trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and Collateral Agent (in such capacity,
the “Collateral
17
Agent”).  The Notes bear interest at a rate of 8.625% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears
on May 15 and November 15 of each year.  The Notes mature on May 15, 2018.
In the event of a change of control, as defined in the Indenture, each holder of the Notes will have
the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their notes at an offer price in
cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to the date of purchase.
The Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by certain future
domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantees”).  The Notes and Guarantees will rank senior in right of
payment to all of the Company's and the Guarantors' future subordinated indebtedness and
equal in right of payment to all of the Company's and the Guarantors' existing and future senior
indebtedness.  The Notes and Guarantees also will be effectively senior to the Company's
unsecured indebtedness and effectively subordinated to the Company's and Guarantors' under
the Revolving Credit Facility, any other indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the same
collateral and any other indebtedness secured by assets other than the collateral, in each case to
the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligation.
The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's ability and the
ability of its subsidiaries to:
·Transfer or sell assets or use asset sale proceeds;
 ·Pay dividends or make distributions, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted
payments;
 ·Make certain investments; incur or guarantee additional debt or issue preferred equity
securities;
·Create or incur certain liens on the Company's assets;
·Create or incur certain liens on the Company's assets;
 ·Incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting future restricted subsidiaries;
 ·Merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Company's assets;
 ·Enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and
 ·Enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions.
Covenants in the Indenture also limit the Company’s ability to borrow on a first priority lien
secured basis, including its ability to refinance the full amount of currently outstanding
borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility or to re-borrow on such facility in the event current
borrowings thereunder are paid down.  These and other covenants that are contained in the
Indenture are subject to important limitations and qualifications that are described in the
Indenture.

5.Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company discloses its recognized non-financial assets and liabilities, such as asset
retirement obligations, unproved properties and other property and equipment, at fair value on a
non-recurring basis. For non-financial assets and liabilities, the Company is required to disclose
information that enables users of its financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop
these measurements. The Company assesses its unproved properties for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of those properties may not be recoverable.
The fair value of the unproved properties is measured using an income approach based upon
internal estimates of future production levels, current and future prices, drilling and operating
costs, discount rates, current drilling plans and favorable and unfavorable drilling activity on the
properties being evaluated and/or adjacent properties or estimated market data based on area
18
transactions, which are Level 3 inputs. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, due to continued lower natural gas prices for dry gas and no current plans to
drill or extend leases in Marcellus East, management’s evaluation of unproved properties
resulted in impairment and the Company reclassified an immaterial amount of costs from
unproved to proved properties for each period.  As no other fair value measurements are required
to be recognized on a non-recurring basis at June 30, 2016, no additional disclosures are
provided at June 30, 2016.
As defined in the guidance, fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date (an exit price). To estimate fair value, the Company utilizes market data or
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including
assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These
inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (“Level 1”) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (“Level 3”). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
·Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Company’s cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments, which have
maturities of 90 days or less, including sweep investments and money market funds.
 ·Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration,
for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
 ·Level 3 inputs are measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are
both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources.
These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies or third party broker quotes
that result in management’s best estimate of fair value. The Company’s valuation models
consider various inputs including (a) quoted forward prices for commodities, (b) time value,
(c) volatility factors and (d) current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments.
Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a
significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.  Level 3 instruments are commodity
costless collars, index swaps, basis and fixed price swaps and put and call options to hedge
natural gas, oil and NGLs price risk. At each balance sheet date, the Company performs an
analysis of all applicable instruments and includes in Level 3 all of those whose fair value is
based on significant unobservable inputs.  The fair values derived from counterparties and third-
party brokers are verified by the Company using publicly available values for relevant NYMEX
futures contracts and exchange traded contracts for each derivative settlement location.
Although such counterparty and third-party broker quotes are used to assess the fair value of its
commodity derivative instruments, the Company does not have access to the specific
assumptions used in its counterparties valuation models. Consequently, additional disclosures
regarding significant Level 3 unobservable inputs were not provided and the Company does not
currently have sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these contracts as
Level 2 instruments.
As required, financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect
the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy
levels. The determination of the fair values below incorporates various factors, including the
impact of the counterparty’s non-performance risk with respect to the Company’s financial assets
and the Company’s non-performance risk with respect to the Company’s financial liabilities. The
Company has not elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative
instruments executed with the same counterparty, but reports them gross on its consolidated
balance sheets.
Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. There were no
transfers between levels during the 2016 and 2015 periods.
The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the Company’s financial
assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015:

(1)Included in gain (loss) on commodity derivatives contracts on the condensed consolidated
statements of operations.
At June 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts
and revenue payables and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to their short-
term nature. The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at June 30, 2016 was
$367.0 million based on quoted market prices of the Notes (Level 1) and the respective carrying
value of the Revolving Credit Facility because the interest rate approximates the current market
rate (Level 2).
The Company has consistently applied the valuation techniques discussed above in all periods
presented.
The fair value guidance, as amended, establishes that every derivative instrument is to be
recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. See Note 6,
“Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity.”
6.Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity
The Company maintains a commodity price risk management strategy that uses derivative
instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from
volatility in commodity prices. The Company uses costless collars, index, basis and fixed price
swaps and put and call options to hedge oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs price risk.
All derivative contracts are carried at their fair value on the balance sheet and all changes in
value are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in (loss) gain on
commodity derivatives contracts. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company reported losses of $3.3 million and $7.8 million, respectively, in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations related to the change in the fair value of its commodity
derivative contracts still held at June 30, 2016 and 2015.  For the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company reported losses of $9.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, in the
condensed consolidated statements of operations related to the change in the fair value of its
commodity derivative contracts still held at June 30, 2016 and 2015.

As of June 30, 2016, all of the Company’s economic derivative hedge positions were with large
financial institutions, which are not known to the Company to be in default on their derivative
positions. The Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-performance by the
counterparties in the derivative contracts discussed above; however, the Company does not
anticipate non-performance by such counterparties. None of the Company’s derivative
instruments contain credit-risk related contingent features.
In conjunction with certain derivative hedging activity, the Company deferred the payment of
certain put premiums for the production month period August 2016 through December 2018. The
put premium liabilities become payable monthly as the hedge production month becomes the
prompt production month. The Company amortizes the deferred put premium liabilities as they
become payable. The following table provides information regarding the deferred put premium

7.Capital Stock
Common Stock
On May 7, 2015, the Company entered into an at-the-market issuance sales agreement with MLV
& Co. LLC (the “Sales Agent”) to sell, from time to time through the Sales Agent, shares of the
Company's common stock (the “ATM Program”).  The shares will be issued pursuant to the
Company's existing effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (Registration
No. 333-193832).  The Company registered shares having an aggregate offering price of up to
$50.0 million.   To date, no shares have been sold through the ATM program.
On May 12, 2016, the Company sold 50,000,000 shares of its common stock in an underwritten
public offering at a price of $0.95 per share, or $47.5 million before offering costs and expenses
(the “Equity Offering”). The Company received approximately $44.8 million of proceeds from the
offering, net of offering costs and expenses of approximately $2.7 million.
On June 14, 2016, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s
certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from
275,000,000 to 550,000,000, which amendment became effective on July 5, 2016.
Stockholder Rights Agreement
On January 18, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan (the
“Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company declared a dividend of one right (a “Right”)
for each of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock.  The dividend was
paid to stockholders of record on January 28, 2016. Each Right entitles the holder, subject to the
terms of the Rights Agreement, to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of the Company’s
Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) at a price of $6.96,
subject to certain adjustments.  The purpose of the Rights Agreement is to diminish the risk that
the Company’s ability to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations would become
subject to limitations by reason of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The Rights generally become exercisable on the earlier of (i) ten business days after any person
or group obtains beneficial ownership of 4.9% of the Company’s outstanding common stock (an
“Acquiring Person”) or (ii) ten business days after commencement of a tender or exchange offer
resulting in any person or group becoming an Acquiring Person.  The exercise price payable,
and the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable,
upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution.  In the
event that, after a person or a group has become an Acquiring Person, the Company is acquired
in a merger or other business combination transaction (or 50% or more of the Company’s assets
or earning power are sold), proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right will
thereafter have the right to receive, upon the
23
exercise thereof at the then-current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common
stock of the acquiring company having a market value at the time of that transaction equal to two
times the exercise price.
The Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at any time before a person or
group becomes an Acquiring Person at a price of $0.001 per Right, subject to adjustment. At any
time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, the Company may generally
exchange each Right in whole or in part at an exchange ratio of two shares of common stock per
outstanding Right, subject to adjustment.  The Rights will expire on January 18, 2019 unless
terminated on an earlier date pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement.
The Series C Preferred Stock is not redeemable by the Company and has certain voting rights
and dividend and liquidation privileges.
The Rights Agreement was amended on May 11, 2016 to make certain provisions inapplicable to
purchasers of the Equity Offering who are approved by the board of directors of the Company, or
a committee thereof, so that no such purchaser will be deemed an “Acquiring Person” under the
Rights Agreement by virtue of their purchase of common stock in the Equity Offering.
Preferred Stock
Pursuant to the Company’s certificate of incorporation, the Company has 40,000,000 shares of
preferred stock authorized.  The Company has designated 10,000,000 of such shares to
constitute its 8.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and
10,000,000 of such shares to constitute its 10.75% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock (the
“Series B Preferred Stock”).  The Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock each
have a par value of $0.01 per share and a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share.
Series A Preferred Stock
At June 30, 2016, there were 4,045,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding with a $25.00 per share liquidation preference.
The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company's common stock and on parity with
the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  The Series A Preferred Stock is subordinated to all
of the Company’s existing and future debt and all future capital stock designated as senior to the
Series A Preferred Stock.
The Series A Preferred Stock cannot be converted into common stock, but may be redeemed, at
the Company’s option for $25.00 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends whether
declared or not.
There is no mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock.
The Company paid cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at a fixed rate of
8.625% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference.  Effective March 9, 2016, the
Revolving Credit Facility prohibited the payment of cash dividends on the Company’s preferred
stock commencing April 2016.  Accordingly, the Company did not declare or pay dividends on
the Series A Preferred Stock in April 2016.  Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will
accumulate regardless of whether any such dividends are declared.  If the Company fails to pay
full cash dividends in four calendar quarters, whether consecutive or non-consecutive, and until
accumulated dividends are paid in full for four calendar quarters with the last two calendar
quarters’ dividends paid in cash, then (i) the fixed rate of Series A Preferred Stock each
increases by 2.00%, (ii) the Company may be required to issue a dividend of common stock to
pay accrued and unpaid dividends, if such dividends are not paid in cash, provided it has
sufficient surplus to pay such a dividend under state law, and (iii) the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock,  voting as a single class, will have the right to elect
up to two additional directors to the board of directors of the Company.  Under certain
circumstances, “pay in kind” dividends of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be
payable in lieu of cash or common stock dividends.  For the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, the Company recognized dividends of $2.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the
Series A Preferred Stock.
Series B Preferred Stock
At June 30, 2016, there were 2,140,000 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding with a $25.00 per share liquidation preference.
The Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock and on parity with
the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  The Series B Preferred
24
Stock are subordinated to all of the Company’s existing and future debt and all future capital
stock designated as senior to the Series B Preferred Stock.
Except upon a change in ownership or control, as defined in the Series B Preferred Stock
certificate of designations of rights and preferences, the Series B Preferred Stock may not be
redeemed before November 15, 2018, at or after which time it may be redeemed at the
Company’s option for $25.00 per share in cash. Following a change in ownership or control, the
Company will have the option to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock within 90 days of the
occurrence of the change in control, in whole but not in part for $25.00 per share in cash, plus
accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared), up to, but not including the redemption
date. If the Company does not exercise its option to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock upon a
change of ownership or control, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have the option to
convert the shares of Series B Preferred Stock into the Company's common stock based upon on
an average common stock trading price then in effect but limited to an aggregate of 11.5207
shares of the Company’s common stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock, subject to certain
adjustments. If the Company exercises any of its redemption rights relating to shares of Series B
Preferred Stock, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock will not have the conversion right
described above with respect to the shares of Series B Preferred Stock called for redemption.
There is no mandatory redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock.
The Company paid cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at a fixed rate of
10.75% per annum of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference. Effective March 9, 2016, the
Revolving Credit Facility prohibited the payment of cash dividends on the Company’s preferred
stock commencing April 2016.  Accordingly, the Company did not declare or pay dividends on
the Series B Preferred Stock in April 2016.  Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will
accumulate regardless of whether any such dividends are declared. If the Company fails to pay
full cash dividends in four calendar quarters, whether consecutive or non-consecutive, and until
accumulated dividends are paid in full for four calendar quarters with the last two calendar
quarters’ dividends paid in cash, then (i) the fixed rate of Series B Preferred Stock each
increases by 2.00%, (ii) the Company may be  required to issue a dividend of common stock to
pay accrued and unpaid dividends, if such dividends are not paid in cash, provided it has
sufficient surplus to pay such a dividend under state law, and (iii) the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock,  voting as a single class, will have the right to elect
up to two additional directors to the board of directors of the Company.  Under certain
circumstances, “pay in kind” dividends of additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be
payable in lieu of cash or common stock dividends.  For the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, the Company recognized dividends of $1.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively, for the
Series B Preferred Stock.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the Company did not
recognize a current income tax benefit or provision as the Company has a full valuation
allowance against assets created by net operating losses generated.  The Company believes it
more likely than not that the assets will not be utilized.
10.Earnings per Share
In accordance with the provisions of current authoritative guidance, basic earnings or loss per
share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the periods. Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding plus the assumed issuance of common shares
for all potentially dilutive securities.

Litigation
Gastar Exploration Ltd vs. U.S. Specialty Ins. Co. and Axis Ins. Co. (Cause No.2010-11236)
District Court of Harris County, Texas 190th Judicial District.  On February 19, 2010, the
Company filed a lawsuit claiming that the Company was due reimbursement of qualifying claims
related to the settlement and associated legal defense costs under the Company's directors and
officers liability
26
insurance policies related to the ClassicStar Mare Lease Litigation settled on December 17,
2010 for $21.2 million.  The combined coverage limits under the directors and officers liability
coverage is $20.0 million.  The District Court granted the underwriters' summary judgment
request by a ruling dated January 4, 2012.  The Company appealed the District Court ruling and
on July 15, 2013, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals of Texas reversed the summary judgment
ruling granted against the Company on the basis of the policies' prior-and-pending litigation
endorsement and remanded the case for further proceedings in the District Court. The insurers
filed a motion for reconsideration in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, which that court
denied.  The insurers then sought discretionary review from the Texas Supreme Court, which that
court denied on February 27, 2015.  The insurers then filed in the Texas Supreme Court a motion
for rehearing of their denied petition for review, which the court has denied.  The case has now
been remanded to the District Court.  The District Court proceedings will include, but not be
limited to, a determination of the portion of the Company's settlement of the ClassicStar Mare
Lease Litigation that is covered by the insuring agreements.  In October 2015, the Insurers sought
a summary judgment based on one of the exclusions in the policy.  The trial court denied their
motion.  After denying the insurers’ motion for summary judgment, the trial court, on February 17,
2016, entered a docket control order establishing the week of November 29, 2016 as the
tentative week for the case to go to trial. The parties are currently engaged in discovery and the
trial court has allowed limited deposition testimony from some of the former Mare Lease plaintiffs.
Gastar Exploration Inc. v. Christopher McArthur (Cause No.:  2015-77605) 157th Judicial District
Court, Harris County, Texas.  On December 29, 2015, Gastar filed suit against Christopher
McArthur (“McArthur”) in the District Court of Harris County, Texas.  The lawsuit arises from a
demand letter sent by McArthur to Gastar in which he claimed to be party to an agreement or
contract with Gastar that entitled him to be paid $2.75 million for services rendered.  In its lawsuit,
Gastar denies that such an agreement or contract exists, that McArthur provided any services to
Gastar or for Gastar’s benefit, and seeks a declaratory judgment that it did not enter into an
agreement or contract with McArthur and that it does not owe any amounts to McArthur under the
terms of any agreement or contract.  Gastar also seeks to recover its attorneys’ fees.  McArthur
answered the lawsuit on February 8, 2016 by filing a general denial.
Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc., Torchlight Energy, Inc. v. Husky Ventures, Inc., et al., (Cause
No. 429-01961-2016) 429th Judicial District Court in Collin County, Texas. The Company
recently learned of this lawsuit (the “Torchlight Lawsuit”) against the Company, two of its
executive officers, a director, and a former director of the Company filed on May 3, 2016. The
Torchlight Lawsuit arises primarily out of Torchlight’s business dealings with Husky Ventures,
Inc. (“Husky”) in Oklahoma. Husky and several of its employees and affiliates are also
defendants in the Torchlight Lawsuit. As part of settlement negotiations between Husky and the
Company in a separate lawsuit, Husky informed the Company that it had agreed to repurchase
assets from Torchlight that Husky had previously sold to Torchlight (the “Torchlight Assets”).
Husky offered to sell those Torchlight Assets to the Company. In the agreement between
Torchlight and Husky, Torchlight expressly acknowledged that the Torchlight Assets were to be
sold to the Company and released the Company from any claims arising out of the sale of the
Torchlight Assets. Despite this release, Torchlight has alleged multiple causes of action against
the Company and its officers and directors arising out of the sale of the Torchlight Assets and
Torchlight’s other business dealings it had with Husky. The case is still at an early stage, and no
discovery has been exchanged among the parties.  The Company believes the plaintiffs’ claims
are without merit and are merely an attempt to induce the Company into settling disputes that are
primarily between Torchlight and Husky. The Company intends to defend this case vigorously,
including asserting coverage of these matters under the release executed by plaintiffs.
The Company has been expensing legal costs on these proceedings as they are incurred.
The Company is party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The
ultimate outcome of each of these matters cannot be absolutely determined, and the liability the
Company may ultimately incur with respect to any one of these matters in the event of a negative
outcome may be in excess of amounts currently accrued for with respect to such matters. Net of
available insurance and performance of contractual defense and indemnity obligations, where
applicable, management does not believe any such matters will have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Overview
We are a pure play Mid-Continent independent energy company engaged in the exploration,
development and production of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs. Our principal business
activities include the identification, acquisition, and subsequent exploration and development of
oil and natural gas properties with an emphasis on unconventional reserves, such as shale
resource plays.  We hold a concentrated acreage position in what is believed to be the core of
the STACK Play, an area of central Oklahoma which is home to multiple oil and natural gas-rich
reservoirs including the Meramec, Oswego, Osage, Woodford and Hunton formations.   On April
8, 2016, we sold substantially all of our producing assets and proved reserves and a significant
portion of our undeveloped acreage in the Appalachian Basin for an adjusted sales price of
$76.6 million, subject to certain additional adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2016
(the “Appalachian Basin Sale”).
Our current operational activities are conducted in, and our consolidated revenues are generated
from, markets exclusively in the U.S.  As of June 30, 2016, our major assets consist of
approximately 184,500  gross (109,200 net) acres in Oklahoma (54% undeveloped) and
approximately 16,300 gross (15,100 net) acres in West Virginia (83% undeveloped).
The following discussion addresses material changes in our results of operations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three and six months ended June 30,
2015 and material changes in our financial condition since December 31, 2015. This discussion
should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1. “Financial Statements” of this report, as well as our 2015
Form 10-K, which includes important disclosures regarding our critical accounting policies as
part of Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.”
Oil and Natural Gas Activities
The following provides an overview of our major oil and natural gas projects. While actively
pursuing specific exploration and development activities in the Mid-Continent area, there is no
assurance that new drilling opportunities will be identified or that any new drilling opportunities
will be successful if drilled.
Mid-Continent Horizontal Oil Play.
We believe that our acreage is prospective in the STACK Play, an area of central Oklahoma that
includes oil and natural gas-rich formations such as the Meramec and Woodford Shale, ranging
in depth from 6,000 to 9,000 feet, and emerging prospective plays in the shallow Oswego
formation and in the Osage formation, a deeper bench of the Mississippi Lime located below the
Meramec as well as the proven Hunton Limestone horizontal oil play.  We believe that the
STACK Play is one of the most economic plays in North America.  It is a horizontal drilling play in
an area of previously drilled vertical wells with multiple productive reservoirs that are
predominantly oil producing.  The STACK Play encompasses all or parts of Blaine, Canadian,
Garfield, Kingfisher and Major counties in Oklahoma. STACK is an acronym for Sooner Trend
Anadarko Canadian Kingfisher.  At June 30, 2016, we held leases covering approximately 
184,500 gross ( 109,200 net) acres in Garfield, Canadian, Kingfisher, Logan, Blaine and
Oklahoma Counties, Oklahoma within the STACK Play.
Our leasing activities primarily located in northwest Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, began in 2012
initially with an AMI co-participant and were expanded to include two additional adjacent
prospect areas. Prior to the closing of the Husky Acquisition, our AMI co-participant handled all
drilling, completion and production activities, and we handled leasing and permitting activities in
certain areas of the AMI.  On December 16, 2015, we completed the Husky Acquisition of
additional interests in the AMI from our AMI co-participant including working and net revenue
interests in 103 gross (10.2 net) producing wells and approximately 15,700 net developed and
undeveloped acres in Kingfisher and Garfield Counties, Oklahoma and assumed operatorship of
a majority of the acquired wells.  With the closing of the Husky Acquisition, our AMI participation
agreements with our AMI co-participant were dissolved.
On September 6, 2015, we spudded our first Meramec well, the Deep River 30-1H, with a
vertical depth of approximately 7,300 feet and drilled an approximate 5,100-foot lateral and
completed it with a 34-stage fracture stimulation.  The Deep River 30-1H was placed on flowback
on October 28, 2015 and in December 2015, produced at a peak 24-hour rate of 1,094 Boe per
day (71% oil) and has produced at a post-peak 230-day gross average daily rate of 513 Boe per
day (53% oil).  Our working interest in the Deep River 30-1H is 100.0% (NRI 80.2%).  The
estimated cost to drill and complete the Deep River 30-1H was approximately $6.5 million.
On February 10, 2016, we spudded our second Meramec well, the Holiday Road 2-1H, with a
vertical depth of approximately 7,000 feet, an approximate 4,300 foot lateral and completed with
34 frack stages using approximately 12 million pounds of proppant.  The well commenced flow
back on April 11, 2016 and, to date, continues to produce significant completion fluids while oil
and gas production continues to increase.  During the most recent 30-day period, the well
averaged gross 267 Boe per day (81% oil) and 2,063 barrels of completion fluid.  During the most
recent five-day period, the well produced at a gross average rate of 343 Boe per day
31
(82% oil) and 2,199 barrels of completion fluids recovered per day.  Our working interest in the
Holiday Road 2-1H is 78.3% (approximate NRI 63.0%).  The estimated cost to drill and complete
the Holiday Road 2-1H was approximately $4.6 million, including approximately $520,000 of
costs associated with fishing coiled tubing from the wellbore during completion procedures.
On June 20, 2016, we spudded our first Osage test well, the McGee 29-1H, with a projected
vertical depth of approximately 7,600 feet and an approximate 4,200 foot horizontal lateral.  Our
current minimum estimated working interest in the McGee 29-1H is 66.3% (NRI 53.0%).  The
estimated cost to drill and complete the McGee 29-1H is $4.5 million, excluding costs associated
with coring operations in the Mississippi Lime and Woodford Shale formations.
To further test the potential of other Mid-Continent formations, to date in 2016, we have
participated in one gross (0.1 net) completed non-operated Woodford Shale well, three gross (0.4
net) completed non-operated wells targeting the Oswego, one gross (0.2 net) completed non-
operated well targeting the Osage Shale and four gross (0.5 net) completed non-operated
Meramec Shale wells.

Appalachian Basin.
Due to the continued depressed price environment in the Appalachian Basin, we suspended our
drilling operations in the Appalachian Basin in the second quarter of 2015.  On April 8, 2016 we
sold substantially all of our producing assets and proved
32
reserves and a significant portion of our undeveloped acreage in the Appalachian Basin for an
adjusted price of $76.6 million, subject to certain additional adjustments.  As of June 30, 2016,
our acreage position in the play was approximately 16,300 gross (15,100 net) acres, 83% of
which is undeveloped, in Preston, Tucker, Pocahontas, Randolph and Pendleton Counties, West
Virginia.
The following table provides production and operational information for the Appalachian Basin

(1)The three and six months ended June 30, 2016 reflect the impact of the Appalachian Basin
Sale completed on April 8, 2016.
(2)The impact of hedging includes the gain (loss) on commodity derivative contracts settled
during the periods presented.  The three and six months ended June 30, 2016 includes the
impact of the monetization of hedge contracts for future period production.
(3)Lease operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 include a credit
of $220,000 and expense of $837,000, respectively, of workover for an insurance
reimbursement related to 2015 WEHLU activity and production enhancing WEHLU well
workovers, respectively.  Lease operating expenses for the three and six months ended June
30, 2015 include $1.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of workover expense for
production enhancing WEHLU workovers.  Excluding workover, lease operating expense per
Boe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 would have been $8.24 per Boe and
$5.50 per Boe, respectively, compared to $4.64 per Boe and $4.38 per Boe for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively.
(4)Production costs include lease operating expenses, insurance, gathering and workover
expense and excludes ad valorem and severance taxes.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Revenues. Total oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues (exclusive of the effects of
hedging) as reported were $14.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, down 37%
from $23.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues was the
result of a 54% decrease in production offset by a 36% increase in weighted average realized
equivalent prices  .  The decrease in production was the result of the Appalachian Basin Sale on
April 8, 2016.  Average daily production on an equivalent basis was 6.4 MBoe/d for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 13.9 MBoe/d for the same period in 2015.  Oil,
condensate and NGLs production represented approximately 71% of total production for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 53% of total production for the three months
ended June 30, 2015.  Excluding the impact of the Appalachian Basin production sales on oil,
condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues (exclusive of the effects of hedging), total oil,
condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues decreased $5.2 million, or 26%, to $15.0 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 from the three months ended June 30, 2015 as a result of
a 26% decrease in weighted average realized equivalent prices in the Mid-Continent while
average daily equivalent production in the Mid-Continent was flat.
Oil and condensate revenues represented approximately 76% of our total oil, condensate, natural
gas and NGLs revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 74% for the
three months ended June 30, 2015 as reported and 81% for the three months ended June 30,
2015 excluding the impact of Appalachian Basin production.  Total liquids revenues (oil,
condensate and NGLs) represented approximately 87% of our total oil, condensate, natural gas
and NGLs revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 83% of our total oil,
condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues for the three months ended  June 30, 2015 as
reported and 89% excluding the impact of Appalachian Basin production.
The impact of hedging on oil and condensate sales during the three months ended June 30,
2016 was an increase of $480,000 in oil and condensate revenues due to the monetization of
hedge contracts covering future production and resulted in an increase in total price realized from
$41.82 per Bbl to $43.59 per Bbl.  The gain on oil and condensate commodity derivatives
contracts settled during the period was reduced by $299,000 for deferred put premiums related to
the hedge monetization.  During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the impact of hedging on
oil and condensate sales was an increase of $1.7 million, which resulted in an increase in total
price realized from $47.68 per Bbl to $52.20 per Bbl.  We designated 15% and 50% of our crude
hedges as price protection for our NGLs production for the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we did not have any commodity derivative
contracts covering our natural gas production.  During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the
impact of hedging on natural gas sales was an increase of $2.0 million in natural gas revenues
resulting in an increase in total price realized from $1.10 per Mcf to $1.68 per Mcf.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we did not have any commodity derivative
contracts covering our NGLs production and we allocated 15% of our crude hedges monetized to
NGLs.  The impact of hedging on NGLs sales during the three months ended June 30, 2016 was
an increase of $85,000 in NGLs revenues due to the monetization of oil and condensate hedge
contracts covering future production and resulted in an increase in total price realized from
$12.02 per Bbl to $12.62 per Bbl.  The gain on NGLs commodity derivatives contracts settled
during the period was reduced by $53,000 for deferred put premiums related to the hedge
monetization.  During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the impact of hedging on NGLs
sales was an increase of $2.3 million in NGLs revenues which resulted in an increase in total
price realized from $7.34 per Bbl to $14.97 per Bbl.
The change in mark to market value for outstanding commodity derivatives contracts for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 was a loss of $3.3 million compared to a loss of $7.8 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2015. The change in the mark to market value is primarily the result
of changes in hedge contracts compared to the prior year.

For additional information regarding our oil and condensate hedging positions as of June 30,
2016, see   Part I, Item 1. “Financial Statements, Note 6 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activity” of this report.
Production taxes. We reported production taxes of $364,000 for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $822,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The decrease in
production taxes primarily resulted from the completion of our Appalachian Basin
Sale.  Excluding the Appalachian Basin, production taxes decreased $112,000, or 23%, to
$377,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from the three months ended June 30, 2015
primarily due to a decrease in oil and natural gas prices. As reported, production taxes for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately 2.4% and 3.5%, respectively,
of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues.  Excluding the Appalachian Basin,
production taxes were approximately 2.5% and 2.4% of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs
revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Lease operating expenses. We reported lease operating expenses (“LOE”) of $4.6 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $7.2 million for the three months ended June 30,
2015.  Our total LOE, as reported, was $7.86 per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $5.74 per Boe for the same period in 2015.  Excluding the Appalachian Basin, LOE
decreased $1.2 million, or 20%, to $4.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from
the three months ended June 30, 2015 due primarily to a $1.6 million decrease in workover
expense resulting from a decrease in workover activity and receipt of a $588,000 insurance
reimbursement offset by a $538,000 increase in controllable LOE.  Excluding the Appalachian
Basin and workover expense, LOE per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $8.36
compared to $7.59 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Transportation, treating and gathering. We reported transportation expenses of $395,000 for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $542,000 for the three months ended June 30,
2015.  Excluding the impact of the Appalachian Basin Sale, transportation expense in the Mid-
Continent increased $304,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2015 due to new wells and changes in Oklahoma marketing contracts
from percent of proceeds to fixed charges.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. We reported depreciation, depletion and amortization
(“DD&A”) expense of $5.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 down from $16.1
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in DD&A expense was the
result of a 54% decrease in production resulting from the completion of the Appalachian Basin
Sale coupled with a lower DD&A rate due to impairment charges incurred in 2015 and first
quarter 2016 and the credit to the full cost pool for the net proceeds from the Appalachian Basin
Sale.  The DD&A rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $9.59 per Boe compared to
$12.74 per Boe for the same period in 2015.
General and administrative expense. We reported general and administrative expenses of $6.3
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $4.4 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is included in
general and administrative expense, was $702,000 and $1.2 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Excluding stock-based compensation expense, general
and administrative expense increased $2.4 million to $5.6 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is primarily
due to  the recognition of an allowance for bad debt provision of $2.0 million in conjunction with
the bankruptcy of a third-party purchaser of Company production primarily in West Virginia.
Interest expense.  We reported interest expense of $9.3 million for the three months ended June
30, 2016 compared to $6.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The increase in
interest expense is primarily due to additional borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and
higher grid pricing under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Dividends on preferred stock. We reported dividends on preferred stock of $3.6 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Series A Preferred Stock had a
stated value and liquidation preference of approximately $101.1 million at June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and carries a cumulative dividend rate of 8.625% per annum.  Dividends on
the Series A Preferred Stock were $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.  The Series B Preferred Stock had a stated value and liquidation preference
of $53.5 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015 and carries a cumulative dividend rate of 10.75% per
annum.  Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock were $1.4 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Effective March 9, 2016 and commencing April 2016, our
Revolving Credit Facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our preferred
stock.  Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have and will
continue to accumulate regardless of whether any such dividends are declared or not.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Revenues. Total oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues (exclusive of the effects of
hedging) as reported were $29.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, down 38% from
$47.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues was the result
of a 17% decrease in weighted average realized prices coupled with a 25% decrease in
production.  The decrease in production was the result of the Appalachian Basin Sale on April 8,
2016.  Average daily production on an equivalent
36
basis was 9.8 MBoe/d for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 13.2 MBoe/d for the
same period in 2015.  Oil, condensate and NGLs production represented approximately 61% of
total production for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 52% of total production for
the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Excluding the impact of Appalachian Basin production
sales on oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues (exclusive of the effects of hedging),
total oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues decreased $11.8 million, or 31%, to $26.3
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from the six months ended June 30, 2015 as a
result of a 33% decrease in weighted average realized equivalent prices slightly offset by a 3%
increase in production in the Mid-Continent.
Oil and condensate revenues as reported represented approximately 68% of our total oil,
condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to 69% for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Total liquids revenues (oil, condensate and
NGLs) as reported represented approximately 80% of our total oil, condensate, natural gas and
NGLs revenues for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 compared to 78% for the six month
period ended June 30, 2015.  Excluding the impact of Appalachian Basin production sales, oil
and condensate revenues represented approximately 75% of our total Mid-Continent oil,
condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to 80% for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Excluding the impact of Appalachian Basin
production sales, total liquids revenues (oil, condensate and NGLs) represented approximately
87% of our total Mid-Continent oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 88% for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had commodity derivative contracts covering
approximately 34% of our oil and condensate production.  The impact of hedging on oil and
condensate sales during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was an increase of $5.1 million in
oil and condensate revenues and resulted in an increase in total price realized from $33.91 per
Bbl to $42.48 per Bbl.  The gain on oil and condensate commodity derivatives contracts settled
during the period includes a loss of $1.7 million for deferred put premiums.  During the six months
ended June 30, 2015, the impact of hedging on oil and condensate sales was an increase of
$3.7 million in oil and condensate revenues, which resulted in an increase in total price realized
from $44.76 per Bbl to $49.86 per Bbl.  We designated 15% and 50% of our current crude hedges
as price protection for our NGLs production for the six months ended June 20, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had commodity derivative contracts covering
approximately 93% of our natural gas production, which resulted in a gain on natural gas
commodity derivatives contracts settled during the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $1.1
million and resulted in an increase in total price realized from $1.40 per Mcf to $1.65 per
Mcf.  The gain on natural gas commodity derivative contracts settled during the period includes a
gain of $75,000 for amortization of prepaid premiums.  Excluding the non-cash amortization, the
impact of hedging on natural gas sales was an increase in revenues of $2.9 million of NYMEX
hedge gains offset by $1.7 million of basis hedge losses and $235,000 of deferred put premiums.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the impact of hedging on natural gas sales was an
increase of $3.9 million in natural gas revenues resulting in an increase in total price realized
from $1.55 per Mcf to $2.11 per Mcf.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had commodity derivative contracts covering
approximately 63% of our NGLs production.  The impact of hedging on NGLs sales during the six
months ended June 30, 2016 was an increase of $1.2 million in NGLs revenues and resulted in
an increase in total price realized from $6.98 per Bbl to $9.38 per Bbl.  The gain on NGLs
commodity derivatives contracts settled during the period includes a loss of $305,000 for deferred
put premiums. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the impact of hedging on NGLs sales
was an increase of $4.4 million in NGLs revenues which resulted in an increase in total price
realized from $8.29 per Bbl to $16.72 per Bbl.
The change in mark to market value for outstanding commodity derivative contracts for six
months ended June 30, 2016 was a loss of $9.8 million compared to a loss of $3.5 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2015. The change in the mark to market value was primarily the result
of changes in hedge contracts and the futures price curve compared to the prior year.
For additional information regarding our oil and condensate hedging positions as of June 30,
2016, see Part I, Item 1. “Financial Statements, Note 6 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activity” of this report.
Production taxes. We reported production taxes of $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $1.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The decrease in
production taxes primarily resulted from the completion of our Appalachian Basin Sale on April 8,
2016.  Excluding the Appalachian Basin, production taxes in the Mid-Continent decreased
$84,000, or 10%, to $756,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015 due to a decrease in Mid-Continent oil and natural gas revenues as
a result of lower realized prices.  As reported, production taxes for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 were approximately 3.6% and 3.5%, respectively, of oil, condensate, natural gas
and NGLs revenues.  Excluding the Appalachian Basin, production taxes were approximately
2.9% and 2.2% of oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs revenues for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
37
Lease operating expenses. We reported LOE of $10.7 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $13.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Our total LOE, as
reported, was $5.97 per Boe for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $5.53 per Boe
for the same period in 2015.  Excluding the Appalachian Basin, LOE decreased $730,000, or 7%,
to $10.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from the six months ended June 30,
2015 due primarily to a $1.9 million decrease in workover expense resulting from a decrease in
workover activity and receipt of an insurance reimbursement offset by a $1.2 million increase in
controllable LOE resulting from new wells, additional acquired interest in existing wells and
increased well operating costs. Excluding the Appalachian Basin and workover expense, LOE
per Boe for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $8.15 compared to $7.27 for the six months
ended June 30, 2015.
Transportation, treating and gathering. We reported transportation expenses of $1.0 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2015,
respectively.  Excluding the Appalachian Basin, transportation expense in the Mid-Continent
increased $386,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015 due to new wells and changes in Oklahoma marketing contracts.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. We reported DD&A expense of $19.3 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 down from $30.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
The decrease in DD&A expense was the result of a 25% decrease in production resulting from
the completion of the Appalachian Basin Sale on April 8, 2016 coupled with a 15% decrease in
the DD&A rate per Boe. The DD&A rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $10.82 per
Boe compared to $12.75 per Boe for the same period in 2015. The decrease in the rate is
primarily due to impairment charges incurred in 2015 and first quarter 2016  .
Impairment of oil and natural gas properties.  We reported an impairment of oil and natural gas
properties of $48.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which was recorded at March
31, 2016.  The impairment was the result of a 38% decline in the 12-month average natural gas
price and a 44% decline in the 12-month average oil price used in the calculation of the full cost
ceiling test at March 31, 2016 compared to March 31, 2015.  At March 31, 2016, our ceiling test
impairment calculation was based on SEC pricing of $2.40 per MMBtu of Henry Hub spot natural
gas and $46.26 per barrel of WTI spot oil.  For a description of the ceiling impairment
determination and the impact of recent price declines on such impairments, see Part I, Item 1.
“Financial Statements, Note 3 – Property, Plant and Equipment.”
General and administrative expense. We reported general and administrative expenses of $11.9
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $8.7 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015.  Non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is included in general and
administrative expense, decreased $438,000 to $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Excluding stock-based compensation
expense, general and administrative expense increased $3.7 million to $9.6 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.  This increase is
primarily due to allowance for bad debt expense costs of $2.0 million related to the bankruptcy of
a third-party purchaser of our production primarily in West Virginia, $677,000 of severance costs
for the Appalachian Basin staff and the retirement of the chief operating officer, $471,000 of
higher legal fees and $399,000 of acquisition costs.
Interest expense.  We reported interest expense of $18.6 million for the six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to $14.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The increase in
interest expense is primarily due to additional borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and
higher grid pricing under the Revolving Credit Facility.
Dividends on preferred stock. We reported dividends on preferred stock of $7.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Series A Preferred Stock had a stated
value and liquidation preference of approximately $101.1 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and carries a cumulative dividend rate of 8.625% per annum. Dividends on the
Series A Preferred Stock were $4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.  The Series B Preferred Stock had a stated value and liquidation preference of
$53.5 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and carries a cumulative dividend rate of
10.75% per annum.  Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock were $2.8 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  Effective March 9, 2016 and commencing April 2016,
our Revolving Credit Facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our preferred
stock.  Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock have and will
continue to accumulate regardless of whether such dividends are declared or not.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash
flows from operating activities, possible asset sales and capital markets transactions, to the
extent available on favorable terms.  We believe that our current cash position, funds from
operating cash flows and possible proceeds from potential future divestitures and capital markets
transactions should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for 2016.    We continually
evaluate our capital needs and compare them to our capital resources and ability to raise funds
in the financial markets. We have the ability to adjust capital expenditures in response to
changes in oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs prices, drilling results, liquidity and cash
flow.  On May 12, 2016, we sold 50,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten
public offering at a price of $0.95 per share, or $47.5 million before
38
offering costs and expenses.  We received approximately $44.8 million of proceeds from the
offering, net of offering costs and expenses of approximately $2.7 million.  Current market
conditions may put limitations on our ability to issue new debt or equity securities in the public or
private markets. The ability of oil and natural gas companies to access the equity and high yield
debt markets has been significantly limited since the decline in commodity prices.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we reported cash flows provided by operating activities
of $5.4 million.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we reported net cash provided by
investing activities of $55.8 million primarily from proceeds from the Appalachian Basin Sale of
$77.6 million offset by $23.4 million for the development of oil and natural gas properties.  For the
six months ended June 30, 2016, we reported net cash used in financing activities of $60.5
million, consisting primarily of $100.4 million of repayment of borrowings under our Revolving
Credit Facility partially offset by $45.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of common equity
and $3.6 million of preferred stock dividends paid.  As a result of these activities, our cash and
cash equivalents balance increased by $687,000, resulting in a cash and cash equivalents
balance of $50.8 million at June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2016, we had a net working capital surplus of approximately $46.9 million.  At June
30, 2016, we had $99.6 million of borrowings outstanding and $370,000 of letters of credit issued
under our Revolving Credit Facility with no availability.
In early May 2016, we decided to withdraw our efforts to market approximately 26,000 net acres
of primarily undeveloped leasehold in Canadian and southeast Kingfisher Counties,
Oklahoma.  Our sales process was impacted by competing acreage that was further developed
and de-risked being offered for sale by third parties.  In addition, future operated and non-
operated drilling activity within and near our acreage could further de-risk our acreage position
and define its value to potential buyers in the future.  We continue to evaluate potential asset
divestitures to enhance our liquidity or capital program activity.
Our substantial borrowings relative to our current cash flows and proved reserve base limits our
operational flexibility, including our ability to make capital expenditures to fully exploit and
enhance the value of our undeveloped oil and natural gas properties. We are highly leveraged
and may not be able to generate sufficient cash or cash flows, as applicable, to service all of our
indebtedness or to meet financial covenants under our debt agreements and may be forced to
take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such agreements, which may not be
successful, or if successful, could adversely affect our creditors and be highly dilutive to our
existing holders of our common and preferred stock or possibly cause the loss of substantially all
of their investment.  For a description of possible actions we may consider to improve our
liquidity, see “Item II. Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors – We are highly leveraged and may
not be able to generate sufficient cash or cash flows, as applicable, to service all of our
indebtedness or to meet financial covenants under our debt agreements and may be forced to
take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such agreements, which may not be
successful, or if successful, could be highly dilutive to, and adversely affect, creditors and our
existing holders of our common and preferred stock.”
Future capital and other expenditure requirements.  Capital expenditures in the Mid-Continent for
the remainder of 2016 are currently projected to be approximately $35.1 million comprised of
$25.9 million for drilling, completion and infrastructure costs and $9.2 million for lease renewal
and extension costs.  In addition, we have allocated $3.0 million for capitalized general and
administrative costs.  All of the remaining 2016 capital expenditures are discretionary, however,
failure to fund lease acquisition expenditures will result in the forfeiture of leasehold rights on
some of our properties.  During the remainder of 2016, we have approximately 17,000 net acres
expiring in the Mid-Continent, including approximately 1,300 net acres that have automatic
extension rights, and have allocated funds for such renewals.  We plan to fund our remaining
2016 capital budget through existing cash balances, internally generated cash flow from
operating activities and possible capital markets transactions and divestitures of assets, or some
combination thereof.
We are closely monitoring the recent volatility in the commodity markets and we are developing
capital plans responsive to changes that are occurring in the commodity and capital markets. Our
capital expenditures and the scope of our drilling activities may change as a result of several
factors, including, but not limited to, changes in oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs prices,
costs of drilling and completion and leasehold acquisitions, drilling results, and changes in the
borrowing base under the Revolving Credit Facility. All of the remaining 2016 capital
expenditures are discretionary, and thus, we could reduce a significant portion of 2016 capital
expenditures if necessary to better match available capital resources, or in the event of debt
service requirements or other cash constraints as described elsewhere in this report.
Operating cash flow and commodity hedging activities. Our operating cash flow is sensitive to
many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for oil, condensate, natural
gas and NGLs. Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market
conditions including national and worldwide economic activity, weather, infrastructure capacity to
reach markets, supply levels and other variable factors. These factors are beyond our control and
are difficult to predict.
To mitigate some of the potential negative impact on cash flows caused by changes in oil,
condensate, natural gas and NGLs prices, we have entered into financial commodity costless
collars, index swaps, basis and fixed price swaps and put and call options to hedge oil,
condensate, natural gas and NGLs price risk. The crude oil fixed price swaps provide price
protection for our future oil sales
39
and butane, isobutene and pentanes components of our NGLs production as these heavy
components of NGLs have pricing that correlates closely with oil pricing. For 2016, we have
designated 15% of our current crude hedges as price protection for a portion of our NGLs
production. For additional information regarding our hedging activities, see Part I, Item 1.
“Financial Statements, Note 6 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity” of this report.
At June 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of all of our commodity derivative instruments was a
net asset of $12.8 million, comprised of current and non-current assets and liabilities. By
removing the price volatility from a portion of our oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs sales for
July 2016 through 2018, we have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing
prices on our operating cash flows for those periods. While mitigating negative effects of falling
commodity prices, certain derivative contracts also limit the benefits we could receive from
increases in commodity prices.  In conjunction with certain commodity derivative hedging activity,
we deferred the payment of certain put premiums for the production month period August 2016
through December 2018.  At June 30, 2016, we had a current commodity premium payable of
$1.7 million and a long-term commodity premium payable of $1.9 million.  The put premium
liabilities become payable monthly as the hedge production month becomes the prompt
production month.
As of June 30, 2016, all of our commodity derivative hedge positions were with large financial
institutions, each of which is not known to us to be in default on their derivative positions. We are
exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-performance by the counterparties in the derivative
contracts discussed above; however, we do not anticipate non-performance by such
counterparties.
ATM Program. We have an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) pursuant
to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price
up to $50.0 million in amounts and at times as we determine from time to time.  Actual issuances,
if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us, including, among others, market
conditions, the trading price of our common stock, our determinations of the appropriate sources
of funding for our company and potential uses of funding available to us.   To date, no shares of
common stock have been issued under the ATM Program.
Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility provides for a maximum amount of
$500.0 million, subject to a borrowing base, which, at June 30, 2016, was $100.0 million.  At
June 30, 2016, we had $99.6 million of borrowings outstanding and $370,000 of letters of credit
issued under our Revolving Credit Facility.  As of August 1, 2016, there were $99.6 million of
borrowings outstanding and $370,000 of letters of credit issued under our Revolving Credit
Facility.
At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit
Facility. We may, however, need to request a waiver of compliance with, or amendment to,
certain of our financial covenants by year-end 2016, which may not be received. The absence of
such relief could result in significant adverse consequences and require us to pursue various
actions to satisfy our Revolving Credit Facility obligations, which may not be successful, or if
successful, could adversely affect our creditors and be highly dilutive to our existing holders of
our common and preferred stock or possibly cause the loss of substantially all of their investment.
See “Part II, Other Information. Item 1A. Risk Factors.  –  We may in the future seek a
postponement of further reductions in our borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility or
seek relief from financial covenant compliance for future periods under our Revolving Credit
Facility, which if not successful, could require immediate repayment of  a portion or all amounts
borrowed on our Revolving Credit Facility and could result in actions that could be highly dilutive
to, and adversely affect, our creditors and our existing holders of our common and preferred
stock.”  For a more detailed description of the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility, see Part I,
Item 1. “Financial Statements, Note 4 – Long-Term Debt” of this report.
Senior Secured Notes.  We have $325.0 million of senior secured notes outstanding, which are
due May 15, 2018.  For a more detailed description of the terms of our Notes, see Part I, Item 1.
“Financial Statements, Note 4 - Long-Term Debt - Senior Secured Notes” of this report.  At June
30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the
Notes.  Covenants in the indenture governing our senior secured notes also limit our ability to
borrow on a first priority lien secured basis, including our ability to refinance the full amount of
currently outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or to reborrow on such
facility in the event current borrowings thereunder are paid down.
Series A Preferred Stock.  Prior to April 2016, we paid cumulative dividends on the Series A
Preferred Stock at a fixed rate of 8.625% per annum of the aggregate $101.1 million stated value
and liquidation preference.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized
dividends of $2.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the Series A Preferred
Stock.  Effective March 9, 2016, our Revolving Credit Facility prohibited the payment of cash
dividends on our preferred stock commencing April 2016.  Accordingly, we ceased payment of
dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock in April 2016.  Dividends on the Series A Preferred
Stock have and will continue to accumulate regardless of whether any such dividends are
declared or not.
If we fail to pay full cash dividends in four calendar quarters, whether consecutive or non-
consecutive, and until accumulated dividends are paid in full for four calendar quarters with the
last two calendar quarters’ dividends paid in cash, then (i) the fixed rate of Series A Preferred
Stock  increases by 2.00%, (ii) the Company may be required to issue a dividend of common
stock to pay accrued and unpaid dividends, if such dividends are not paid in cash, provided it has
sufficient surplus to pay such a dividend under state law
40
and (iii) the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a single
class, will have the right to elect up to two additional directors to the board of directors of the
Company.
Series B Preferred Stock.  Prior to April 2016, we paid cumulative dividends on the Series B
Preferred Stock at a fixed rate of 10.75% per annum of the aggregate $53.5 million stated value
and liquidation preference. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized
dividends of $1.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the Series B Preferred
Stock.  Effective March 9, 2016, our Revolving Credit Facility prohibited the payment of cash
dividends on our preferred stock commencing April 2016.  Accordingly, we ceased payment of
dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock in April 2016.  Dividends on the Series B Preferred
Stock have and will continue to accumulate regardless of whether any such dividends are
declared or not.
If we fail to pay full cash dividends in four calendar quarters, whether consecutive or non-
consecutive, and until accumulated dividends are paid in full for four calendar quarters with the
last two calendar quarters’ dividends paid in cash, then (i) the fixed rate of Series B Preferred
Stock  increases by 2.00%, (ii) the Company may be required to issue a dividend of common
stock to pay accrued and unpaid dividends, if such dividends are not paid in cash, provided it has
sufficient surplus to pay such a dividend under state law and (iii) the holders of Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, will have the right to elect
up to two additional directors to the board of directors of the Company.
After March 31, 2017, if we do not pay all accumulated and unpaid dividends on our outstanding
preferred stock in cash, we may be required to issue a significant number of shares of common
stock as dividends to holders of our outstanding preferred stock, which will dilute our common
stockholders and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  The number of
shares of common stock paid as dividends, if paid in respect of Series A Preferred Stock or
Series B Preferred Stock, would be determined based upon a ten day average last sale trading
price of the common stock immediately prior (or reasonably close in time to) the dividend
payment date. Under certain circumstances, in lieu of cash or common stock dividends, we may
be required to make “pay in kind” dividends of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred
Stock. Payments of stock dividends on our preferred stock could be substantially dilutive to
stockholders. See “Part II, Other Information. Item 1A. Risk Factors.  – After March 31, 2017, if we
do not pay all accumulated and unpaid dividends on our outstanding preferred stock in cash, we
may be required to issue a significant number of shares of common stock as dividends to holders
of our outstanding preferred stock, which will dilute our common stockholders and may adversely
affect the trading price of our common stock.”
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. We have no plans to enter into
any off-balance sheet arrangements in the foreseeable future.
Commitments and Contingencies
As is common within the industry, we have entered into various commitments and operating
agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved oil and
natural gas properties. It is management’s belief that such commitments will be met without a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
We are party to various litigation matters and administrative claims arising out of the normal
course of business. Although the ultimate outcome of each of these matters cannot be absolutely
determined and the liability the Company may ultimately incur with respect to any one of these
matters in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently accrued with
respect to such matters, management does not believe any such matters will have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. A discussion of
current legal proceedings is set forth in Part I, Item 1. “Financial Statements, Note 11 –
Commitments and Contingencies” of this report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses, contingent assets and liabilities and the related disclosures in the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements. Changes in these estimates and assumptions
could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Management
considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
·It requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and
 ·Changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated
results of operations or financial condition.
Significant accounting policies that we employ and information about the nature of our most
critical accounting estimates, our assumptions or approach used and the effects of hypothetical
changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate are
41
presented in Part I, Item I. “Financial Statements, Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” of this report and in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in
our 2015 Form 10-K.
Recent Accounting Developments
For a discussion of recent accounting developments, see Part I, Item 1. “Financial Statements,
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Policies” of this report.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Commodity Price Risk
Our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our oil, condensate, natural
gas and NGLs production. Our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by
changes in market prices. Realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot
prices applicable to oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs in the region produced. Prices
received for oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs are volatile, unpredictable and beyond our
control.  To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into
various derivative instruments.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, a 10%
change in the prices received for oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs production would have
had an approximate $1.5 million and $2.9 million, impact on our revenues prior to hedge
transactions to mitigate our commodity pricing risk, respectively. See Part I, Item 1. “Financial
Statements, Note 6 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity” of this report for additional
information regarding our hedging activities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our Revolving Credit Facility.  At June
30, 2016, we had $99.6 million of borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit
Facility.  Based on the amount outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility at June 30, 2016,
a one percentage point change in the interest rate would have had a per month impact of
$83,000 on our interest expense.  We have not entered into interest rate hedging arrangements
in the past, and have no current plans to do so.  Due to the potential for fluctuating balances in
the amount outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, we do not believe such
arrangements to be cost effective.  The amount outstanding under the Notes is at fixed interest of
8.625% per annum.  We currently do not use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to
the volatility in interest rates, including under the Revolving Credit Facility, as this risk is minimal.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Management’s Evaluation on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”),
as of June 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-
15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended June
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
In addition to the risk factors below and the other information set forth in this report, you should
carefully consider the factors discussed in   Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K
and Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended March 31, 2016, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or
future results. These risks are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
We are highly leveraged and may not be able to generate sufficient cash or cash flows, as
applicable, to service all of our indebtedness or to meet financial covenants under our debt
agreements and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under such
agreements, which may not be successful, or if successful, could be highly dilutive to, and
adversely affect, creditors and our existing holders of our common and preferred stock.
Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness obligations and to
meet related financial covenants applicable to our debt instruments, including our Revolving
Credit Facility and our $325.0 million outstanding principal amount of 8 5/8% Senior Secured
Notes due 2018 (the “Notes”), depends on our financial condition and operating performance,
which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial,
business and other factors beyond our control, as well as our ability to complete proposed asset
sales.  As of August 1, 2016, our cash balance was approximately $45.6 million. We may not be
able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the
principal, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.
Our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including,
without limitation:
•requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to support the
payment of debt service and reduce our capital expenditures required to maintain or grow our
reserves and production base;
•increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions,
and putting us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have fewer fixed
obligations and greater cash flows to devote to their businesses;
•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general
corporate and other purposes; and
•limiting our flexibility in operating our business and preventing us from engaging in certain
transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us.
Due to the relatively high level of our indebtedness, on April 8, 2016, we sold substantially all of
our producing assets and proved reserves and a significant portion of our undeveloped acreage
in the Appalachian Basin for an adjusted sales price of $76.6 million and on May 12, 2016, we
sold 50,000,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering for approximately
$44.8 million of net proceeds.  We are also pursuing or analyzing various additional alternatives
to reduce the level of our long-term debt and lower our future debt obligations, including the
application of proceeds from possible targeted assets sales, followed by possible issuance of
equity securities for cash, debt repurchases, exchanges of existing debt securities for new debt
securities and exchanges or conversions of existing debt securities for new equity securities,
among other options.   Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the
condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. One or more of these
alternatives could potentially be consummated with the consent of any one or more of our current
security holders, or, if necessary, without the consent of holders through a restructuring under a
voluntary bankruptcy proceeding.  Such alternatives would likely adversely affect our creditors
and be highly dilutive to our existing holders of our common and preferred stock or possibly
cause the loss of substantially all of their investment.  Any refinancing of our indebtedness could
be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which
could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments,
including the indentures governing our Notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these
alternatives.  For example, covenants in the indenture governing the Notes also limit our ability to
borrow on a first priority lien secured basis, which may limit our ability to refinance the full amount
of currently outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or to reborrow on such
facility in the event current borrowings thereunder are paid down.  In addition, any failure to make
payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would
likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to
meet our debt service and other obligations. Our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures
governing our Notes currently restrict our ability to dispose of assets and our use of the
43
proceeds from such disposition. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the
proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then
due, including required reduction in amounts owed in our Revolving Credit Facility as a result of
reductions in our borrowing base.  If we are unable to meet our debt obligations, we would be
forced to restructure our indebtedness and equity capitalization.  Depending upon asset values
and other factors, any future restructuring could be highly dilutive to existing holders of our
common and preferred stock, could result in equity holders losing a significant amount or all of
their investment in us and may adversely affect the trading prices and values of our existing debt
and equity securities.
We may in the future seek a postponement of further reductions in our borrowing base under our
Revolving Credit Facility or seek relief from financial covenant compliance for future periods
under our Revolving Credit Facility, which if not successful, could require immediate repayment
of  a portion or all amounts borrowed on our Revolving Credit Facility and could result in actions
that could be highly dilutive to, and adversely affect, our creditors and our existing holders of our
common and preferred stock.
After completion of our Appalachian Basin Sale on April 8, 2016 and our related repayment of
$80.0 million in outstanding borrowings, our borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility
was reduced to $100.0 million, and as of August 1, 2016, $99.6 million of borrowings remained
outstanding and $370,000 of letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Facility. In connection with Amendment No. 8 (as defined and described below) to the
Revolving Credit Facility, we have agreed to an additional scheduled borrowing base
redetermination in August 2016. Our borrowing base is otherwise determined semi-annually by
our lenders in May and November of each year and is based on our proved reserves and the
value attributed to those reserves.  We and the lenders each have the option to initiate a
redetermination of the borrowing base between scheduled semi-annual redeterminations.
The borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility could be further reduced as a result of
lower oil or natural gas prices, declines in estimated oil and natural gas reserves or production,
our issuance of new indebtedness or for other reasons.  If the borrowing base under our
Revolving Credit Facility is further reduced, there would be a reduction of our available credit and
the potential requirement for us to repay outstanding indebtedness in excess of the redetermined
borrowing base. In addition, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our
Revolving Credit Facility as a result of the inability on the part of our lending counterparties to
meet their funding obligations and the inability of other lenders to provide additional funding to
cover the defaulting lender's portion.  If our borrowing base is further reduced or we cannot
access adequate funding under our Revolving Credit Facility, it will reduce the availability of our
cash flow for replacing reserves through implementing our drilling and development plan, making
acquisitions or otherwise carrying out our business plan, which would have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service our
indebtedness.
In addition, under our Revolving Credit Facility we are required to maintain compliance with
certain financial covenants, including a minimum interest coverage ratio, and for quarterly
periods ending on or after June 30, 2017, a maximum leverage ratio. Under the recent commodity
price environment (utilizing recent NYMEX strip commodities pricing for the remainder of the year
and assuming limited capital expenditures to maintain or grow our reserves and production), we
believe it is likely we would not meet the minimum interest coverage ratio applicable to our
Revolving Credit Facility at year-end 2016. In addition, our compliance with the maximum
leverage ratio covenant as of June 30, 2017 is uncertain. Accordingly, absent significant
increased prices, reduced costs or production increases during 2016, we expect to request
further waivers of compliance or amendments with respect to such ratios from lenders holding of
a majority of the commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility. There is, however, no
assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such a waiver or amendment.
If we fail to comply with our financial covenant ratios or lenders under our Revolving Credit
Facility reduce our borrowing base beyond our ability to repay, our lenders could accelerate the
maturity of our Revolving Credit Facility and exercise remedies available to them, including
foreclosure on our pledged oil and gas properties. We expect that in these circumstances, we
would pursue the various alternatives described in the immediately preceding risk factor to
reduce our indebtedness and repay amounts owed under our Revolving Credit Facility, all of
which could be highly dilutive to existing holders of our common and preferred stock, could result
in equity holders losing a significant amount or all of their investment in us and may adversely
affect the trading prices and values of our existing debt and equity securities.
After March 31, 2017, if we do not pay all accumulated and unpaid dividends on our outstanding
preferred stock in cash, we may be required to issue a significant number of shares of common
stock as dividends to holders of our outstanding preferred stock, which will dilute our common
stockholders and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
We have two series of perpetual preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate stated value
liquidation preference of $154.6 million. Under recent amendments to our revolving credit facility,
we are prohibited from paying cash dividends on our preferred stock. Accordingly, we ceased
paying monthly dividends on our preferred stock effective April 2016.  If we do not or cannot pay
accumulated dividends on our outstanding preferred stock in cash by April 1, 2017, we may be
required to issue shares of common stock to pay the accumulated and unpaid dividends, which
would aggregate approximately $14.1 million at April 1, 2017 (assuming no issuance of cash
dividends before such date), and pay all future monthly dividends in common stock, in each case
assuming our common stock is then listed on a national securities exchange or market and we
have surplus under Delaware law at that time equal to or in excess of the par value of the
common stock issued as dividends. The number of shares of common stock issued in lieu of
cash
44
dividends would be determined based upon a ten day average last sale trading price of the
common stock immediately prior (or reasonably close) to the date of such dividends.  If such
average last sale price in April 2017 were equal to our last sale price at June 30, 2016 of $1.10
per share and assuming we have not issued any preferred cash dividends prior to such date, we
would be obligated to issue approximately 13.2 million shares of our common stock in April 2017
(excluding shares for the April 2017 monthly dividend as described in the following sentence) to
holders of our outstanding preferred stock as dividends in lieu of cash dividends.  In addition,
after March 31, 2017, unless and until all accrued and unpaid preferred stock dividends are paid
in full and paid in cash for the most recent two calendar quarters, the fixed rate of dividends on
each of our two outstanding series of preferred stock will increase by 2.00% per annum and
monthly dividends, if not paid in cash, will be required to be paid monthly in common stock,
subject to the requirements described above. In such event, the monthly dividend requirement for
our currently outstanding preferred stock would increase to approximately $1.5 million, an
increase of $258,000 per month.  If the average last sale price in April 2017 were equal to our last
sale price at June 30, 2016 of $1.10 per share and assuming we have not issued preferred cash
dividends prior to such date, we would be obligated to issue approximately 1.3 million shares of
our common stock monthly commencing April 2017.  As a result, a significant number of shares
of common stock may be issued as dividends on our outstanding preferred stock after March 31,
2017, which issuances will dilute the ownership of our common stockholders and may adversely
affect the trading price of our common stock.
