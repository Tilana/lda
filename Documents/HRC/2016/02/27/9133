<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In resolution 6/34, the Council requested the Special Rapporteur to ensure effective 
follow-up and to foster the implementation of the remaining short and medium-term 
recommendations identified in the first report of the Group of Experts mandated by the Human 
Rights Council in resolution 4/8<b>1</b> through an open and constructive dialogue with the 
Government of the Sudan, taking into account the final report of the Group of Experts<b>2</b> and the 
replies of the Government thereon, and to include information in this regard in her report to the 
Council at its ninth session. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur has worked to ensure effective follow-up and to foster the 
effective implementation of the recommendations through dialogue with the Government. She 
has assessed the measures taken by the Government of the Sudan to implement the 
recommendations compiled by the Group of Experts and provides the Human Rights Council 
with as detailed a description and analysis of the status of implementation as possible. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur, on the basis of the information received, concludes that while 
certain recommendations have been  implemented, regarding certain other recommendations first 
steps towards implementation have been taken, whereas still other recommendations remain, at 
least for the present time, without implementation. The Special Rapporteur regrets that certain 
short-term recommendations were not addressed by the Government at all or, in other cases, 
information provided was unrelated to them. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the ultimate 
measure of the Government&#8217;s implementation of the recommendations compiled by the group 
has to be concrete improvement in the human rights situation on the ground in Darfur. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of the Sudan to take all necessary 
measures to implement the recommendations compiled by the Group of Experts without further 
delay in a more constructive engagement with the Human Rights Council, the United Nations 
and the international community. She would like to thank the donors for their generosity in 
providing funds for any United Nations technical assistance required towards this end. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Council continue the process 
of review, in accordance with the indicators for assessing implementation developed by the 
Group of Experts, until such time as there is full implementation of all recommendations. In 
recognition of the fact that the time frame for implementation of the short and medium-term 
recommendations elapsed on 20 June 2008 and that the Government of the Sudan should show 
more commitment to a process of cooperative engagement to foster the effective implementation 
of recommendations as requested by the Human Rights Council, the Council may also wish to 
consider what further action is required to concretely protect and promote the human rights of 
people in the Darfur region of the Sudan.

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Arising out of its deep concern over the ongoing violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law in Darfur, the Human Rights Council adopted without a vote at its 
fourth regular session, on 30 March 2007, resolution 4/8 on the follow-up to decision S-4/101 of 
13 December 2006 adopted by the Council at its fourth special session on the situation of human 
rights in the Darfur. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 4/8, the Council decided to convene a group of seven mandate holders to 
ensure the effective follow-up and to foster the implementation of resolutions and 
recommendations on Darfur as adopted by the Council, the Commission on Human Rights and 
other UN human rights institutions, as well as to promote the implementation of relevant 
recommendations of other UN human rights mechanisms, taking into account the needs of Sudan 
in this regard, to safeguard the consistency of these recommendations and to contribute to the 
monitoring of the human rights situation on the ground. The Group of Experts was presided over 
by Sima Samar, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, and was 
composed of Philip Alston, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, Radhika Coomaraswamy, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
children and armed conflict, Yakin Ert&#252;rk, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, Hina Jilani, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, Walter K&#228;lin, Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the human rights of internally displaced persons, and Manfred Nowak, Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Mr. K&#228;lin 
served as Rapporteur for the Group of Experts. 
</p>
<p>3. In resolution 6/34, the Council requested the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in the Sudan to ensure effective follow-up and to foster the implementation of the 
remaining short-term and the medium-term recommendations identified in the first report of the 
Group of Experts (A/HRC/5/6) through an open and constructive dialogue with the Government 
of the Sudan, taking into account the final report of the Group of Experts (A/HRC/6/19) and the 
replies of the Government thereon, and to include information in this regard in her report to the 
Council at its ninth session. 
</p>
<p>4. In its resolution 7/16, the Council urged the Government of the Sudan to continue and 
intensify its efforts to implement the recommendations identified by the Group of Experts, in 
accordance with the specified time frames and indicators. The Council invited relevant 
United Nations bodies and agencies, including the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, to continue providing support and technical assistance to the 
Sudan for the implementation of the recommendations of the Group of Experts, and calls upon 
donors to continue providing financial and technical assistance and required equipment for the 
improvement of human rights in the Sudan and to continue to provide support for the 
implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. 
</p>
<p>5. The present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 6/34. It contains a review by the 
Special Rapporteur of the efforts by the Government of the Sudan to implement the 
recommendations of the Group of Experts on Darfur compiled, on the basis of information</p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p>received from the Government in written and oral form and from other sources, including 
United Nations and African Union agencies, bodies and programmes with operational 
competence in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>6. Using the indicators put forward in the Group&#8217;s report to the Council of 8 June 2007 
(Annex to A/HRC/5/6), the Special Rapporteur provides an assessment of the Government&#8217;s 
activities to implement recommendations to be achieved over the short and medium-term as well 
as the degree of impact reported from the ground in Darfur. Accordingly, the present report 
focuses on developments in Darfur between the adoption of Council resolution 6/34 in 
December 2007 and July 2007. In the appendix to the report, the Special Rapporteur presents a 
more detailed review of the current status of implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  METHODS OF WORK 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur continued to follow the methodology used by the Group of Experts 
in its work. 
</p>
<p> (a) To cooperate and work in a transparent manner with the Government of the Sudan 
and other relevant partners of the international community; 
</p>
<p> (b) To identify obstacles to the implementation of previous recommendations; 
</p>
<p> (c) To differentiate short-term from medium-term recommendations with a view to 
assisting the Government of the Sudan to implement fully the recommendations identified and to 
keep the victims of past and ongoing human rights violations of human rights and humanitarian 
law in central focus, with the aim of reducing such violations in the future. 
</p>
<p>8. In line with the indicators specified, this report focuses on the state of implementation on 
two levels: On the one hand, it examines to what extent the Government of the Sudan has 
undertaken recommended activities. This assessment is based on information provided and 
documentation submitted by the Government. On the other hand, the report analyses information 
received from UNAMID, UNMIS, UN agencies and other organizations which are operational in 
Darfur with a view to identifying whether and to what extent any tangible impact on the ground 
is being reported. This methodology permits the group to conclude, in relation to each 
recommendation, whether (i) it was fully implemented (i.e. all recommended activities were 
carried out and, as a result, the situation on the ground has been reported to have improved 
accordingly); (ii) significant activities were undertaken and tangible impact has been reported 
from the ground; (iii) activities were undertaken but little or no practical impact has been 
reported; (iv) initial steps towards implementation were undertaken; or (v) there was no 
implementation at all. While this report synthesizes the findings of the Special Rapporteur, the 
appendix sets out in detail information received from the Government and other sources as well 
as the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment for each of the recommendations contained in the first 
report of the Group of Experts to the Council (A/HCR/5/6). 
</p>
<p>9. The report first describes the activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur since 
December and then summarizes the findings of the Special Rapporteur as to the present status of 
implementation for each of the four main clusters of recommendations identified, namely: 
(a) human rights protection; (b) humanitarian access, including protection of humanitarian </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>workers from harassment and attacks, and facilitating access to civilians, including those 
displaced; (c) accountability and justice; (d) monitoring of implementation of recommendations. 
The report ends with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s main conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government of the Sudan on 23 January 2008 
requesting an official visit to Sudan to gather first hand information on the human rights situation 
in the country and engage in a constructive dialogue with the Government on human rights 
concerns. The Special Rapporteur sent another letter on 7 February 2008 proposing a tentative 
programme for the visit including a meeting with the Inter-ministerial committee to discuss 
status of implementation of the Group of Experts on Darfur recommendations. The Government 
of the Sudan accepted her proposed dates 28 February to 10 March 2008 for the visit. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur contacted the human rights components of UNAMID and UNMIS 
to gather information from concerned UN agencies, bodies and programmes operational in 
Darfur. The present report reflects information received from those sources in addition to 
information provided by the Government of the Sudan. The Special Rapporteur has sought to 
ensure as far as possible that the information was based on first hand observations, careful 
verification and wherever appropriate interagency corroboration. The Special Rapporteur is 
grateful to all those who submitted information on the current status of implementation of 
recommendations according to the time frame and indicators specified by the Group of Group of 
Experts on Darfur. 
</p>
<p>12. In a letter dated 8 February the Permanent Representative for the Sudan to the UN in 
Geneva informed the Special Rapporteur that the Ministry of Justice had agreed to continue 
cooperation in the same method adopted with the Group of Experts on Darfur through dialogue 
and exchange of concerns and information with the Special Rapporteur. He informed that the 
Minister of Justice had established an inter-ministerial committee, headed by Mr. Zumrawy, to 
be the focal point to deal with concerns of the Special Rapporteur. He reported that the 
committee had held several meetings and was ready to meet with the Special Rapporteur in 
Khartoum. At the request of the Government, prior to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s arrival the 
complete set of recommendations and key topics for discussion were submitted to the ACHR in 
Khartoum. 
</p>
<p>13. On 9 March during her visit to Sudan the Special Rapporteur held a meeting with the 
Inter-ministerial committee in Khartoum to discuss status of implementation of the Group of 
Experts on Darfur recommendations. At that meeting the Government stated that due to the short 
period of time following the report in December 2007, it was unable to discuss the status of 
implementation with her. They provided statistical information, in Arabic, on the status of 
investigation and prosecution of cases on violence against women and children in North, 
South and West Darfur for the period September 2007-January 2008. Information on 
prosecutions of members of the armed forces under Article 149 of the Criminal Act was also 
provided at the meeting. The inter-ministerial committee agreed to send a complete progress 
report, in English, to the Special Rapporteur by 25 May 2008. On 28 April 2008 the Special 
Rapporteur sent a letter requesting a visit to Sudan 29 June to 13 July 2008 and recalling the 
Government&#8217;s agreement to send a progress report by 25 May 2008. On 3 June 2008 the Special 
Rapporteur informed the Government that the agreed deadline of 25 May 2008 had passed and </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>encouraged the Government to send the progress report as soon as possible to ensure that all 
relevant information on the human rights situation would be reflected in her review. The 
Government&#8217;s progress report was submitted to the Special Rapporteur on 26 June 2008 on the 
eve of her departure to Sudan. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government of the Sudan submitted a report to the Special Rapporteur 
on 10 July 2008 on status of implementation of the recommendations. On 11 July the Special 
Rapporteur held a meeting with the inter-ministerial committee in Khartoum to discuss the status 
of implementation and clarify outstanding issues. The Government engaged in a dialogue with 
the Special Rapporteur on the different aspects of the human rights situation but the Government 
did not provide any information in oral form on the status of implementation of the 
recommendations. According to the Government the written information was comprehensive. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the Government of the 
Sudan in written form. However, she regrets that despite her best efforts the dialogue with the 
inter-ministerial committee in Khartoum was not very informative specifically on the 
recommendation of the Group of Experts on Darfur. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Human rights protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Protection of the civilian population, including internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>16. Regarding the protection of the civilian population, the group of Group of Experts had 
proposed that the Government of the Sudan issue and enforce clear orders to the armed forces 
and any militias under Government&#8217;s control that it is prohibited to make civilians or civilian 
objects (including cultivated land and livestock) the target of attacks or to launch indiscriminate 
attacks (including burning of villages and aerial bombardments); that such attacks can amount to 
war crimes and crimes against humanity, that suspects, including bearers of command 
responsibility, will be investigated and brought to justice, and that any immunities would be 
waived (recommendation 1.1.1) and enforced (see section C. Accountability and Justice below). 
The Government informed that the new Armed Forces Act was approved at the end of 2007. The 
Act includes a chapter on the principles of International Humanitarian Law which illustrates the 
protection of civilians and war crimes. The chapter also emphasizes individual responsibility and 
provides for mechanisms of accountability and formation of military courts. The National 
Commission of Humanitarian Law at the Ministry of Justice is preparing the required studies for 
the adoption of the Arab Model Law for war crimes and crimes against humanity, endorsed by 
the Sudan and other Arab countries at the meeting of Arab Ministries of Justice on 6/4/2008. The 
basic draft of the law was prepared by the legal branch of the Arab League. The National 
Commission of Humanitarian Law is also drafting a Combating mines Act 2008 pursuant to 
article 9 of the Ottawa agreement. The Government informed that a workshop was held in 
El Fashar for police officers, armed forces, prosecutors and judges on international humanitarian 
law principles, protection of civilians during conflict and safeguards pertaining to arrest and 
detention. Implementation began in October 2007 when the Government indicated that it had 
issued and circulated rules to enforce discipline in the Sudanese Armed Forces. </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>17. The information received indicates that the orders and strengthened legal framework has 
not had any impact so far as attacks on civilians and civilian objects by Government forces or 
allied militia continued. UN sources indicate that from January to July 2008 there were 
indiscriminate Government aerial bombardments of civilian towns specifically in West and 
North Darfur. The attacks resulted in the displacement of thousands of people and the death of 
hundreds of civilians and widespread destruction of property and livestock. In the Northern 
corridor of West Darfur, the Government embarked on a major military campaign using armed 
militias and Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) ground troops, supported by SAF air assets to regain 
control of areas that were seized by the armed group, Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). In 
its campaign, the Government failed to discriminate between civilians and armed groups 
combatants. Civilian villages in the area were also subjected to repeated attacks and looting and 
the burning of their homes by armed militia aligned with the Government. In April and 
May 2008, the Government shifted focus to North Darfur. Ten civilian villages including 
cultivated land were subjected to aerial bombardments in violation of the principle of distinction. 
The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the reports received of continuing attacks against 
civilians or civilian objects and launching of indiscriminate attacks including aerial bombing. 
The attacks led to killings, widespread looting and destruction of civilian property, including 
hundreds of houses, the theft and killing of large numbers of livestock, as well as the 
displacement of thousands of people. 
</p>
<p>18. With regards to (recommendation 1.1.2) control and disarm the militia and to control and 
downsize the PDF, Border Intelligence Guard<i>,</i> Central Reserve Police, Popular Police or 
Nomadic Police. The Government reported that on 5 June 2008, in South Darfur, a joint 
committee of armed forces, security and police at the camp of Domaia, 15 km west of Nyala, 
completed the procedure of handing over the light and heavy weapons of 174 fighters from the 
Peoples Forces Movement, headed by Gamal Eldeen Ali Abdalla. Accordingly the group 
evacuated the sites it dominated in the regions of North Eltaina and Khor Banga. Reports 
indicate that the militia, the PDF, Border Intelligence Guard<i>,</i> Central Reserve Police, Popular 
Police or Nomadic Police continue to commit violations and no efforts have been taken to 
control or disarm them. 
</p>
<p>19. Despite some action taken by the Government to prevent and protect the civilian 
population against attacks (recommendation 1.1.3), the civilian population in Darfur was 
reported to remain largely unprotected against such attacks. As of July 2008, there were 
4.27 million people affected people in need of assistance, of which, 2.5 million are internally 
displaced. An additional 250,000 Darfurians sought refuge in Chad. Displacement is still 
ongoing, 150,000 people were displaced in the first four months of 2008 and 780,000 since the 
signing of DPA, 5 May 2006. The affected population throughout Darfur is vulnerable to risks 
associated with displacement, lack of basic services and lack of protection. UN agencies, bodies 
and programmes operational in Darfur documented several attacks by SLA/MM, militia groups 
and other armed elements, on IDP camps. The proliferation of weapons, the presence of armed 
elements residing or in some cases responsible for security inside the camps along with the 
increased divisions along tribal affiliations added to the insecurity felt by IDPs in Darfur. The 
UN documented consistent accounts of harassment, intimidation, and sexual and physical 
assaults on IDPs particularly female IDPs by armed militias, often dressed in military uniform 
from Arab nomadic groups. IDPs continued to be vulnerable and exposed to violence as a result 
of deliberate attacks by Government forces and rebel groups. In some cases, IDPs found 
themselves caught in the middle of fighting between warring factions. Violations included direct </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>attacks on IDP camps, blockade of camps perceived to be hostile to the Government, 
intimidation and physical assaults. In addition, several cases of arbitrary detention and 
ill-treatment of IDPs by Government security forces were documented over the reporting period. 
Tribal clashes also have resulted in civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>20. On 10 May 2008 rebels of the Darfurian Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) launched 
an unprecedented attack on the Omdurman district of Khartoum. Government forces stopped the 
rebel attack in the eastern part of Omdurman near the river Nile. According to official sources, 
over 30 civilians died in the attacks, but the circumstances of most of killings of civilians remain 
unknown. Eye-witness accounts indicated that at least six civilians were killed deliberately by 
JEM fighters during an attack on a brick factory. JEM further attacked civilian targets, such as 
the main Omdurman local Government office, a police station of regular police forces who were 
not participating in the armed conflict between JEM and Government forces, and the branch of a 
bank in Omdurman market. The number of casualties caused by these attacks is unknown. It is 
likely that the number of casualties was limited because most office and Government buildings 
were empty as the attack occurred on a weekend. The main material damage to buildings 
attacked by JEM appeared to have resulted from rocket-propelled grenades fired at the buildings, 
and there were also numerous bullet holes probably caused by rifle shots. 
</p>
<p>21. The Government provided information about efforts to prevent child recruitment and 
highlighted concerns about the use of child combatants by JEM (recommendation 1.1.4). The 
National Assembly adopted the new Sudan Armed Forces Act during its regular session on 
5 December 2007. The Act makes illegal recruitment of persons below the age of 18 into the 
Armed Forces and provides criminal penalties for those who recruit children under the age 
of 18 years or provide false information for enlistment/recruitment of a person below 18 years of 
age. The provisions are an improvement on the earlier Armed Forces Act but fall short of 
international law and standards. For example, provisions criminalising recruitment of child 
soldiers do not apply to the enlistment or recruitment of children into rebel forces who are 
known to use child soldiers widely. In addition, the crime of recruiting child soldiers is subject to 
a statute of limitations 10 years after the offence. The Armed Forces Act causes further concern, 
since military courts are permitted jurisdiction over civilians with regards to acts of genocide and 
war crimes, and Article 34 of the Act provides immunity to soldiers for acts committed in an 
official capacity. Furthermore, the death penalty is maintained for crimes that are not amongst 
the most serious. 
</p>
<p>22. According to information received from the Government the number of IDPs who returned 
voluntarily to their original villages in 2008 included: 132,222 in South Darfur to the villages of 
Jumiza arbaa, Kassar, Buram, Hiloog and Marla; 135,242 people in North Darfur to the villages 
of Abu Zeraga, Fatabarnu, Kalkel and Shagra; and 155,066 in West Darfur to the villages of 
Arkum, Gokar, Artala, and Bendas. 
</p>
<p>23. According to information received from the Government 2,300 police were deployed to 
North Darfur state, 2,500 police were deployed to South Darfur and 2,600 police were deployed 
to West Darfur to protect IDP camps. The police are said to have established stations in the 
camps and carry out regular patrols around the camps as well as escorting women groups out of 
the camps while collecting fire wood (recommendation 1.1.5). </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Protection of women against violence 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Government provided information on criminal cases of violence against women in 
South and North Darfur, involving accused who are members of the regular forces (armed forces 
and police). The 4 cases from South Darfur (period 2006-2008) included crimes of art. 142 and 
149, 3 persons were sentenced and 1 accused from the armed forces had not been arrested yet. 
The 8 cases from North Darfur (period 2006-2008), 5 were sentenced, 2 were due to appear in 
court on 22/6/08 and 24/6/08 and 1 accused from the armed forces had not been arrested yet. 
These commendable efforts to combat impunity through investigation, prosecution of 
perpetrators and compensation must continue. 
</p>
<p>25. The definition of rape needs to be amended as well as looking into evidentiary 
requirements for the prosecution of sexual crimes however no significant action has been taken 
to date (recommendation 1.2.8). Application of the existing law, have in some instances 
amended charges of rape to adultery. The &#8220;reversal of charge&#8221; has become an effective threat to 
victims accessing justice in cases of rape. The problem of misinterpretation of the law has not 
been limited to defence lawyers, in the absence of a statutory interpretation of the Evidence 
Act 1993, in cases of rape, judges&#8217; interpretation of the law has also not been clear. 
</p><p>26. Increased efforts are needed to seriously address these crimes as women and girls, 
particularly the displaced, continue to be raped and subjected to other forms of sexual violence 
especially when they venture outside the confines of the IDP camps to undertake income 
generating activities. There have been a few cases where perpetrators of rape have been 
prosecuted, however in the majority of cases the authorities are still not responding 
appropriately. More effort is required to ensure that every case reported to the authorities is 
promptly responded to through effective investigation, prosecution and compensation. Only 
when victims see successful cases being brought to court will they have confidence in the 
criminal justice system and more cases will be reported to the police. 
27. Steps were taken by the Government to ensure that women who experienced sexual 
violence have access to medical care, regardless of whether they choose to report their case to 
the police or not. This has been fully implemented with the authorities disseminating, promoting 
compliance with the rules for implementation of Criminal Circular No. 2, and state committees 
monitoring compliance. Training is ongoing to ensure that the message is communicated to all 
parts of Darfur (recommendation 1.2.6). 
</p>
<p>28. Gender and family protection units in Northern and Southern Darfur have received women 
police who will investigate gender-based crimes. The Special Rapporteur was provided with a 
list of names of police women transferred to different sites in Darfur, as well as the names of 
women who joined the child and family protection units. The new Unit now comprises the 
Prosecution office, Judiciary, Ministry of Social Welfare, doctors and psychosocial specialists. 
Additionally, the new unit comprises a specialised Prosecutor for children, a child custody centre 
and a juvenile court. The Government informed that 35 police women have been deployed in 
Northern State to work in the camps of Abu Shouk and Zam Zam and units of women and child 
protection in the central and southern sectors. In Southern Darfur 33 police women have been 
deployed in the camps of Itash, Alsraif, Alsalam and Sagli as well as in the localities of Nyala,</p>

</p>
<p>Gadas, Idelfrsanm, Rehaid Alberdi, Kas and Aldiain. Lists of names, rank and location were 
provided to the Special Rapporteur. In North Darfur 27 social workers were said to have been 
trained by the unit to combat violence against women on the effects of incidents on victims 
(recommendation 1.2.7). </p>
<p><b>3.  Children and armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Child Act 2008 (bill) has been submitted to parliament. The bill defines a child as a 
person who has not yet reached the age of 18 and it has revoked signs of maturity as a criterion 
for defining a child adopted by the previous Act. It also prohibits FGM and raised the age of 
criminal responsibility. It also dedicates a section for juvenile trial, formation of special 
prosecutor and courts. It also elaborated on means of reform and rehabilitation. The bill also 
provides better guarantees for children with disabilities (recommendation 1.3.2). By the initiative 
of the National Council for Child Welfare NCCW, UNICEF in partnership with Save the 
Children-Sweden commenced training of Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) officers in Khartoum and 
Darfur states (recommendation 1.3.3). 
</p>
<p><b>4. Protection against summary executions, arbitrary  
detention, disappearances, torture 
</b></p>
<p>30. Government security apparatus continued to commit human rights violations including 
arbitrary arrests, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment of detainees. Individuals targeted 
included community leaders, and people perceived to have ties with rebel movements. Abuses by 
rebel groups and armed militias have also been received. The UN has records of some 
450 detainees, most of them civilians of Darfurian origin, who have been arrested in connection 
with the JEM attack 10 May 2008. The actual number of arrests carried out may be much higher 
than the over 500 individual cases it has been able to record. Large numbers of civilians appear 
to have been arrested arbitrarily on the basis of their ethnic origin or perceived affiliation with 
JEM, and are held without access to the legal support. Families have not been informed where 
their relatives are being held, raising fears that detainees have been subject to enforced 
disappearance. There is allegation that detainees may be tortured or ill-treated in detention. 
Reports of excessive use of force during arrests and of ill-treatment in police and NISS detention 
have been received. Several reports from released detainees indicate that numerous detainees 
suffered serious health problems in detention as a consequence of torture or ill-treatment, or due 
to exposure to sun and lack of access to food or water in detention. While the Government has 
insisted that no detainees are tortured and those charged would be given access to lawyers. No 
information was provided to the Special Rapporteur on concrete measures taken with a view to 
upholding the rights of the detainees. Detainees were often not informed of the reasons for their 
arrest or charged with an offence and denied legal counsel (recommendation 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3). 
</p>
<p>31. The Government has not granted access for UNMIS Human Rights to places of detention 
in Khartoum-relevant for Darfur related detainees as there are transfers to the capital (either for 
trial or interrogation). Human rights monitors were granted limited access to Government 
detention facilities in West and South Darfur. No action was taken to reform the NISS in 
accordance with the INC. A large number of cases of harassment, arrest and detention by NISS 
has been documented and violations of rights of detainees especially those in the custody of MI 
and NISS (recommendation 1.4.3, 1.4.4, 1.4.5). </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Protection of witnesses and victims 
</b></p>
<p>32. No information was provided by the Government on measures taken to protect witnesses 
and victims against violence, reprisals and harassment by third parties. Access for human rights 
monitors was impeded by the authorities on some occasions. The deteriorated security situation, 
carjacking and banditry targeting UN assets combined with logistical limitations as well as 
intimidation by Government security apparatus hindered the ability of human rights monitors to 
document cases of violations and to gain access to victims and witnesses. Government clearance 
for flights to undertake missions have in some cases been delayed, and in some instances denied, 
further impeding the monitoring work of human rights officers. 
</p>
<p>33. There were reports that Human Rights Defenders working on Darfur-related issues in 
Khartoum were subjected to intimidation and harassment by the NISS, and in some cases 
arbitrary arrests. Among the hundreds of civilians arbitrarily detained following the 10 May 
rebel attacks on Omdurman were Khartoum-based Darfurian lawyers, journalists and political 
activists. Among them was Barood Sandal Rajab, a lawyer, a prominent member of the Popular 
Congress Party and also the Secretary-General of the Darfurian Lawyers Committee. He was 
arrested from his home on 12 May by NISS officers and continued to be detained without charge 
and without contact with the outside world at the time of finalising this report. Barood Sandal 
Rajab had previously been detained three times between 2003 and 2006 because of his political 
and human rights activities. Journalists who publicly expressed views critical of Government 
policy in Darfur were harassed and intimidated, and at least two journalists were arbitrarily 
arrested by the NISS in May 2008 and reportedly humiliated and ill-treated because of the views 
they had expressed in connection with the JEM attacks on Omdurman. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Humanitarian access 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Protection of humanitarian workers from harassment and attack 
</b></p>
<p>34. The number of security incidents affecting humanitarian workers and their assets has 
increased dramatically in 2008 in comparison to previous years. As of 27 July, 11 humanitarian 
staff members have been killed in 2008, compared to five during the first seven months of 2007. 
In the same period of 2008, 183 humanitarian vehicles have been hijacked, compared to 
85 during the first seven months of 2007. During these hijackings, 146 humanitarians were 
abducted so far in 2008 compared to 106 in the first seven months of 2007. Armed men 
assaulted 87 humanitarian premises so far in 2008, compared to 50 in the period January to 
July 2007. 
</p>
<p>35. Humanitarian access in Darfur remains severely constrained, with access rates to 
the 4.25 million conflict-affected populations just above 70% according to UN security 
standards. One of the solutions to offset the serious access constraints has been the increased use 
of local community workers and volunteers. The number of humanitarian workers in Darfur has 
increased over the past year from 12,300 to some 17,100, mainly due to this trend. However, a 
number of NGOs are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the implications of legal or 
other challenges by former employees, incentive workers or volunteers. The most serious 
challenge for many NGOs is that the concept of volunteers for non-profit organizations has not 
been recognized under Sudanese labour law and, as a result, NGO volunteers are treated as if</p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>they are full employees for &#8220;profit&#8221; organizations after they have completed three months of 
&#8220;employment&#8221;. Ongoing court-cases over pay for volunteers might force some NGOs with 
limited resources to decrease their operations. White Government aircraft were spotted in Darfur 
posing a security threat to UN and humanitarian operations (recommendation 2.1.3). 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Facilitating access to civilians, including those displaced 
</b></p>
<p>36. On 22 September 2007, the Government of the Sudan finalized the General Directory of 
Procedures (GDP) for NGOs operating in northern Sudan, based on the March 2007 Joint 
Communiqu&#233;, including special provisions for Darfur based on the Moratorium. The GDP, 
available in English and Arabic, outlines in detail all necessary requirements and may also be 
valid for southern Sudan if no other specifications are in place. Two joint committees, a High 
Level Committee and a Joint Tripartite Joint Committee involving Government, UN and NGOs, 
have been established to follow up on the implementation of the Joint Communiqu&#233;. In addition, 
OCHA trained Government officials and NGO personnel on the GDP, and installed a database at 
the Joint Procedures Centre (JPC). 
</p>
<p>37. On 22 January 2008, the Government of the Sudan extended the Darfur Moratorium 
until 31 January 2009. The Moratorium facilitates a series of fast track procedures to facilitate 
the humanitarian operations in Darfur. As the former Moratorium expired on 31 January 2008, 
HAC granted a one month grace period to allow NGOs to complete their paperwork. However, 
various forms of harassment as well as access denials by different parties to the conflict 
continued to constrain humanitarian operations in Darfur. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Accountability and justice 
</b>38. The Government did not provide any information to the Special Rapporteur on action 
taken to combat impunity (recommendation 3.1). According to information received there was 
no implementation of the recommendation. Where investigation committees were established, 
their findings were not made public. No legal action was taken against the perpetrators including 
those with command responsibility or compensation provided to the victims. 
</p>
<p>39. Legal immunities for armed state agents continued to be enshrined in law. The new Police 
Act touches on immunity of police personnel in its Article 45: &#8220;1) No criminal procedures shall 
be taken against any Policeman, who committed any act which is deemed to be an offence, 
during or because of executing his official duties and he may not be tried except by a permission 
issued by the Minister of Interior or whoever authorizes. 2) The State shall bear the payment of 
the compensation or the blood money (Diyya) for any police man in case he committed an act 
which is considered a crime during or because of his official duty. 3) Any Policeman who faces 
any legal procedures, which require placing him under legal custody, shall be confined to the 
police barracks, pending the decision on procedures; and the regulations , shall specify the 
placing him to confinement.&#8221; The Government confirmed that the Act gives police personnel 
procedural immunity which shall be lifted automatically at the request of the aggrieved persons. 
It also provides for accountability procedures in cases of transgressions (recommendation 3.2). 
</p>
<p>40. The Government of the Sudan informed the Special Rapporteur of its refusal to accept the 
competence of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate cases in Sudan. Sudan has 
not cooperated with the ICC (recommendation 3.3). </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>41. Some progress was made to review of national law pursuant to the interim national 
constitution and bill of rights, and harmonization of laws with Sudan&#8217;s obligations under 
international human rights law. The Armed Forces Act and Police Act were reformed, although 
the Armed Forces Act does not fully comply with international human rights principles. On 
7 June 2008 Parliament passed the Election Act 2008. The Act allocated 40% of seats for 
proportional representation to enable a better representation for small parties and regional 
groups. 60% of the seats designated for the geographical constituents. 25% of seats were 
allocated for women who may also compete for other seats. The Act also provides for 
establishment of the Electoral Commission. On 19 June 2008 the Council of Ministers approved 
the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and referred it to Parliament for 
ratification. Other bills have been prepared and presented to Parliament. However the National 
Security Act has not been reformed in accordance with the Interim National Constitution 
(recommendation 3.5). 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Monitoring of implementation of recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>42. Discussions are underway between UNAMID, UNMIS and the Government&#8217;s Advisory 
Council on Human Rights on the establishment of a National Human Rights Forum. An 
Independent National Human Rights Commission has not been established. Despite repeated 
requests, human rights monitors in Khartoum had no access to detention facilities and were 
unable to maintain regular dialogue with prosecutors or access investigation records 
(recommendation 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7). 
</p>
<p>43. No standing invitation extended to special procedures. The Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Sudan was invited by the Government to undertake two country 
visits to Sudan in March and July 2008. The Representative of the Secretary General on IDPs, 
the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Special Rapporteur on the right to Food 
have requested to visit the Sudan. Dates for the missions have not yet been agreed. In May 2008 
the Government extended an invitation to Special procedures of the African Commission for 
Human and Peoples Rights to visit Sudan in August 2008. The regional mechanisms accepted 
the offer however dates have not yet been agreed upon. Between July 2007 and July 2008, 
15 communications were sent from special procedures of the UN to the Sudan. The 
communications concerned a range of alleged human rights violations including adequate 
housing; arbitrary detention; freedom of expression; human rights defenders; torture; and 
summary executions. The communications concerned 289 individuals, 8 of which were women. 
The Government replied to one of the communications to inform that several detainees had been 
released and one person remained in detention (recommendation 4.4). 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>The Special Rapporteur concludes that effective implementation of recommendations 
by the Government of the Sudan has been slow. The Government needs to engage fully in 
an open and constructive dialogue on concerns and take concrete steps to improve the 
human rights situation. 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>As regards activities undertaken by the Government to implement recommendations 
the Special Rapporteur notes that in only a few areas were necessary steps taken fully or to 
a significant degree to have a tangible impact. In more cases activities were undertaken but </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p><b>little or no tangible impact has been reported or only initial steps were taken towards 
implementation. In regards to some of the recommendations no implementation was 
reported at all.</b> 
</p>
<p>46. <b>The information provided on the human rights situation from UNAMID, 
UN agencies, bodies and programmes with operational competence in Darfur and other 
relevant sources reflects an extremely critical situation which requires action. The 
information available does not confirm the Government&#8217;s assessment of the impact on the 
ground of activities undertaken so far. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>In particular, the Special Rapporteur assesses the status of implementation of the 
recommendations contained in the report (A/HRC/5/6, annex) as follows (for details see the 
appendix to this report):</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Full implementation (i.e. all recommended activities were carried out and, as a 
result, the situation on the ground has been reported to have improved 
accordingly): Recommendations 1.2.1, 1.2.6 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Significant activities were undertaken and tangible impact has been reported from 
the ground: Recommendations 4.6 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Activities were undertaken, but little or no tangible impact has been reported from 
the ground: Recommendations 1.1.1, 1.1.4, 1.1.5, 1.2.2, 1.2.4, 1.2.5, 1.2.7, 1.3.1, 
1.3.2, 2.1.1, 2.1.4, 3.4 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Initial steps towards implementation were undertaken: Recommendations, 1.2.8, 
1.2.9, 1.3.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1., 2.2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.7 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>No implementation at all: Recommendations 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.2.3, 1.2.9., 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 
1.4.3, 1.4.4, 1.4.5, 1.5.1, 1.6.1, 1.6.2, 2.1.3, 2.2.3, 3.3, 4.5, and 4.8 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>The Special Rapporteur, while acknowledging the activities undertaken by the 
Government of the Sudan is concerned that reports received from the ground clearly 
indicate that with very few exceptions these efforts still have not yet lead to an 
improvement of the situation of human rights in Darfur.</b> 
</p>
<p>49. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that full implementation of certain 
recommendations, may be complex and tangible impact could take time, especially where 
recommended activities were undertaken only recently. The 12 month period for 
implementation of all recommendations, short and medium-term ended on 20 June 2008. 
The Special Rapporteur notes that in certain specific instances the feasibility of full 
implementation could have been affected by the absence of sufficient resources and 
technical assistance. However several recommendations which were prioritized as 
short-term and could have been implemented within a short term time frame, as they did 
not require lengthy administrative processes or additional resources, have not yet been 
implemented. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the lack of resources cannot justify 
any acts of violence against the civilian population or the lack of action to prevent such 
acts.</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>50. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls the Council&#8217;s consensus on the serious situation of 
human rights in Darfur and the need to focus on implementation of existing 
recommendations to enhance the human rights situation.</b> 
</p>
<p>51. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Council continue the process of 
reviewing the implementation of recommendations until such time as there is full 
implementation, or at least significant activities, and tangible impact has been reported 
from the ground. In recognition of the fact that the timeframe for implementation of the 
recommendations elapsed on 20 June 2008 and the Government of the Sudan still needs to 
effectively implement the majority of recommendations requested by the Human Rights 
Council, the Council could ask the Government why it has been unable to implement the 
recommendations and also consider what further action is required to concretely protect 
the human rights of people in the Darfur region of the Sudan. </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendation 1.1.1  </b><i>Short-term<b></b></i><b> 
</b></p>
<p>Issue and enforce clear orders to the armed forces and any militias under Government&#8217;s 
control that it is prohibited to make civilians or civilian objects (including cultivated land and 
livestock) the target of attacks or to launch indiscriminate attacks (including burning of 
villages and aerial bombardments); that such attacks can amount to war crimes and crimes 
against humanity, that suspects, including bearers of command responsibility, will be 
investigated and brought to justice, and that any immunities would be waived. 
<i>Indicators: Orders issued and widely disseminated. Number of such attacks reported that 
</i></p>
<p><i>are attributable to Government forces or any allied militia.</i> 
</p>
<p><b>Response of the Government of the Sudan on recommendation 1.1.1 
</b></p>
<p>Written information submitted to the Special Rapporteur on 10 July 2008  
</p>
<p> On 2 July 2008 the ACHR, National Committee for the International Humanitarian Law, in 
collaboration with UNAMID Human Rights convened a workshop in El Fasher. The workshop 
targeted police officers, armed forces, prosecutors and judges. It focused on international 
humanitarian law principles, protection of civilians during conflict and safeguards pertaining to 
arrest and detention.  
</p>
<p><b>Information received from other sources on recommendation 1.1.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Land and air attacks by Government forces against civilians 
</b> Between January and July 2008, the Government of Sudan conducted aerial bombardment 
throughout Darfur. Many of the air strikes impacted in civilian populated areas. Information 
received indicates that the air strikes resulted in the displacement of thousands of people and the 
deaths of hundreds of civilians and widespread destruction of property and livestock. In the 
Northern corridor of West Darfur, the Government embarked on a major military campaign 
using armed militias and Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) ground troops, supported by SAF air assets 
to regain control of areas that were seized by the armed group, Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM). In its campaign, the Government failed to discriminate between civilians and armed 
groups combatants in violation of international humanitarian law. Villages in the area were also 
subjected to repeated attacks and looting and the burning of their homes by armed militia aligned 
with the Government. </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p> In April and May 2008, the Government shifted focus to North Darfur. Ten civilian 
villages including cultivated land were subjected to aerial bombardments in violation of the 
principle of distinction. UN sources indicate that there were twenty one separate incidents of 
aerial bombardment in the first three weeks of July 2008. The air strikes were carried out by the 
Government of Sudan (GoS) with Antonov aircrafts and MIG fighter jets. Reportedly, the strikes 
impacted in the vicinity of civilian communities and allegedly resulted in the deaths of 
12 persons, including five women and two children. The UN received further reports that civilian 
objects, in particular cultivated lands and livestock, were also destroyed. 
Northern Corridor, West Darfur 
</p>
<p> On 8 February 2008, the towns of Sirba, Silea and Abu Suruj were attacked by government 
allied militia and Sudanese army ground forces supported by helicopters and Antonov planes. 
The attacks resulted in the deaths of at least 100 people including women, children and the 
elderly, the displacement of at least 30,000 people and widespread destruction and looting of 
civilian property. They also left the three towns badly damaged by fire. </p>
<p> (i) Saraf Jidad, 7, 12, 24 January 2008 
</p>
<p> On 7, 12, 24 January, Saraf Jidad (50 km northwest of El Geneina) was repeatedly attacked 
by armed militias resulting in the death of 26 civilians including three women. In the 12 and 
24 January attacks, the militias were supported by the Government aerial bombardments. Four 
people were reportedly killed in the 12 January attack while five others including three men and 
one woman were injured. The attackers also looted animals and burned down shops and huts. 
Due to security restrictions on movement imposed by the Government in the northern corridor of 
West Darfur, many of the injured were unable to access medical treatment in El Geneina 
hospital. Government sources reported the incident as a clash between nomads and members of 
the JEM in Saraf Jidad over livestock theft. However, community leaders claimed that JEM 
forces were not present in the village during the attack. 
</p>
<p> (ii) Abu Suruj, 8 February 2008 
 On 8 February, Abu Suruj town was attacked by militiamen backed by SAF forces in a 
convoy of about 100 vehicles. According to witnesses, the attackers shot indiscriminately at 
civilians forcing most of the inhabitants to flee to the nearby mountains. The ground forces were 
supported by two helicopter gun ships and two Antonov planes which dropped bombs on the 
outskirts of the town around the villages of Melmelle and Shabab Ardo. Shops and houses were 
looted and many others were burned down. At least 30 civilians were killed including one 
woman; one mentally disabled man who was found shot in the vicinity of his home, ten elderly 
people, among them a blind 75-year-old woman who burned alive inside her house, and three 
minors. Most of the inhabitants reportedly fled to neighbouring Chad and to the Jebel Moon area. </p>
<p> (iii) Sirba, 8 February 2008 
</p>
<p> The town of Sirba, 50 km north of El Geneina was attacked on the morning of 8 February 
by militiamen and later Sudanese army ground forces. The attack was marked by indiscriminate 
shooting, looting and widespread destruction of houses and personal property. Prior to the attack, 
two military helicopters and one white Antonov plane were seen hovering over the area. At least </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>forty-five civilians including ten women and at least three elderly persons were reportedly killed. 
Eyewitnesses and victims reported that at least ten girls and women, between the ages of 9 and 
18 years, were raped. Five documented incidents out of six occurred on the first day of the 
attack. One occurred on 9 February. 
</p>
<p> (iv) Silea, 8 February 2008 
</p>
<p> The attack on Silea followed the same pattern as those on Sirba and Abu Suruj. It was led 
by the militia and supported by SAF ground forces and it began on the evening of 8 February 
and continued until the next day. Various eyewitness accounts reported that the attackers on the 
ground were backed by helicopter gun ships and Government Antonov planes which dropped 
several bombs in different locations of the town. The attack was also marked by indiscriminate 
shootings, wanton destruction of property and widespread looting. Four IDP women and five 
children were killed during the attack. There were also reports that Government Antonov planes 
bombed several locations in the eastern part of Jebel Moon believed to be the SLA (SLA/AW) 
controlled areas. Several civilians were killed as result of the aerial bombardment. 
</p>
<p> (v) Jebel Moun, 18, 19, 22 February 2008 
</p>
<p> On 18, 19 and 22 February, SAF launched attacks on several villages in the Jebel Moun 
area (approximately 80 km northeast of Geneina), targeting JEM and SLA/AW strongholds. The 
SAF carried out extensive aerial attacks in the area using helicopter gun ships, Antonov planes 
and MIG fighters. The attacks began on the morning of 18 February when bombs were dropped 
near the Aro Sharow IDP camp, near Jebel Moun. The bombardments continued the next day 
and were followed by ground attacks by Government troops in other parts of the area. There 
were reports of clashes between the SAF and JEM/SLA forces in different locations which 
forced the SAF to subsequently retreat to Silea. On 22 February, the SAF resumed its aerial 
offensive with continuous bombing of selected targets in the area from morning until sunset. 
Sudanese army ground troops along with allied militia groups were also reported to have 
attacked the village of Guzminu, 10 km north of Silea. Five villages are reported to have been 
partially destroyed by fire, at least 20 civilians were killed and a further reported 1000 were 
displaced. 
</p>
<p> (vi) Fanga, (North Darfur), 1 February 2008 
</p>
<p> An eyewitness reported that on 1 February, at approximately 1700 hrs, a Government 
Antonov bombed Um Hos Mountain, close to Faki village, in Fanga area. The witness described 
the Um Hos area as mountainous, with many small farms which were destroyed during the 
attacks. According to other civilians interviewed by human rights monitors, the Government 
Antonov plane dropped six bombs at a time. After the bombings on Um Hos Mountain, six 
further bombs were reportedly dropped on Jabal Taib (approximately 20 km Southwest of 
Tawila). 
</p>
<p> (vii) Madu and Mou, (North Darfur), 29 March 2008 
</p>
<p> On 29 March, Government antonov bombarded Medo village, North East of El Fasher 
killing one child and injuring four others. The village water well was destroyed in the attack. </p>

<p> (viii) Buram, (South Darfur), 4, 5, 8 April 2008 
</p>
<p> On 4 and 5 April, two Salamat villages, Kibawo, and Umkaradees, south west of Buram 
were attacked by government police officers from Buram, using 4 land cruisers vehicles 
mounted with heavy machine guns, killing six Salamat civilians and injuring numerous others. 
According to witness, on 8 April, Kibaw, a Salamat village near Tulu, Buram, was attacked by 
some 200 men from Habbania, riding pickup trucks mounted with machine guns. Reportedly, 
twenty-nine Habbania militia men were killed and two Habbania leaders, including the 
Commissioner of Buram were taken as hostages. The Commissioner was on an official mission 
to Tulus, he was released on the same day, after Salamat leaders informed him about the attack, 
and presented wounded Salamat civilians to him.

<p> On 6 April, soldiers from the Sudanese Border Guards Unit attacked El Fasher market. The 
attack resulted in the death of a 17 year old boy. The soldiers were reportedly unhappy about the 
delay in the payment of their salaries. The incident began when the soldiers left their 
headquarters and headed towards the market area shooting indiscriminately at civilians. They 
besieged the market and looted the property of shop owners. According to eyewitnesses, some 
Government police officers stationed at the market fled upon seeing the soldiers while others 
stood by and watched. In the aftermath of the attack, the Wali of North Darfur acknowledged 
that the police were late in arriving at the scene and were therefore not able to prevent the attacks 
on civilians. The soldiers reportedly continued their rioting the next day and attempted to break 
into a local bank.

<p> (x) Amkhabesha, Amhawaim and Amhabila, (South Darfur), 9 April 2008 
</p>
<p> On 9 April, Amkhabesha village was attacked by armed men wearing military uniforms. 
The attackers reportedly shot indiscriminately, killing one 28 year old Dajo tribesman. The 
attackers also looted cattle and household goods before setting the village on fire. Amhabila 
village, located 8 km South of Amhawaim and Amkhabesha village, was attacked on the same 
day and time as the two other villages. The IDPs interviewed by human rights monitors reported 
hearing gunshots and loud screaming and then observed a group of armed men wearing military 
uniforms enter the village on horses and camels. Reportedly, the attackers also opened fire 
indiscriminately within the village. Although there were no casualties, the IDPs reported 
widespread looting and part of the village was reportedly burnt down.

government soldiers were killed. 
</p>
<p> (xiii) Helif, (North Darfur), 29 April 2008 
 On 29 April, Government Antonov planes bombarded Helif village, North Darfur, killing a 
50 year old Medob woman and her 2 month old grandchild, and injuring an eight month old 
baby. Witnesses reported that six of the bombs fell inside the village, one of which did not 
detonate. 
</p>
<p> (xiv) Um Sidir, (North Darfur), 1 May 2008 
 On 1 May, three civilians were killed and sixteen injured after the Government launched 
an air strike 20-30 meters from the water point in Um Sidir village, North Darfur. The injured 
were evacuated to El Fasher by UNAMID. Two men who escorted the injured were arrested by 
Government at the El Fasher airport, but were released 18 days later. The two men, who paused 
as civilians as they volunteered to escort their relatives turned out to be associated with 
SLA/MM. 
</p>
<p> (xv) Ein Bisharo and Hatan villages, (North Darfur), 4 May 2008 
 On 4 May a Government antonov plane attacked Ein Bisharo village, killing three children, 
and seriously injuring a fourth. The deceased were two brothers aged eight and twelve, and their 
infant sister, aged two. The bombs, which were four, reportedly detonated near the hut with the 
children. A SAF commander residing in the village reported that an &#8220;Antonov&#8221;, flying at a low 
altitude approached from the North, passed the village, returned from the South and then 
dropped the bombs on the village. The commander further stated that the rationale for the 
bombing is unknown, particularly since the area is under Government control. 
</p>
<p> (xvi) Shegeg Karo, (North Darfur), 4 May 2008 
 On 4 May, Government aerial bombardment of Shegeg Karo resulted in the death of 
12 people, including six children, and injured a further thirty-one. During a verification trip to 
the area on 9 May, UN observed four piles of shrapnel and bomb craters approximately 
20-30 meters away from one another, with two of close proximity to a burnt area, which had 
previously been the village&#8217;s market place. Representatives from both UNDSS confirmed three 
of the four craters resulted from three small bombs, but could not authenticate one larger crater.

</p>
<p> (xviii)  Sanya Affendu, 10 April 2008 
</p>
<p> On 10 April, Sanya Affendu, which is predominantly Birgit, was attacked by SLA/MM, 
after cattle belonging to civilians in Ladob were looted, and after SLA/FW attacked Zaghawa 
people in the Um Safati area. Many Zaghawa civilians who had been displaced during the 
attacks on Um Safati joined the SLA/MM in the attacks against Birgit villages. Other Zaghawa 
civilians from Seleah also took part in the attacks. SLA/MM confirmed carrying out the attacks 
from Ladob with further support from their base in Muhajeria. During the attack, the attackers 
fired randomly as they entered the area and then burnt down the village. SLA/FW elements were 
present in Sanya Affendu during the attacks and returned fire, Nine people were killed during 
these attacks. After the attacks, the displacement of families from the conflict area to Kalma and 
Alsalam ID camps continued. In total, 25,000 civilians were displaced as a result of these 
attacks. 
</p>
<p> (xix) Kafod, (North Darfur), 13 May 2008 
</p>
<p> On 13 May, clashes between SLA/MM and SLA/FW in Kafod, north Darfur resulted in the 
death of twelve people, and the injured of eight SLA/MM combatants, the destruction of homes 
and property and the injury of seven people and the displacement of hundreds of others. On 
2 June, SLA/FW and Government commanders informed that civilians had begun returned to 
Kafod following the deployment of SAF soldiers to the area on 30 May. 
</p>
<p> (xx) Kafod, (North Darfur), 21 May 2008 
</p>
<p> On 21 May SLA/MM carried out an attack against three villages in the Kafod area, 
Mario Katol, Mario Tunjur and Mario Karol, where 13 civilians were killed. Most of the 
civilians reportedly killed were burnt alive in their houses, seven civilians were injured and the 
three villages were burnt to the ground. Reportedly relatives of SLA/FW live in these three 
villages. The attack was reportedly in retaliation for the attacks which occurred on 19 May, and 
resulted in the death of five SLA/MM soldiers. The attacks may also be due to the resistance of 
Kafod and Abusakkin inhabitants to pay the high taxes the SLA/MM is imposing on water 
points, markets, and farms in the area.

<p><b>(c) Attacks by armed militias 
</b> (i) Senabo, (South Darfur), 8 December 2007 
</p>
<p> On 8, 9, 10 December, Senabo, 30 km north of Khorshamam village were subjected to 
repeated attacks in which nineteen civilians were killed and six injured. The attackers who were 
armed, driving three land cruiser vehicles, some dressed in civilian clothes and others in green 
khaki military uniforms entered the village at approximately 11 am from the Southern side, and 
began shooting randomly. According to the victims interviewed, the perpetrators were Arabs 
from Fallata tribe. The village was looted, and destroyed including cultivated land. </p>

</p>
<p> On 11 January, armed militias attacked Boulay village, North of Rockero. According to 
witnesses, who arrived in Zamzam IDP camp, North Darfur, the attack took place on Friday 
11 January. Community leaders and an INGO in Zamzam camp reported that 22 families from 
Boulay had settled in Zamzam since the 11 January attack. According to the IDPs, Marri and 
Korakule, two villages near Rockero were also attacked. 
</p>
<p> (iii) Tanjeki, (West Darfur), 16 January 2008 
 On 16 January, Tanjeki (north east of El-Geneina) was attacked by a group of 20 suspected 
armed militiamen. The armed men raided the village, looted property and harassed people. A 
SAF force subsequently intervened to protect the population but some damage was already done. 
Although the intervention of SAF is a positive step, it should also be noted that in mid 
December 2007, the SAF withdrew from Tanjeki following an attack by a group of 200 armed 
militia, leaving the civilian population behind. 
</p>
<p> (iv) Adikong, (West Darfur), 2 February 2008 
</p>
<p> On 2 February, armed militia attacked Adikong, 23 km west of Geneina, displacing a large 
number of the residents to El Geneina. A number of victims interviewed reported that on 
2 February, hundreds of armed Arab men on horses and camels wearing green camouflage 
uniforms entered Adikong village and began looting and destroying property. More than 
50 houses and shops were either looted or destroyed.  
</p>
<p> (v) Bir Dagig, (West Darfur), 7 and 9 February 2008 
</p>
<p> On 7 and 9 February, Bir Dagig was subjected to two separate attacks by armed men 
dressed in dark green uniforms. The attackers harassed, beat the residents and looted the town. 
The residents informed that although the SAF was present in the area during both attacks, they 
took no action to prevent the looting. 
</p>
<p> (vi) Kabkabiya, (North Darfur), 7 April 2008 
</p>
<p> On 7 April, soldiers from the Sudanese Border guards Unit attacked Kabkabiya market. 
The attackers looted several shops and killed two civilians, including a child, and wounded three 
others. The soldiers were reportedly protesting delay in the payment of their salaries. On 
27 April, the UN conducted a field trip to Kabkabiya but was unable to interview victims of the 
attack due to the large presence of armed militia elements inside the town&#8217;s market. 
</p>
<p> (vii) Amkhabesha, (South Darfur), 9 April 2008 
</p>
<p> On 9 April, Amkhabesha village, 20 km North of Um Safati, was attacked. According to 
witnesses, approximately 300 armed men dressed in khaki military uniforms, others in civilian 
clothes, entered the village via land cruisers, horses, donkeys and camels and on foot and</p>

<p>launched a sudden attack on the village. The attackers entered the village began shooting 
randomly killing anybody in sight and burning the villages. As a result, twelve civilians were 
killed, including an elderly woman who was burnt alive in her house. Four other people were 
injured and three men were also abducted and their whereabouts are still unknown. The attackers 
faced no resistance from the village and only found unarmed civilians in the village. 
</p>
<p> (viii)   Wadi Kobore, West Darfur, 16 June 2008 
</p>
<p> On 16 June, two Massalit IDP men from Masteri, were abducted by seven armed men 
described by witnesses as Arab militia from Kobore, which is an area renown for its presence of 
militia. The abduction was reported to the police. On 20 June, the victims&#8217; bodies were found in 
a dry well near Wadi Kobore, West Darfur. On 21 June, the bodies were examined by a medical 
practitioner. The Masteri police commander stated that the men had been severely beaten, and 
postulated that both men died as a result of a broken neck. The Masteri police opened a case file, 
initially as an abduction case and later as a murder case. It appears, however, that police did not 
proceed with further investigation on the grounds that there were no witnesses to the deaths and 
the case involved &#8220;unknown perpetrators&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> (ix) Jelenga (West Darfur), 11 July 2008 
</p>
<p> Sudanese governmental officials confirmed that on 11 July 2008 at least eleven civilians 
were killed and two injured after being attacked by men armed men described as Arab militia. 
The incident took place in Jelenga village, West Darfur approximately three and a half 
kilometers west of Masteri. Fifty militia reportedly attacked and shot at a group of men 
conducting farm work in Jelenga village. The attack follows tension between the militia and the 
alleged supporters of SLA/Khamis Abdallah in Masteri which had escalated in mid June. The 
presence of approximately 100 Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) has not mitigated the tension as 
SAF are stationed outside of the town and thus far have failed to protect the civilians in the area. 
This security vacuum increased following the departure of the Movement of the Popular Forces 
for Rights and Democracy (MPFRD), a signatory group with de facto responsibility for security 
of the area. At the time of the attack, MPFRD had already left to Nyala, South Darfur for 
regularization training as part of their integration into the government security apparatus.

<p><b>Assessment of implementation of recommendation 1.1.1 
</b></p>
<p>Implementation began in October 2007 when the Government indicated that it had issued and 
circulated rules to enforce discipline in the Sudanese Armed Forces. The information received

<p><b>Response of the Government of the Sudan on recommendation 1.1.3 
</b></p>
<p>Written information submitted to the Special Rapporteur on 10 July 2008 
</p>
<p> In its report, the Government stated that 431,000 IDPs have voluntarily returned to their 
original villages during the course of 2008, of which 132,222 have in Southern Darfur such as 
Jumiza arbaa, Kassar Buram, Hlloog and Marla. In Northern Darfur there are 135,242 voluntary 
returns such as Abu Zerraga, Fatabarnu, Kalkel and Shagra. In Western Darfur there are 
155,066 returns such as Arkum, Gokar, Artala and Bendas. 
</p>
<p> According to information received there is coordination with UNAMID forces through 
meetings of the joint security committee conducted on a regular basis. UNAMID has requested 
the Government to provide necessary police patrols to escort convoys of aid from Khartoum to 
El Obeid to Darfur. The police and armed forces have been patrolling roads to escort convoys in 
the three states of Darfur, to ensure the flow of petrol and relief materials. 
</p>
<p><b>Information received from other sources on recommendation 1.1.3 
</b></p>
<p> As of July 2008, there were 4.27 million people affected people in need of assistance, of 
which, 2.5 million are internally displaced. An additional 250,000 Darfurians have sought refuge 
in Chad. Displacement is still ongoing, 150,000 people were displaced in the first four months of 
2008. The affected population throughout Darfur is vulnerable to risks associated with 
displacement, lack of basic services and protection. January - March 2008 were characterized by 
widespread Government - rebel armed confrontations in large parts of Darfur. Government aerial 
bombings in the northern corridor of West Darfur, west and east Jebel Marra, and the Tabit and 
Malha areas of North Darfur (detailed in other sections) resulted in the temporary suspensions of 
humanitarian activities in these areas. For the first 40 days of 2008, Government authorities 
denied all humanitarian access to the conflict-affected populations in the northern corridor of 
West Darfur, leaving tens of thousands people without humanitarian assistance and protection.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p> UN agencies, bodies and programmes operational in Darfur documented several attacks by 
SLA/MM, militia groups and other armed elements, on IDP camps. The proliferation of 
weapons, the presence of armed elements residing or in some cases responsible for security 
inside the camps along with the increased divisions along tribal affiliations added to the 
insecurity felt by IDPs in Darfur. One of the key human rights concerns is the presence of armed 
men inside and on the periphery of IDP camps. The UN documented consistent and repeated 
incidents of sexual and physical assaults, harassment, intimidation, theft and other acts of 
violence and threats against IDPs particularly female IDPs by armed militias, often dressed in 
military uniform from Arab nomadic groups.

their residence after attending a meeting with some members of Sudan Peoples Liberation 
Movement (SPLM) inside the camp, when they were intercepted by unknown armed men. The 
men opened fire on the Omdas, killing one instantly, and seriously injuring a second Omda. 
 There were also armed confrontations between elements of SLA/MM and Government 
forces which impacted negatively on IDPs in South Darfur. On 30 April, two IDPs were killed 
and several others wounded during an exchange of heavy shooting and mortar fire between 
Government (Birgit) and SLA/MM in Shearia. The incident was reportedly caused by an attempt 
by Government elements to recover 35 goats allegedly stolen by IDPs from Shearia IDP camp, 
which is under the control of SLA/MM. Mortar bombs fired by the warring factions landed 
within 200 meters from the fence surrounding UNAMID camp. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Attacks on IDPs 
 </b>IDPs continued to be vulnerable and exposed to violence as a result of deliberate attacks by 
Government forces and rebel groups. In some cases, IDPs found themselves caught in the middle 
of fighting between warring factions. Violations included direct attacks on IDP camps, blockade 
of camps perceived to be hostile to the government, intimidation and physical assaults. In 
addition, several cases of arbitrary detention and ill treatment of IDPs by Government security 
forces were documented over the reporting period. (Recounted in Recommendations 1.4.1 &amp; 
1.4.2) 
</p>
<p> On 30 April, armed Government soldiers surrounded Khamsa Dayegeg IDP camp, 
Zalingei. In the afternoon of the same day, a male IDP from the camp aged 40 years was brought 
to UNAMID premises in Zalingei with a gunshot wound to his leg and taken to the local hospital 
where he received medical treatment. Approximately 200 IDPs had gathered under a tree inside 
the camp. Witnesses reported that NISS forces approached the group, and attempted to separate 
the children from the adults. When the crowd resisted, the soldiers shot towards the crowd. 
Another man reportedly suffered minor injuries. IDPs alleged that 91 bullets were collected from 
the area. The soldiers withdrew from the IDP camp on 4 May. 
</p>
<p> In El Geneina, more than 100 armed members of the Central Reserve Police (CRP) raided 
several homes in Riyadh camp on 28 April 2008. The raid was reportedly conducted following 
allegations that three CRP members had sold guns belonging to the CRP to persons in Riyadh 
camp. During the raid, the police ransacked several homes and assaulted a number of IDPs; 
nine people were reportedly injured. Community leaders sought the intervention of the police in 
the camp but the police refused to intervene. 
</p>
<p> In North Darfur, more than 20,000 people from Tawila town and the nearby Rwanda IDP 
camp were forced to flee to neighbouring villages following an attack on 12 May by policemen 
from CRP. Elements from the CRP attacked the camp after one CRP soldier was found shot dead 
in the area. CRP surrounded the IDP camp, opened fire indiscriminately at civilians, injuring 
several people, looted and burnt huts, and destroyed the market. The fighting resulted in thirteen 
civilian casualties including a fifteen year old boy and the destruction of three homes. Most of 
the victims were inside the camp market undertaking market activities at the time of the attack. </p>

</p>
<p> There had been previous exchange of gunfire between Government forces and the 
SLA/MM inside Rwanda IDP camp, Tawila, in two separate confrontations on 21 and 
23 February. According to the SLA/MM commander in Tawila, the February incident began 
when a SLA/MM soldier prevented a drunken CRP soldier from assaulting a female IDP. On 
23 February, at least 11 IDPs were injured when members of the CRP and SLA/MM soldiers 
opened fire on each other following a dispute outside the UNAMID compound, while their 
respective commanders were attempting to negotiate a settlement to the dispute with the 
mediation of the UNAMID Sector Commander. Heavy weapons such as RPGs and tracers were 
used, in addition to AK 47s. In both incidents, the SLA/MM either deliberately launched attacks 
or responded to attacks from within the IDP camps, thus putting the lives of civilians at risk. 
</p>
<p> On 25 March 2008, two drunken SAF soldiers attacked two people in two separate 
incidents in Silea. In the first incident, a 60 year IDP woman came home and found two soldiers 
in her room. The soldiers held her by the neck and severely beat her with a sword. The soldiers 
also broke into the house of the woman&#8217;s neighbour, an 80 year old man. The man sustained 
severe injuries after being subjected to severe beatings on the back and wrist with a sword by the 
assailants. The accused soldier has been imprisoned for the past year by a military tribunal and as 
of July 2008, is in a civilian Prison in West Darfur. 
</p>
<p> On 28 January, a male IDP was seriously beaten and six others were robbed of their 
possessions by four armed men in the vicinity of Kalma camp, South Darfur. The men were 
returning to the camp after collecting firewood when they were approached by four armed men 
on camels wearing green uniforms. The armed men asked them to surrender their firewood. All 
the members of the group did as they were told except for the victim who refused to comply with 
the demands of the armed men. He was separated from the group and beaten with the butt of a 
gun until he fell down unconscious. The assailants took away all the possessions of the victims 
and threatened to kill them if they came to the area again. None of the victims reported the 
incident to the police. 
</p>
<p> On 12 May in Foro Baranga clashes between CRP and SAF members, which included four 
hours of shooting, injured a total 11 people, including three civilians, among them two minors 
aged between five and nine years. The regular police reportedly did not take any immediate 
action to stop the incident or to arrest the perpetrators. Following the incident, the SAF 
commander was transferred, and the locality police commander reported that a total of 35 cases 
have been opened, including one case for murder and another for intentional injuries. 
 On 23 May, a police officer entered the home of an IDP family in Mukjar IDP camp and 
aimed his gun at a 28-year-old-man while he was asleep. The intruder was taken to the police 
post in Mukjar and a complaint filed. The police officer has reportedly been transferred to 
Mukjar and the Deputy Chief of Police in Mukjar stated that he was not aware of the incident. 
 On 27 May, five IDP men from Hassa Hissa IDP camp, Zalingei, were attacked by two 
armed suspected militiamen wearing green camouflaged uniforms, while collecting firewood 
15 km west of Zalingei. The next day, the victims, and UNAMID CivPol went to the crime scene 
and traced the donkey&#8217;s footprints to Souk Al Khamis market in Zalingei. The victims 
recognised their donkeys in the market but did not report the incident to the police because they 
did not think the police would take any action. </p>

<p> On 7 June evening, a SAF soldier killed a male IDP inside the in Kass Kabir IDP Camp, 
Kass camp. Reportedly IDPs from the camp had earlier prevented the soldier from robbing a 
shop inside the camp. The soldier was reportedly arrested, charged and detained. 
</p>
<p> On 13 June a 14-year-old IDP boy was killed by seven suspected armed militiamen while 
collecting firewood with six other children outside Bilel IDP Camp, South Darfur. Eyewitnesses 
in Bilel informed that the same armed attackers came to the camp following the incident and 
looted cattle from the camp. The men fired their guns repeatedly for approximately 30 minutes 
within the vicinity of the police station inside the camp, but reportedly, the police did not 
intervene. 
</p>
<p> On 14 June members of the SLA/Unity faction reportedly beat three community leaders 
and opened fire upon civilians in Kheirban village, North Darfur, after the village refused to 
continue paying &#8220;protection&#8221; money to SLA/Unity. Three of the villagers sustained gunshot 
wounds. 
</p>
<p> On 1 July, a 20 year old man and two youths ages 17 and 15 were beaten and robbed by 
three men described as &#8220;armed Arab militia wearing uniforms&#8221;. The victims were all IDPs from 
Khamsa Dagaig IDP camp. The incident was not reported to the police in Zalingei. 
</p>
<p> On 8 July 2008, three armed men believed to be Border Guards opened fire on three 
civilians while attempting to rob them, killing a 25 year old Berti man and injuring two men. The 
perpetrators were seen entering a house where Border Guard soldiers reside. Although the case 
was filed at the Awsat police station on 8 July, and police have been informed about the location 
of the suspects, reports indicate that no arrests have been made. 
</p>
<p> On 9 July a group of armed men described as Arabs looted goods from Dorti IDP camp 
and on 11 July, two land-cruisers carrying armed men wearing military uniforms attacked the 
food storage of an INGO at Ardamata IDP camp. 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Tribal clashes 
</b> (i) Katila, (South Darfur) November-December 2007 
</p>
<p> From 23 November to 10 December, tribal fighting between the Fallata and Gimir in 
Katila area, South Darfur led to the deaths of nine civilians and the displacement of over 
3000 civilians into Alsalam IDP Camp, Nyala. The fighting affected a number of Gimir villages 
including Ardeba Bitadud, 20 km south east of Katila and Senabo. The villagers have since 
opened a case with the Government police in Katila. The police informed that the perpetrators of 
the attacks were not arrested, because the parties agreed to amicably settle their differences. 
According to the IDPs, the attacks began after the Gimirs handed over to the Government police 
in Katila three men from Fallata tribe, whom they accused of stealing cattle in September. 
</p>
<p> (ii) El Sunta and Mangoya (South Darfur), 27 February 2008 
</p>
<p> On 27 February, Reziegat and Salamat tribesmen attacked and looted El Sunta, a Habbania 
town, 130 km south east of Nyala killing at least sixty civilians. The attackers destroyed El Sunta 
police station diminishing the capability of the local police to defend the residents. The attackers 
also kidnapped two women and one girl. UN officers observed that El Sunta was completely </p>

</p>
<p>burned down, with several unexploded ordnances strewn around the town. The local 
Government police informed that it was the military&#8217;s responsibility to prevent tribal clashes and 
not the police and that moreover, they did not receive any Government reinforcements until two 
days after the attack. 
</p>
<p> (iii) Hilat Daleel, (South Darfur), 25 March 2008 
</p>
<p> On 25 March, a reported dispute over cattle theft triggered intense fighting between Abbala 
and Tarjum tribesmen. The fighting continued for three days resulting in injuries to three Abbala 
tribesmen. On 28 March, a large number of Reziegat tribesmen, some of whom were reported to 
be wearing Border Intelligence uniforms attacked the Tarjum village of Hilat Daleel, killing two 
men and injuring eight others. Most of the victims were internally displaced people who recently 
heeded the Government&#8217;s appeal to IDPs to return to their places of origin. 
</p>
<p> (iv) Um Safati, (South Darfur), 9 April 2008 
</p>
<p> On 9 April, armed elements belonging to the SLA/FW attacked several villages in the 
Um Safati area. The attackers reportedly accused the villagers of stealing their animals. Um Safti 
is a Government controlled area but residents reported that the Government police and military 
took no action to intervene to protect civilians or their property. The attacks left about 
twenty two dead and three civilians were confirmed abducted. It also led to the displacement of 
25,000 people from mainly the Dajo, Fur, Zaghawa, Massalit, Bergo tribes. A subsequent gun 
battle between SLA/MM elements and the attackers resulted in the killing of one cattle owner. 
</p>
<p> (v) Hilelat, (West Darfur), 21 January 2008 
</p>
<p> On 21 January 2008, armed men under the leadership of Ibrahim Abakar Hashim<b>5</b> 
reportedly with the support of JEM attacked Hilelat village, destroying the town&#8217;s market. 
During the attack, one civilian was killed and three others were abducted. 
</p>
<p> (vi) Kulbus, (West Darfur), 13 March 2008 
</p>
<p> On 13 March 2008 Ibrahim Abaker Hashim&#8217;s group attacked a commercial bus escorted by 
police. Unconfirmed reports indicated that about 10 police officers were killed and five others 
abducted. Moreover a number of civilians, including a 20-year-old woman and her two-year-old 
daughter, were also injured during the exchange of fire between the attackers and the police. The 
woman and her daughter were subsequently abducted by the attackers along with six other 
civilians, including the driver of the vehicle and a sheikh from Kulbus, both injured during the 
attack. Three of the abductees including the mother and daughter have been released; the 
whereabouts of the remaining abductees is unknown. According to NISS in El Geneina, the 
abductees are being held in Jebel Moon.

<p> (vii) Ed-Alfursan and Wadi Gandai, (South Darfur) 26-28 June 2008 
</p>
<p> Fighting on 26-28 June between the Bani-Halba and Tarjam tribes led to the death of over 
100 people and displacement of an unconfirmed number of families. Sources report that Wadi 
Gandi, Umhimada, Umdofof, Karo-Karo and Dondora villages were burnt down during clashes 
on 28 June. To control the conflict, the Government of South Darfur established a mediation 
team led by the Nomads Commissioner. He was, however, killed on 29 June, at approximately 
4 km from Karo-Karo village, a Tarjam populated area where the two tribes were still fighting. It 
is still not clear who was responsible for his killing. Following the killing, on 30 June, 
approximately 120 Central Reserve Police (CRP) were deployed to the area to mitigate further 
conflict. While the CRP was trying to disperse the two conflicting parties, clashes ensued 
between the CRP and Bani Halba tribesmen. In an effort to restore order, the Sudanese Armed 
Forces (SAF) subsequently deployed close air support. 
</p>
<p><b>(d) JEM attack on Omdurman district of greater Khartoum 
</b> On 10 May 2008 rebels of the Darfurian Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) launched 
an unprecedented attack on Khartoum. Some 200-300 cars manned with rebel fighters and 
equipped with mounted machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades entered the Omdurman 
district of Khartoum from the north and west. Government forces stopped the rebel attack in the 
eastern part of Omdurman near the river Nile. Heavy fighting ensued on the eastern end of 
Al Arda Street, in Khalifa Square, and particularly on Fiteihab Bridge leading across the river to 
Khartoum where rebel cars were attacked by tank fire and where JEM was eventually defeated. 
According to official sources, over 30 civilians died in the attacks, but the circumstances of most 
of killings of civilians remain unknown. Eye-witness accounts indicated that at least six civilians 
were killed deliberately by JEM fighters during an attack on a brick factory. JEM further 
attacked civilian targets, such as the main Omdurman local government office, a police station of 
regular police forces who were not participating in the armed conflict between JEM and 
Government forces, and the branch of a bank in Omdurman market. The number of casualties 
caused by these attacks is unknown. It is likely that the number of casualties was limited because 
most office and Government buildings were empty as the attack occurred on a weekend. The 
main material damage to buildings attacked by JEM appeared to have resulted from 
rocket-propelled grenades fired at the buildings, and there were also numerous bullet holes 
probably caused by rifle shots. 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment of implementation of recommendation 1.1.3 
</b></p>
<p> Information received indicates that attacks on civilians or civilian objects in areas under 
Government control are continuing in July 2008. Very few actions were taken to avert the threat 
of or prevent an attack on civilians or protect populations under attack. 
</p>

<p><b>Response of the Government of the Sudan on recommendation 1.1.4 
</b></p>
<p>Written information submitted to the Special Rapporteur on 10 July 2008 
</p>
<p> According to information received the Sudan Armed Forces Act 2007 as well as the Child 
Act 2008 (bill) confirmed 18 years as age of recruitment. They consider the recruitment or using 
of children in armed conflict as a crime punishable under the two acts. 
</p>
<p> The Sudanese authorities have detained 102 child soldiers who participated in the JEM 
attack on Omdurman on 10 May 2008. The President ordered the establishment of a commission 
chaired by the State Minister in the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs to oversee the conditions of 
the detained children whose ages range from 11-17. The detained children were separated from 
the others and held in rehabilitation centres in Khartoum North. They have been provided with 
an excellent standard of accommodation, nutrition, health and psychological care. The children 
have been visited by UNICEF, ICRC, the Independent Expert Group under resolution 191, as 
well as the Special Rapporteur on the Sudan. The children are said to have provided information 
about how they were abducted by JEM and kept in a training camp in the city of Adry in Chad. 
</p>
<p><b>Information received from other sources on recommendation 1.1.4 
</b></p>
<p> The National Assembly adopted the new Sudan Armed Forces Act during its regular 
session on 5 December 2007. The Bill makes illegal recruitment of persons below the age of 18 
into the Armed Forces and provides criminal penalties for those who recruit children under the 
age of 18 years or provide false information for enlistment/recruitment of a person below 
eighteen years of age. These provisions are an improvement on the earlier Armed Forces Act but 
fall short of international law and standards. For example, provisions criminalising recruitment 
of child soldiers do not apply to the enlistment or recruitment of children into rebel forces who 
are known to use child soldiers widely. In addition, the crime of recruiting child soldiers is 
subject to a statute of limitations 10 years after the offence. The Armed Forces Act causes further 
concern, since military courts are permitted jurisdiction over civilians with regards to acts of 
genocide and war crimes, and Article 34 of the Act provides immunity to soldiers for acts 
committed in an official capacity. 
</p>
<p> The International Committee of the Red Cross is involved in tracing the children&#8217;s families 
and UNICEF is planning to assist with their eventual reintegration. While the access for 
international observers to the children was a positive development, the children were subjected 
to repeat interviewing by a range of actors, among them criminal investigators, international 
journalists and members of international organizations, with little consideration of the possibility 
that this may re-traumatize them. 
</p>
<p> Photos of alleged child combatants have been shown in a public exhibition, on Sudanese 
television and in several Sudanese newspapers. The public exposure of photos of the children 
and their identity details may undermine future efforts for their reintegration. Some of the 
children have also been used as witnesses in a criminal investigation to identify alleged JEM 
combatants among the hundreds of people detained by the authorities in the wake of the attacks. 
They also testified as witnesses in court. The authorities did not appear to have considered</p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 33 
 
</p>
<p>measures to ensure that procedures should be child-friendly and to protect the identity of the 
children so as not to put them or their families at risk of reprisals. No information was available 
on any criminal investigations to determine responsibility for the recruitment of the children and 
to prosecute those responsible. 
</p>
<p> Before international observers were given access to the children, they were held for around 
three weeks without contact with the outside world. The children reported that, prior to being 
moved to a separate detention facility, they had been held for several days together with adults in 
a large hangar whose location they were unable to identify. They indicated that detention 
conditions there had been harsh but did not provide further details. 
</p>
<p> Around four children, who remained detained with adult suspects, were charged along with 
adults for criminal offences related to the Omdurman attacks. After trial proceedings opened on 
18 June, three of them were excluded from the judicial proceedings on the grounds that they 
were minors. In one case the judge reportedly did not accept that the defendant was a minor 
without ordering a medical examination to determine his age. 
</p>
<p> Information received indicates that children have also been seen as members of 
government and other rebel forces in Darfur. 
</p>
<p> In North Darfur a 15 year old boy working for the Central Reserve Police (CRP) was 
arrested for killing a civilian while intoxicated in El Fasher town. In a similar incident, another 
15 year old boy working for CRP was arrested in El Fasher for theft and sentenced to one year. 
</p>
<p> In South Darfur, JEM/PW and SLA/PW<b>6</b> are responsible for security matters inside 
al-Dereig IDP camp as per an agreement with the Government. On January 2008, at 
approximately 1400 hrs, ten SLA/PW soldiers entered one IDP family house inside the camp and 
attempted to abduct their son, aged 15 years. When the father resisted, he was stabbed in the 
back and the boy&#8217;s mother was tied up with a rope. The female neighbours intervened when they 
heard the screams from the family; they ran to the house and surrounded the minor in an attempt 
to prevent the soldiers from taking him. In response the soldiers fired in the air to disperse the 
women injuring two women. The soldiers left without the boy. 
 JEM/PW said they do not actively recruit any person below the age of 15, and members 
within their ranks below the age of 15 had volunteered to join and were not forced. 
 Forced recruitment of children by SLA/AG in Manawashi IDP Camp, South Darfur have 
been received. Children are reportedly initially offered a salary, before being forced if they 
refuse.

<p> On 2 July the presence of armed SLA/Free Will child soldiers in Kafod, North Darfur was 
observed. One 15 year old child soldier stated that he had been given a gun by one of the 
movement&#8217;s commanders. The SLA/FW commanders insisted that the children were only 
&#8220;volunteering to help the commanders with fetching water, serving coffee and/or similar 
services&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment of implementation of recommendation 1.1.4 
</b></p>
<p> The adoption of the Armed Forces Act 2007 provides greater legal protection for children 
and women in situations of armed conflict, however, it does not comply with human rights law 
and principles in terms of other areas noted above. Despite the prohibition of recruitment of 
children into armed groups, children continue to be seen as members of government and rebel 
forces. 
</p>
<p><b>Recommendation 1.1.5  </b><i>Mid-term 
</i></p>
<p>Set up effective regular police patrols to protect vulnerable populations in Darfur, supported 
by UN, including around IDP camps and villages. The needs assessment to decide on priorities 
should be done with the involvement of the community concerned to decide and agree on the 
most effective strategy of protection in those areas.

<p> According to information received 2300 police were deployed to North Darfur state, 
2500 police were deployed to South Darfur and 2600 police were deployed to West Darfur to

patrols around the camps as well as escorting women groups out of the camps while collecting 
firewood.

<p> On 23 March 2008, SAF began to conduct daily patrols around Abu Suruj, West Darfur. 
The daily patrols followed an incident on the same day, 23 March, whereby armed Arab nomads 
drove their camels into the watermelon and onion farms destroying cultivated land in Abu Suruj. 
The incident was immediately reported to SAF who rushed to the scene and exchanged fire with 
the Arab nomads. No casualties were reported. Community members in Abu Suruj confirmed to 
human rights monitors that the daily patrols by SAF at the time led to an initial reduction in 
harassment, and lootings by armed Arab nomads. </p>

<p> On 26 March 2008, during a field mission to Kulbus, West Darfur, the Government police 
commander informed human rights monitors that a joint force of police, NISS and SAF conducts 
daily and night patrols in Kulbus town. Local people confirmed the patrols and added that the 
security situation has improved allowing for some of the displaced to return. It is important to 
note however, that the security environment in Kulbus town may have improved, but there are no 
IDP camps in the town itself, therefore the displaced population have not necessarily returned to 
the IDP camps around Kulbus town. 
</p>
<p><b>Assessment of implementation of recommendation 1.1.5

<p>Written information submitted to the Special Rapporteur in March 2008 
</p>
<p> The Government provided statistical information on status of investigation and prosecution 
of violence against women and children cases in North, South and West Darfur for the period 
September 2007-January 2008. In North Darfur 5 cases, 2 referred to court, 1 under investigation 
and 2 reserved. In South Darfur 10 cases, 3 sentenced 4 trials in progress, 1 before the court, 
1 victim referred for medical examination and accused searched for. In West Darfur 14 cases, 
4 sentenced 8 trials in progress, 1 accusation dismissed and 1 under investigation. Information on 
prosecutions of 2 members of the armed forces under Article 149 of the Criminal Act was also 
provided, 1 was sentenced to imprisonment for five years, a hundred lashes and dismissed from 
service the other was found not guilty. 
</p>
<p> The Government also provided information on criminal cases of violence against women 
in South and North Darfur, involving accused who are members of the regular forces (armed 
forces and police). The 4 cases from South Darfur (period 2006-2008) included crimes of 
art. 142 and 149 in which 3 persons were sentenced and 1 accused from the armed forces had not 
been arrested yet. Of the 8 cases from North Darfur (period 2006-2008), 5 were sentenced,

<p> In December 2007, the Advisory Committee for Human Rights (ACHR)<b> </b>sent a letter to 
each of the Darfur States requesting that information on all GBV cases which reached the Courts 
be compiled on a quarterly basis. The letter stated that the reports will be consolidated at 
Khartoum level and will be used in reports by the &#8220;Special Rapporteur on the Situation of 
Human Rights in Sudan&#8221; and in Advisory Council reports. Information requested is: name of 
perpetrator; case number; charges; name of the court; trial date; and court decision.

<p> Women and girls particularly the displaced continue to be raped and subjected to other 
forms of sexual violence especially when they venture outside the confines of the IDP camps to 
undertake income generating activities. Incidents involving attacks on women inside the camps 
were also documented during the period under review. In West Darfur, for example, the total 
number of cases documented between January and June 2008 is 36 involving 109 victims. The </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 37 
 
</p>
<p>break up of incidents is as follows: 15 cases of rape; 11 of attempted rape; 1 abduction; 
2 attempted abduction; and 22 of physical assault and harassment.<b>7</b> Only 3 out of 36 cases were 
registered with the police with no follow up. Three cases were reported to the SAF post 
commander and one with the CRP commander. However, none of the cases were forwarded to 
the relevant judicial authorities for further investigation. 
 In South Darfur, 41 SGBV cases have been documented between January and June 2008, 
including: thirty three rape cases, five cases of attempted rape, two abduction cases and one 
attempted killing. Trials and rulings are still pending for all cases. 
</p>
<p> Human rights monitors documented several cases of sexual violence against minors within 
families, and among the IDP population. Among the perpetrators were members from the 
Government security forces. The majority of victims do not file police complaints either due to 
their lack of confidence in the ability of the police to conduct proper investigations or out of fear 
of retribution. Additionally, in places where there was no INGO presence, victims were reluctant 
to seek medical treatment in Government hospitals due to cultural inhibitions, ability to pay 
hospital fees and stigmatisation. In South Darfur, Government police informed that they did not 
register cases of SGBV without evidence of a Form 8, which must be submitted within 24 hours 
of the incident. Furthermore, the police considered cases of attempted rape and physical assaults 
as minor incidents, and thereby felt no obligated to investigate such cases. 
</p>
<p> In cases where victims reported attacks, there are still huge barriers to victims seeking 
justice even in cases where the perpetrator was known to the victim. 
 On 9 March 2008 in Silea, West Darfur, the police failed to pursue a criminal case against 
two SAF soldiers who raped a 12 year old girl. The family were reportedly pressurized by the 
police and the community leaders to agree to compensation in the sum of 2,000 Sudanese 
pounds. The victim was taken to Chad for her own safety.

and gang-raped at gun-point over a period of three days by three military personnel and one 
civilian, a relative of the victim (police record No. 5142/2007). The four were charged under 
Articles 149 (Rape) and 26 (Assisting) of Sudan Criminal Act 1991. Only the civilian defendant 
was present at the court session. According to the prosecution lawyer, since the beginning of 
2008, the South Darfur military legal advisor has failed to produce the other three accused before 
the court. The court scheduled the next hearing for 8 May and reiterated its request to the 
military legal advisor to produce the three military defendants. Again on 8 May, the three 
military defendants failed to appear before the Judge, the case has since been re-adjourned four 
times to 15 June, 8 July, 16 July and at the time of issuing this report had been again adjourned 
until 27 July, due to the failure of the military to produce personnel.

<p> A member of SAF who raped a 14 year old girl in Nyala in November 2007 has repeatedly 
failed to appear before the court. The case which is lodged as criminal case No. 2632/2007 has 
received six court sessions; the defendant has failed to appear on all six occasions. The defendant 
is charged in absentia under article 149 of the Criminal Act, 1991. 
</p>
<p> On a positive note, Nyala Court imposed a prison sentence and compensation on two men, 
one of whom was a member of SAF. In the sexual assault case (police record No. 2927/2007) 
involving the October 2007 rape and beating of two 14 year old girls by two men, including one 
military personnel, on 29 April 2008, the Nyala Criminal Court found both men guilty under 
Articles 149 (rape) and 21 (criminal joint acts) of the Sudan Criminal Act 1991. The court 
sentenced both men to ten years imprisonment and one hundred lashes each, and ordered a 
compensation payment of 3500 Sudanese pounds / 1750 USD for each victim to be paid by the 
convicted. The court stated in its decision that due to the prevalence of rape offences in 
South Darfur State, the maximum punishment should be taken against the convicted.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) South Darfur 
</b> Human rights monitors documented 21 cases of rape, of which 6 of the victims were 
children. Among the cases documented are some of the following: 
</p>
<p> On 15 November 2007, two women who went out in search of firewood were captured, 
beaten and gang raped by five armed men in military uniforms at a farm west of Nyala. Although 
the men had their faces partly covered, the victims suspected that they were soldiers from a 
nearby military checkpoint. One was raped by three men while the other was raped by two 
others. Both did not receive medical treatment, the case was not reported to the police. 
</p>
<p> In another incident in Nyala, on 20 November 2007, a 28 year old woman working in her 
farm was gang raped in the presence of her 7 year old son by two men in green camouflage 
uniforms. Both mother and son were severely beaten by the men before two of them proceeded 
to rape the woman. She received treatment at a local clinic but chose not to report the incident to 
the police. 
</p>
<p> On 8 December 2007 two girls aged 12 from Al Neem IDP camp, were abducted and raped 
by two gunmen while fetching firewood near the camp. One was released the same day while the

soldiers and police. In the market, SAF solders and policemen started beating civilians, burnt 
down shops, looted goods and raped several women inside the shops and in their homes. 
According to witness, the attackers started off by shooting indiscriminately before proceeding to 
loot the market and then sexually assaulting women. Three women reported having been gang 
raped. Accounts from victims and other witnesses testified that Fur women in the town were 
specifically targeted. 
</p>
<p> On 9 January 2008, one girl and seven women were returning to Mornei camp after 
collecting firewood when they came across four armed men in green camouflage uniform who 
asked them to hand over the 16-year-old girl. The women refused and started running. The four 
men chased them and managed to beat some of them with whips. When the men spotted another 
man in the distance, they gave up the chase but took most of the women&#8217;s possessions and 
disappeared. Upon their return to the camp, the women reported the incident to the police but the 
police refused to open a case and took no action. 
</p>

the CRP in Sirba, West Darfur. The girls were returning from Birak, Chad to Sirba with an older 
woman when they were approached by the soldiers. The attackers allowed the older woman to 
leave the place and took the girls to their military base where they raped them in the presence of 
four other CRP members. The incident was reported to the local CRP Commander, who has so 
far not made any efforts to investigate or prosecute the perpetrators, citing the unwillingness of 
two of the victims to be interviewed by him. This reluctance appears to stem from concern for 
the safety of the victims, who have refused to speak with the commander due to fear of reprisal. 
</p>
<p> On 6 March 2008, two armed Arab men attacked a group of Fur IDP girls and women in 
Lisse area, 2 km south of Mornei. The perpetrators approached the group and asked a

intercourse with her. After she refused and the older woman intervened to support the victim, the 
attackers hit the 13-year-old girl with an axe on her neck and assaulted the woman. The attackers 
fled when a group of IDPs approached the scene. The victim was taken to the police station and 
later admitted to the public clinic for medical treatment. Although the Form 8 was completed for 
her and the incident reported to the police, the police reportedly did not take any action to 
investigate. 
 Two SAF soldiers who beat and attempted to rape two female IDPs, a 25-year-old woman 
and a 15-year-old girl on 18 March 2008 were verbally reprimanded by their commander. He 
advised the victims to beat the men if they attempt to rape them again. The victims were attacked

have sex with. When the elder sister refused to allow them to take the girls, the SAF soldiers 
shouted at her and told her she was black and a stupid woman and that &#8220;they were black 
Africans, and that they should consider it a blessing to have Arab babies&#8221;. The soldiers insisted 
on taking the girls, they beat the elder sister and one of the soldiers pointed his gun at her. The 
elder sister&#8217;s shouts and screams alerted the neighbours who came to intervene. The other soldier 
persuaded his colleague not to shoot the elder sister.

</p>
<p><b>Assessment of implementation of recommendation 1.2.2 
</b></p>
<p> Implementation has begun however the ratio of number of reported cases followed by 
appropriate action is still extremely low. There have been a few cases where perpetrators of rape 
have been prosecuted, however in the majority of cases the authorities are still not responding 
appropriately. More effort is required to ensure that every case reported to the authorities is 
promptly responded to through effective investigation, prosecution and compensation. Only 
when victims see successful cases being brought to court will they have confidence in the 
criminal justice system and more cases will be reported to the police.

<p> North Darfur State Committee to Combat Violence against Women met on 18 February to 
review its 2007 workplan and to draft a new Work Plan for 2008. Members of the Committee 
met again on 3 March; it was agreed that the Committee would meet on a bi-monthly basis. The 
Committee received funds 5000 Sudanese pounds from the Violence against Women Unit in 
Khartoum. UNAMID sections have committed support to the committee in the form of technical 
expertise, logistics, financial support and training based on the mandate of each section. 
</p>
<p> According to the work plan capacity-building represented the main scope of the State 
Committee  activities in 2007 and will continue in 2008 with the following planned activities: 
workshops on form 8 in seven additional localities; one-day workshop for newly appointed 
prosecutors in the localities; two-day training workshop for members of the sub-committees 
branch offices; several workshops on female circumcision; training on GBV to the media in 
El Fasher and human rights training at OHCHR for some members of the Committee. UN 
representatives requested that the Committee work in 2008 Work plan concentrate more on 
advocacy, policy and information-sharing: Public Awareness Raising : The Committee agreed

<p>Dissemination of policy and recommendations drafted at the State level should take place 
including on the Declaration on the measures for the elimination of violence against women in 
Darfur Information-Gathering/Analysis: The ACHR addressed a letter to each Darfur State on 
30 December 2007, asking that information on all types of GBV should be compiled on a 
quarterly basis and sent back to them. The Sate Committee Chair has forwarded the request to 
ND Police Commissioner, ND Prosecutor and ND Chief Judiciary. 
</p>
<p> During the reporting period, the Committee collected and forwarded information requested 
by the ACHR in Khartoum (156 cases for the 1st quarter). It did not directly implement any other 
activity, investigate or follow up on any case of GBV. Celebrations of International Women&#8217;s 
Day were led and conducted by the Wali&#8217;s Advisor on Women and Children Affairs. The Chair 
of the GBV State Committee and some members attended. The local topic this year was on 
eradication and criminalisation of FGM, an official celebration was organized by the Wali&#8217;s 
office and the Advisor on Women and Children Affairs. Also the Ministry of Social Welfare 
conducted several activities on FGM and the Ministry of Education established an 
awareness-raising committee in 5 schools in North Darfur. 
</p>
<p> The Committee constituted 3 Sub GBV committees in Dar El Salam, El lait and El Sarif 
localities. The Sub committees received funds from the National Ministry of Social Welfare, 
Women and Children Unit (5,000 Sudanese pounds each, computer and furniture). 
</p>
<p> West Darfur - The West Darfur State Committee to Eliminate Violence against Women 
held three meetings, on 1 and 30 April and 21 May. The meetings were attended by all 
Government members and UNAMID and UN agencies, who attended as observers. The 
committee has a work plan. Although the committee was established in late 2005, it is only now 
starting its work and has not yet undertaken activities. 
</p>
<p> South Darfur - In the last quarter of 2007, the South Darfur State Committee developed a 
three-month work plan, which was not implemented. On 30 April, members of the Committee 
met for the first time in 2008. Participants proposed that the 2008 work-plan be adopted for 
implementation for the next three months. Participants agreed to meet on 13 May to complete the 
work plan. UNAMID and other UN agencies participated in the meeting as observers. The work 
plan has now been adopted by the Committee.

to issue Form 8. 
</p>
<p> On 14 April, the Joint State Committee for Combating Sexual and Gender Based Violence 
(JSCGBV) in Nyala, South Darfur, UNFPA and UNAMID Gender Office conducted field

regards to the Rules of Application to Criminal Circular No. 2 in addition to the Governor&#8217;s 
circular on the seven (7) points of handling rape survivors in relation to Form 8. The JSCGBV 
was created in January 2008 following a Government Decree. 
</p>
<p> In North Darfur, the State Committees to Combat Violence Against Women conducted 
dissemination workshops on Circular 2 and Form 8 across five localities (50%) in North Darfur, 
the Committee in its Work plan for 2008 budgeted for a further five workshops in the remaining 
localities. UNAMID Human Rights will be funding part of the activities. Inter-agency Working 
groups on GBV in three Darfur states have undertaken several activities to spread awareness 
among women of their right to seek medical care with regard to cases of sexual violence 
including awareness raising on referral pathways on medical care, training of UNAMID 
CIVPOL community police officers, Gender Desk Officers and Gender Advisers.

<p> The Government provided information that 35 police women have been deployed in 
Northern State to work in the camps of Abu Shouk and Zam Zam and units of women and child

</b></p>
<p> On 16 October 2007, South Darfur Police established a new unit in Nyala entitled, 
&#8220;Section to Investigate Crimes and Violations against Women and Children&#8221;. The Unit was 
tasked with investigations into cases of sexual violence. Although members of the unit include 
female police officers who have benefited from a number of UN trainings pertaining to their 
mandate, there has yet to be an official outcome to investigations which they were assigned. The 
new Unit now comprises the Prosecution office, Judiciary, Ministry of Social Welfare, doctors 
and psychosocial specialists. Additionally, the new unit comprises a specialised Prosecutor for 
children, a children custody centre and a juvenile court. 
 On 7 May, a representative from West Darfur State Police informed that there were no 
female police holding the rank of an officer in West Darfur. That the police barracks in 
West Darfur lacked the resources to provide facilities including accommodation for women 
police officers should they be deployed to the region. In Zalingei, women work in the police as 
administrators and not as police officers.

Art. 149 of Criminal Act 1991 in a way ensuring that no links it to the substantive or

</b></p>
<p>Written information submitted to the Special Rapporteur on 10 July 
</p>
<p> On 16 June ACHR in collaboration with UNMIS convened a workshop to discuss the 
overlap in the definition of the crimes of rape and adultery and to look into the practice and ways 
of substantiating each of the two crimes. The workshop was attended by judges, prosecutors, the 
police, the military justice, lawyers and representatives of voluntary organizations. A paper 
presented by the former Chief justice included a number of initial recommendations stressing the 
importance of amending the definition of rape as well as looking into evidence. The 
recommendations will be provided to a number of specialized scholars. 
</p>
<p><b>Information received from other sources on recommendation 1.2.8 
</b></p>
<p> During the reporting period, there were no significant changes in the current legal 
framework with regard to crimes of sexual violence, including amendment to the definition of 
rape. 
</p>
<p> In the courts application of the existing law, the courts have in some instances amended 
charges of rape to adultery. Rape unlike adultery is not a hudud crime and therefore the high 
standards of evidence required to prove and convict a defendant of hudud offences are not 
requirements to convict a defendant of rape. However victims and their legal representatives are 
not made aware of this fact, ensuring that the &#8220;reversal of charge&#8221; has become an effective threat 
to victims accessing justice in cases of rape. The problem of misinterpretation of the law has not 
been limited to defence lawyers, in the absence of a statutory interpretation of the Evidence 
Act 1993, in cases of rape, judges&#8217; interpretation of the law has also been wrong in law. On 
27 January, Nyala General Court found an accused guilty under articles 151 (Gross Indecency) 
and 78 (Drinking alcohol) of the Criminal Act, 1991 although the defendant was charged and 
tried for offences under articles 149 (rape), 78 and 148. The judge ruled that the prosecution 
failed to present evidence of adultery as contained in article 62 of the Evidence Act 1993. On 
12 January, the victim, a 12-year-old girl from Alserief IDP Camp, 12 km south west of Nyala 
was raped by the accused in her home inside the camp. The victim was also subjected to severe 
beatings during the attack. The defendant was sentenced to two years imprisonment, 80 lashes 
and a fine of 10,000 Sudanese pounds. </p>

</p>
<p> On 29 April, Nyala Criminal Court convicted two men, one a member of SAF, of rape of 
two 14-year-old girls in October 2007 under Articles 149 (rape), and 21 (criminal joint acts) of 
the Criminal Act 1991. The men were sentenced to ten years imprisonment and one hundred 
lashes each, and ordered to pay a compensation of 35, 000 SDG for each victim to be paid by the 
convicted. The court stated in its decision that due to the prevalence of rape offences in 
South Darfur State, the maximum punishment should be imposed on the convicted.<b>

</b></p>
<p> Workshops have been held on the issue which conclude that there is need for reform of the 
Criminal Act of 1991-definition of rape and evidence. No action has been taken to reform the 
law so far. In a couple of cases the Nyala Criminal Court has shown that it is able and willing to 
prosecute cases of rape, with appropriate sentences for perpetrators and reparation for victims.<b>

<p> In March 2008, the government opened a Family and Child Protection Unit in 
West Darfur, the first in Darfur with the technical and financial support of UNICEF. The Unit is 
modelled on previous Units established in Khartoum in early 2007. It is expected to provide 
specialist services for children and women who are victims of sexual and gender based violence, 
abuse and exploitation. Similar Units are expected in the latter half of 2008 in both North and 
South Darfur. The unit is headed by a police officer holding the rank of captain. The Ministry of 
Justice has designated one judge and one prosecutor to follow up on cases involving women and 
children. The unit has four departments, 1) three police investigators; 2) one social worker, 3) 
one nurse and 4) one public relations and media officer. 
</p>
<p> All the Units as in Khartoum will be funded jointly by the Government and UNICEF. As 
part of capacity building programme for the Units, 45 law enforcement officers (chiefs of police 
units and prosecutors from Northern and Southern Sudan states) were trained from 24 to 
29 February 2008. For further capacity building, UNICEF plans on facilitating and funding 
&#8220;on-the-job&#8221; training through an INGO. UNICEF El Geneina has donated to the unit 
furniture including desks, chairs, photocopier and cabinets. To facilitate the work and

<p> On 9 December 2007, Adam Youssef Ibrahim, a 60-year-old tailor was shot and killed in 
El Fasher market by members from the Border Guards. Immediately after the incident, the Wali 
of North Darfur and Government Police confirmed that members of SAF were responsible for 
the death. The police opened a case against the perpetrators (criminal case no. 3945/2006) and 
the Wali promised compensation to the relatives of the victim. As of 29 May 2008, the relatives 
have not received compensation. The Prosecutor has requested cooperation from the Military; 
however the Military responded that they required the name of the individual soldier who fired 
the fatal shot before they would be able to take action.

patronised her restaurant. The victim was packing her belongings and preparing to close for the 
day when the soldier appeared in front of her restaurant. Without any warning, the soldier shot 
the victim several times in the stomach and she died instantly. The soldier was reportedly 
arrested by the police and transferred to Zalingei prison.

IDP camp and Zalingei town, while coming back from farming along the <i>wadi</i>. The two IDPs 
were stopped by two armed men - one in military uniform and the other in police uniform. The 
two IDPs were asked to walk in front of the armed men. One of the IDPs attempted to flee 
towards the camp and the armed men opened fire and shot at both victims: one victim was shot 
in the leg and the other in the hand. The perpetrators immediately left the scene while the IDP 
who was wounded in the hand was able to return to the IDP camp to ask for help. A complaint 
was filed with the police. There has been no progress in the investigation. 
 On 8 February, two drunken Central Reserve Police (CRP) members assaulted a 
40-year-old woman and her son in their home in Jabalin IDP camp, near Garsilla, West Darfur. 
The woman&#8217;s neighbours came to her rescue and captured one of the assailants. They took him 
to the local police station but the police released him without charging him with an offence. </p>

</p>
<p> On 10 February 2008, a 46-year-old man was killed after being attacked in his home in 
Garsilla by four members of the SAF. The four men barged into the victim&#8217;s home at around 
10 p.m. and began beating him in the presence of his family. Neighbours reported the beating 
lasted for more than an hour and the aggressors made sure the victim was dead before they left. 
</p>
<p> On 25 February 2008, a 50-year-old man was shot dead in his home in Ardamata, 
West Darfur, while trying to prevent his two nieces from being raped. Eyewitnesses reported that 
three armed men dressed in green camouflaged uniforms broke into the house of the deceased 
sister and attempted to rape the deceased&#8217;s nieces who also lived in the house. She tried to stop 
the attackers and was severely beaten. The deceased, who lives next door, heard the screams of 
his sister and immediately run to her rescue. He was immediately shot and killed by one of the 
attackers. The incident was reported to the police in Ardamata. 
</p>
<p> On 2 May 2008, NISS allegedly detained a 53-year-old Massalit man for two days, for his 
criticism of the government and the Tijaniya <i>tariqa</i>, a Sufi religious group. The victim is a 
well-known religious figure and activist in El Geneina and belongs to a Sunni sect with hundreds 
of student supporters. The man was released on 4 May 2008 after signing an agreement not to 
criticize the Government and other religious groups. The victim had been similarly detained on 
four previous occasions, for periods of fourteen to ninety five days in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 
2003. 
 On 14 May 2008 at approximately 5:00 pm, soldiers from Military Intelligence arrested 
three Zaghawa men at a check point located at the western entrance of Zalingei town. At the time 
of the arrest, the three men were travelling in a commercial vehicle from Al Geneina en route to 
Zalingei. The basis of the men&#8217;s arrest remains unclear. The three men were taken to military 
intelligence headquarters based in Brigade 96 HQ, Zalingei. On the same evening of the arrest, 
one of the men, a 30-year-old from the Zaghawa tribe from Tandelti, West Darfur, died after 
being beaten by military intelligence soldiers. Reportedly the victim was repeatedly kicked by 
military soldiers, which may have caused the man to haemorrhage internally. He reportedly 
collapsed and died the same evening and was buried on 15 May. According to information 
received, the other two detainees arrested at the same time as the deceased were immediately 
transferred from the military base. Military intelligence, were not available to discuss the case. 
</p>
<p> On 9 June a 47-year-old Berti man was arrested in Nyala after NISS had threatened to 
abduct his wife if he did not surrender himself. On 11 June, the police (not the NISS who 
arrested him) brought the body of the victim to his family. The family was unable to verify 
whether there were any signs on the body as to the cause of death as the police had prepared the 
body for burial before bringing the body to the family. The man was said to have been in good 
health before his arrest. There is a police autopsy report, but the results have so far not been 
disclosed. The family is of the opinion that the arrest of their relative was related to the 
Omdurman attack. The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has initiated an investigation. 
</p>
<p> On 19 June, two armed members from the CRP shot and killed an unarmed 45-year-old 
IDP man inside Tonkitir IDP camp. According to eyewitnesses two armed CRP from Mershing 
entered an IDP home at Tonkitir IDP camp and reportedly attempted to kidnap and rape two 
girls. The victim, who resided in a home neighboring the attacked family, heard the noise and 
approached the home. According to the witnesses, when the victim entered the home, the CRP 
reportedly shot the victim in the chest. The victim died shortly after the shooting. IDP sheiks </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 59 
 
</p>
<p>briefed the Wali on the circumstances of the killing, including the identities of the perpetrators, 
when the Wali visited the area on 20 June. The Wali reportedly instructed the CRP commander 
to take immediate action. The two CRP members suspected of the killing are reportedly in CRP 
detention in Mershing. On 23 June, the chief prosecutor of South Darfur reportedly submitted a 
formal request to the Ministry of Interior to waive the immunity privileges of the two CRP 
members. The letter was also addressed to the Chief of the CRP in South Darfur and to Mershing 
police station, where the men are currently detained. It is promising to note the immediate action 
undertaken by the chief prosecutor. 
</p>
<p> On 16 June 2008, two Massalit IDP men from Masteri, were abducted by seven armed men 
described by witnesses as Arab militia from Kobore. The bodies of the men were later found in a 
dry well. Relatives of the victims, a group of nine women and girls, were collecting mangoes 
when they were instructed by two men, described as Arabs wearing green military uniforms, to 
leave the area. As the women were returning to their camp, they saw their two relatives cutting 
wood. Before the women could reach the men to warn them to leave, the women observed a 
group of armed men approach their two relatives. The armed men were described as Arabs 
wearing green camouflage uniforms who were riding horses. Both victims were reportedly 
ordered at gunpoint by the abductors to move with them to Kobore, which is an area renown for 
its presence of militia. The women who witnessed the abduction reported it to the police. On 
20 June, the victims&#8217; bodies were found in a dry well near Wadi Kobore, West Darfur. On 
21 June 2008, the bodies were recovered from the well and examined by a medical practitioner. 
The Masteri police commander stated that the men had been severely beaten, and postulated that 
both men died as a result of a broken neck. The Masteri police opened a case file, initially as an 
abduction case and later as a murder case. It appears, however, that police did not proceed with 
further investigation on the grounds that there were no witnesses to the deaths and the case 
involved &#8220;unknown perpetrators&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> On 16 July 2008, three armed men believed to be members of the Border Guards dressed 
in military uniforms opened fire on two students (brothers) in Nyala, Hay al-Salam west, 
South Darfur. According to reports, the students were returning home when the armed men tried 
to stop them. After the men failed to stop, the soldiers reportedly shot several rounds of 
ammunition towards them, killing one of the men, a 20-year-old student. The perpetrators fled 
the area. Police visited the home of the victim but were reportedly sent away by the victim&#8217;s 
father.  
</p>
<p> (ii) Torture, degrading, inhumane and cruel treatment 
</p>
<p> The UN continues to receive reports of severe beatings of detainees, particularly those 
suspected of involvement with rebel groups, while in custody of National Intelligence and 
Security Services (NISS) in West Darfur. For example, between 23 June and 12 July 2008 in 
West Darfur, UNAMID documented four separate incidents of torture/ill treatment by NISS 
which are consistent with previous reports, whereby detainees accused of involvement with rebel 
movements or other anti-state political activities were subjected to torture, ill treatment and 
inhumane and degrading treatment. Consistent reports were received of: detainees being 
restrained and severely and repeatedly beaten with pipes and sticks; being subjected to beatings 
and interrogation while in stress positions; and detainees being forced to adopt degrading</p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 60 
 
</p>
<p>positions such as crawling or rolling on the ground and being beaten. On the basis of the severity 
of the beatings and degree of suffering caused, and the intent to use the beating to elicit 
information or punish detainees for their alleged involvement in activities perceived as acts 
against the state. The following are some examples of cases documented. 
</p>
<p> In Zalingei, a male IDP arrested by the police in January 2008 reported that he was later 
ill-treated by NISS. The victim was picked up at a market area by a policeman who accused him 
of having killed people. He was taken to the local police station where he was interrogated and 
detained for two days. He was later moved to an NISS office inside the police station where he 
was further interrogated and subjected to ill treatment by five NISS officers and one policeman. 
He reported that he was repeatedly beaten, humiliated and threatened. His hair was pulled and he 
was beaten many times with a plastic cylinder tool. The victim was released on 12 January, after 
the Zalingei Prosecutor intervened. 
 On 25 February, police in Nyala re-arrested four people moments after a court ordered 
their release, citing insufficient evidence. The detainees were not informed of the reasons for 
their re-arrest. They later embarked on a hunger strike and demanded to know why they had been 
re-arrested. Human rights monitors visited the detainees at Kuria Prison. One of them was 
arrested on 20 August 2007 on suspicion of killing his brother while the other three were picked 
up by the police from Al Salaam and Kalma IDP camps along with other IDPs for unknown 
reasons. All of them stated that they had been ill treated and denied access to medical treatment. 
Some were kicked while others were punched and thrown against a wall on numerous occasions. 
They also reported that their lives were threatened by officers from National Security while in 
custody at Nyala Wassat Police station and at Kuria prison. 
</p>
<p> A 40-year-old man from Zalingei was reportedly subjected to cruel and inhumane 
treatment including being shown pictures of dead and mutilated bodies, and suspended upside 
down from a ceiling by officers from National Security. The man was arrested on 25 February on 
suspicion of murdering a community leader in an IDP Camp in Zalingei. He reported that the 
officers threatened to kill him in a similar fashion as shown in the pictures if he did not confess 
to the murder. He has been charged with murder and remains in detention.  
</p>
<p> On 27 March, a 44-year-old IDP shopkeeper was reportedly assaulted and threatened by 
the head of SAF military base in Mornei, West Darfur inside Mornei market after he informed 
the Commander that he did not have enough of the item he was seeking. The commander 
reportedly told the victim that &#8220;<i>he could bury him alive if he wished to do so and nobody would 
know what happened to him</i>&#8221;<i>. 
</i> On 8 May, Sudanese authorities in Kass arrested the man for travelling in Sudan without a 
visa and instructed him to return to Chad. On 10 May, as he was returning back to Chad, 
Nationality and Immigration authorities wearing civilian clothes reportedly arrested him at the 
bus station in Zalingei. The man was taken to the Nationality and Immigration Office where he 
was detained and subjected to ill-treatment including severe beating. According to the victim, he 
was repeatedly beaten with a whip and a tree branch by an immigration officer in the presence of 
four other men in civilian clothes. The victim also stated that during his detention, an 
Immigration authority approached him and stated that &#8220;your people have attacked Omdurman&#8221;. 
The victim escaped from custody on 11 May and reported the incident to UNHCR Zalingei. The 
Chadian male was transferred to the Zalingei police station and the case referred to the court. On 
13 May, the UN attended the trial and observed that the Zalingei court ordered the man to be </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 61 
 
</p>
<p>immediately deported to Chad and to remain in Zalingei prison until the arrangements for his 
return to Chad were finalized. Reports were received that arrangements had been made for the 
man&#8217;s deportation but as of 21 May 2008, the man remained in detention at Zalingei prison. 
</p>
<p> On 10 April 2008, a group of SAF soldiers reportedly arrested a 35-year-old Erenga man in 
Abu Suruj on suspicion of belonging to rebel groups. The victim was detained for six days and 
was not brought before a judicial authority. According to the victim, he was blindfolded and 
handcuffed during the arrest and taken to a military camp on the western side of Abu Suruj. The 
victim was beaten by SAF soldiers with whips and sticks and hung him by his neck from a tree 
for two hour intervals, over a period of two days. A deep fresh wound on the victim&#8217;s neck was 
observed. He was released on 15 April 2008 without charge. 
</p>
<p> On 11 May, military intelligence in West Darfur detained a Massalit taxi driver for 
seven days. In both cases, the men were reportedly subjected to ill treatment. The Zaghawa man 
stated that his hands were shackled to his feet for several days and only released twice each day 
for personal needs. The Massalit taxi driver was reportedly repeatedly whipped by three military 
intelligence soldiers and blamed for the attacks against the government in Omdurman. Although 
both men were released without charge, the security entities reportedly stated the releases were 
&#8220;conditional&#8221; and instructed the men to report every day to the NISS or Military Intelligence 
respectively and not to leave the city. 
</p>
<p> In early 2004, NISS at Um Kadada tortured a Tunjur man. The victim suffered extensive 
damage to his genitalia: as a result of the attack, parts of his testes were removed at El Fasher 
hospital. Although it is not relevant to allegation to the allegation of torture, the victim had been 
accused of robbery and was acquitted by the Al Fasher courts on 26 April 2004. After the 
incident, the victim could not file case against those who tortured him because he was living in 
Um Kadada, an area was under control of Border Guards. After the victim moved to 
Abou Shouk IDP camp in early 2008, he filed a complaint at the Al Gunubi police station. On 
1 June 2008, the Prosecutor lodged a request for the immunity of NISS perpetrators to be 
waived. 
</p>
<p> On 3 July 2008, a group of approximately thirty men, mostly wearing brown camouflage 
uniforms, arrested a 34-year-old man at his home in Zalingei and brought him to NISS where he 
was detained until 10 July. Available information indicates that the man was subjected to 
ill-treatment on the evenings of 3 and 4 July 2008. The victim was seen briefly by a relative on 
4 July and described as very weak and unable to stand up. Due to a pre-existing medical issue, 
on 8 July the detainee was taken to the emergency room at Zalingei hospital. Relatives of the 
victim observed bruising on the victim&#8217;s back, the bottom of both feet, on his right wrist and 
right cheek. The men have been released. 
</p>
<p> A 28-year-old Fur male who was reportedly subject to ill treatment during his detention 
with NISS Zalingei from 17 May 2008 until 6 July 2008. NISS Zalingei arrested and detained 
him on 17 May due to suspicion of his involvement in painting pro-SLA/Abdul Wahid messages 
and other graffiti on walls in Zalingei town. On four occasions during his detention he was 
subjected to severe beatings and degrading treatment. The victim was reportedly ordered to stand 
against a wall with his arms above his head while NISS officers repeatedly beat him with a black 
water pipe and sticks. On two occasions he was instructed to crawl on the ground, during which</p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 62 
 
</p>
<p>he was also subjected to further beatings. The victim reported that while being subjected to this 
degrading treatment, NISS said &#8220;you Fur, you are away now. Now we hate you. Now we will 
take you out of the country&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> In May a 39-year-old Zaghawa man was detained for six days by the NISS (both in 
El Fasher and Khartoum) on suspicion of being involved in the Omdurman attack. The man, who 
is from Tina and resides in El Fasher, works as a security guard for a UN agency. During the 
three days he was detained by NISS in El Fasher, the man reported that he was forced to lie on 
the floor in only his underwear with his legs tied to a chair while four men beat him. During the 
beatings he was accused of collaborating with foreigners. According to the victim, he was 
transferred to Khartoum in a cargo aircraft and had his head hooded until his arrival at NISS 
premises in Khartoum. During his interrogation in NISS, which occurred after a hospital visit as 
the victim had fainted and required oxygen, the victim said he was beaten with a wooden stick 
whenever he moved. He was interrogated mainly about his relationships with the leadership of 
rebel movements. He also mentioned that he was questioned about a colleague and questioned as 
to whether the colleague belonged to the Zaghawa tribe. He reported that this colleague was later 
interrogated by NISS for two hours, before being allowed to leave. The victim was returned to 
El Fasher on 26 May. A few days later, he was invited to meet the Head of NISS in El Fasher 
who presented his excuses to him for the ill-treatment and stated that it had been carried out by 
individuals who should not have treated him in such a way. 
</p>
<p> On 11 May NISS arrested two merchants from Central Sudan in Nyala, apparently for their 
suspected involvement with the Omdurman attack. The families of the detainees were allowed 
access to them after they approached the NISS with a Berti tribal committee headed by the Nazir. 
UNAMID&#8217;s attempts to gain access to the detainees were denied by the NISS. The Director of 
NISS told the HRT that the men were arrested following orders from Khartoum and therefore all 
requests including access should be directed at the Khartoum level. 
</p>
<p> A 42-year-old Massalit IDP leader from Hujaj IDP Camp in Geneina, West Darfur arrested 
and detained by NISS officials on several occasions due to suspicion of his association with 
JEM. He was initially arrested on 21 May, when he went to the NISS office inside Geneina 
market to seek permission to buy fuel to sell. The man was reportedly taken to the NISS 
headquarters in Geneina and subjected to ill-treatment. NISS officials apparently took him 
outside, made him lie down in the sun and told him to crawl for over thirty minutes. During the 
ill-treatment, he was accused of collecting money from the IDPs in Hujaj camp to support JEM. 
According to the man, he was kept in a cell alone for the first four days; on the fifth day, he was 
taken to another cell with thirteen other detainees. The man was released on 26 May and ordered 
to report to the NISS every day. On 29 May, the man was rearrested and detained when he went 
to report to the NISS office. The man was reportedly interrogated again and told that he would 
be released if he confessed to supporting the JEM. The man alleged that a senior official from 
the Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) in Geneina was present during the interrogation and 
he also urged him to confess. The man was reportedly released on 15 June, after the he swore on 
the Quran that he would not support the JEM and signed a paper presented to him, which he was 
unable to read. According to the ex-detainee, he shared a cell with sixteen other detainees, 
including Chadians. Bruising and abrasion marks on the victim&#8217;s feet and arms were observed 
consistent with his testimony. </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 63 
 
</p>
<p> On 7 June, NISS officers arrested eight IDP men from Kalma IDP camp. No reason was 
given for the arrest. The NISS initially denied arresting the men but have since admitted to the 
detention. The detainees are accused by NISS of membership of SLA/AW. The NISS officials 
also informed the relatives that the detainees will be charged under articles 50 (Undermining the 
constitutional system) and 51 (Waging war against the state) of the Sudan Criminal Act 1991. 
The family has been denied access to the detainees. 
</p>
<p> On 9 June a 25-year-old man from the Berti tribe was arrested by unknown men believed 
to be NISS officers. According to the family, the NISS, the police and police &#8220;mubaheth&#8221; 
(intelligence) in Nyala have denied the arrest. The whereabouts of the man is unknown. 
</p>
<p> On 9 June, unknown armed men suspected to be officers from the NISS arrested a 
17-year-old boy from the Berti tribe in his family home in Hay Al-Wihda, Nyala, South Darfur. 
The whereabouts of the detainee is unknown. The detainee&#8217;s family added that NISS in Nyala 
have denied making the arrest. 
</p>
<p> On 3 July 2008, NISS arrested three men in Zalingei, on the basis of the men&#8217;s suspected 
involvement in writing pro-SLA Abdul Wahid and other rebellion oriented graffiti on houses, 
schools and shops in Zalingei town. At least two of the men were reportedly ill treated while in 
NISS custody.  
</p>
<p> (iii) Arbitrary Detention 
</p>
<p> The UN continued to document arbitrary arrests and detentions by Government security 
agencies, primarily targeting people perceived to be aligned with rebel factions. On 29 March, a 
40-year-old man from Dorti IDP camp, West Darfur, was arrested by officers from NISS for 
providing accommodation to a man alleged to be a member of JEM and for reportedly aiding in 
his escape from the camp. The man has since been held in <i>incommunicado</i> detention and is yet to 
be charged with an offence. The Head of Military Intelligence confirmed the arrest, and 
informed that the detainee will remain in detention until the alleged JEM member surrenders to 
the authorities. 
 In Hileat, West Darfur, law enforcement agencies arrested three men including the Omda 
of Hilelat on suspicion of having ties with JEM. The men were arrested on 8 March, and taken to 
a Government military barracks in Kulbus. They were held for two nights and interrogated about 
their affiliation with JEM. On 18 March, two of the detainees were released without charge. The 
Omda remained in military custody in Kulbus for additional three days and was transferred to 
military headquarters El Geneina for further investigations on 21 March 2008. After two days in 
detention in MI headquarters, he was transferred to NISS detention facility in El Geneina where 
he was detained for a further 28 days. The Omda was released on 19 April without charge. 
</p>
<p> In West Darfur, following aerial bombardments of villages in the northern corridor in early 
February, the Government arrested and detained 21 male IDPs from Silea for more than 30 days. 
According to one of the detainees, the detainees were all released without charge on 25 March in 
El Fasher, North Darfur and given thirty Sudanese pounds for transportation. One former 
detainee reported that he was arrested on 19 February from his home along with twenty others 
from Aro Sharow by SAF soldiers and taken to Silea. Their hands were tied behind them, and 
they were denied food and water. They were also beaten with whips and sticks. On 20 February, 
they were transferred to Military Intelligence headquarters in Geneina where they were kept for </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 64 
 
</p>
<p>three nights. Again, they were subjected to continual beatings and accused of being rebels. They 
were then separated and subjected to repeated interrogation on their alleged ties with rebel 
groups. The victim was lashed repeatedly while being interrogated. He was transferred to 
El Fasher on 22 February and remained in military custody before his release on 25 March. 
</p>
<p> Between 20 and 21 May 2008, five Zaghawa family members, including two women and a 
19-month child, were detained by Military Intelligence in El Fasher during a search for a suspect, 
the husband of one of the women arrested. The suspect, a clothes merchant from El Fasher has 
been missing since 20 May. The family reports that they were arrested to place pressure on the 
suspect to surrender to Military Intelligence. The family were not informed of the reasons why 
Military Intelligence is looking for the suspect. Although by 26 May all family members had 
been released, the two male family members released conditionally were re-arrested on 29 May 
when checking in with the police as required on a daily basis. The wife of the suspect was 
released on bail and is facing the charge of &#8220;concealing information about a suspect&#8221;. The 
victims lodged a complaint with the Prosecutor&#8217;s office in El Fasher on the grounds that the daily 
checking in with the police has disrupted their lives. The Police refused to investigate the case 
and advised the family members to comply with orders of the Military Intelligence, &#8220;even if it 
takes a year of daily checking in&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The headmaster of a school in Kalma camp was arrested and detained by the NISS for 
three days without being charged with an offence. NISS accused him of being a rebel 
commander and a member of a group responsible for mobilizing IDPs against the Government. 
On 21 December 2007, the man was picked up from his home and placed in an NISS cell. On the 
third day of his incarceration, he was brought before the NISS director and accused of stealing 
and being part of group which had threatened to attack Nyala. He was transferred to a Nyala 
police station and released on the same day without being charged with an offence. 
</p>
<p> Allegations have been received that on 27 April, NISS Zalingei arrested a 74-year-old 
INGO security guard, on suspicion of being a supporter of Abdul Wahid. During his 17 days in 
custody, the man was not brought before a competent judicial authority nor was he informed of 
the reason of arrest. The victim was released on 14 May 2008. 
</p>
<p> In Zalingei, a male IDP was subjected to severe beatings by local policemen while in 
police custody. The man was first &#8220;arrested&#8221; by a group of men from the Fallata tribe who 
accused him of fighting with their relative. He was severely beaten by the men before being 
taken to the local police station where a complaint was filed against him. While the police was 
undertaking their own investigation, the victim was subjected to further beatings by some of the 
policemen. He claimed that his hearing has been partially impaired after being slapped by a 
police investigator. HROs observed several bruises on different parts of his body including a 
swollen right ankle. 
</p>
<p> In Hileat, West Darfur, law enforcement agencies arrested three men including the Omda 
of Hilelat on suspicion of having ties with JEM. The men were arrested on 8 March, and taken to 
a Government military barracks in Kulbus. They were held for two nights and interrogated about 
their affiliation with JEM. On 18 March, two of the detainees were released without charge. The 
Omda remained in military custody in Kulbus for additional three days and was transferred to</p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 65 
 
</p>
<p>military headquarters El Geneina for further investigations on 21 March 2008. After two days in 
detention in MI headquarters, he was transferred to NISS detention facility in El Geneina where 
he was detained for a further 28 days. The Omda was released on 19 April without charge. 
</p>
<p> Between 10 and 24 May, the NISS in West Darfur have arrested at least ten civilians on the 
basis of their alleged association with the JEM, following the attack on Omdurman. The arrested 
include two women, a prominent lawyer, at least five Zaghawa IDPs and an Umda. There is 
concern that the arrest of the Zaghawa may have been linked to their ethnic origins rather than 
their demonstrated involvement in the Omdurman attacks. The HRT also received reports that 
several of the detainees were held incommunicado. On 27 May, the HRT met with the Acting 
NISS Director, West Darfur who confirmed that several of the detainees had been released while 
four remained in custody. The NISS Director also agreed to allow the HRT to interview the 
detainees after NISS has completed their investigation. Between 10 May and 23 of June, NISS 
officials in South Darfur have arrested and detained twenty-three people from the Zaghawa, 
Berti and Arab tribes on the basis of their suspected involvement in the attack on the city of 
Omdurman. The UN also documented some incidents of similar arrests in North Darfur. On 
27 May, a Zaghawa man who had been detained by NISS North Darfur for twelve days and was 
released without charge. Several reports were received that persons detained in relation to the 
Omdurman incident were subjected to ill treatment during interrogation. 
 On 11 May a Zaghawa man detained by NISS North Darfur for twelve days and released 
without charge. On 11 May, MI West Darfur detained a Massalit taxi driver for seven days. In 
both cases, the men were reportedly subjected to ill treatment. The Zaghawa man stated that his 
hands were shackled to his feet for several days and only released twice each day for personal 
needs. The Massalit taxi driver reported to HRT that he was repeatedly whipped by three MI 
soldiers and blamed for the attacks against the government in Omdurman. Although both men 
were released without charge, the security entities reportedly stated the releases were 
&#8220;conditional&#8221; and instructed the men to report every day to the NISS or MI respectively and not 
to leave the city.

<p> On 12 June, a 35-year-old Massalit man was arrested by NISS officers in Geneina. No 
reason was given for the arrest and the detainee has been held incommunicado since the arrest. 
The man, a trader from El Geneina, was first detained on 11 June by NISS for two hours and 
released on the condition that he report to NISS the following day. When he did so, he was 
arrested. The victim&#8217;s family members visited the NISS Office on three separate occasions to 
confirm the detention and to visit the detainee. On the third visit the NISS confirmed that the 
detainee was being held in their custody but the family&#8217;s requests to see the detainee were 
rejected by the NISS. UNAMID HR is also seeking to gain access to the detainee and to meet the 
NISS Director, but these requests have also been refused. 
</p>
<p> (iv) Abuses by rebel groups and armed militias 
</p>
<p> In April 2008, JEM rebels in West Darfur reportedly detained and tortured a 41-year-old 
Tama man who had been accused of spying on rebels. During an interview with the victim on 
11 May, the victim reported that he had been detained incommunicado for thirteen days and 
subjected to torture and ill-treatment, including: being hung from a tree and beaten, burnt with 
cigarettes, repeatedly beaten with a steel rod and being subjected to other forms of physical 
abuse. Bruising, burns, cuts and marks consistent with the victim&#8217;s testimony were observed. </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 66 
 
</p>
<p>The victim also stated that he is now deaf in his right ear and his thumb and forefingers are 
paralyzed as a result of the beatings. After receiving information that the victim had been 
detained, his brother registered the case at the Ardamata police station. Police also recorded the 
victim&#8217;s testimony after he had been released by the rebels. 
</p>
<p> Reportedly in Dereig IDP camp, South Darfur members of rebel factions namely 
SLA/Peace Wing and JEM/Peace Wing continue to perpetrate a variety of abuses against the 
IDP population since their arrival in the Camp in 2007. Reportedly, notwithstanding a 
Government judicial system in the camp, the two groups have established a parallel judicial 
system which they use to extort money from the IDPs with the complicity of Government police 
stationed inside the camp. IDPs that are unable to pay the court charges imposed by the rebels 
are prevented from settling dispute through the national court system. Once the court charges are 
paid, the rebels then arrest the alleged perpetrators and detain them until they are able to pay a 
fine for the alleged offence. Reportedly the feet and hands of detainees in the rebels&#8217; custody 
centre are tied with rope to prevent them from escaping. The IDP leaders added that Government 
police in the camp are aware of this practice and are reticent to register cases from the IDPs. 
Reports were also received of forced recruitment of children by SLA/Peace Wing in the camp. 
</p>
<p> On 18 January, a 20-year-old Fur woman from a village near Kabkabiya in North Darfur 
was reportedly assaulted and stoned in her house by three armed men in green khaki and 
camouflage uniforms. The men jumped over the wall of her house and demanded money. The 
victim refused to hand over her money and started screaming to attract the attention of her 
neighbours. The attackers hit her with stones and bricks before escaping. She sustained severe 
injuries in the head and a report was filed with the local police. 
 On 28 May 2008, MPFRD members arrested a 30-year-old Massalit IDP from his home in 
Masteri and detained him for two nights at the MPFRD military compound. The victim was 
severely and repeatedly beaten by three MPFRD members for approximately four hours each 
day. As a result of the torture/ill treatment, the victim reportedly sustained serious injuries on his 
back, head and legs. The victim had been accused of providing information and financial support 
to SLA associated with Khamis Abdallah. The victim is a butcher in the market and does not 
have any relationship with any rebel groups. On 30 May 2008, the victim&#8217;s brother was ordered 
to go to the MPFRD office in the market and to pay 100 SP for the release of his brother. The 
victim was released on the same day and allegedly threatened that if he reported the incident to 
the police or to the Human Rights Team he would be executed. Due to fear of reprisal, the victim 
did not seek medical treatment or report the matter to the police. 
</p>
<p>In Khartoum: 
</p>
<p> (i) Treatment and detention of combatants 
</p>
<p> The tens of people presumed to have been killed during the armed confrontation in 
Omdurman were either JEM fighters or armed government forces belonging to Police, National 
Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), Popular Defense Forces (PDF) and the Sudan Armed 
Forces (SAF). There are fears that both government forces and JEM combatants may have 
executed wounded combatants instead of capturing them. For example, official sources have 
reported that Jamali Hassan Jelaladin, a leading figure in JEM, was killed in armed 
confrontation. However, pictures of his dead body suggest that he may have been severely </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 67 
 
</p>
<p>beaten on his face prior to his death. According to reports in the Sudanese press, between 50 and 
300 JEM combatants have been captured. Two days after the attack, the Minister of Defense 
gave public assurances that captured combatants would receive a fair military trial. The number 
and whereabouts of captured combatants are currently unknown. Since 19 May 2008 UNMIS 
Human Rights has requested a list of captured combatants from the Government, as well as 
information on their whereabouts, and sought access to them. 
</p>
<p> (ii) Arrest of Darfurians following the JEM attack on Omdurman 
</p>
<p> The UN has records of some 450 detainees, most of them civilians of Darfurian origin, 
who have been arrested in connection with the JEM attack. The actual number of arrests carried 
out may be much higher. Large numbers of civilians appear to have been arrested arbitrarily on 
the basis of their ethnic origin or perceived affiliation with JEM, and are held without access to 
the outside world. Families have not been informed where their relatives are being held, raising 
fears that detainees have been subject to enforced disappearance. There are allegations of torture, 
and that the fair trial rights of those who may be charged with criminal offences in connection 
with the Omdurman events may already have been undermined. In a public briefing on 10 June 
criminal investigators announced that 113 suspects had been charged with criminal offences and 
transferred to remand custody, 20 had been released and 72 remained under investigation. The 
Rapporteur of the ACHR and Ministry of justice insisted that no detainee had been tortured and 
that those charged would be given access to lawyers. No information was provided on concrete 
measures taken with a view to upholding the rights of the detainees. 
</p>
<p> The majority of the arrests were carried out by NISS officers in Omdurman, in many cases 
during searches targeting neighbourhoods and individual houses inhabited by ethnic Zaghawa in 
which the male inhabitants of the houses were taken away. Arrests of Zaghawa men and other 
ethnic Darfurians have also been reported in other areas of Khartoum, as well as Darfur and 
other parts of northern Sudan. There are frequent incidents of members of the same family being 
detained. Some may have been arrested on suspicion of being associated with JEM because of 
their ethnicity or appearance. In some cases, those detained are known Darfurian activists who 
may have been targeted because of their political or public activities. Six detained Darfurians are 
members of the Popular Congress Party (PCP), among them a well-known human rights lawyer. 
</p>
<p> According to testimonies from released detainees, students were reportedly threatened in 
NISS detention that they should not return either to their universities or to their homes, otherwise 
they would be arrested again. Several students are known to have abandoned their studies and 
returned to Darfur for fear of renewed arrest. There are several cases of people being subjected to 
repeated arrests and several released detainees reported that they were threatened that they would 
be killed should they be arrested again. 
</p>
<p> In one such case, a student disappeared in the eastern part of Omdurman on the afternoon 
of 10 May. The following week police reportedly informed the family that he had drowned in the 
river and that his body had been found in the water three days after he died. Family members 
saw photographs of his dead body fully clothed but reportedly did not notice any signs that he 
had been submerged in water for three days, or any other physical sign of the cause of his death. 
They were reportedly told that the body had been buried but have received no information on the 
burial place. </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 68 
 
</p>
<p> On 3 June, the prosecutor announced that some 115 detainees had been charged with 
terrorist crimes and would be tried by a special court, in accordance with the 2001 law. Their 
names were not disclosed. As none of the detainees seemed to have had access to lawyers by this 
time, they may have been effectively deprived of their right to challenge the lawfulness of their 
pre-trial detention in court. A committee of lawyers acting on behalf of those detained after the 
Omdurman events made a request to the Ministry of Justice on 3 June in which they sought 
access to some 200 presumed detainees to ensure their legal defence. In light of fears over the 
treatment of detainees and their unacknowledged detentions, there are concerns about reports in 
the Sudanese media that several suspects allegedly recorded &#8220;confessions&#8221;, in the absence of 
legal counsel or other measures that would prevent the recording of forced statements. Lawyers 
requesting to visit the detainees at Kober prison on 11 June were reportedly denied access and 
told that, according to instructions by the Ministry of Justice, they would only be granted access 
to the detainees 48 hours before the trials.

<p> Human rights monitors documented several cases of <i>incommunicado</i> detentions. In the 
context of the conflict, Government security apparatus and proxy groups with no powers of

<p>Darfur: 
</p>
<p>(i) West Darfur 
</p>
<p> A 31 year old man from the Gimir tribe was arrested by NISS, held incommunicado for 
three days and subjected to severe beatings. The man was accused of having ties with Ibrahim 
Abaker Hashim, a suspected rebel leader and a rival of the Sultan of the Gimir tribe. The man 
was picked up from his office by three men in civilian clothes on 5 January 2008. They first took 
him to an NISS unofficial place of detention and later to another NISS office. He was kept for 
three days in a cell so small that he could barely stretch his legs and was made to sleep on the 
bare floor without any blanket. During this period, he was repeatedly beaten with a stick after he 
refused to eat the food provided him. After three days of interrogation, he was informed by NISS 
that his arrest was a mistake and that he had been arrested based on inaccurate information 
provided by NISS field officers. He was released but warned that he could be rearrested if the 
information he provided to the NISS turns to be incorrect. 
</p>
<p> On 6 January 2008, a 30-year-old Fur male living in Hamediya IDP camp was arrested by 
NISS in Zalingei at the checkpoint on the road towards Abata and Nertiti. An NISS official at the 
checkpoint confirmed to a relative that the victim had been detained by NISS in Zalingei. On 
16 January the Deputy Head of NISS Zalingei confirmed the arrest and detention of the victim, 
and informed that the victim was part of an investigation as a suspect in the October 2007 
incident in Hamadiya IDP camp in which some members of the military were killed by IDPs. 
NISS declined the request to see the victim and insisted that the victim was not allowed any 
visitors. The victim was reportedly released on 23 April 2008. 
</p>
<p> On 8 April 2008, ten SAF soldiers arrested and detained a 52-year-old man from 
Abu Suruj. The man was detained incommunicado for eight days without bringing him before a 
judicial authority. He was accused of being a rebel and associating with rebel groups. The victim 
reported that SAF beat him with sticks and whips during interrogation and throughout his 
detention, and was kept in a hole in the ground in the military camp for one day. He was released 
without charge on 15 April. 
</p>
<p> On 8 April, NISS agents arrested a 26 year old Zaghawa man at El Geneina airport, 
West Darfur. The detainee was taken to NISS offices in Geneina and held incommunicado. The 
detainee is an employee of Adala Organization for Environment and Development, an NGO 
headquartered in Khartoum and that the detainee was in Geneina to carry out field activities and 
to establish a branch of the organisation. NISS agents went to his brother&#8217;s house where they 
questioned him about his brother and searched his house and seized documents related to the 
NGO. NISS confirmed the arrest. They informed that the detainee was under investigation 
because the NGO was not registered. The detainee was released on 16 April. 
</p>
<p> On 8 April, eight civilians including two medical professionals were arrested in Abu Suruj 
town, West Darfur by SAF soldiers. No reason was given for the arrest, the detainees were held 
incommunicado. The local SAF commander confirmed the arrests and detentions of the civilian 
staff. He informed that the basis of the arrest was an order from Military Intelligence. The four 
detainees were transferred to Military Intelligence headquarters for further investigation and 
were released on 10 April without any charge. </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1

</p>
<p> On 10 April, UNAMID received confirmed information of detainee charged with several 
offences including &#8220;Waging War against the State&#8221; under Article 50 of the Criminal Act, 1991. 
The detainee was arrested on 28 February by military intelligence after he filed a case against 
JEM to Popular Defence Forces (PDF) for forced recruitment and torture. He was not informed 
of the reasons for the arrest. The detainee was initially taken to SAF military base in Kulbus 
where he was subjected to torture including being beaten with the butts of their guns, being 
drenched in cold water and suspended from the ceiling and interrogated about his association 
with JEM. After ten days, on 10 March, the detainee was transferred to a police station in 
Kulbus, West Darfur where he was informed that he was under investigation for several 
offences. The detainee was transferred to Ardamata prison on 14 March where he remains in 
detention. The detainee appeared in Geneina Special Court on 9 June, the case was adjourned 
until 23 June. 
</p>
<p> On 2 April, a 55 year old Zaghawa merchant, detained incommunicado by NISS agents in 
Geneina for 50 days was released after signing a statement that he would not support JEM and its 
leader, that NISS officers would be deployed to his home and shop to monitor his activities. The 
merchant was arrested from his shop by NISS agents on 13 February and taken to NISS office in 
Geneina where he was interrogated about his relationship with JEM, and its leader, 
Dr. Khalil Ibrahim. NISS agents accused him of providing financial support to JEM and sending 
Zaghawa men to the north to fight the government. The victim reported that he was subjected to 
death threats while in NISS custody. Reportedly, NISS agents would call him from his detention 
cell once a week and interrogate him asking the same questions, that they would be released if he 
confessed to providing financial assistance to JEM, and threatened to hang and kill him. On the 
19 day of his detention, the victim fell seriously ill. NISS agents took him to a local clinic where 
he received medical treatment. He was brought back to the detention centre but was kept outside 
in the passage of the cells, where he remained until his released. 
</p>
<p> Between 7 and 15 April, six Fur men were arrested at different locations by NISS agents 
and detained for allegedly painting anti-census slogans on public and private buildings in 
Zalingei town, and inciting the population against the census. Witnesses reported that the men 
were subjected to ill treatment and physical assault during their arrest. The detainees were held 
incommunicado throughout their detention, without access to legal representation or visits from 
relatives. Human rights monitors were also denied access to the detainees. Reports received 
indicate that the detainees, amongst others, suffered from ill treatment several evenings during 
their detention period. No charges were brought against any of the detainees. The six detainees 
were released on 10 July 2008. 
</p>
<p> On 1 June, National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) in Kulbus arrested a 
UNAMID local contractor who is Gimir by tribe, on charges of alleged involvement in the 
Omdurman attack in May 2008. NISS authorities reportedly detained him at the NISS detention 
centre in Kulbus for approximately fifteen days and then transferred him to Geneina. NISS 
authorities in Geneina and in Kulbus confirmed that the man has been transferred to Khartoum 
for further investigation. Although information is not available to assess whether or not the arrest 
was arbitrary, the man was detained incommunicado and did not have access to his family. 
Information available also indicates that the man was not brought before a judicial authority. </p>

<p>(ii) North Darfur 
</p>
<p> Two SLA/MM members held in custody by military intelligence were reportedly 
ill-treated. The two men were detained by military intelligence on 2 May at El Fasher&#8217;s airport 
tarmac, after travelling from Um Sidir to El Fasher by a UNAMID helicopter carrying injured 
persons. They have now been released, after 18 days in custody. Although the detention was 
reportedly carried out by military intelligence (one of the arresting officers was dressed in 
military uniform), the two men were held in the Security building in El Fasher. During their time 
in custody they stated that they did not receive visits from their families and were reportedly 
ill-treated by being whipped and by being forced to stand all night. One of them was also 
reportedly handcuffed for five days. They were questioned on the division of the rebel 
movements in the northern area and on the whereabouts of specific persons. Both of them have 
been released, one of them conditionally; he now has to report to the police every morning. 
</p>
<p>(iii) Places of Detentions 
</p>
<p> No access to places of detention in Khartoum-relevant for Darfur related detainees as there 
are transfers to the capital (either for trial or interrogation.) Human rights monitors were granted 
limited access to Government detention facilities in West and South Darfur. 
</p>
<p> In West Darfur, human rights monitors&#8217; visit to the State Prison at Ardamata, El Geneina 
on 3 April and the follow up visit on 8 April was the first general visit since 2005 since the 
Federal Ministry of the Interior prohibited visits to prisons under its jurisdiction by foreign 
organizations without prior personal authorization from the Federal Minister of the Interior. 
According to the prison officials, the prison had a total of 242 inmates, of which 19 were female, 
one minor aged 14 years detained on charges under article 130 (murder) of the 1991 Criminal 
Act, and two inmates suffering from mental illness. Human rights monitors were able to hold 
private interviews with individual detainees on this occasion. 
</p>
<p> In South Darfur, human rights monitors were given access to two government places of 
detention, Kass Prison and Kass Police Custody centre. In Kass prison, human rights monitors 
were informed that there were eighty seven inmates, all male, nine of whom were on remand 
awaiting trial. Human rights monitors were informed by the Prison Director that twenty five of 
the prison inmates had been transferred to Singita Camp, 29 km west of Kass to work; it is 
unknown whether the prisoners were paid for their labour. Human rights monitors observed 
extremely poor conditions in the prison; forty four prisoners shared two medium 4m x 7m and 
4m x 9m cells. In Kass police custody centre, human rights monitors observed two cells, 
reportedly for male and female. The male cell had five detainees, one of whom was a 12 year old 
boy and a man reportedly from Niger, detained on immigration charges. The Officer-in-Charge 
of the facility agreed with human rights monitors on the need to separate adults and child 
detainees and in the presence of human rights monitors, the Officer-in-Charge moved the child to 
the empty women cell. 
</p>
<p>(iv) SLA/MM Detention Centres 
</p>
<p> On 25 March, UNAMID visited SLA/MM controlled detention facility in Dar El Salam, 
North Darfur. According to information gathered, there were twenty three inmates; most were 
arrested for criminal offences and or the failure to pay blood money (diya). All the detainees </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
page 72 
 
</p>
<p>interviewed reported having been ill-treated and denied access to legal representation and have 
yet to appear before judicial authorities. UNAMID interviewed five of the inmates, one of the 
detainee informed human rights monitors that he was arrested on 27 December 2007 for theft of 
two camels. He alleged that he was severely beaten by SLA/MM members in the early days of 
his detention, that they tied his hands behind his back and periodically took him to the yard and 
poured water on him while insulting him. Human rights monitors interviewed two other 
prisoners chained together. According to the men, aged 30 and 31 respectively, they had been 
chained together since their arrest on 25 February for stealing 19 goats. Another detainee 
informed human rights monitors that he was arrested on 20 November 2007 for an alleged 
murder committed by his brother. 
</p>
<p> On 2 April, human rights monitors visited SLA/MM controlled detention facility in 
Zamzam IDP Camp, North Darfur and interviewed five inmates, one of whom was a minor aged 
13 years detained in the same cell with four adults. The boy reported that he was arrested on 
suspicion of raping a 7 year old girl at Zamzam IDP Camp on<b> </b>24 March. The SLA/MM 
Commander informed human rights monitors that the case was under investigation. All the 
detainees reported ill-treatment. They stated that they were denied food prepared and brought to 
them by their relatives, and that they were only allowed out of the cell once a day for toilet 
breaks. 
</p>

<p> The deteriorated security situation, carjacking and banditry targeting UN assets combined 
with logistical limitations as well as intimidation by Government security apparatus hindered the 
ability of human rights monitors to document cases of violations and to gain access to victims 
and witnesses. Government clearance for air missions have in some cases been delayed, and in 
some instances denied, further impeding the monitoring work of HROs. 
</p>
<p> Human rights monitors in West Darfur were unable to interview civilian casualties from 
clashes between government forces and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) in Kish Kish 
(15 km North West of Silea) on 10 April. At the hospital, HROs were obligated to register their 
names at NISS offices located inside the hospital compound and were continuously followed 
throughout their visit to the hospital. Also in Abu Suruj, West Darfur, human rights monitors 
were forced to abandon an assessment mission following intimidation from SAF soldiers based 
in the town. 
</p>
<p> Human Rights monitors in South Darfur have also been forced to abandoned interviews 
with victims and witnesses due to the presence of armed rebel groups. On 10 April, HROs were 
unable to conduct interviews with victims following allegations of serious human rights 
violations including torture, arbitrary detentions, and extortion of money by JEM/PW and 
SLA/PW inside Dereig Camp. 
</p>

<p><b>Information Received from Other Sources on Recommendation 1.6.1 
</b></p>
<p> In the absence of fundamental institutional and legal reforms, human rights defenders 
continue to operate in a restrictive environment and are regularly subjected to violations, 
especially due to the powers of NISS. 
</p>
<p> On 18 April 2008, a 31 year old human rights defender, an employee of a national NGO 
was arrested by officers from NISS at the Nyala-El Fasher check-point following an argument at 
the checkpoint. UNAMID HR obtained access to the detainee on 6 May, during the visit, a 
human rights monitor heard an NISS officer inform the detainee that, &#8220;<i>We could have released 
you today but this would be attributed to the UN&#8217;s interference, therefore, we will keep you for 
another week</i>&#8221;. On 19 May, the detainee was released on the conditions that he presents himself 
to NISS on a daily basis and not leave Nyala town. Additionally, during his detention, he 
reportedly spent two weeks in a two-by-two meter cell without any visits being allowed. Two 
days before his release he started a hunger strike which he believes accelerated his release. No 
charges have been filed against the human rights defender nor has he been provided with any 
explanations as to the reasons behind the conditional nature of his release. He fears being 
targeted by NISS and the pressing of criminal charges. 
</p>
<p> On 22 April 2008, Zalingei NISS, detained and intimidated a UNAMID Human Rights 
Officer. The Head of NISS informed UNDSS that the life of the HRO was at risk although he did 
not provide elaboration about the alleged threat. 
</p>
<p> On 5 May 2008 UNAMID HR received a human rights defender case that was referred to 
Amel Centre for Treatment and Rehabilitation of victim of torture. In March 08 the organization 
submitted application to renew registration for the year 2008 with HAC Nyala office. To date, 
HAC has not yet renewed the registration of the organization. Therefore the organization cannot 
conduct field missions outside Nyala, go to IDP camps and follow up on other human rights 
defender cases. </p>

</p>
<p> There were reports that human rights defenders working on Darfur-related issues in 
Khartoum were subjected to intimidation and harassment by the NISS, and in some cases 
arbitrary arrests. Among the hundreds of civilians arbitrarily detained following the 10 May 
rebel attacks on Omdurman were Khartoum-based Darfurian lawyers, journalists and political 
activists. Among them was Barood Sandal Rajab, a lawyer, prominent member of the Popular 
Congress Party and also the Secretary-General of the Darfurian Lawyers Committee. He was 
arrested from his home on 12 May by NISS officers and continued to be detained without charge 
and without contact with the outside world at the time of finalising this report. Barood Sandal 
Rajab had previously been detained three times between 2003 and 2006 because of his political 
and human rights activities. 
</p>
<p> Journalists who publicly expressed views critical of Government policy in Darfur were 
harassed and intimidated, and at least two journalists were arbitrarily arrested by the NISS in 
May 2008 and reportedly humiliated and ill-treated because of the views they had expressed in 
connection with the JEM attacks on Omdurman.

<p> No significant changes. On 22 May, following events in Omdurman, the Government Press 
Council imposed a ban prohibiting reporting/publishing statement of Darfurian rebel groups. 
Restrictions and enforcement of the National Press Law through seizure of all copies of a 
newspaper edition, daily inspections of newspapers offices and printing houses by NISS 
continues to be a common practice. 
</p>
<p> Journalists have been summoned by NISS in connection with their writing on the events. 
One journalist, who also heads a Darfurian journalist association, was reportedly arrested in 
Khartoum on 15 May and his whereabouts are currently unknown. On 14 May, <i>Alwan</i>, an 
Arabic-language newspaper was closed on orders by the NISS for allegedly disclosing sensitive 
security information, after it had reported about a missing plane and pilot. Other newspapers </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 77 
 
</p>
<p>have been subjected to tight censorship on reporting related to the Omdurman attacks. The 
Arabic-language daily <i>Ajrass Al Huriya</i>, for example, was prevented from printing and 
publishing on three occasions since the Omdurman events. On one occasion, on 16 May, NISS 
censors objected to seven articles in the paper, thereby preventing it from going to print. The 
NISS officials who objected to the articles reportedly told journalists that from now on the 
newspaper should stick to the &#8220;official line&#8221;. A journalist from <i>Ajrass Al Huriya</i> was summoned 
by NISS on 18 May after the censored articles had been published on the internet, along with 
criticism of the continuing practice of arbitrary press censorship by the NISS. He was held at an 
NISS office between 1 p.m. on 18 May and 2.15 a.m. on the following day and interrogated at 
length about his personal life and political views, subjected to humiliation and ridicule, and told 
that he should stop writing for Sudanese newspapers. Another journalist who works as a 
newspaper for the Arabic daily <i>Al Sudani</i> was detained by NISS for four hours in the late 
evening of 26 May because he defended an article which NISS officers had decided to censor. 
He was taken to an NISS office at 9.30 p.m. and kept standing for nearly four hours. He was 
reportedly forced to stand facing a wall with his hands raised and insulted as &#8220;dirty&#8221;, following 
which he had containers of cold water and sewage poured over his head.

</p>
<p> While occasionally, Government of Sudan authorities would publicly express support for

</p>
<p><b>Information Received from Other Sources on Recommendation 2.1.2 
</b></p>
<p> The number of security incidents affecting humanitarian workers and their assets has 
increased dramatically in 2008 in comparison to previous years. As of 27 July, 11 humanitarian 
staff members have been killed in 2008, compared to five during the first seven months of 2007. 
In the same period of 2008, 183 humanitarian vehicles have been hijacked, compared to 
85 during the first seven months of 2007. During these hijackings, 146 humanitarians were 
abducted so far in 2008 compared to 106 in the first seven months of 2007. Armed men assaulted 
87 humanitarian premises so far in 2008, compared to 50 in the period January to July 2007. 
</p>
<p> Humanitarian access in Darfur remains severely constrained, with access rates to the 
4.25 million conflict-affected populations just above 70% according to UN security standards. 
One of the solutions to offset the serious access constraints has been the increased use of local 
community workers and volunteers. The number of humanitarian workers in Darfur has 
increased over the past year from 12,300 to some 17,100, mainly due to this trend. However, a 
number of NGOs are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the implications of legal or 
other challenges by former employees, incentive workers or volunteers. The most serious </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1 
 page 79 
 
</p>
<p>challenge for many NGOs is that the concept of volunteers for non-profit organizations has not 
been recognized under Sudanese labour law and, as a result, NGO volunteers are treated as if 
they are full employees for &#8220;profit&#8221; organizations after they have completed three months of 
&#8220;employment&#8221;. Ongoing court-cases over pay for volunteers might force some NGOs with 
limited resources to decrease their operations.

<p> Several white aircrafts were spotted during the reporting period; none of them had any

Government vehicles in Zalingei, and white Government helicopters being used in South of 
Zalingei, in the localities of Wadi Salih and Mukjar. During a Government aerial attack on 
Abu Suruj, Silea and Sirba on 8 February 2008 Sirba, eyewitness reported the use of a 
White Antonov plane. On 26 March 2008, eye witnesses observed a white military helicopter 
flying over Silea and then proceeding to Kish Kish. A Government aircraft used to carry out 
bombing campaigns in late April and early May 2008 in North Darfur was a white Government 
Antonov, again bearing no distinctive markings, based in El Fasher. The Government also has a

</p>
<p> The Government reported that none of the hundreds of humanitarian workers in Darfur 
have been subjected to harassment and detention by the authorities January-June 2008. On 
22 June 2008 Susanna Malkora met with Under-Secretary of the Foreign Ministry and requested 
the Government for the increase of equipment convoys from El Obeid to Darfur and for such 
envoys to be escorted by the police. In collaboration with UNAMID seven police checkpoints 
were established on the outskirts of the city to help combating attacks and looting of 
car/convoys. The police succeeded in the return of 3 cars which were looted by rebels. The 
police in West Darfur were able to return a car belonging to Rescue Child organization in Kring 
locality. The police force chased the looters; a police officer and a police man were killed in the 
exchange of fire. Another incident at the Chadian border the police succeeded in regaining a car 
belonging to an American child organization. Five policemen including an officer were killed 
two suspects were detained with another car. 
</p>
<p><b>Information Received from Other Sources on Recommendation 2.1.4 
</b></p>
<p> Increased attacks on humanitarian targets and lack of assured overall safety for 
humanitarian workers continued to hinder the freedom of movement of humanitarian workers 
and placed civilians who depend on humanitarian services at increased risk. In some instances, 
vehicles were looted and the drivers and other civilians on board were abducted along with the 
vehicles. Thus far in 2008, there has been 120 hijacking of humanitarian vehicles, 51 attacks on 
humanitarian facilities and compounds, and 7 humanitarian workers killed. In addition, 28 WFP 
contracted drivers are currently missing. Among some of the incidents documented were the 
following: 
</p>
<p> On 1 January 2008 three national NGO (SUDO) staff members were arrested and detained 
by NISS at the Zalingei checkpoint on the road to Nertiti. The three staff members were 
transporting medicine in a civilian vehicle to Nertiti. The NGO met with NISS who promised 
repeatedly that the staff members would be released in few days and requested that 
UNAMID-HRT not to intervene. On 14 January 2008 an apology letter was written by the NGO 
in Zalingei to HAC Zalingei. In the letter the NGO stated that &#8220;they apologized for the mistake 
of not having a permit to take medicine to the Nertiti clinic, and that they would not repeat this</p>

</p>
<p>mistake again&#8221;. On 15 January 2008 at 5:00 p.m. the three staff members were released by NISS. 
The release was on the condition to report back to NISS on a daily basis, every morning for four 
days. HRT met with the Deputy Head of NISS, who confirmed that all three staff members had 
been arrested and detained for transporting medicine without license, in a non-INGO vehicle and 
on a holiday, and that they had been released after confessing and after the NGO had apologized 
for wrongdoing. 
</p>
<p> In the month of April, three human rights monitors&#8217; vehicles driven by HROs were 
hijacked by armed men. Two of the incidents occurred in Zalingei, West Darfur while the third 
took place in El Fasher town. In two of the cases, the vehicles were recovered in a damaged 
state. All HROs involved in the incidents were unharmed. 
</p>
<p> On 24 March, one WFP driver was shot dead and his assistant seriously injured by 
unidentified armed men while en route to Nyala, South Darfur. 
</p>
<p> On 13 April, a contract driver with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) was 
killed during an ambush by unknown armed men between Kurgi and Nyubu, two hours drive 
from El Daein, South Darfur. Again on 21 April, a truck driver with WFP was killed while 
transporting food 40 km north of Nyala town, South Darfur. His guard was also injured in the 
attack. 
</p>
<p> On 19 May a vehicle belonging to a humanitarian NGO was hijacked at Al Salam IDP 
camp. As a result, healthcare providers in the camp have temporarily reduced their presence in 
the camp until increased security measures are implemented. Armed men reportedly broke into 
an NGO compound in El Ferdous. Humanitarian missions from Ed Daein to El Ferdous have 
been put on hold. Two NGOs decided to relocate 19 staff members from Muhajiriya as a 
precautionary move following a report of attack in that area. 
</p>
<p> On 19 May three unknown armed men approached the office area of a UN agency and 
stole a car at gun point. On 21 May, five UNAMID peacekeepers were stopped at gunpoint by a 
group of 20 armed men on horses while returning from UNAMID Super camp (east of 
Ardamata) to the UNAMID military camp. Their belongings and three AK 47 rifles were stolen. 
</p>
<p> From January to July 2008, 12 humanitarian workers were temporarily detained by 
Government authorities in Darfur. One NGO international staff member was expelled by HAC in 
South Darfur for allegedly not cooperating with Government authorities.

</p>
<p> The Government has been committed to the enforcement of the Fast track Understanding 
which was signed in 2004 and renewed in March 2007 which allows for custom free aid 
requirements which amounted to 155 million dollars for the period January-June 2008. 
</p>
<p> During this period the humanitarian indicators have been positively on the rise. The 
malnutrition indicator has been declining from 21.8 in previous years to 11.9. Mortality rates 
decline from 75% to 35%, and mortality rate under 5 years from 1.3% - 77%. 
</p>
<p><b>Information Received from Other Sources on Recommendation 2.2.1 
</b></p>
<p> On 22 September 2007, the Government of Sudan finalized the General Directory of 
Procedures for NGOs operating in northern Sudan, based on the March 2007 Joint Communiqu&#233;, 
including special provisions for Darfur based on the Moratorium. The GDP, available in English 
and Arabic, outlines in detail all necessary requirements and may also be valid for 
southern Sudan if no other specifications are in place. Two joint committees, a High Level 
Committee and a Joint Tripartite Joint Committee involving Government, UN and NGOs, have 
been established to follow up on the implementation of the Joint Communiqu&#233;. In addition, 
OCHA trained Government officials and NGO personnel on the GDP, and installed a database at 
the Joint Procedures Centre (JPC). 
</p>
<p> On 22 January 2008, the Government of Sudan extended the Darfur Moratorium until 
31 January 2009. The Moratorium facilitates a series of fast track procedures to facilitate the 
humanitarian operations in Darfur. As the former Moratorium expired on 31 January 2008, HAC 
granted a one month grace period to allow NGOs to complete their paperwork. 
</p>
<p> However, various forms of harassment as well as access denials by different parties to the 
conflict continued to constrain humanitarian operations in Darfur. </p>

<p> A/HRC/9/13/Add.1

</p>
<p> In March, a special UNHAS flight to Birmaza was blocked by National Security at 
El Fasher. A number of NGO rented vehicles were denied access to Zam Zam camp by 
Government soldiers at the nearby checkpoint stating that they had received strict orders not to 
allow access to rented vehicles. Five SLA-MM soldiers forced an NGO team to transport them 
from Wana to Kafod, while suspected SLA-Unity elements stopped a UN convoy and stole fuel. 
A representative of an NGO was stopped by National Security in El Fasher and told that he could 
not stay in North Darfur as the NGO does not have programmes in the state. In West Darfur, 
local Government authorities are requesting NGOs to transport medical supplies in NGO trucks 
only. In Nyala, South Darfur, the majority of technical agreements are not processed by local 
authorities, which in turn cause delays in stay visas for expatriate staff and may result in fines for 
the NGOs. In addition, three UNAMID teams were temporarily obstructed by PDF forces 
between Shaeria and Labado, by SLA-MM elements at Zam Zam camp by SLA-Unity forces in 
Um Sidir. Armed confrontations between Government and SLA-MM forces in Tawilla, 
Shangil Tobayi and Zam Zam add to the humanitarian access constraints in North Darfur. 
</p>
<p> In April, local authorities in North Darfur continued to deny travel permits for NGOs 
travelling in rented vehicles. In West Darfur, local Government authorities were requesting 
NGOs to transport medical supplies in NGO trucks only. In Nyala, South Darfur, local 
authorities were slow in processing technical agreements, which in turn caused delays in stay 
visas for expatriate staff. However, most worrisome of all is that all nutritional surveys by NGOs 
and the dissemination of their results have been postponed or delayed pending clearance from 
the Government&#8217;s Humanitarian Affairs Commission. With waiting periods of up to four months 
before receiving permission to share results even informally within nutrition coordination 
mechanisms, the ability to mobilize appropriate responses in a timely manner is undermined. 
</p>
<p> In May, following the JEM attack on Omdurman, UN flights from Khartoum to Darfur did 
not receive Government clearance and airports in Darfur were temporarily closed for 
humanitarian flights. Humanitarian activities were particularly constrained in North Darfur, the 
northern corridor of West Darfur and the area north of Ed Daein (South Darfur). In North Darfur, 
the Wali issued a decree on 15 May, giving directives for the cessation of all UN and 
international organizations&#8217; flights in and out of El Fasher and the suspension of road travel 
outside El Fasher for both NGOs and UN. While UNAMID and UNHAS flights resumed as 
from 16 May, the road travel blockage effectively curtailed humanitarian access throughout the 
state except inside and around the major humanitarian hubs. The restrictions seem to have been 
eased as from 22 May, when some NGOs received travel permits to the Dar El Salaam area. For 
three months, local government authorities had already imposed access restrictions on 
international NGO staff travelling in rented vehicles. 
</p>
<p> In June, National Security refused for weeks permission to bring fuel into Kalma camp, 
resulting in severe water shortages, increased tensions and health problems. Although on 
26 June, NISS allowed small quantities of fuel into the camp, the problems persist and some 
IDPs have resorted to collecting water at the wadi. There is also a series of events which result in 
increased tensions in the camp, including the destruction of humanitarian facilities. In addition, 
the South Darfur Wali ruled out a food distribution to 8,000 registered IDPs living in Nyala town 
who had fled Kalma in October last year. These IDPs have been allowed only one food 
distribution since then. </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/13/Add.1

</p>
<p> In July, Government imposed restrictions continued to further erode humanitarian space. 
Ten UN and two NGO staff members were prevented by National Security at Khartoum airport 
from boarding a UN flight to El Fasher. In North Darfur, HAC informed NGOs of a new set of 
strict regulations before they can obtain travel permits when travelling in rented vehicles. Travel 
in rented vehicles is one of the mitigating actions taken by humanitarians to reduce the 
debilitating effect of hijackings. In Nertiti, four out of six NGO staff members were prevented 
from boarding a UN flight. The decision was later retracted as there had reportedly been a 
misunderstanding between different Government authorities, and the staff members were 
allowed to fly out the next day. In Geneina, two UN vehicles were stopped by Government 
police/National Security demanding travel permits. This is in contrast to HAC reassurances in 
the three Darfurs of continued cooperation with the UN and NGOs, and appeals to the 
humanitarian community to continue deliver services. An NGO was summoned by HAC in 
Geneina after they relocated their staff from Beida. 
</p>
<p> On the positive side, in July, a Joint Tripartite Technical Committee team has held training 
workshops in Nyala and El Fasher on the General Directory of Procedures for Government and 
NGO representatives. The GDP outlines the fast track procedures foreseen by the 2007 Joint

<p> In December 2007, Government restricted humanitarian access to rebel-held areas around 
Kutum (North Darfur). The restriction was lifted in January 2008, allowing the resumption of 
food distributions to 140,000 conflict-affected people in the area. In early January 2008, 
Government army staged a major military campaign and Government authorities banned all 
humanitarian access to the northern corridor of West Darfur. The ban was lifted after 40 days,

<p><b>Information Received from Other Sources on Recommendation 3.5 
</b></p>
<p> In South Darfur: The Appeal Court (Mahkama Estenaf) is the highest court in South Darfur 
State and consists of a five-judge court under the chair of the South Darfur Chief of Justice. With 
regard to the general courts (Mahkama El-Aama) there are just four general courts in the 
South Darfur State located in Nyala, El Daein, and Buram and Edd el Fursan localities. There are 
district courts (Mahkama El-Jouziah) in just six localities (administrative districts) out of the 
11 localities. According to him there are no regular courts (general courts and the district courts) 
in the following five localities in South Darfur State; Adila , Shearia, Tulus, Bahr El Arab and 
El-Salam localities. The last two localities are new localities based on the recent geographical 
administrative division. However, South Darfur Chief of Justice stated that they usually send 
judges on missions to the localities that have no ordinary courts. This means that about one-third 
of the South Darfur population has no access to the justice system for serious crimes except the 
tribal leaders&#8217; efforts to search for solutions for community problems through traditional and 
customary law. Serious crimes are beyond the rural courts mandate. Tribal leaders intervene in 
such cases based on their identity and role as tribal leaders. 
</p>
<p> The prosecution offices are not fully functional due to the conflict in Darfur, just like the 
courts. On 31 July 2007, the Higher Deputy (Prosecution office in Nyala), stated that there are</p>

</p>
<p>currently fifteen prosecutors in South Darfur State. There are nine prosecutors in Nyala and a 
further six prosecutors covering the following localities respectively: Rehad el Birdi, Buram, 
Edd el Fursan, El Daein, Adila and Kass.

<p> Human rights monitors were granted limited access to Government detention facilities in 
West and South Darfur. In West Darfur, the visit to the State Prison at Ardamata, El Geneina on 
3 April and the follow up visit on 8 April was the first general visit since 2005 since the Federal 
Ministry of the Interior prohibited visits to prisons under its jurisdiction by foreign organizations 
without prior personal authorization from the Federal Minister of the Interior. 
</p>
<p> In South Darfur, human rights monitors were given access to two government places of 
detention, Kass Prison and Kass Police Custody centre. In Kass prison, human rights monitors </p>

awaiting trial. Human rights monitors were informed by the Prison Director that twenty five of 
the prison inmates had been transferred to Singita Camp, 29 km west of Kass to work; it is 
unknown whether the prisoners were paid for their labour. Human rights monitors observed 
extremely poor conditions in the prison; forty four inmates shared two medium 4m x 7m and 
4m x 9m cells. In Kass police custody centre, human rights monitors observed two cells,

<p> No standing invitation extended to special procedures. The Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Sudan was invited by the Government to undertake two country 
visits to Sudan in March and July 2008. The Representative of the Secretary General on IDPs, 
the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Special Rapporteur on Food have 
requested to visit the Sudan. Dates for the missions are still to be agreed. In May 2008 the 
Government extended an invitation to Special procedures of the African Commission for Human 
and Peoples Rights to visit Sudan in August 2008. The regional mechanisms accepted the offer 
however the dates have not yet been agreed. 
</p>
<p> Between July 2007 and July 2008, 15 communications were sent from special procedures 
of the UN to the Sudan. The communications concerned a range of alleged human rights 
violations including adequate housing; arbitrary detention; freedom of expression; human rights 
defenders; torture; and summary executions. The communications concerned 289 individuals, 
8 of which were women. The government replied to one of the communications to inform that
