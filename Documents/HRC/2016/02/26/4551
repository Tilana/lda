New York from 20 to 22 September 2010, entitled &#8220;Keeping the promise: united to achieve 
the Millennium Development Goals&#8221;, and reaffirming in particular the deep concern 
expressed therein by the Assembly at the alarming global levels of maternal and child 
mortality and its grave concern at the slow progress being made on reducing maternal 
mortality and improving maternal and reproductive health, as well as the commitments to 
accelerate progress in order to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5 on improving 
maternal health, and Millennium Development Goal 8 on a global partnership for 
development,

<p> <i>Welcoming</i> <i>further</i> the information contained in the recent report entitled &#8220;Trends in 
maternal mortality&#8221;, released jointly by the World Health Organization, the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund and the World Bank, showing a

high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that increased political will and commitment, cooperation and technical 
assistance at the international and national levels are urgently required to reduce the 
unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,

<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the interactive panel debate on preventable maternal mortality and 
morbidity and human rights, held on 14 June 2010 at its fourteenth session, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that gender equality, the empowerment of women, women&#8217;s full 
enjoyment of all human rights and the eradication of poverty are essential to economic and 
social development, and that achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women is 
both a key development goal and an important means for achieving all of the Millennium

by age, geographical location, ethnicity and disability, in relation to maternal mortality and 
morbidity to ensure effective targeting of policies and programmes to address 
discrimination and the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized women and adolescent

programmes;

implementation of their human rights obligations, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for 
Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and 
Development and its review conferences, the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium 
Development Goals, in particular the goals on improving maternal health and promoting

morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and cooperation arrangements,

information and education and gender inequality, and to pay particular attention to 
eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls; 
</p>

the above-mentioned submissions, an analytical compilation that includes an identification 
of how such initiatives embody a human rights-based approach, the elements of these 
initiatives that succeed in achieving reductions in maternal mortality and morbidity through </p>


<p>a human rights-based approach, and ways in which similar initiatives could give effect 
more fully to a human rights-based approach; 
</p>
<p>11.<i> Decides</i> to address the analytical compilation requested in paragraph 10 
above within its programme of work at its eighteenth session, and to consider taking further
