<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the context of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
discrimination in this context, receives a large number of communications alleging 
violations of the right to adequate housing and related rights worldwide. Such 
communications are received from national, regional and international non-governmental 
organizations, as well as intergovernmental organizations and other United Nations 
procedures concerned with the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The present addendum to the annual report of the Special Rapporteur contains, on a 
country-by-country basis, summaries of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur to 
States, responses received from States, observations of the Special Rapporteur, and 
activities relating to earlier communications, from the period of 23 December 2009 to 6 
December 2010 and replies received for the period of 4 February 2010 to 6 February 2011. 
</p>
<p>3. Where appropriate, the Special Rapporteur has sent joint urgent appeals or letters 
with one or more special procedures of the Human Rights Council where the allegations 
raised concerned the right to adequate housing as well as rights addressed under other 
mandates. 
</p>
<p>4. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 24 
communications concerning the right to adequate housing to 16 States. To these 8 replies 
were received from 7 Governments. During the period under review, the Special 
Rapporteur also received 4 replies concerning communications covered in precedent 
reports.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur appreciates and thanks the concerned States for these 
replies. However, she regrets that several Governments have failed to respond, or when 
they have, have done so in a selective manner that does not respond to all the questions 
arising from the communication. These communications remain outstanding and the 
Special Rapporteur encourages Governments to respond to every communication, and all 
concerns raised in each communication. 
</p>
<p>6. As in the past a large number of the communications in the period under review are 
related to cases of forced evictions particularly in the context of city beautification, mega-
events or developmental projects. In most cases the persons affected belong to minorities, 
indigenous peoples or are persons living in poverty. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to remind all relevant actors that forced evictions constitute prima facie 
violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights and large-scale 
evictions can only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and in full accordance 
with international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur reminds all states that eviction should never result in 
rendering people homeless and putting them in a vulnerable situation. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds all Governments of the Basic principles and guidelines on 
development-based evictions and displacement (A/HRC/13/20/Add.1 page 5) that can be 
used as a tool to prevent human rights violations in cases where evictions are unavoidable. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the reports that the mandate continue to 
receive in regards to threats, harassment, and imprisonment of human rights defenders, 
community representatives and activists working on the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur believes in the importance of engaging in a constructive 
dialogue with States aimed at implementing and realizing the right to adequate housing. 
The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur have to be understood in this context. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>In a spirit of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur urges all States and other actors to 
respond promptly to the communications, to immediately take appropriate measures, to 
investigate allegations of the violation of the right to adequate housing and related rights 
and to take all steps necessary to redress the situation. 
</p>
<p>10. To the extent that resources available to the mandate permit, the Special Rapporteur 
continues to follow up on communications sent and monitor the situation where no reply 
has been received, where the reply received was not considered satisfactory or where 
questions remain outstanding. The Special Rapporteur also invites the sources that have 
reported the alleged cases of violations, to review cases and responses included in this 
report, and send, when appropriate, follow-up information. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of communications sent to Governments and 
replies received 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>11. On 25 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the 
Government of Bangladesh, inquiring about the alleged attacks on indigenous Jumma 
people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. According to the information received, 
on 4 March 2010 at Daine Bhaibachari village under Baghaichari Sub-Division in 
Rangamati district of the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh at least seven houses of the 
ethnic minority Jumma people and a UNICEF-run community school were set afire and 
burnt down by the military forces and Bengali settlers. It was also reported that police 
despite being in proximity to these events failed to intervene. The events of 4 March 2010 
continued a series of attacks which began on the 19-20 February 2010 at Sajek Union under 
Rangamati district, when Bengali settlers supported by the Bangladesh Army personnel 
sought to grab the lands of Jumma indigenous people. In the course of these attacks at least 
six indigenous people were shot dead and dozens were injured. According to the allegations 
received, between 200 and 300 houses belonging to Jumma people, including a Buddhist 
temple, were burnt as a result of these attacks. The affected villages are Guchchhagram, 
Gangaram Mukh, Hajachhara, Retkaba, Jaruichari, Dippara, Dane Bhaibachhara, Bame 
Bhaibachhara, MSF Para and Purbapara. On 23 February 2010 attacks began to spread to 
other areas of Chittagong Hill Tracts. Estimates from March 2010 indicated that around 400 
houses of indigenous people were destroyed, more than 2,000 persons were displaced and 
as a result many people were living in the jungle with no shelter. Jumma people, who had 
lived in the area for decades, have continuously protested the Bengali settlement on their 
land. The expansion of Bengal settlements into Jumma land reportedly resumed in January 
2010, within the Sajek area, Ragamati district, with the support of the army. The situation 
concerning the Jumma indigenous community was subject of a series of communications of 
different Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council sent to the Government. The 
Special Rapporteur reminded the Government of a communication her predecessor had sent 
to the Government on 3 April 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, to which the Government provided a response in a letter dated 14 
September 2009. She also reminded the Government of a communication sent on 5 March 
2010 by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, 
the Special Rapporteur requested further information on whether any judicial proceedings 
had been started against the perpetrators; on whether compensation and possibilities of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>temporary resettlement had been offered to the people whose houses were destroyed; on 
whether the Government had taken measures in order to protect the property of the Jumma 
from future attacks; on the measures that had been foreseen to ensure that the persons 
affected dol not become homeless; on the measures foreseen in terms of relocation; and on 
the measures that have been taken to resolve all standing land disputes in the Chittagong 
Hill Tracts, in accordance with the Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord. 
</p>
<p><b>  Replies received 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 6 April 2010, the Government of Bangladesh replied to the allegation letter sent 
on 25 March 2010, as well as to the communication No. AL Indigenous (2001-E) G/O 214 
(33-27) BGD 4/2010 dated 5 March 2010 concerning alleged human rights violations of 
indigenous communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), sent jointly by the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people concerning alleged human rights violations of indigenous communities in the 
Chittagong Hill Tracts. The Government specified that this was a preliminary response as it 
was waiting for more detailed information from the concerned authorities. The Government 
indicated that the incidents in the Rangmati Hill district can be traced to the confrontation 
between the tribal hill people and Bengali settlers in the Baghaichari sub-district and 
Gangarampur areas of the Rangamati district regarding some reserve forests and land 
disputes. Allegedly, on 19 and 20 February 2010, the two sides had engaged in skirmishes 
and burnt down houses. There were also attacks on the UN, the executive officer of the sub-
district and on the area commander of Bangladesh Army in Baghaichari. Members of law-
enforcing agencies, including the armed forces based there, had allegedly had to open fire 
as a result. According to the Government, 3 persons (two tribal and one Bengali settler) 
were killed while 2 Buddhist Bihars and 300 houses and shops were burnt during the two 
days incidents. The Government indicated that it had taken immediate steps to restore calm 
in the area and re-establish communal harmony between the conflicting groups, through its 
local administration and law enforcing agencies. The local administration declared a ban on 
public assembly by Imposing Section 144. The security forces stationed in the area also 
helped the local administration. The State Minister for CHT Affairs,  along with the 
Chairman of the Task Force relating to tribal minority refugees visited the troubled spots 
accompanied by officers of the local administration. This was immediately followed by 
visits by the State Minister for Home Affairs and Secretary of the Ministry of Home 
Affairs. The Minister met the local elite and representatives of both communities, assured 
them of proper investigation into the incident and gave directives to the local administration 
to distribute relief and compensation, including house building material and cash 
allowances among the affected people. The Government further indicated that cases were 
lodged following the incidents and police arrested a number of suspects. The Government 
also reiterated its commitment to its policy of &#8216;zero tolerance&#8217; against impunity and 
reminded that persons found responsible for instigating or committing acts of violence in 
the Chittagong Hill Tracts would be brought to justice. The Government added that it was 
able to bring back calm in the area. The Government reminded that in 1997, during the 
Government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, it was concluded the Chittagong Hill Tracts 
Peace Accord, in order to bring back peace, security and stability in the area. The present 
government resumed the process to fully implement the 1997 Peace Accord. As part of this 
process, a good number of military camps were withdrawn from the hill districts.. The 
functioning of Chittagong Hill Tracts Land Commission was reinvigorated with the new 
institution of the Head of the Land Commission, and more subjects were transferred to 
Chittagong Hill Tracts local councils. The Government further indicated that the Land 
Commission had been working on surveys to address land disputes. The Government 
further noted that it had always attached special emphasis to the socio-economic 
development of the people living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, with particular focus on the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>marginal and vulnerable groups, especially people belonging to ethnic minorities. In this 
context, more education and health facilities had been provided to the tribal minorities than 
their fellow citizens elsewhere in the country. Quota facilities had been given to the tribal 
minorities in higher educational institutions and government jobs; development projects 
and livelihood support have been taken up with tribal minorities as beneficiaries. The 
Government further informed the Special Rapporteur that it was planning to establish more 
schools, colleges, and university in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The Government was also 
planning to take up commercial, economic, and tourism ventures there to develop this 
resourceful region of the country.  
</p>
<p>13. On 18 May 2010 the Government provided additional information concerning the 
communication dated 25 March 2010 by the Special Rapporteur on housing and the 
Communication dated 5 March 2010 jointly sent by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people. The Government indicated that the 
facts as summarized in the Special Rapporteurs letter of allegation were not accurate. It 
further maintained that the land of Sajek Union in Baghaichari Upazila under the Rangmati 
Hill District is declared as Protected Reserve Forest, and that therefore, there is no private 
ownership of land in Sajek Union. Accordingly, some Chakma tribal and Bengali families 
had been living there illegally for the last few years. There had been an aggression between 
the Tribal and Bengali people for the ownership as well as possession of a piece of land of 
Protected reserve Forest at Baghaihat areas of Baghaichari Upazilla, and following this 
incident, there had been a clash between the Tribal and Bengali people in the area 
Baghaihat-Gangarammukh on 19 and 20 February 2010. The Government explained that 
the clash was due to a land dispute. A Tribal had sold to a Bengalese a piece of land but this 
was later disapproved by the Tribal Leaders who subsequently tried to get the piece of land 
back by setting up a local women NGO there, with a turmeric-crushing machine. This 
ended in a clash on the 19th and 20th of February in which dozens of houses of both Tribal 
and Bengali people were set afire, and two Tribal people died. Following the incidents, the 
State Minister for CHT Affairs and the Chairman of the Taskforce of CHT Refugee Affairs, 
and other state as well as local level police officials, administration officials, government 
representatives, elites and journalists visited the affected areas, on two occasions, 
requesting the people to live in peaceful coexistence, and distributing relief materials such 
as rice, pulse, potatoes, and salt to the affected tribal and Bengali families. They also 
assured the affected people that they would bring the culprit before trial with a neutral and 
trustworthy investigation. In March a third high level visit was organized and at that 
occasion locals were assured that all the distressed would be rehabilitated properly, and that 
the culprit would be punished. The Ministry of Relief and Disaster Management allocated 
200 metric tons of rice; 0.5 million BDT as cash relief; 02 million BDT as house building 
grants for house-repairing purposes; and 500 bundles of C.I. sheet for the victims of the 
circumstances of the incident on 19 and 20 February 2010.  In addition, a special VGF 
program was set up from March 2010 to May 2010 distributing 30 metric tons of rice to 
every affected Tribal and Bengali family of that locality.  The Ministry of CHT Affairs 
allocated 0.5 million BDT and 100 tons of rice as emergency relief to be distributed among 
the affected families.  Furthermore, a letter of demand was sent to the to the concerned 
authority for granting 85.32 metric tons of rice as a special VGF program from June 2010 
to February 2011, as well as an additional 500 bundles of C.I. sheet for the affected Tribal 
and Bangalee families. The Government indicated that on 4 march 2010, another incident 
occurred in which six open houses were burnt at Daine Bhaibachara of Sajek Union. After 
the incident, officials of Baghaichari visited the areas and talked to the locals. The case was 
investigated and it resulted that the incident had been triggered intentionally, in order to 
create chaos as well as to draw the attention of the government and get some extra benefits 
and relief. No one claimed the houses of their own, nor did they go to the local police 
station to complain about the incident. In response to the questions raised by the Special </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur, the Government answered that two cases have been lodged on behalf of the 
alleged victims at Baghaichari Police Station in Baghaichari Upazila, and that these two 
cases are under investigation. In addition, cases were under trial in the Court of Chief 
Judicial magistrate in Rangmatil Hill District.  Four accused were arrested in connection 
with these cases. The trial of the actual perpetrators would start following the investigation 
report, which was still not submitted at the time.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>15. On 20 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government 
of Brazil regarding the unconstitutionality claim submitted to the Supreme Federal Tribunal 
of Brazil concerning Decree No. 4887/2003.  According to information received by the 
Special Rapporteur, the Supreme Federal Tribunal of Brazil was allegedly going to initiate 
the judgment of the constitutionality of Presidential Decree No. 4887, of 20 November 
2003, which regulates the procedure for granting property titles to quilombo communities 
over the lands they occupy. The Decree lays down administrative procedures to regularize 
the ownership of quilombo territories. Thus, it establishes the modus operandi of the 
process to granting the quilombo communities the right to property enshrined in article 68 
of the Temporary Constitutional Provisions Act of the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 
1988, which consists of a reparatory measure aiming to compensate the historical debt of 
the Nation with communities affected by centuries of domination and violation of rights. 
Reportedly, Decree No. 4887/2003, was elaborated by a multidisciplinary expert group in 
consultation with a range of civil and quilombo organizations, in compliance with the 
Federal Constitution of Brazil and the relevant international human rights instruments to 
which Brazil is a State Party, such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the Convention No.169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples of the 
International Labour Organization, and the American Convention on Human Rights. Article 
216 of the Federal Constitution of Brazil recognizes these communities as part of the 
national cultural heritage, their identity, action and memory forming integral elements of 
Brazilian society. In that connection, Decree No.4887/2003 purportedly enshrines the right 
to property and to access to natural resources of the quilombo communities, as recognized 
in the Federal Constitution of Brazil. Reportedly, in 2004 the constitutionality and 
applicability of the Decree had been challenged before the Supreme Federal Tribunal 
(ADIn No. 3239) by the Democrat Party, with the support of the National Confederation of 
the Industry, the National Confederation of Livestock Producers and the Brazilian Rural 
Society. The Supreme Federal Tribunal was expected to deliver its decision concerning the 
constitutionality of Decree No. 4887/2003 in the short term. In this context, there was 
concern that a decision of the Supreme Federal Tribunal declaring Decree No. 4887 
unconstitutional would have regressively affected the housing and living conditions of all 
quilombo communities, as well as paralysed the national land titling programme being 
implemented according to the Palmares Cultural Foundation to benefit more than 1,400 
quilombo communities in Brazil. Furthermore, it was alleged that declaring the 
unconstitutionality of Decree No.4887 could have entailed the applicability of its 
predecessor, Decree 3912 of 1991, according to which quilombo communities were 
required to prove that they were descendants of the original quilombo fortresses right back 
to 1888, when slavery was legally abolished in Brazil. Thus, it could have allegedly 
reinstated unattainable requirements for granting land titles to the quilombo communities. It 
was reported that although legally recognized, the property rights of the quilombo </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>communities were secured only slowly, leaving them extremely vulnerable to forced 
evictions and threats by land owners, mining companies and development projects seeking 
to take possession of their lands and natural resources. According to the allegations, until 
December 2009 only 177 communities had been assigned ownership titles, which represent 
13% of the total of 1,408 communities listed by the Palmares Cultural Foundation in 87 
territories, which together comprise an area of 1,171.579 hectares. Out of this total, only 
eight property titles were allegedly issued by the current Government. For quilombo 
communities, traditional lands constitute a source of subsistence as well as a basis for the 
continuation of their life and cultural identity. The relationship with the lands they 
traditionally occupy is at the core of the spiritual and material life of quilombo 
communities. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the 
Special Rapporteur requested further information on the views of the Government 
regarding the compatibility of Decree no. 4887/2003 and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and the Committee for the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations

Government had not transmitted any reply to her communication sent on 20 May 2010.

<p>17. On 23 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Chair-
Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, sent a joint 
urgent appeal to the Government of China, in connection to the information received 
regarding Ms. Mao Hengfeng, a reproductive and housing rights activist who had petitioned 
against family planning policies and forced evictions since 1989. Ms. Mao Hengfeng, had 
been the subject of seven communications from various special procedures, the most recent 
being from 7 July 2008. The Special Rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Working Group 
acknowledged the receipt of a response from the Government dated 2 September 2008. 
According to updated information received by the Special Rapporteurs and the Working 
Group, on 4 March 2010, the Shanghai Municipal Reeducation through Labor Committee 
sentenced Mao Hengfeng to 18 months reeducation through labor. Ms. Mao had been held 
at Yangpu Detention Center in Shanghai, but following the information received she could 
had been transferred to a labor camp. Ms. Mao&#8217;s husband was not notified of any transfer, 
but his requests for visits were denied. On 15 March, Ms. Mao&#8217;s lawyers' request to visit 
her was also denied. At the moment of writing the communication her whereabouts were 
unknown. The Special Rapporteurs and Chairman of the Working Group expressed 
concerns about the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Mao Hengfeng while in 
detention in an unknown location. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of 
the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs and Chairman of the Working Group urged the 
Government to undertake all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms 
of Ms. Mao Hengfeng are respected, including appropriate investigations to clarify her fate 
and whereabouts and, in the event that the above allegations were correct, the 
accountability of any person responsible of the alleged violations. Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Working Group requested further information on: 
whether a complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victim; the details and 
results of any investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried 
out in relation to the case; the fate and whereabouts of Ms. Mao Hengfeng. </p>

<p>18. On 12 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the 
Government of China inquiring about the alleged forced evictions of residents of Shanghai. 
According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, in 2008, eighteen thousand 
families were forcibly evicted from their homes in Shanghai for the construction of the site 
for the 2010 World Expo, hosted by China. In addition, another four hundred thousand 
people were allegedly moved to faraway suburban areas as part of comprehensive urban 
development schemes which include the Expo, large infrastructural development, and 
market-rate commercial and residential development. Allegedly, residents were not given 
adequate compensation to relocate within the inner city, and were forced to relocate to the 
suburban areas where access to their workplace and livelihood opportunities was limited. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur suggested that in Shanghai, as of July 2010, two thousand 
households may have been evicted and their homes demolished for the development of a 
Disneyland theme park set to open in 2014. One of the evictees of Shanghai, Wang 
Yuchen, took his case to the local courts several times with a May 15 edict from China&#8217;s 
State Council which said people forcibly removed from their homes should get 
&#8220;reasonable&#8221; compensation and which held local authorities responsible for not 
&#8220;oppressing&#8221; people facing eviction. In compensation for Yuchen&#8217;s farm, the developers 
offered three separate apartments which together barely constitute half the size of his 
family&#8217;s villa with no land to grow food, and on which he would have to contribute a 
sizeable down-payment. The demolition crew responded to Yuchen&#8217;s protest by first 
bulldozing all the houses around the Wangs&#8217; home and piling the debris in front, then 
cutting off the water and the phone lines. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur cautioned 
that allegedly these types of forced evictions and demolitions with the aim to make way for 
real estate developments and infrastructure projects were not unusual in China. Allegedly, 
hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents were displaced and thousands of houses 
destroyed for the construction of 2008 Olympics venues. The demolishing process was 
reportedly not transparent or public, and victims received little compensation. Allegedly the 
relevant authorities did not engage in adequate dialogue with evictees, nor did they afford 
them with the appropriate consultation process, as there were no public consultations on the 
city&#8217;s planned neighborhood demolitions. Reportedly, Governmental authorities detained 
residents protesting against the evictions and their legal representatives. Furthermore in 
2005, the Supreme Court ordered lower courts to stop hearing cases brought by those who 
had been evicted, and the Government allegedly introduced new regulations restricting the 
ability of lawyers to represent groups of evictees. In addition to comments on the accuracy 
of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information 
regarding the number of people that were evicted from their homes in Shanghai to make 
way for the World Expo and the Disney theme park; the legal basis on which the evictions 
were carried out; whether or not complaints had been lodged by or on behalf of victims; the 
details of any investigation and judicial or other inquiries that had taken place; whether 
appropriate consultations had taken place with the affected persons; whether the affected 
populations were given adequate and reasonable prior notifications before the evictions; 
whether the affected persons were given adequate and reasonable time to withdraw their 
belongings and locate alternative accommodations before the destruction of their homes; 
what measures were foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the evictions would not 
become homeless; and whether the affected persons were offered adequate compensation 
for the loos of their houses and livelihood.

<p>21. El 15 de abril de 2010 la Relatora Especial env&#237;o una carta de alegaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n 
con los supuestos desalojos masivos sucedidos en los municipios de Olaya Herrera y 
Buenaventura. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, en el municipio de Olaya Herrera, varias 
comunidades del R&#237;o Satinga habr&#237;an sufrido dos desplazamientos masivos. El primero 
desplazamiento habr&#237;a sucedido el 10 de octubre de 2009 a causa de un aparente 
enfrentamiento entre las FARC-EP y la Infanter&#237;a de la Marina en el caser&#237;o de Pueblo 
Nuevo, afectando a ocho comunidades de afrodescendientes e ind&#237;genas durante dos meses. 
Durante este tiempo, las personas afectadas se habr&#237;an visto forzadas a abandonar sus 
hogares. El segundo desplazamiento se habr&#237;a producido el 31 de enero de 2010, afectando 
a alrededor de 300 ind&#237;genas Eperara Siapidara. Estas personas habr&#237;an tenido que 
abandonar sus caser&#237;os de La T&#243;rtula, Casa Grande y Robles, y refugiarse temporalmente 
en un paraje cercano a Bocas de Satinga, sobre el cual no se reportaron detalles. La 
Relatora expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por la situaci&#243;n de desprotecci&#243;n de las personas 
desplazadas y por el impacto de esta situaci&#243;n en el disfrute del derecho a una vivienda 
adecuada, en particular atendiendo a la situaci&#243;n de vulnerabilidad en la que se encuentran 
las comunidades ind&#237;genas y afrodescendientes. Respecto al municipio de Buenaventura, la 
Relatora Especial recibi&#243; informaci&#243;n seg&#250;n la cual al momento de enviar la comunicaci&#243;n 
se estaba implementando un plan de reubicaci&#243;n para las comunidades de los sectores de 
Bajamar, comunas 1, 2, 3, 4 y 5 ubicadas al sur occidente de la Isla Cascajal (en el 
departamento del Valle del Cauca). Este plan contemplar&#237;a la reubicaci&#243;n de 3400 
viviendas (alrededor de 22000 personas), mediante un Macroproyecto de Vivienda de 
Inter&#233;s Social denominado &#8220;Ciudadela San Antonio&#8221;. Despu&#233;s del traslado de las familias, 
en este sector se ejecutar&#237;a un proyecto de renovaci&#243;n urbana denominado &#8211;Proyecto 
Malec&#243;n &#243; Malec&#243;n Perimetral del Mar -, que valorizar&#237;a la tierra costera, le dar&#237;a un uso 
netamente comercial y dar&#237;a lugar a nuevos desarrollos inmobiliarios aparentemente 
contemplados en el esquema de mejoramiento integral del Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial 
del a&#241;o 2001, de Buenaventura. Sin embargo, los habitantes de los sectores afectados no 
habr&#237;an tenido derecho a participar efectivamente en este proceso de reubicaci&#243;n, ni habr&#237;a 
tenido lugar ninguna consulta previa. Asimismo, los habitantes aparentemente fueron 
notificados de tales planes en sus etapas finales, al momento de contrataci&#243;n de la 
construcci&#243;n. La Relatora enfatiz&#243; el hecho de que estos habitantes pertenecen a 
comunidades afrodescendientes que han ocupado hist&#243;ricamente estos territorios. Adem&#225;s 
de los comentarios sobre la veracidad y exactitud de las alegaciones presentadas, la 
Relatora Especial solicit&#243; mayor informaci&#243;n sobre las investigaciones y diligencias 
judiciales iniciadas en relaci&#243;n con el caso, las medidas adoptadas por el Gobierno para 
garantizar el derecho a una vivienda adecuada de los habitantes de los municipios de Olaya

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>24. On 1 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
of Egypt expressing concern regarding the situation in Manshiyet Nasser, an informal 
settlement east of Cairo, where 200 families were allegedly in imminent danger of serious 
injury or death because of a high risk of rock fall. According to the information received, 
among the families being at risk in Manshiyet Nasser were Zamzam Mohamed Abdel Nabi, 
aged 35, her husband Mohamed Hassan, and their two children, Alaa and Husssein who 
live in a building located at the end of Al-Me&#8217;adessa Street under the cliffs from which 
rocks were very likely to fall. Although geological studies done in 1997 by official bodies 
had identified Al-Me&#8217;adessa Street as dangerous, the families had not been evacuated to a 
safe place and were living in a constant fear for their health and lives. Allegedly, the 
authorities identified 13 unsafe areas inside the settlement where around one million people 
were living. Still, the residents were not offered temporary shelter or alternative housing 
despite several complaints they reportedly have submitted to Manshiyet Nasser 
Neighborhood police station, Cairo Governorate and the Egyptian Parliament. They could 
not afford to move to another place themselves because of their low incomes and their 
dependence on the informal economy in the neighborhood or in nearby old Cairo. Reports 
indicated that workers hired by authorities tried to secure the cliffs by breaking some rocks 
but it led to rocks falling on homes, and reportedly caused cracks in the walls of the nearby 
buildings. It was reported that in September 2008, a rockslide in the area of Al-Duwayqa in 
Manshiyet Nasserkilled killed at least 119 people and injured 55. This accident reportedly 
was followed with a series of evictions.  The reports received indicated that the potential 
evictees were neither consulted nor informed about the eviction in advance. For example, it 
was alleged that on 11 February 2010, three buildings on the Al-Me&#8217;adessa Street were 
demolished but their residents, without any prior information were ordered to remove their 
possessions immediately and were relocated to nearby Suzanne Murabak dwellings. The 
information received further indicated that more than 4000 families were relocated to these 
dwellings. The dwellings were reportedly full and some evictees were left homeless. At the 
same time those who were allocated accommodation were not given security of tenure in 
their new places of residence or guarantees that they would not be forcibly evicted again in 
the future. The residents still living in Manshiyet Nasser at the time of the allegation letter 
feared that the destruction of some buildings could have affected the structural safety of the 
remaining ones. In addition the residents were afraid that the authorities would have 
demolished their homes as well as relocate them &#8211; without consultation &#8211; to Al-Nahda, a 
new urban area about 30 kilometres north-east of Cairo and far from their sources of 
livelihood and social networks. In addition, the Special Rapporteur received information 
that the Government developed a plan to transform Manshiyet Nasser into gardens and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>tourist accommodation by 2050 and that the reported evictions could be linked to this plant. 
In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special 
Rapporteur requested further information regarding: the number of people that were left 
homeless due to their eviction from the Manshiyet Nasser; the number of people who live 
in the areas endangered by the rock fall in Manshiyet Nasser; the number of buildings 
affected; whether or not Manshiyet Nasser Neighbourhood police station, Cairo 
Governorate, and the Egyptian Parliament received the complaints submitted by the 
families living in Manshiyet Nasser and whether these complaints were dealt with in an 
appropriate manner; what the response was to these complaints by the institutions 
concerned; whether the people evicted from Manshiyet Nasser have been offered adequate 
compensation; and whether there are any other settlements in Cairo or elsewhere in Egypt 
where the life and health of the populations is endangered.

<p>25. On 5 May 2010, the Government of Egypt replied to the urgent appeal sent on 1 
March 2010. Regarding the number of areas at risk in Cairo, the Government replied that 
the Informal Settlement Development Fund, in coordination with the Governorate, had 
drawn up a list of at-risk areas in Cairo Governorate, using a system of classification based 
on the gravity of the risk. There were 16 areas and an estimated 8, 511 dwellings in 
category 1 (life threatening); 33 areas with 29,902 dwellings in category 2 (unsuitable 
housing); 3 areas with 5,571 dwelling in category 3 (health risk); and 1 area with 1,081 
dwellings in category 4 (occupants without legal title). Immediately after the Al-Duwayqa 
accident in 2008, three special technical committees were set up to study the cliffs of the 
Muqattam hill range, following Decision No. 3268 of 2008, issued by the Governor. Each 
committee was in charge of a different edge: one Committee was in charge of the Northern 
edge of the range (the Manshiyet Nasser area), a second of the southern edge and a third 
was in charge of the edge of the range in the Istabil Antar and Azbah Khayr Allah area. The 
Government explained that involved in this task were geology and geophysics experts, soil 
mechanics experts, mining experts, structural engineering experts, and experts from the 
Egyptian Mineral resources and Geological Surveys Authority. Their task was to prepare a 
full and comprehensive study of all areas at risk and delineate the features of thse areas. 
The studies entailed: a full survey of all parts of the Muqattam range; identification of the 
level of risk and of priority areas for attention; establishment of upper and lower limits for 
delineating safe areas; and establishment of scientific methods for blunting and containing 
the rocks. In its final report of March 2009, the committee reached the conclusion that the 
informal dwellings on the upper and lower slopes which were at risk should be demolished, 
taking due account of the level of geological risk, once the area at risk has been delimited, 
and that work should be done to blunt and contain the rocks on the slopes. Accordingly, the 
Governorate of Cairo began to demolish unsafe buildings in the Manshiyet Nasser, Istabil 
Antar and Old Cairo areas and to transfer the inhabitants to dwellings in Al-Nahdah City 
and 6 October City. At the same time work was begun to blunt the rocks in the areas 
specified in the report. The Governorate only demolished dwellings in areas where, 
according to the geological report, there was a risk to life or a very serious risk. The 
Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the situation as at the end of April 2010 
was as follows: approximately 10,000 dwellings in Minshayet Nasser were assigned in the 
new Al-Duwayqa (Suzanne Mubarak) project, in addition to some 1,880 dwellings in the 
Nahdah project, which included some of the areas at greatest risk in Ma&#8217;dasah Street, Wadi 
Far&#8217;aun and Shahbah; in Istabil Antar and the district of Old Cairo, a total of 1,950 
dwellings were assigned in October City and 300 were being assigned at the time of the 
response to the allegation letter; a total of 4,000 dwellings were built in 6 October city and 
were to be delivered in 2010; the State allocated 200 million Egyptian pounds for the 
delivery of 8,000 dwellings, which were being built in 6 October City at the time of the 
response; the Governorate of Cairo announced that it would complete the transfer of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>inhabitants from all at-risk areas by the end of 2010. Regarding forced eviction of 
inhabitants, the Government argued that According to General Comment No. 7, concerning 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was ratified by 
Egypt in 1982, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights defines &#8220;forced 
evictions&#8221; as the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families 
and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provisions 
of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection. The Government added 
that the allegation letter referred to the evacuation of the inhabitants of Al-Duwayqa as a 
case of forced eviction. According to the Government, the State had to evacuate the 
inhabitants of Al-Duwayqa as a matter of urgency, in order to transfer them from areas 
where their lives were at risk to safe residential areas provided by the governorate, namely 
Al-Nahdah City and 6 October City. The Government further noted that these areas are in 
the Cairo governorate, and are connected to a good transport network, which covers all 
areas. It also explained that these evacuations were a positive measure taken to protect the 
right to life in accordance with article 6 of the International Covenant on civil and Political 
Rights. The Government also noted that the dwellings where the inhabitants were 
transferred (in new Al-Duwayqa or 6 October City) had two bedrooms, a living room, a 
bathroom, a kitchen and a balcony (and a surface area of around 63 m3). The Government 
further noted that these dwellings were well built and have access to a full range of services 
(schools, markets, health and religious services, transport and places of employment for 
new residents). It also added that the beneficiaries were satisfied with all the facilities 
provided. According to the Government, this situation cannot therefore be referred to as a 
case of &#8220;forced evictions&#8221; and cannot be considered a violation of the &#8220;right to housing&#8221;. In 
terms of legal tenure with respect to the new places of residence, the Government informed 
the Special Rapporteur that the Governorate issued the residents with contracts granting 
them the right of usufruct in accordance with the relevant rules, including a lease which 
could be legally extended and which allowed the tenant to transfer the right of occupancy to 
relatives up to the third degree who live with them and to their descendants.

de logements situ&#233; au 92 rue Victor Hugo, &#224; Bagnolet, le 10 f&#233;vrier 2010 le matin. Cet 
incident serait intervenu &#224; cause de la vente de l&#8217;immeuble &#224; une filiale du groupe Auchan 
dans le but de le d&#233;truire et construire un immeuble neuf pour y abriter des logements. Une

logements depuis 10 ans, auraient &#233;t&#233; expuls&#233;es ce jour-l&#224;. Apr&#232;s leur expulsion, les

auraient &#233;t&#233; install&#233;es par les expuls&#233;s aux abords de l&#8217;immeuble en destruction dans 
l&#8217;attente de leur relogement. M&#234;me si des accords seraient intervenus avec la pr&#233;fecture et

premi&#232;re nuit au chaud, sans crainte de subir l&#8217;harc&#232;lement policier subi jusqu&#8217;&#224; ce 
moment. Les expuls&#233;s seraient en majorit&#233; des migrants d&#8217;Afrique de l&#8217;Ouest, dont parmi 
eux quelques personnes sans papier. Ils auraient &#233;t&#233; expuls&#233;s en plein hiver, sans ayant &#233;t&#233; 
au pr&#233;alable offerts un h&#233;bergement alternatif pour y rester comme mesure temporaire, et 
sans aucune offre de relogement imm&#233;diat non plus. La Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale a demand&#233; au

fran&#231;aise se m&#233;rite et il faut pouvoir s&#8217;en montrer digne. [&#8230;] Je souhaite &#233;galement que 
l&#8217;acquisition de la nationalit&#233; fran&#231;aise par un mineur d&#233;linquant au moment de sa majorit&#233; 
ne soit plus automatique. [&#8230;] nous subissons les cons&#233;quences de cinquante ann&#233;es 
d&#8217;immigration insuffisamment r&#233;gul&#233;e qui ont abouti &#224; un &#233;chec de l&#8217;int&#233;gration. [&#8230;]&#187;. En 
outre, selon les informations re&#231;ues, environ vingt mille Roms originaires de l'est et du 
centre de l'Europe vivent actuellement en France, pour beaucoup dans des campements non 
autoris&#233;s. Il n'existerait pas assez de lieux de halte autoris&#233;s pour les gens du voyage qui 
leur permettraient de conserver leurs modes de vie et leurs m&#233;tiers traditionnels. Les 
personnes vivant en caravane seraient contraintes de s&#8217;installer l&#224; o&#249; elles le peuvent faute 
de possibilit&#233;s r&#233;guli&#232;res. De m&#234;me, selon les all&#233;gations re&#231;ues, plus de dix ans apr&#232;s 
l&#8217;adoption de la loi imposant aux communes la r&#233;alisation d&#8217;aires d&#8217;accueil et de 
stationnement pour les gens du voyage, &#224; peine la moiti&#233; des places pr&#233;vues sur toute la 
France sont aujourd&#8217;hui ouvertes. De plus, environ quatre cents mille &#171;personnes 
itin&#233;rantes&#187; de nationalit&#233; fran&#231;aise, seraient contraintes de se pr&#233;senter r&#233;guli&#232;rement aux 
services de police. Elles seraient &#233;galement oblig&#233;es d&#8217;&#234;tre enregistr&#233;es pendant trois ans 
dans une municipalit&#233; avant de pouvoir voter. Enfin, il a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; fait &#233;tat de 
restrictions &#224; la libert&#233; de circulation et du refus de certaines communes de scolariser les 
enfants. Les Rapporteurs Sp&#233;ciaux ont demand&#233; au Gouvernement de leur fournir des 
informations d&#233;taill&#233;es au sujet de la situation &#233;nonc&#233;e pr&#233;c&#233;demment et de leur indiquer 
comment il entendait assurer la conformit&#233; des propositions de r&#233;forme annonc&#233;es en

internationales, notamment celles d&#233;coulant de l&#8217;article 5 de la Convention internationale 
sur l&#8217;&#233;limination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale, Les Rapporteurs Sp&#233;ciaux 
ont en outre demand&#233; au Gouvernement quelle &#233;tait la base l&#233;gale du d&#233;mant&#232;lement des 
camps des Roms et des gens du voyage, quelles mesures avaient &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;vues pour s&#8217;assurer

qu&#8217;avait-t-il &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;vu en termes de relogement. Les Rapporteurs Sp&#233;ciaux ont aussi 
demand&#233; au Gouvernement de leur faire parvenir des informations d&#233;taill&#233;es sur les 
mesures prises par les autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes, conform&#233;ment aux provisions concernant le

particulier pour s&#8217;assurer que les expulsions qui auraient lieu dans le cadre du 
d&#233;mant&#232;lement annonc&#233; des camps soient autoris&#233;es par la loi, soient raisonnables et

envoy&#233;e le 18 ao&#251;t 2010 par la Rapporteuse Sp&#233;ciale conjointement au Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial 
sur les formes contemporaines de racisme, de discrimination raciale, de x&#233;nophobie, et de 
l&#8217;intol&#233;rance. Le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que dans le communiqu&#233; de presse du Pr&#233;sident 
de la R&#233;publique fran&#231;aise dat&#233; du 28 juillet 2010, le Pr&#233;sident avait effectivement 
demand&#233; au Gouvernement de proc&#233;der, dans les trois mois, &#224; l&#8217;&#233;vacuation des campements 
illicites, mais qu&#8217;il avait soulign&#233; que ces &#233;vacuations devaient &#234;tre r&#233;alis&#233;es lorsque le 
droit en vigueur le permettait. Ce droit avait &#233;t&#233; expos&#233; par une circulaire du ministre de 
l&#8217;int&#233;rieur du 24 juin 2010 d&#233;crivant les modalit&#233;s d&#8217;application des lois. En ce qui

</p>
<p>qui vivent en France et qui a &#233;t&#233; mentionn&#233;e dans la lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation, le Gouvernement a 
indiqu&#233; que la France ne distingue pas de minorit&#233; ethnique, qu&#8217;il n&#8217;existe pas de 
recensement ethnique de population en France et que l&#8217;&#233;valuation la plus g&#233;n&#233;ralement 
avanc&#233;e entre 20 000 et 15 000 Rome originaire de l&#8217;Est et du centre Europe qui se 
trouveraient sur le territoire fran&#231;ais ne peut &#234;tre confirm&#233;e ou infirm&#233;e. Au sujet de la base 
l&#233;gale de l&#8217;&#233;vacuation des campements illicites, le Gouvernement a pr&#233;cis&#233; que ces mesures 
n&#8217;ont concern&#233; que des terrains ill&#233;galement occup&#233;s. Dans la plupart des cas, l&#8217;expulsion 
du domaine public ne peut &#234;tre ordonn&#233;e que par une d&#233;cision de justice. Si le terrain 
ill&#233;galement occup&#233; appartient au domaine public, la personne publique propri&#233;taire du 
domaine concern&#233; peut saisis le juge des r&#233;f&#233;r&#233;s du tribunal administratif comp&#233;tent pour 
qu&#8217;il ordonne la cessation de l&#8217;occupation au titre de l&#8217;article n L.521-3 du code de justice 
administrative. Il appartient au juge de rechercher si cette demande pr&#233;sente un caract&#232;re 
d&#8217;urgence et ne se heurte &#224; aucune contestation s&#233;rieuse. Si l&#8217;occupation porte sur une 
d&#233;pendance du domaine priv&#233; d&#8217;une personne publique ou encore sur le domaine public 
routier ou en dernier lieu sur un terrain ou un local priv&#233;, il appartient &#224; la personne 
propri&#233;taire ou titulaire d&#8217;un droit d&#8217;usage de saisir le juge judiciaire, en l&#8217;occurrence le 
tribunal de grand instance. Le Gouvernement a en outre indiqu&#233; qu&#8217;il existe aussi une 
proc&#233;dure administrative, applicable aux seules occupations de terrains par des r&#233;sidences 
mobiles. Ces dispositions ont express&#233;ment &#233;t&#233; d&#233;clar&#233;es conformes &#224; la Constitution par le 
Conseil constitutionnel qui rel&#232;ve que la mise en &#339;uvre par le pr&#233;fet de l&#8217;&#233;vacuation forc&#233;e 
des r&#233;sidences mobiles des gens de voyage est strictement pr&#233;cis&#233;e et encadr&#233;e par la loi et 
qu&#8217;elle ne peut survenir qu&#8217;apr&#232;s mise en demeure pour &#233;vacuer spontan&#233;ment les lieux 
occup&#233;s ill&#233;galement. Le Gouvernement a soulign&#233; que de plus dans tous les cas, le droit &#224; 
un recours juridictionnel effectif permet &#224; toute personne concern&#233;e de contester toute 
d&#233;cision administrative ou judicaire. En ce qui concerne le relogement, le Gouvernement a 
indiqu&#233; que une grande majorit&#233; des citoyens communautaires occupants ces campements 
illicites ont regagn&#233; leur pays volontairement. Les personnes &#233;vacu&#233;es b&#233;n&#233;ficient d&#8217;un 
droit inconditionnel &#224; l&#8217;h&#233;bergement d&#8217;urgence, quelle que soit leur situation au regard du 
doit de s&#233;jour en rance. Les personnes de nationalit&#233; fran&#231;aise ou en situation de s&#233;jour 
r&#233;gulier b&#233;n&#233;ficient des m&#234;mes droit au logement que toute autre personnes d&#233;pourvue de 
logement. Le Gouvernement a aussi abord&#233; le sujet du nombre de lieux de halte autoris&#233;s 
pour les gens du voyage suite aux pr&#233;occupations avanc&#233;es par les Rapporteurs &#224; ce sujet. 
Le Gouvernement a d&#8217;abord pr&#233;cis&#233; que l&#8217;all&#233;gation selon laquelle environ quatre cent 
milles personnes itin&#233;rantes de nationalit&#233; fran&#231;aise seraient contraintes de se pr&#233;senter 
r&#233;guli&#232;rement aux services de police serait inexacte. Selon la loi du 3 janvier 1969 relative 
&#224; l&#8217;exercice des activit&#233;s ambulantes et au r&#233;gime applicable aux personnes circulant en 
France sans domicile ni r&#233;sidence fixe, pour pouvoir circuler en France toutes les personnes 
de plus de 16 ans n&#8217;ayant as de domicile ou de r&#233;sidence fixe doivent &#234;tre munies d&#8217;un titre 
de circulation si elles logent de fa&#231;on permanente dans un v&#233;hicule, un remorque ou tout 
autre abri mobile et il leur est d&#233;livr&#233; des titres de circulation. L&#8217;obligation de d&#233;tenir un 
titre de circulation ne s&#8217;impose pas aux seuls gens de voyage. Ces documents sont valable 
cinq ans mais selon le titre de circulation octroy&#233; (ils existent trois types de documents 
divers en fonction du type d&#8217;activit&#233; exerc&#233;e), leurs titulaires doivent se pr&#233;senter aux 
autorit&#233;s chaque ann&#233;e ou trois mois. En ce qui a trait au projet de reforme en mati&#232;re 
d&#8217;acquisition et de perte de la nationalit&#233; fran&#231;aise, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que ce 
projet de reforme pr&#233;voit la possibilit&#233; de retirer la nationalit&#233; fran&#231;aise aux personnes 
condamn&#233;es pour les crimes d&#8217;homicide ou homicide involontaires commis contre les 
personnes d&#233;positaires de l&#8217;autorit&#233; publique. En outre le Gouvernement a pr&#233;cis&#233; que cette 
mesure n&#8217;est pas contraire au principe d&#8217;&#233;galit&#233; garantie par la Constitution et qu&#8217;elle est 
aussi conforme aux engagements internationaux de la France. En relation avec l&#8217;application 
de la loi relative &#224; la r&#233;alisation d&#8217;aires d&#8217;accueil pour les gens du voyage, le Gouvernement 
a indiqu&#233; que l&#8217;Etat accompagne financi&#232;rement les communes inscrites au sch&#233;ma

<p>31. El 5 de mayo de 2010 la Relatora Especial junto con el Relator Especial sobre el 
derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n enviaron una acci&#243;n urgente al Gobierno de Honduras en relaci&#243;n 
con la supuesta situaci&#243;n de creciente violencia y represi&#243;n en la zona del Bajo Agu&#225;n, en 
el Departamento de Col&#243;n, donde m&#225;s de 3,200 familias de campesinos hab&#237;an 
supuestamente sido amenazadas y hubieran podido resultar victimas de desalojos forzosos. 
De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, desde el 9 de abril de 2010 tropas militares y 
policiales se habr&#237;an movilizado masivamente en la zona del Bajo Agu&#225;n, amenazando en 
forma directa a las 3.200 familias de esta zona. En la informaci&#243;n recibida se expresaba 
temor que esta situaci&#243;n hubiera podido dar lugar a actos de represi&#243;n y desalojos forzosos 
contra los campesinos residentes en el Bajo Agu&#225;n. Tambi&#233;n se expresaba preocupaci&#243;n 
por la creciente violencia y represi&#243;n contra miembros y grupos del Movimiento Unificado 
Campesino del Agu&#225;n (MUCA) y del Movimiento Campesino del Agu&#225;n (MCA). En 
Octubre del 2009, miembros del MUCA habr&#237;an tomado tierras en el Bajo Agu&#225;n. Dichas 
tierras formar&#237;an parte de una disputa sobre tenencia de la tierra entre grupos campesinos y 
los terratenientes de la zona. En tal sentido, el 17 de abril de 2010 el Gobierno de la Naci&#243;n 
y representantes del MUCA firmaron un acuerdo que establece la entrega de 11 mil 
hect&#225;reas de tierra a 28 Grupos Campesinos del MUCA. El 9 de abril de 2010, 2500 
militares y polic&#237;as fueron movilizados en la zona de Bajo Agu&#225;n, donde la MUCA 
aparentemente discut&#237;a las propuestas recibidas en torno a las negociaciones sobre las 
tierras en disputa. El 10 de abril, fuerzas militares y de la polic&#237;a tomaron control de toda la 
zona, enviando efectivos militares y veh&#237;culos de combate y cortando el acceso a la 
cooperativa campesina La Confianza. El 11 de abril, la Cooperativa Guadalupe Carney fue 
tomada por las fuerzas militares y policiales. El 12 de abril, el acceso a todas las entradas y 
salidas al departamento de Col&#243;n fue bloqueadas, quedando bajo control de las fuerzas 
militares y policiales. El 13 de abril, la polic&#237;a y los soldados habr&#237;an entrado en la 
cooperativa El Despertar y detenido a Ulises La&#237;nez y Vicente Padilla, quienes fueron 
liberados luego de cuatro horas de detenci&#243;n. Los efectivos militares y policiales tambi&#233;n 
habr&#237;an entrado en la comunidad de R&#237;o Claro, cercana a la cooperativa, aparentemente 
irrumpiendo en tres domicilios e intimidando a sus residentes, incluidos ni&#241;os. Los hechos 
habr&#237;an ocurrido cuando estaba teniendo lugar la tercera reuni&#243;n de negociaci&#243;n entre 
autoridades y campesinos, y fueron interpretados por los campesinos como instrumentos de 
presi&#243;n para que acepten las propuestas antes mencionadas. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida,

tiempo en el norte del pa&#237;s comandos contratados por empresarios terratenientes habr&#237;an 
estado atacando a familias campesinas, quienes aparentemente no reciben protecci&#243;n alguna 
de las autoridades. Las alegaciones recibidas tambi&#233;n informaban que cuatro miembros del 
MUCA habr&#237;an sido v&#237;ctimas de violencia: el 17 de marzo, fueron asesinados Jos&#233; Antonio 
Cardoza y Jos&#233; Car&#237;as, directivos de la cooperativa Brisas de COHDEFOR, en Bonito 
Oriental; el 1 de abril, fue asesinado Miguel Alonso Oliva, por un guardia de seguridad de 
una de las plantaciones de palma africana en el Valle del Agu&#225;n; y el 7 de abril, Jos&#233; Leonel 
&#193;lvarez Guerra, integrante de la Cooperativa La Confianza, fue asesinado por dos hombres 
en motocicleta, cuando llegaba a su casa en el barrio Manga Seca, en Tocoa, Col&#243;n. 
Asimismo, el 14 de marzo fue asesinado el periodista Nah&#250;m Palacios, quien fue director 
del Canal 5 de televisi&#243;n en el Agu&#225;n. Previamente, Palacios habr&#237;a trasmitido vasta 
informaci&#243;n sobre el conflicto agrario en el Bajo Agu&#225;n, desvirtuando la campa&#241;a 
aparentemente emprendida para deslegitimar y criminalizar las luchas campesinas por la 
tierra en la zona. Adem&#225;s de los comentarios sobre la veracidad y exactitud de las 
alegaciones presentadas, los Relatores Especiales solicitaron mayor informaci&#243;n sobre las 
investigaciones y diligencias judiciales iniciadas en relaci&#243;n con el caso, las medidas 
adoptadas por el Gobierno para garantizar el derecho a una vivienda adecuada de los 
habitantes de la zona del Bajo Agu&#225;n, las negociaciones llevadas adelante entre el gobierno 
y el movimiento campesino, y sobre el acuerdo realizado el 17 de abril de 2010, las 
medidas de protecci&#243;n adoptadas en este caso, las medidas tomadas para garantizar que las 
personas afectadas no queden sin hogar, las medidas tomadas para garantizar el acceso y la

<p>34. On 13 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal letter to the 
Government of India, regarding the alleged situation of homeless in New Delhi, including 
deaths due to severe cold weather. According to information received, between 31 
December 2009 and 11 January 2010, at least seven homeless people died from cold in 
New Delhi. Concerns were also expressed that because of the weather and the lack of a 
sufficient number of equipped shelters, the life of additional homeless people was at stake 
in New Delhi. The information received indicated that the number of homeless persons in 
New Delhi was growing and exceeded the capacity of emergency centres operating in the 
capital. It was alleged that the number of homeless shelters in New Delhi had recently been 
reduced from 46 to 24, in disregard of the Delhi Master Plan 2021 and the Delhi Municipal 
Corporation Act 1957. It was further reported that despite the severe cold weather, 
homeless shelters were recently demolished and homeless people were evicted from the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>places they used as shelters. Allegedly, on 22 December 2009, the Municipal Corporation 
of Delhi (MCD) demolished a temporary night shelter for the homeless at Pusa Road, 
rendering 250 persons &#8220;shelterless&#8221; and allegedly causing the death from cold of Mr. 
Bhima. The information received indicated that this shelter was demolished by the MCD in 
order to &#8220;beautify&#8221; the area in view of the Commonwealth Games. It was further alleged 
that despite a 6 January order of the Delhi High Court requesting to immediately restore the 
Pusa Road night shelter and not to evict homeless persons in the winter on &#8220;humanitarian 
grounds,&#8221; the MCD did not provide the &#8220;shelterless&#8221; with an adequate shelter. It was 
alleged that on 9 January 2009, officials from the Northern Railway, the Delhi Police and 
the MCD evicted more than 400 people from an area they were using as shelter at Pul 
Mithai, Sadar Bazaar. Reportedly, during these events women and children were beaten 
with batons and the possessions of the people were destroyed. 60 of the evicted families 
were reportedly Dalits, many of them employed as construction workers for the 
Commonwealth Games. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information regarding the number of 
persons died in New Delhi due to the cold and weather conditions since 31 December; the 
measures that the authorities had taken to address the issue, including preventive measures 
to avoid these deaths; the measures that MCD had taken to implement the 6 January order 
of the Delhi High Court to take responsibility for protecting the rights of homeless persons 
in New Delhi; the needs of homeless and inadequately housed persons in New Delhi; the 
statistics, indicators, and other available figures on the number of homeless people in New 
Delhi; the type of shelters for the homeless that were in use in New Delhi; the grounds on 
which the number of shelters in New Delhi was diminished from 46 to 24, while the 
number of homeless had at the same time been increasing; the grounds on which the MCD 
allegedly demolished the temporary night shelter for the homeless at Pusa Road; the current 
situation of around 250 persons who were rendered &#8220;shelterless&#8221;; the measures, if any, that 
were undertaken to avoid the worsening of the housing and living conditions of the 
evictees; the measures that MCD undertook to implement the 6 January order of the New 
Delhi High Court requesting, inter alia, to immediately restore the Pusa Road night shelter;  
the grounds on which Northern Railway, the Delhi Police and the MCD allegedly evicted 
more than 400 people from the Pul Mithai, Sadar Bazaar area; the reason why the 
authorities did not comply with the 6 January order of the Delhi High Court requesting not 
to evict homeless persons in the winter on &#8220;humanitarian grounds;&#8221; the current situation of 
the evictees; and finally, what measures were undertaken to avoid the worsening of the 
housing and living conditions of the evictees.

<p>35. On 10 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government of India regarding the alleged evictions and demolitions of informal 
settlements and slums in New Dehli in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games. According 
to information received by the Special Rapporteur, New Delhi witnessed evictions and 
demolitions of informal settlements and slums in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games 
that took place from 3-14 October 2010 in the capital city. Most of these evictions were 
apparently carried out to construct roads, bridges, stadiums, and parking lots, or to beautify 
the city. In addition, beggars and homeless persons were allegedly rounded up, arrested and 
arbitrarily detained under the Bombay Prevention of Beggary Act 1959 in preparation for 
the Games. According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, in 2004, Delhi 
authorities evicted more than 35,000 families living along the banks of the river Yamuna to 
make way for a tourism and city beautification project on land adjacent to the 
Commonwealth Games Village. Settlements at Banuwal Nagar, Vikaspuri, were also 
allegedly demolished in 2006 in preparation for the Commonwealth Games. Reports 
indicated that evictions scaled up in 2009. On 12 January 2009, officials of the Municipal 
Corporation of Delhi (MCD) reportedly demolished the settlement of Gadia Lohar Basti 
consisting of around 15 jhuggies (slums), which resulted in the displacement of over 200 
people. The settlement was neither notified nor covered under any resettlement programme. </p>

<p>In June 2009, the MCD allegedly demolished a slum, inhabited by 50 people with 
disabilities, behind Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium to make way for a parking lot in preparation 
for the Games. According to the information, the MCD also reportedly demolished a 
settlement of 1,000 residents in J. Prabhu Market and Prabhu Market Extension near Lodi 
Colony for a parking lot for the opening and closing ceremony of the Commonwealth 
Games. A slum cluster of 368 families of Dalit Tamils at Jangpura&#8217;s Barapullah Nullah was 
also reportedly demolished to construct another parking lot for the Games. The Tamils, who 
had been living there for the past 35 years, did not receive any compensation or 
resettlement and were thereafter living on the streets. It was alleged that 400 jhuggies 
located near Barapullah Nullah were also likely to be demolished for construction of an 
elevated road that would connect the Commonwealth Games Village to the Jawaharlal 
Nehru Stadium. Modalities of resettlement had not been worked out yet at the time of the 
submission of the allegation letter. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of 
the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested further information on whether or not a 
complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victims; the details and results of 
any investigation ad judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the case; whether 
the appropriate consultations took place with the affected persons, and the outcomes of 
these consultations; the grounds on which the MCD allegedly demolished the slums; the 
situation of displaced persons; the measures that had been undertaken to avoid the 
worsening of the housing and living conditions of the people affected by the demolitions; 
the measures that had been foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the evictions and 
demolitions would not become homeless; whether the affected persons were offered 
compensation for the loss of their houses and livelihood; and finally, what had been 
foreseen in terms of relocation.

dated 5 March 2008 which was sent by the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on Violence Against Women (a summary of this communication can be found 
in the document A/HRC/10/7/Add.1, para.54). The Government of India noted that it has 
examined the complaint with regard to allegations filed by Mrs. Ramashree and found them 
to be inaccurate. According to the Government, Mrs. Ramashree&#8217;s husband was arrested on 
15 November 2006 at about 1900hrs in connection with manufacture of illicit liquor, 
following which a charge-sheet was filed in the local court on 26 December 2006. The 
subject filed a petition in the local court that was dismissed on 11 April 2008. Since the 
allegations were found to be inaccurate and even dismissed by the Court, the question of 
compensation for the subject did not arise.

<p>37. On 7 April 2010, the Government of India replied to the communication IND 8/2009 
sent on 20 July 2009 by the Special Rapporteur (a summary of this communication can be 
found in the document A/HRC/13/20/Add.1, para.37). According to the Government, on 
27-28 May 2009, the local authorities carried out demolition of only unauthorized hutments 
on public land. These demolitions were carried out in accordance with the due procedure 
laid down by the law and no incidents of violence were reported. According to the 
Government of India, contrary to what had been asserted in the communication, the 
Government of Maharashtra&#8217;s Slum Redevelopment and Relocation Scheme <i>was not</i> 
applicable to <i>unauthorized </i>hutment dwellers. The Government of India assured that it is 
aware of its obligations under the ICESCR and that it fully abides by them. In this context, 
the Government of India reminded that the General Comments of any treaty body do not 
constitute international human rights law.

<p>from 46 to 24. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi set up 37 additional night shelters in 
January 2010, over and above the existing 27 permanent night shelters. Further, the 
Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi also set up another seven temporary 
night shelters in January 2010, in addition to the 17 temporary night shelters that it had 
established, as a yearly exercise, in December 2009. The authorities provided over 2,800 
blankets for the inmates of these shelters who were also provided medical assistance, 
electricity, and water and sanitation facilities in association with some local NGOs. As for 
the demolition of a temporary night shelter on Pusa Road and evictions of squatters in 
Sadar Bazar, these were carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down by law and 
temporary night shelters were set up to provide shelter to those evicted. The authorities did 
not receive any reports of deaths due to sever cold weather at any of the night shelters being 
run by the authorities, or due to lack of such shelters. In fact, in its order on 27 January 
2010, the Supreme Court of India expressed its satisfaction with the prompt action and 
arrangements by the authorities to safeguard the human rights of the homeless and needy.

<p>39. On 29 July 2010, the Government of India replied to the urgent appeal sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 9 December 2009, regarding the alleged forced evictions along the 
Cooum River in Chennai, Tamil Nadu (a summary of tis communication can be found in 
the document A/HRC/13/20/Add.1, para.37). The Government examined the facts of the 
case and found the allegations to be inaccurate. The families living along the banks of the 
Cooum River had illegally encroached upon the riverine area, which had been declared as 
an environmentally sensitive area by the Supreme Court of India. Nevertheless, no forced 
evictions had been made and appropriate procedural protection was extended to all the 
project affected families. During the enumeration process conducted six months prior to the 
movement, all families had been fully informed of the resettlement process and their 
consent had been duly obtained. No formal complaint had been filed against any plausible 
forced eviction in this regard. The Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board was designated as the 
nodal agency for the rehabilitation and resettlement of the affected families. Alternate 
housing was provided to each family, on a non-discriminatory basis, in the suburbs of 
Chennai.  Each family was given Rs 1000 as shifting allowance and transport arrangements 
were made to carry their belongings to alternate accommodation. Moreover, vocational 
training was imparted to the unemployed youth in order to enable them to seek 
remunerative employment.

<p>41. On 19 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, together with the 
Independent Expert on Minority Issues and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophonia, and related intolerance, sent a joint urgent 
appeal to the Government of Italy regarding the &#8220;Nomad Plan&#8221; implemented in the 
Commune of Rome, which allegedly resulted in the eviction of hundreds of Roma and 
which would incur thousands of more evictions in the near future. According to information 
received by the Special Rapporteurs and the Independent Expert, the &#8220;Nomad Plan&#8221; was 
launched on 31 July 2009 by representatives of the Commune of Rome and the Prefect of 
Rome pursuant to a Presidential decree adopted in May 2008 declaring a &#8220;Nomad 
Emergency&#8221;. The plan was scheduled to be implemented by June 2010. The &#8220;Nomad Plan&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>provided for the forced evictions of thousands of Roma and the resettlement of most, but 
not all, of them in new or expanded camps. Reportedly, according to the census carried out 
in Rome, around 7,200 Roma were living in camps across the city, of which 2,220 lived in 
seven &#8220;authorized camps&#8221;, 2,750 in 14 &#8220;tolerated camps&#8221; and 2,200 in 80 &#8220;unauthorized 
camps&#8221;. The &#8220;Nomad Plan&#8221; allowed the relocation of 6,000 Roma in 13 camps which it 
referred to as &#8220;villages&#8221;. These &#8220;villages&#8221; allegedly consisted of maintained or expanded 
&#8220;authorized camps&#8221;, three expanded &#8220;tolerated camps&#8221;, two new camps and one transitional 
structure. However, it was unclear what would happen to those 1,200 Roma for whom there 
would be no place in the &#8220;villages&#8221;, since the rest of the Roma settlements would be 
destructed. Over the previous few months at least five different camps, including &#8220;Casilino 
900&#8221;, one of Europe&#8217;s largest Roma camps, had been closed leaving hundreds of Roma 
families homeless. The allegations received expressed concern over the eligibility criteria 
for lodging in one of the camps. Reports received indicated that official documents referred 
only to those &#8220;having the right&#8221; to a place but did not define who they were or what would 
happen to the rest of the people. It was reported that eligibility criteria would be based on 
possession of authorized residence in Italy. In such cases, evictions would allegedly be used 
as a punitive measure to force people to leave the country. On the other hand, there were 
reports that implementing authorities planned to determine who would have access to the 
&#8220;villages&#8221; based on whether the person under consideration had been involved in criminal 
activity. The information received alleged that thus far the &#8220;Nomad Plan&#8221; had been 
implemented without consultation with the people affected. Reportedly, the affected Roma 
communities lacked information about the plan and the way it would influence their lives. 
Neither Roma organizations nor NGOs working with Roma participated in the elaboration 
of the plan. Reportedly Roma communities were not given any alternatives - they either had 
to transfer to the new camps, or to become homeless. They also were not consulted in 
relation to how the resettlement should take place. Therefore there were fears that Roma 
communities would be resettled in the camps without regard to their family ties or national 
origins. In addition, the reports received indicated that the &#8220;Nomad Plan&#8221; would reduce 
people&#8217;s access to employment and essential services. Many of the &#8220;villages&#8221; would also 
possibly be more isolated due to a complete lack of public transport. There were also 
concerns that the children&#8217;s schooling would suffer because they would be forced to change 
schools or travel even further each day. The allegations received claimed that many Roma 
had to live in camps because they could not access the private housing due to the high costs 
of rent. At the same time, social housing was also unavailable to them, because one 
criterion for the allocation of social housing in Rome, under the concurrent points system, 
was prior eviction from private housing. Reportedly, the evictions from the &#8220;authorized&#8221; 
and &#8220;tolerated&#8221; camps were not treated as equivalent to expulsions from private sector 
accommodation for the purposes of determining access to social housing. In addition to 
comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs and 
Independent Expert requested more information regarding: whether or not a complaint had 
been lodged by the victims; the details and results, of any investigation, and judicial or 
other inquiries carried out in relation to the  evictions;  the legal basis on which the 
evictions had been carried out; whether or not the Government was aware that the number 
of Roma actually living in camps exceeded the number of Roma whose resettlement was 
envisaged pursuant to the &#8220;Nomad Plan&#8221;; whether the Government had designed a policy 
addressing housing needs of the people who had been and would be left homeless as a 
result of the implementation of the &#8220;Nomad Plan&#8221;; whether appropriate consultations had 
taken place with the affected persons; what criteria had been used for deciding who is 
eligible for resettlement; whether the affected populations were given adequate and 
reasonable prior notifications before the evictions and housing demolitions; whether the 
affected persons had been given adequate and reasonable time to withdraw their belongings 
before the destruction of their residences; what measures had been foreseen to ensure that 
the persons affected by the housing demolition,  would not become homeless; and whether </p>

<p>42. On 26 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, sent a joint letter of allegation to the Government of Italy regarding 
the alleged forced eviction of Roma families in Milan and the clearance of their settlements. 
According to information received by the Special Rapporteurs, on 9 April 2010, a 
deployment of 30 local police officers allegedly cleared three Roma settlements in Via 
Siccoli, Via Guglielmo Pepe and Ponte delle Milizie. More than 100 Roma citizens living 
in conditions of extreme hardship (among them sick and handicapped people, pregnant 
women and children) were purportedly charged with illegally occupying private land and 
forced to leave their makeshift shelters despite having nowhere else to go, or being offered 
any social assistance. The huts the families were living in were reportedly bulldozed, while 
the areas was due to be &#8220;secured&#8221; to prevent the Roma or homeless returning to the site. It 
was further reported that the local authorities adopted repressive measures against the 
Roma who were living in &#8220;authorized camps&#8221; and was allegedly planning to install twenty 
surveillance cameras over the entrances to the settlements in Via Triboniano, Via Idro, Via 
Chiesa Rossa and Via Martirano. The cameras would be linked up to police and Carabinieri 
stations to control the families living in the camp. Reportedly, the project initiated by the 
local authorities, had been approved by the City Police Chief and would cost an estimated 
of 479,000 Euros. In addition, 12 million Euros were apparently spent every year on 
clearing Roma settlements. The implementation of these policies reportedly caused a 
situation of extreme hardship and marginalization for more than one thousand Roma people 
in the area. In addition, on 21 January 2010, eighty makeshift shelters were allegedly 
bulldozed by the Milanese authorities. The huts were reportedly razed to the ground along 
with their contents: blankets, winter clothes, stoves for heating and essential medicines. The 
alleged forced eviction took place in Via Sant'Arialdo, near the Chiaravalle Abbey, where 
about 150 Roma citizens, including children, pregnant women and sick people, were 
purportedly thrown out onto the street. Furthermore, 95 Romanian Roma were reportedly 
charged with illegally occupying a plot of land and may be subject to mass expulsion as the 
authorities have allegedly ordered them to leave the city. In addition to comments on the 
accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs requested further 
information on whether or not a complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged 
victims; the provision of details and results of any investigation and judicial or other 
inquiries carried out in relation to the case; whether appropriate consultations had taken 
place with the affected persons; on what measures had been foreseen to ensure that the 
persons affected by the forced evictions and displacements would not become homeless; 
and on any compensation that had been offered to the affected persons.

<p><b>  Reply received

<p>43. On 23 June 2010 the Government of Italy replied to the allegation letter sent on 19 
March 2010. The Government noted that the operations of resettlement foreseen by the so-
called &#8220;Nomads Plan&#8221;, referring to Casilino &#8216;900, and evictions carried out by the Police 
Headquarters in Rome, including those of Casilino &#8216;700, and of Naide, Dameda and Via 
degli Angeli, have never foreclosed the possibility of finding a better accommodation with 
the Municipal assistance, except if so decided by the concerned persons. Regarding the 
&quot;<i>procedural deficit of consultation</i>&quot;, the Government noted that the Municipality of Rome, 
with the assistance of the Italian Red Cross, and the Police coordinated and cooperated with 
every person concerned the process of relocation in order to take into account their ethnic 
and family origin. Concerning the resettlement of Casilino &#8216;900, the Government noted that 
this cannot be defined as a &#8216;forced eviction&#8217;, as this eviction was carried out in compliance 
with all the procedural safeguards: adequate notice, consultation at various levels in all </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>stages, offering alternative accommodation according to the availability of the Municipality 
of Rome. In this context, the Government further indicated that the Roma communities 
were themselves well aware of the deteriorated environment in which they had been 
precariously living for many years and that in this context they were favorable to a 
relocation. As far as the schooling of children after the resettlement is concerned, the 
Government indicated that until the summer break, Roma children affected by the 
resettlement would have continued to be enrolled in the same establishments as before the 
resettlement. It added that after the summer break, every family, supported by school 
mediators of the Municipality of Rome, would have been able to enroll their children in the 
school of their choice within the appropriate <i>Municipio</i> (sub-division of the Municipality of 
Rome). The Government further noted that procedures similar to those mentioned above 
were followed for schooling also in cases of evictions that took place outside the 
framework of the &#8220;Nomads Plan&#8221; owing to the continued involvement of social and cultural 
mediators of the Municipality of Rome in the different operations. The Government 
informed the Special Rapporteurs and the Independent Expert that at the time of sending its 
reply, there was no evidence of any complaint submitted by or on behalf of the Roma 
people affected by resettlements or of any judicial investigation initiated with respect to the 
&#8220;Nomads Plan&#8221;. The Government further recalled that the affected persons were not 
entitled to stay in the occupied area since the settlements were illegal and that the evictions 
should therefore be seen as extraordinary measures taken in order to address situations of 
extreme degradation of sanitary and socio-environmental living conditions. The 
Government appointed a Delegated Commissioner for Nomads Emergency in the Lazio 
Region (by a Prime Minister Order of May 30, 2008) and the &quot;Regulations for the 
managing of the equipped villages for Nomad communities located in the Lazio Region&quot;, 
subscribed by the Commissioner, the Region, the Province and the Municipality of Rome 
have been subsequently adopted. The Government added that the so-called &quot;solidarity 
villages&quot; are structured to ensure the safety of the people concerned and to allow the 
implementation of programs of social inclusion through training courses, job orientation, 
school integration of children, health care and managing of the village involving the 
representatives of the communities. The Government explained that villages are not 
considered definitive accommodation but rather housing solutions that allow the 
implementation of the above mentioned programs of social inclusion and where possible to 
stay up to 4 years. As an alternative to placement in the equipped villages there are various 
regional projects, pursuant to which Municipalities should ensure the allocation of housing, 
social care and education, organization of training courses and job orientation, in order to 
facilitate the integration of Roma people into local communities. In the case of Casilino 
'900, the Government explained that families with people with health problems were 
provided for <i>ad hoc</i> solutions, such as the allocation of housing by the Municipality or 
destination to a specific structure instead of the village. The Government further noted that 
the relevant authorities appropriately consulted the persons affected by the resettlement of 
Casilino &#8216;900 camp. On 5 December 2009, a first communication was made in the camp, 
with the presence of relevant institutions (Mayor, Prefect, Councilor for Social Policies) in 
order to inform with sufficient time the beginning of operations. In a second phase, from 20 
December 2009, officials of the Municipality of Rome agreed with representatives of the 
camp on how to carry out the procedures. Finally, the information on the activities agreed 
upon was sent to each person concerned, in order to satisfy the special needs of people (for 
example in the case of vulnerable people). The Government noted that only individuals 
with very serious criminal history such as violence against children, rape, robbery, 
possession and trafficking of arms, trafficking and pushing of drugs, pimping, etc. were 
excluded from the resettlement plan. The Government further added that in light of the 
procedures adopted and of the time between the notification date and the beginning of the 
operations, it is clear that the affected person were given adequate and reasonable time to 
withdraw all their belongings before the destruction of their shelters. The Government also </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>said that considering the nature of the shelters no compensation for the loss of the &#8216;houses&#8217; 
was offered. In terms of transfer, the Municipality of Rome provided the logistical means to 
transport the affected people from the camp to the new village. The Government also 
informed the Special Rapporteurs and the Independent Expert that since the arrival in the 
village the continuity in education of minors and cultural mediation procedures (for 
example information about local services) were ensured. Finally the Government indicated 
that for EU citizens, the Municipality offered the possibility to voluntarily join the project 
&quot;Back Home&quot;, providing for their travel.

<p>45. On 23 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
of Kenya regarding the alleged planned eviction of more than 50,000 people living and 
working along the Kenyan railway lines, especially in Nairobi. According to information 
received by the Special Rapporteur, on 21 March 2010 Kenya Railways, a state-owned rail 
company, published a notice in the daily newspapers that people living and working in 
shacks within 100 feet on either side of the railway lines had to pull down their structures 
and leave within 30 days, otherwise they would have faced forced evictions and be 
prosecuted. Allegedly, the reason behind this measure was the Government&#8217;s willingness to 
upgrade the railway system. Reportedly, most of the people affected by this measure were 
slum dwellers in parts of Nairobi and other railway reserve land countrywide, who after 
living there for several years, had built up their homes and stalls they use to sell vegetables. 
These people, if forcibly evicted, were likely to lose their property, shelter and income. As 
a result, their access to clean water, sanitation and healthcare, already precarious, would be 
further negatively affected. In addition, a thirty-day notice did not allow enough time for 
people to explore resettlement possibilities. Moreover, according to the allegations 
received, prior to the issuance of the notice people had not been consulted with or offered 
alternative housing and other resettlement options. Reportedly, the Government did not 
announce any comprehensive resettlement or compensation plan. Reports received 
indicated that in response to similar planned evictions from the railway reserve in 2005, a 
study had been commissioned by the Government to develop a relocation action plan. The 
study, Relocation Action Plan for Improving Safety along Kenyan Railway Line (RAP), 
was finalized in 2005 and made publicly available in 2006. The RAP revealed that as many 
as 50,000 people were living or working within the reserve in Nairobi alone and many 
thousands more were using the tracks as a walking route to and from their homes. The Plan 
also emphasized the need to ensure an ordered relocation process, however it was never 
implemented and according to the information received, the Government did not intend to 
execute the Plan in connection to the situation at hand. In addition to comments on the 
accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested more information 
regarding: whether or not a complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged 
victims; the provision of details and results, of any investigation, and judicial or other 
inquiries carried out in relation to this case; any consultations that had taken place with the 
affected persons; the precise number of people who live and work along the railway lines in 
Kenya and therefore face the threat of eviction; the parts of Kenya which are affected by 
the Government&#8217;s plans to improve the railway system in the country; the measures that 
had been foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the forced displacement, would not </p>

Gobierno de M&#233;xico en relaci&#243;n con la informaci&#243;n recibida sobre las supuestas amenazas 
a un habitante de Lomas del Poleo en el estado de Chihuahua, norte de M&#233;xico, a manos de 
hombres armados contratados por una familia de terratenientes locales. De acuerdo con la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, la ma&#241;ana del 2 de febrero, siete hombres armados montados a 
caballo llegaron a la casa de Lomas del Poleo donde estaba viviendo Alfredo Pi&#241;&#243;n 
Valenzuela. Uno de ellos apunt&#243; a Alfredo Pi&#241;&#243;n con un arma y amenaz&#243; con matarlo. El 
grupo supuestamente trabaja para el terrateniente local que afirma ser el aut&#233;ntico 
propietario de la tierra de Lomas del Poleo. Alfredo Pi&#241;&#243;n Valenzuela hab&#237;a estado 
viviendo en casa de su vecina, Adelaida Plasencia Sierra, desde que &#233;sta fue atacada en 
diciembre por unos hombres que dispararon contra ella y le rompieron una costilla. 
Adelaida Plasencia, ante el temor a nuevos ataques, se march&#243; de Lomas del Poleo, y 
Alfredo Pi&#241;&#243;n se fue a vivir en su casa para asegurarse de que el terrateniente no la 
destruyera. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones recibidas, desde el ataque del 4 de diciembre contra 
Adelaida Plasencia Sierra, unos guardias de seguridad se hab&#237;an acercado a la casa de sus 
dos hijas y dici&#233;ndoles que la tierra no era suya. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, los 
habitantes de Lomas del Poleo llevan desde 2003 sufriendo acoso y ataques de hombres que 
aparentemente trabajan para un terrateniente local. Desde 2004, la zona est&#225; rodeada por 
una valla de alambre de espino montada por estos hombres, y el acceso a ella est&#225; vigilado 
por guardias privados de seguridad que trabajan para el terrateniente. En 2005, seg&#250;n los 
habitantes, los guardias de seguridad incendiaron 40 viviendas y mataron a golpes a un 
residente. Al momento de enviar la comunicaci&#243;n s&#243;lo unas 17 familias segu&#237;an viviendo 
en la zona. Seg&#250;n afirman los habitantes, pese a que han denunciado lo sucedido a la 
oficina local del ministerio p&#250;blico, no se ha llevado a cabo ninguna investigaci&#243;n seria. 
Seg&#250;n se informa, la tierra de Lomas del Poleo ha adquirido mucho m&#225;s valor desde que un 
grupo de empresarios empez&#243; a planear la conversi&#243;n de una zona cercana en nueva zona 
urbana e industrial. Al momento de enviar la comunicaci&#243;n, un tribunal agrario llevaba

Poleo, y durante ese tiempo los residentes de la zona hab&#237;an sufrido m&#225;s amenazas e 
intimidaci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, las amenazas eran un intento de intimidar a los 
habitantes de Lomas del Poleo para que renunciaran a su reclamo. Adem&#225;s de los

Especial solicit&#243; mayor informaci&#243;n sobre las investigaciones y diligencias judiciales 
iniciadas en relaci&#243;n con el caso, las medidas adoptadas por el Gobierno para garantizar el

<p>48. El 18 de mayo de 2010, la Relatora Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n al 
Gobierno de M&#233;xico acerca de informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la situaci&#243;n de la 
vivienda de las familias desalojadas para la construcci&#243;n de la represa Cerro de Oro en el 
Estado de Oaxaca, en 1972. De acuerdo con los informes recibidos, en el a&#241;o 1972, el 
Gobierno de M&#233;xico decret&#243; iniciar la construcci&#243;n de la presa Cerro de Oro para represar 
los r&#237;os Santo Domingo, San Juan Evangelista y Tesechoacan en el Estado de Oaxaca que 
se ubica al sur oeste del pa&#237;s. Los trabajos empezaron en 1974 y, a causa de varias 
interrupciones, terminaron en 1989. El lago artificial producto del embalse abarca 36 mil 
hect&#225;reas. 26 mil campesinos divididos en 37 ejidos, en su mayor&#237;a ind&#237;genas chinantecos, 
habr&#237;an sido directamente afectados por la construcci&#243;n de esta represa. Muchos de ellos 
pose&#237;an tierras de primera calidad, en las que produc&#237;an ma&#237;z, frijol, chile, ajonjol&#237;, tabaco, 
arroz, camote, de las que fueron desalojados. Las personas afectadas habr&#237;an sido 
reubicadas en varios municipios del Estado de Oaxaca y Veracruz. El Estado habr&#237;a 
desalojado por la fuerza a los residentes que se resist&#237;an a salirse de sus tierras y viviendas. 
Para construir los nuevos poblados, se habr&#237;a procedido al desmonte de 85 mil hect&#225;reas en 
dos a&#241;os, provocando una deforestaci&#243;n masiva cuyos efectos negativos contin&#250;an 
actualmente. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, hasta el momento en el que se emiti&#243; el 
decreto presidencial que formaliz&#243; la construcci&#243;n de la obra, los afectados no hab&#237;an sido 
informados de la misma ni consultados por las autoridades. En 1973 se cre&#243; el Comit&#233; de 
Reacomodo de la Presa, pero dichas informaciones indican que los afectados no fueron 
llamados a formar parte de este Comit&#233; ni fueron consultados sobre las alternativas de 
reubicaci&#243;n. En relaci&#243;n con el reacomodo, el Gobierno se habr&#237;a comprometido en aquel 
entonces a dotar a los afectados de tierras, construir caminos e infraestructura urbana en los 
poblados, pagar las indemnizaciones territoriales, bienes comunales y parcela escolar, y 
darles la posibilidad de explotar maderas finas. El pago de las indemnizaciones fue 
establecido a trav&#233;s de la resoluci&#243;n presidencial del 4 de abril de 1978, consistente en el 
acuerdo de pago de indemnizaciones territoriales, bienes comunales y parcela escolar. 
Seg&#250;n las informaciones, ninguno de estos compromisos fue cumplido o fueron 
insuficientes. Las obras de infraestructura urbana en los centros de poblaci&#243;n que se 
construyeron en el Valle de Uxpanapa habr&#237;an quedado sin terminar, y aparentemente no 
existen sistemas de drenaje, la red de agua potable es muy reducida, la luz se corta muchas 
veces al d&#237;a y los residentes viven hacinados. Asimismo, las viviendas no se adecuar&#237;an a 
las tradiciones o las necesidades de las comunidades afectadas. Respecto de las tierras, 
seg&#250;n los afectados, el 90% del suelo otorgado es agostadero (tipo de tierra generalmente 
&#225;rida) para la crianza de ganado, lo cual hace a estas tierras no aptas para producir lo 
alimentos que acostumbraban en el lugar de origen. A su vez, la zona no contar&#237;a con 
caminos ni con la infraestructura necesaria para la venta del ganado. El 10% restante ser&#237;an 
tierras para agricultura que incluye los cultivos de hule, palma, c&#237;tricos y ma&#237;z. Sin 
embargo, mientras cada hect&#225;rea de tierra originaria produc&#237;a 4 toneladas de ma&#237;z, cada 
hect&#225;rea de tierra otorgada en Veracruz produce solamente 400 kilogramos. Todo ello 
habr&#237;a forzado a las comunidades a modificar las formas de supervivencia, con profundas 
implicaciones en su identidad y cosmovisi&#243;n. Seg&#250;n los datos recibidos, la implementaci&#243;n 
de la presa repercuti&#243; en la destrucci&#243;n de la cultura chinanteca y en el empobrecimiento de 
las familias afectadas. En 1997, 18 mil chinantecos, que despu&#233;s del primer desalojo hab&#237;an 
sido reubicados en la ribera de la presa Cerro de Oro y Miguel Alem&#225;n, sufrieron un nuevo 
desalojo a causa del aumento del nivel de ambas obras. Seg&#250;n las informaciones, la 
poblaci&#243;n no fue debidamente indemnizada y sufri&#243; un aumento en sus niveles de 
pauperizaci&#243;n como resultado del desalojo. En 2005, una demanda judicial fue interpuesta 
por Juan Zamora Gonz&#225;lez en su calidad de Presidente del Consejo de Administraci&#243;n de la 
Uni&#243;n de Ejidos de Producci&#243;n y Comercializaci&#243;n Agropecuaria &#8220;Jos&#233; L&#243;pez Portillo&#8221;, a 
la cual pertenecen 25 n&#250;cleos agrarios en los que viven personas afectadas por la presa. La 
demanda por 3,500 millones de pesos interpuesta ante el Tribunal Unitario Agrario, del 
Distrito 40, con sede en San Andr&#233;s Tuxtla, Veracruz, solicita la indemnizaci&#243;n de las </p>

</p>
<p>tierras y la construcci&#243;n de las obras comprometidas en la resoluci&#243;n presidencial del 4 de 
abril de 1978 y en otros decretos presidenciales publicados en distintas fechas anteriores a 
</p><p>1976. Sin embargo, el 10 de junio de 2009, el Tribunal habr&#237;a resuelto que los actores 
carecen de legitimaci&#243;n procesal para promover el juicio, argumentando que el &#250;nico 
legitimado para promover el juicio es el comisariato ejidal de cada poblado y no la Uni&#243;n 
de Ejidos. El 18 de junio de 2009, la Uni&#243;n de Ejidos interpuso una queja administrativa 
frente al Tribunal Superior Agrario con sede en M&#233;xico DF en contra de Jos&#233; Lima Cobos, 
titular del Tribunal Unitario Agrario del Distrito No. 40, en la que da cuenta de una serie de 
expresiones ofensivas y racistas usadas por el Magistrado, que hace suponer a la Uni&#243;n de 
Ejidos la falta de imparcialidad en el an&#225;lisis del caso. Adem&#225;s de los comentarios sobre la 
veracidad y exactitud de las alegaciones presentadas, la Relatora Especial solicit&#243; mayor 
informaci&#243;n sobre las investigaciones y diligencias judiciales iniciadas en relaci&#243;n con el 
caso, las medidas de protecci&#243;n adoptadas en este caso, las medidas adoptadas por el 
Gobierno para garantizar el derecho a una vivienda adecuada de las personas afectadas, las 
compensaciones ofrecidas a las comunidades afectadas por los da&#241;os a sus viviendas y

<p>49. El 18 de noviembre de 2010, la Relatora Especial junto con el Relator Especial sobre 
la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas envi&#243; 
una carta de alegaci&#243;n al Gobierno de M&#233;xico en relaci&#243;n con el Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico de 
la Parota. En este contexto, los Relatores hicieron referencia al intercambio de 
comunicaciones que desde 2004 sus predecesores hab&#237;an tenido con el Gobierno de M&#233;xico 
en relaci&#243;n con el Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico La Parota. En particular, hicieron referencia al 
documento titulado &quot;Reflexiones sobre algunas implicaciones en materia de derechos 
humanos del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico de La Parota&quot; que sus predecesores emitieron a ra&#237;z 
de la visista que realizaron a M&#233;xico entre el 7 y el 11 de septiembre de 2007, y al

Gobierno de M&#233;xico en torno al documento &#8220;Reflexiones sobre algunas implicaciones en 
materia de derechos humanos del Proyecto Hidroel&#233;ctrico de la Parota&#8221;. En este contexto, 
llamaron la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de M&#233;xico en relaci&#243;n con informaciones adicionales 
recibidas acerca de dicho proyecto. De acuerdo con estas informaciones, en el transcurso de 
2010, hubo nuevas resoluciones judiciales que habr&#237;an ordenado la suspensi&#243;n temporal del 
proyecto hidroel&#233;ctrico de La Parota como medida cautelar. En particular, el 11 de abril del 
2010, el Tribunal Unitario Agrario n&#250;mero 41, habr&#237;a otorgado una medida suspensiva de 
car&#225;cter cautelar para evitar que la Comisi&#243;n Federal de Electricidad (CFE) u otra entidad 
realice obras tendentes a la construcci&#243;n de este proyecto hidroel&#233;ctrico. Seg&#250;n las 
alegaciones, a pesar de las resoluciones judiciales, el Congreso Federal (C&#225;mara de 
Diputados) habr&#237;a previsto la autorizaci&#243;n del presupuesto para la construcci&#243;n de esta 
presa hidroel&#233;ctrica. La CFE habr&#237;a en efecto incluido en el Proyecto de Presupuesto de 
Egresos de la Federaci&#243;n, en el apartado de inversiones y proyectos, un monto de 2,049 
millones de pesos mexicanos para la construcci&#243;n de dicha hidroel&#233;ctrica. El director de la 
CFE, habr&#237;a adem&#225;s p&#250;blicamente declarado que el pr&#243;ximo a&#241;o se licitar&#225; la construcci&#243;n

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>51. On 15 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
of Nigeria concerning the alleged plans of the Department of Development Control of the 
Federal Capital Territory (FTC) to evict and demolish homes of more than 200,000 families 
living in Lugbe, a suburb of the FTC located along the International Airport Road, Abuja. 
According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, the demolitions, previously 
scheduled to commence on 28 February 2010, were allegedly targeting non-indigenes in 
Lugbe and its environs. This latest trend of demolishing structures belonging to non-
indigenes in the FCT allegedly started in August 2009 following the demolition of &#8220;illegal 
structures&#8221; in Sauka, Todge, Gosa and many human settlements along that corridor. 
Reportedly, the potential evictees were not offered compensation, rehabilitation or 
resettlement due to the fact that they were not indigenous residents of the area in question. 
The demolitions may have affected over 200,000 families. In 1979, the FTC Authority 
adopted the Master Plan for Abuja according to which Abuja was to become a modern 
capital city. Reportedly, authorities argued that the FCT Act of 1976 did not envisage the 
influx of non-indigenes into these suburbs and that the Master Plan of 1979 stipulated that 
only those who stayed in the area would be recognized by the law as enshrined in the FCT 
Act of 1976. Therefore, authorities argued that non-indigenes would not be entitled to 
relocation after the demolition of their houses. However, according to the allegations 
received, a large number of residents had lived on the area for over two decades and had 
enjoyed uninterrupted possession over the years. The FTC Department of Development 
Control allegedly planned to carry out the evictions in spite of the agreement reached 
between the Lugbe community and a former FTC Minister which envisaged integrating the 
community into the Abuja Master Plan. Representatives of the Lugbe community claimed 
that they had presented a proposal to the FCT authorities that affirmed their plans to 
redesign the community into a satellite model village using their own resources and self-
help construction efforts. The Lugbe community reportedly contracted four banks and a 
private source and they confirmed their readiness to finance the project. The allegations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>received claimed that in planning the demolition of the houses and evictions in Lugbe, the 
concurrent FTC authorities disrespected the agreement Lugbe community had made with 
the FTC previous administrations. A series of mass evictions were reported in Abuja 
between 2003 and 2007 in an attempt to restore what the authorities allegedly termed as 
restoration of the original Abuja Master Plan. Consequently, an estimated 800.000 people 
lost their homes, schools, worship places and businesses. Some of the evictions were 
reportedly accompanied by massive human rights violations and violence perpetrated by 
heavily armed security forces against the residents and business owners. In addition to 
comments on the accuracy of the facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested 
more information regarding: whether or not a complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of 
the alleged victims; the details and results of any investigation, and judicial or other 
inquiries carried out in relation to this evictions and demolitions; whether the 
implementation of the Abuja Master Plan required people living in Lugbe to be evicted and 
if so, whether the plan provided for the resettlement or any other kind of compensation to 
the people who were evicted from their homes as a result of its implementation; whether the 
FTC authorities respected these provisions; whether there was any other place apart from 
Lugbe within the FTC where people were evicted from their homes; whether the 
Government was aware of the existence of the agreement between the Lugbe community 
and the former FTC administration; whether any measure had been foreseen to ensure that 
the persons affected by the housing destruction, would not become homeless; and what 
measures were foreseen in terms of relocation.

Government had not transmitted any reply to this communication.

<p><b>  Papua New Guinea  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>53. On 26 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the 
Government of Papua New Guinea, inquiring more information about alleged forced 
evictions and police brutality around the area of Porgera Gold Mine, in Papua New Guinea, 
between April and July 2009, and the lack of police or judicial investigation thereof. 
According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, in the area of Porgera Gold 
Mine, specifically in the villages of Wuangima, Kulapi and Mungalep, police officers had 
illegally and forcibly evicted people from their homes, including pregnant women, children 
and the elderly, by destroying their houses. Moreover, there was significant evidence 
proving that police used excessive force during police raids within the Special Mining 
Lease (SLM) area where the villages were, aiming firearms at residents and threatening 
them while destroying their property and burning their houses. On 27 April 2009, the 
Mobile Squad police allegedly entered Wuangima from several points, and proceeded to set 
fire to houses while being heavily armed. At least 130 buildings were destroyed, this being 
the most affected village. There was also evidence that police fired their weapons at or near 
the residents, and killed their animals, including valuable livestock. On around 21 May 
2009, police armed with rifles also destroyed several houses in Kulapi, a well-established 
village immediately next to the open pit on the opposite side to Wuangima. Arms were used 
to point neighbours, in order to intimidate them. On 23 June 2009, around 3am, police 
forces allegedly entered a house and beat a man and his son in front of the rest of the family 
members, including children, in the village of Mungalep, within the SLM area. Allegations 
indicated that the evictions were undertaken without prior notice or consultation with the 
affected persons, in breach of the terms of search warrants issued by the District Court at 
Porgera. Moreover, no alternative accommodation, food or other assistance was provided to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>the victims. The affected persons were reportedly dependent on their relatives for shelter, 
and living in cramped conditions. Concerns were also expressed regarding ongoing support 
to the police by companies involved in the mine after the companies became aware of the 
police activity in the area. The mine was reportedly 95% owned and operated by 
subsidiaries of Canadian-based Barrick Gold Corporation, as part of the Porgera Joint 
Venture (PJV). PJV allegedly provided accommodation, food and fuel to the police 
operation during the forced evictions and has continued to do so. Reportedly, by the time 
the allegation letter was sent the governmental authorities in Papua New Guinea had not 
carried out any investigation into the police activities around the Porgera mine, prosecuted 
those responsible for human rights, or provided remedies to those affected. Furthermore, 
allegations indicated that on 4 February 2010, Papua&#8217;s New Guinea&#8217;s Police Commissioner 
reportedly dismissed evidence of forced evictions of people living near the Porgera gold 
mine and police violence as &#8220;fabricated&#8221;. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the 
facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested more information regarding: 
whether or not any complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victims; the 
details and results, of any  investigation, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to this evictions and demolitions; the legal basis on which the evictions were 
carried out; the number of people that were affected by the evictions; whether appropriate 
consultations had taken place with the affected persons; whether the affected populations 
were given adequate and reasonable prior notifications before the evictions; the measures 
that had been foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the evictions, would not 
become homeless; whether the affected persons had been offered compensation for the loss 
of their houses and livelihood; and what had been foreseen in terms of relocation.

<p>55. El 21 de abril de 2010 la Relatora Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n al Gobierno 
de Per&#250; en relaci&#243;n con la supuesta demolici&#243;n de viviendas en el barrio denominado 
Barrios Altos, distrito de Cercado de Lima. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 2 de febrero 
de 2010, el conjunto de moradores que comparten su vivienda con la &quot;Canchita Buenos 
Aires&quot; en Barrios Altos, denunciaron la llegada al terreno de personas extra&#241;as con 
maquinaria pesada para derribar muros e iniciar desalojos. Los desalojos se habr&#237;an 
producido sin contar con una sentencia de desalojo, ni licencia de demolici&#243;n. Los vecinos 
tambi&#233;n denunciaron la presencia de cerca de medio centenar de matones en el lugar. El 
terreno afectado se ubica en la cuadra 9 de Jr. Huanuco, al borde de la Plaza Buenos Aires y 
vecino al Hospital 2 de Mayo, y es parte del legendario patrimonio monumental de Barrios 
Altos. 63 familias que viven en los inmuebles ubicados en el Jr. Huanuco 903 y 917 de 
Barrios Altos se ver&#237;an afectadas por estos desalojos. Los desalojos y demoliciones estar&#237;an 
perturbando la salud f&#237;sica y mental de los habitantes del barrio, con recursos muy limitados 
para proveerse de otro medio habitable en el que residir. En fecha de 22 de septiembre de 
2009, la Pontificia Universidad Cat&#243;lica de Per&#250; habr&#237;a vendido el terreno del cual es 
propietaria, ubicado frente al Jr. Huanuco &#8211; Calle Cocharcas n&#186; 917, Barrios Altos, en el 
distrito de Cercado de Lima, a los siguientes compradores: Comercializadora y 
Distribuidora Soto S.R.L., Distribuidora JPQ S.A.C., Comercial JSK E.I.R.L., y 
Distribuidora Boqueron S.A.C. El ingreso de maquinaria pesada y camiones en la zona con

</p>
<p>los servicios de medio centenar de hombres que se habr&#237;an asentado en la zona, impidiendo 
el tr&#225;nsito regular de los vecinos e intimid&#225;ndolos. Se alega que la Comisar&#237;a de San 
Andr&#233;s, pese a estar presentes en el lugar de los hechos, no habr&#237;a tomado ninguna medida 
para evitar las demoliciones y las intimidaciones. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, las 
familias ocupantes no ten&#237;an conocimiento de las gestiones de compra-venta entre la 
&quot;Pontificia Universidad Cat&#243;lica del Per&#250;&quot; y el grupo de comerciantes que aducen ser 
compradores. Al momento de enviar la carta de alegaci&#243;n, la amenaza de desalojo no hab&#237;a 
desaparecido y segu&#237;an los hostigamientos para que las familias desalojaran el predio, en 
algunos casos siendo ofrecidos cincuenta d&#243;lares (USD) por ello. Las familias ocupantes 
del predio estaban reivindicando su derecho al acceso a una vivienda digna en el terreno y 
poder formalizar la compra, as&#237; como no perder el &#225;rea deportiva dentro del predio. Las 
alegaciones indicaban adem&#225;s que no existe un plan de manejo del Centro Hist&#243;rico de 
Lima y Plan de Zonificaci&#243;n que garantice la vivienda de los residentes en esta &#225;rea de la 
ciudad. Asimismo, se alegaba que las autoridades locales permiten la venta de muchos 
predios habitados a grupos de comerciantes, promoviendo desalojos extrajudiciales y 
aprovech&#225;ndose de la situaci&#243;n de empobrecimiento de las familias residentes en el Centro 
de Lima. Adem&#225;s de los comentarios sobre la veracidad y exactitud de las alegaciones

<p>56. Con carta de fecha 6 de julio de 2010 el Gobierno de Per&#250; contest&#243; a la carta de 
alegaci&#243;n del 21 de abril de 2010. Port este medio el Gobierno inform&#243; la Relatora que el 
inmueble en cuesti&#243;n no posee la calidad de Patrimonio Cultural de la Naci&#243;n ni cuenta con 
caracter&#237;sticas arquitect&#243;nicas o hist&#243;ricas que ameriten su conservaci&#243;n, por lo que no es 
imposible su sustituci&#243;n por obra nueva. En relaci&#243;n con los supuestos desalojos que 
habr&#237;an ocurrido el 2 de febrero de 2010, el Gobierno inform&#243; que el Instituto Nacional de 
Cultura desconoc&#237;a de los mismos y que no hab&#237;a recibido denuncia alguna al respecto que 
meritara la realizaci&#243;n de una investigaci&#243;n o intervenci&#243;n correspondientes. El Gobierno 
a&#241;adi&#243; que las instituciones competentes habr&#237;an efectuado la constataci&#243;n correspondiente 
a fin de averiguar si se habr&#237;an realizado obras inconsultas en el inmueble y determinar si 
eventualmente corresponde el inicio de un procedimiento administrativo sancionador. El 
Gobierno adem&#225;s inform&#243; que el inmueble en el cual habitar&#237;an las 63 familias, posee un 
propietario, quien, de acuerdo al ordenamiento interno peruano, tiene entre sus atribuciones 
la de disponer y reivindicar su propiedad, con lo cual, leg&#237;timamente el propietario puede 
decidir libre y voluntariamente el momento y la persona a quien transferir su propiedad. El 
Gobierno precis&#243; desconocer si los 63 habitantes del inmueble estar&#237;an viviendo en este 
ultimo como arrendadores o como precarios pero que independientemente de ello, de ser 
cierto que se produjo un desalojo, este deber&#237;a haberse producido judicialmente y ante la 
negativa de los habitantes de desocupar un inmueble que no es de su propiedad. El 
Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que no es posible consentir o avalar la precariedad de un poseedor que no 
cuente con un titulo leg&#237;timo para continuar residiendo en el inmueble y de esta manera 
desproteger al propietario. Adicionalmente, el Gobierno pidi&#243; a la Relatora mayores 
detalles y datos sobre los hechos alegados a fin de dar respuesta a sus interrogantes. El

<p>58. On 19 March, 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
of the Philippines regarding the violent demolitions that were allegedly taking place along 
Road 10 in Navotas City, in Metro Manila, Philippines. According to the information 
received, between 18 and 20 January 2010 and resuming again on 4 March, the Philippine 
Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the City Government of Navotas 
reportedly conducted demolition operations for the purpose of widening Road 10. The 
homes of some 393 families were reported to have been demolished. They were part of the 
1,000 families that the government allegedly planned to remove to give way to its Road 10 
widening project. The demolitions reportedly rendered the residents homeless and 
vulnerable to further violations of their rights, including access to work, education, access 
to food and services, a healthy environment, and the right to vote, amongst others. Many of 
the victims were reportedly living in lean-tos along R10 and approximately 100 families 
were purportedly camping in front of the office of the DPWH in Port Area Manila, to press 
their demand for relocation. In response to the demolitions, the residents formed barricades. 
To break their resistance, it was reported that the government used baton-wielding and 
shield shoving policemen and water canon blasts by firemen. Many people were allegedly 
hurt during this operation and women bore the brunt of beatings. Moreover, a number of 
residents, including women, were allegedly arrested and jailed for resisting the forced 
eviction, and later released. According to the allegations, Philippine housing law mandates 
relocation in case of evictions or demolitions. Moreover, on 1 August 2008 in a meeting 
with a number of urban poor communities affected by national government infrastructure 
projects, the Government agreed to the resident&#8217;s proposal to be relocated to 
Montalban/Rodriguez municipality, a location relatively near their jobs and sources of 
income, and with basic services like water, electricity, public transportation, clinics, 
hospitals, and schools. However, later the DPWH authorities approached the residents 
offering only financial assistance and no relocation. Many residents did not accept the 
financial offer of P21,000 (USD457) for each affected family from the DPWH as it was 
contrary to Philippine law (RA 7279) and insisted on receiving relocation as promised by 
the Government in 2008. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteur requested more information regarding: whether or not a 
complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victims; the details and results, of 
any investigation, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this evictions and 
demolitions; the legal basis on which the evictions and housing demolitions in Road 10 
were carried out; whether appropriate consultations took place with the affected persons 
and if so, the details, date and outcome of these consultations; whether the affected 
populations were given adequate and reasonable prior notifications before the evictions and 
housing demolitions and if so, the dates of notifications; whether the affected persons were 
given adequate and reasonable times to withdraw their belongings before the destruction of 
their residences; the measures that were foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the 
housing demolition, would not become homeless; whether the affected persons were 
offered compensation for the loss of their houses and livelihood, and if not the reasons for 
this decision; and what was foreseen in terms of relocation. </p>

<p>60. On 3 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, and the Independent Expert on Minority Issues, sent a joint urgent 
appeal to the Government of Serbia, regarding alleged forced evictions of Roma 
communities living in informal settlements in Belgrade. According to information received 
by the Special Rapporteurs and Independent Expert, on 30 March 2010, Belgrade's Deputy 
Mayor publicly announced that evictions would purportedly begin at the end of April 2010 
to make way for an access road for a planned new bridge over the River Sava, affecting 
approximately 300 households in an informal settlement known as Belvil, in Belgrade. 
Reportedly, the Roma community in Belvil had not yet been informed about the evictions 
plan when four families received an eviction notice. According to the allegations, Belgrade 
city employees visited Belvil and threatened members of the Roma community with 
imminent eviction. Local authorities allegedly made no attempt to consult with the affected 
community on the eviction plans or feasible alternatives to evictions. Moreover, the 
community was not informed of, or offered any alternative adequate housing. Instead, it is 
reported that the Deputy Mayor said that the families would had be housed in containers. 
Other Roma families in Belgrade were purportedly living in these containers after having 
been evicted the previous year. Reports indicated that the containers were poorly ventilated, 
damp and overcrowded. According to the allegations, in that same week, 35 families were 
reportedly evicted from another Roma settlement in the city of Belgrade, known as 
Vidikovac, in the municipality of Rakovica. Reports further indicated that more forced 
evictions would have been carried out in this community.. In addition, it was reported that 
on 20 March 2010, 30 Roma families, comprising more than 150 people, were forcibly 
evicted from their homes in the Lazara Kujund&#382;ica Street in the municipality of Cukurica of 
Belgrade. According to witness reports, the eviction, which took place around 7 o&#8217;clock in 
the morning, took the inhabitants of the settlement by surprise. Reportedly, the affected 
families were not given sufficient time to retrieve their belongings, which were destroyed 
when the houses were bulldozed. Against its promise, the municipality allegedly failed to 
provide alternative accommodation to the families who had to spend the night in a Roma 
cultural centre in &#381;eleznik. Some of the evicted families were residents of the Municipality 
of Vladicin Han, the Municipality of Surdulica, and other areas outside of Belgrade, but 
were living in the settlement in Lazara Kujund&#382;ica Street where they could access better 
sources of livelihood. According to the allegations, the day after the evictions, 
representatives of the municipality offered 10,000 to 15,000 dinars to those prepared to 
return to their home towns or villages away from Belgrade. Seven families from Belgrade 
were promised alternative accommodation in Belgrade, but no date and location for such a 
solution were announced.. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the facts of the 
allegations, the Special Rapporteurs and Independent Expert requested more information 
regarding: whether or not a complaint had been lodged by or on behalf of the alleged 
victims; the details, and where available the results, of any investigation, and judicial or 
other inquiries carried out in relation to this case; whether or not appropriate consultations 
took place with the affected persons; the details, date and outcome of the consultations; the 
measures foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the forced evictions and 
displacements, would not become homeless; whether the affected persons were offered </p>

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>65. On 12 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the 
Government of the United Kingdom, concerning the alleged threat of eviction of the 
Roma/Gypsy/Traveller community of Dale Farm in Essex. According to information 
received by the Special Rapporteur, Dale Farm, the largest Roma/Gypsy/Traveller 
community in the United Kingdom, comprising of approximately 1000 residents, was 
facing the threat of eviction from the land they owned. Dale Farm has been home to 
Roma/Gypsy/Traveller communities since the 1960's. Although the Roma/Gypsy/Traveller 
community at Dale Farm had possession of the land from which they were to be evicted, 
they were refused planning permission for their caravans when the land was designated as 
Green Belt. Basildon District Council and the Secretary of State for Communities and 
Local Government reportedly refused to grant planning permission on the basis of the harm 
that would have been caused to the Green Belt. The Council had served a number of 
enforcement notices ordering the removal of the chalets, mobile-homes and caravans from 
the land they occupied. These enforcement notices concerned some 90 families, comprising 
approximately 300 people, including many children, elderly and infirm. As the enforcement 
notices had not been complied with, Basildon District Council allegedly decided to pursue 
direct action to evict the community in 2005. The decision by the Council to take direct 
action and evict the Dale Farm community was challenged by the residents. On 5 May 
2008, the High Court of Justice quashed the respective order by Basildon District Council. 
However, the judgment was overturned and the decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal 
on 22 January 2009. An application for permission to appeal to the House of Lords was 
refused on 14 May 2009. Following that, the residents were proceeding with homelessness 
applications. On 10 December 2009, Basildon District Council reportedly selected the 
private bailiff company Constant and Co. (Bedford) Ltd to undertake planning enforcement 
action. This company was allegedly responsible for the Twin Oaks eviction, in 
Hertfordshire in 2004, when chalets and private property were needlessly burned. It 
purportedly also acted as the agent for Chelmsford Borough Council at the Meadowlands 
eviction of 2004, which entailed burning of caravans and racial abuse against the residents. 
These actions drew criticism from the High Court judge, who during the May 2008 hearing 
said it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; for Basildon Council to continue using Constant &amp; Co. The 
housing options that were offered by the Council were apparently unsatisfactory and failed 
to meet the specific cultural needs of the affected community. Moreover, the planned 
evictions may have resulted in irreparable harm to the Dale Farm community, particularly 
given the private bailiff that was due to conduct the eviction. Such irreparable harm 
included, inter alia, the loss of housing and other personal belongings, the dangers 
associated with lack of shelter due to resulting homelessness, and the loss of social 
networks and cultural integrity. It was reported that the case of the Dale Farm community 
was one example of a pattern of discrimination against Roma/Gypsy/Traveller communities 
in the United Kingdom. As a result of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (CJPOA) 
of 1994, there was no longer an enforceable legal duty on local authorities to provide sites 
for the caravans of members of Roma/Gypsy/Traveller communities. Whilst the powers 
provided under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act (CSCDA) of 1960 to 
offer temporary or permanent sites have remained in place, since 1994 they are rarely, if 
ever, used. Instead, it has reportedly been government policy since 1994 that sites for 
Roma/Gypsy/Travellers are to be sought and planning permission obtained through private </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>endeavour by such communities themselves. However, due to the CJPOA Act, these 
communities have been facing major difficulties in finding adequate sites and obtaining 
planning permission to develop the sites. In addition to comments on the accuracy of the 
facts of the allegations, the Special Rapporteurs and Independent Expert requested more 
information regarding: whether or not a complaint was lodged by or on behalf of the 
alleged victims; the legal basis on which evictions were to be carried out; the number of 
people that would be affected by the evictions; the consultations carried out with affected 
persons; the details, date and outcome of these consultations; the measures taken in order to 
reach a peaceful and viable solution in agreement with the Dale Farm community; whether 
the planned evictions were halted until an adequate solution was  achieved to meet the 
housing needs, including suitable and cultural adequate accommodation, of the Dale Farm 
community; whether an impact assessment was carried out in order to identify the social 
and housing effects of the planned evictions; whether Basildon District Council selected the 
private company Constant and Co. (Bedford) Ltd to undertake planning enforcement 
action; whether the selection process took into account the records of the company 
concerning corporate social responsibility and respect for international human rights 
standards; the information regarding the proceedings and results of the selection process; 
the measures that were foreseen to ensure that the persons affected by the evictions would 
not become homeless; whether the affected persons were offered compensation for the loss 
of their houses and livelihood, and if not, the reasons for this decision; and what was 
foreseen in terms of relocation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Replies received 
</b></p>
<p>66. On 23 July 2010, the Government of the United Kingdom sent a letter to the Special 
Rapporteur, thanking her for the aforementioned allegation letter, and assuring her that the 
Government was working on the reply and that the Special Rapporteur would receive a 
substantive reply within the 60 day deadline.   
</p>
<p>67. On 31 August 2010, the Government of the United Kingdom sent a letter of 
response to the allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on 12 April 2010. The letter 
contained the entire Judgment Approved by the High Court of Justice, as well as an Annex 
containing answers to the questions raised by the Special Rapporteur. According to the 
Government of the United Kingdom, the alleged facts contained in the summary of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter were not correct in all respects, nor did they give a complete 
account of the case. The Government then proceeded to provide the background and history 
of development at Dale Farm. In clarifying that the &#8220;Green Belt&#8221; land had been an essential 
element of planning policy in England and Wales for 50 years, and that its fundamental aim 
had always been to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open, the 
Government explained that permission for development was not granted there unless there 
were very special circumstances justifying it. The unauthorised traveller site at Dale Farm 
had been the subject of an exhaustive legal process, including consideration of human 
rights issues, and extension of the compliance period to two years to allow occupiers to find 
alternative accommodation. The proposed action by the District Council was very much a 
last step in seeking to regularise development of the site. It related to longstanding unlawful 
development. It was not simply development that had been built without planning 
permission, but one which was in breach of criminal law, because the time for compliance 
with the enforcement notices had long expired. It came at the end of a complex sequence of 
events over the past 10 years, involving the service of enforcement notices against 
unauthorised development, retrospective planning applications, appeals against the 
enforcement notices and refusals of planning permission, and a judicial review of the 
decision of the District Council to take action under section 178 of the Town and Country 
Planning Act 1990. That judicial review was finally decided by the Court of Appeal on 22 
January 2009. Through this process, there were opportunities to have the planning merits of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>the unlawful development considered by the District Council to have those merits 
reconsidered through appeals and to test the lawfulness of the process through judicial 
review. Theses opportunities were taken. The unacceptability of the development was 
confirmed during the legal process and extensions were given to the time for compliance. 
Contrary to what was suggested in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter, only the residents of the 
plots without the necessary planning permission were at risk of eviction, and not all 
residents in the Dale Farm community. A significant part of the site had planning 
permission as a result of decisions in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In addition, the 
Government disputes the suggestion in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter that planning 
permission was refused &#8220;when the land was designated as Green Belt&#8221;. In fact, a substantial 
extension of the Green Belt was approved in 1976, which predates the unlawful 
development. Regarding the statement by Mr. Justice Collins in regard to the 
&#8220;unacceptable&#8221; way that Constant and Co&#8217;s staff carried out evictions, the Government 
explained that the Justice was referring to the Twin Oaks site and not Dale Farm. 
</p>
<p>68. Furthermore, regarding the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s partial overview of policy history 
towards traveller site provision, the Government indicated that this overview was out of 
date and did not take into account developments since 1994. The Government specified that 
planning policy and law are different in Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland. In 
England, decisions on housing supply, including the provision of travellers&#8217; sites, rest with 
local planning authorities. The Government explained that it intended to revoke Planning 
Circular 01/2006 (&#8220;Planning for Gypsy and Traveller Caravan Sites&#8221;), and replace it with a 
light-touch guidance outlining councils statutory obligations. Concerning the question on 
whether or not a complaint had been lodged on behalf of the alleged victims, the 
Government indicated that a number of Dale Farm residents had exercised their right of 
appeal against various enforcement notices and against refusals of retrospective planning 
permission. The Judicial Review was a mechanism through which the legality of the 
proposed action under section 178 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 was 
challenged. Concerning the legal basis of the evictions, they were to be carried out on the 
basis of Section 178 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. According to Basildon 
District Council, there were 50 unauthorised pitches at Dale Farm, which is an estimate of 
90 families, comprising of about 300 people. Regarding the consultations, Basildon District 
Council appointed a Liaison Officer with a dedicated phone number who was in charge of 
coordinating the responses to any queries concerning the Council&#8217;s proposed action. The 
individual needs of each family were to be considered before any eviction. Basildon 
District Council was working with Essex County Council and South Essex Primary Care 
Trust to ensure that specific needs were addressed. Before any eviction was carried out, 
there was a 28-day notice period. In addition to serving site notices and sending personal 
letters, Basildon Council intended that each of the families would be personally visited to 
ensure that they were fully aware of what was being proposed. Regarding measures taken to 
ensure a peaceful and viable solution, apart from participation in the planning appeals and 
redress through the courts as outlined before, in planning for the eviction Basildon Council 
was working closely with the police, emergency services, local education authority, health 
authorities, social services and so on, to ensure that the eviction was carried out peaceably 
and that the likely impact on children, vulnerable adults, those with health conditions and 
other specific needs was taken into account. As to whether or not an impact assessment was 
carried out in order to identify the social and housing effects of the planned evictions, 
Basildon District Council carried out a service impact assessment, a community impact 
assessment, and a risk assessment. Regarding whether or not at the time Basildon DC 
selected the private company Constant and Co. (Bedford) Ltd to undertake planning 
enforcement action, they were aware of the records of the company concerning corporate 
social responsibility; the Government replied that Basildon Council was aware of the 
criticisms of their record at the previous evictions. In response to the concerns raised by Mr. 
Justice Collins, Basildon Council provided information (attached to the response to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>Special Rapporteur) on how it would undertake the proposed eviction. The Government 
was assured by the Council that if eviction was necessary, it would be carried out as 
humanely as possible and having in mind the past history of undertaking this type of work. 
Regarding the measures that were foreseen to ensure that the persons affected would not 
become homeless, and whether or not an adequate solution to the housing needs, including 
cultural accommodation, was taken into account, the Government replied that in general, 
where persons were lawfully evicted and did not have alternative accommodation available, 
there was a likelihood that they would be at risk of homelessness. England has one of the 
strongest legal safety nets in the world to assist persons who face homelessness. If a local 
housing authority in England had reason to believe that someone who applied to them for 
housing assistance may be homeless or was likely to become homeless within 28 days, they 
would have to make inquiries and decide whether they owe any duty to the applicant and to 
those who normally reside with him. The duties owed range from providing advice and 
assistance to the main homelessness duty of security settled accommodation, dependent on 
whether or not the applicant had a priority need or was found to be intentionally homeless. 
According to English law, the families were already homeless because they had set up 
movable homes in a place where they did not have legal permission to station them or live 
in them. The affected families were invited to make homeless applications. The council was 
also making offers of housing to those for whom it owed a statutory duty to secure 
accommodation. The affected families were not entitled to compensation, however, because 
the development they carried out was unlawful. Under the homelessness legislation the 
local housing authority would have a duty to secure suitable alternative accommodation for 
any person who was (1) eligible for assistance, (2) homeless though no fault of their own, 
and (3) within a priority need group. Certain categories of persons from abroad were 
ineligible for assistance (i.e. those with limited leave to remain in the UK on condition of 
no recourse to public funds). The priority need groups included (among others) pregnant 
women, people with who a dependant child resides, and people who are vulnerable for 
some reason. In considering whether accommodation was suitable for an applicant (and 
those who reside with him/her) the authority had to take account any cultural aversion to 
bricks and mortar accommodation. Where a homeless applicant had a mobile home and was 
homeless only for lack of a lawful site to place it and live in it, the local authority was 
expected to try and find a suitable site, so far as possible. However if there was no suitable 
site available, the authority would have to offer suitable alternative accommodation until 
such time as a site became available. Basildon Council had been working with Essex 
County Council, the Local Government Association, the Homes and Communities Agency 
and the Government Office for the East of England to identify alternative sites on to which 
families affected could relocate by agreement.
