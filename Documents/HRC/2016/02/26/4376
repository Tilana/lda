<p> At its 33rd meeting, on 1 October 2010, the Human Rights Council decided to adopt 
the following text: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on hostage-taking, on human rights and 
terrorism and on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering 
terrorism, in particular Assembly resolutions 61/172 of 19 December 2006 and 
64/168 of 18 December 2009, Commission resolutions 2004/44 of 19 April 2004 and 
2005/31 of 19 April 2005 and Council resolution 13/26 of 26 March 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> all General Assembly resolutions on measures to eliminate 
international terrorism and on the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, 
including resolutions 46/51 of 9 December 1991, 60/288 of 8 September 2006 and 
64/297 of 8 September 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the importance of the ratification of all relevant international 
conventions against terrorism, especially the International Convention for the 
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the International Convention against 
the Taking of Hostages, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i>, in particular, that peace and security, development and human 
rights are the interrelated pillars of the United Nations system, and renewing its 
commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its fifteenth session (A/HRC/15/60), chap. I. 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that the promotion and protection of human rights for all and 
the rule of law are essential to the fight against terrorism, and recognizing that 
effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not 
conflicting goals but are complementary and mutually reinforcing,  
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern </i>at the increase in incidents of kidnapping and hostage-
taking,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i>, therefore, the need to reflect on the question of human rights and 
issues related to terrorist hostage-taking,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides </i>to convene, within existing resources, at its sixteenth session, 
a panel discussion on the issue of human rights in the context of action taken to 
address terrorist hostage-taking, with a special focus on the primary responsibility of 
States to promote and protect human rights for all in their jurisdiction, on the 
strengthening of international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism and on the 
protection of the rights of all victims of terrorism involved; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to liaise with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
of human rights while countering terrorism and all concerned parties and 
stakeholders, including relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to 
ensuring their participation in the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report 
on the outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>33rd meeting 
1 October 2010 
</i></p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote.]
