<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In August 2012, the Advisory Committee submitted to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>for its consideration and approval a research proposal on local government and human 
</p>
<p>rights (A/HRC/AC/9/6). 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 September 2013 the Council adopted its resolution 24/2 in which it took note 
</p>
<p>of the above-mentioned research proposal and requested the Advisory Committee to 
</p>
<p>prepare a research-based report on the role of local government in the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, including human rights mainstreaming in local administration 
</p>
<p>and public services, with a view to compiling best practices and main challenges, and to 
</p>
<p>present a progress report on the requested research-based report to the Council at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-seventh session, for its consideration. 
</p>
<p>3. The Advisory Committee was also requested to seek the views and inputs of 
</p>
<p>Member States, relevant international and regional organizations, the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant special procedures, as well as 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, in order to prepare 
</p>
<p>the above-mentioned research-based report. 
</p>
<p>4. During its twelfth session held from 24 to 28 February 2014, the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee established a drafting group tasked with the preparation of the said report and 
</p>
<p>designated the following members of the Committee as members thereof: Mr. Coriolano, 
</p>
<p>Ms. Elsadda, Mr. H&#252;seynov (Rapporteur), Ms. Reyes Prado, Mr. Seetulsingh 
</p>
<p>(Chairperson), and Mr. Yigezu. 
</p>
<p>5. At the same session of the Advisory Committee, the drafting group developed a 
</p>
<p>questionnaire, in accordance with Council resolution 24/2, which was disseminated to 
</p>
<p>various stakeholders. As at 4 August 2014, a total of 67 responses had been received: 22 
</p>
<p>from States, 20 from national human rights institutions, 9 from non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, 12 from local authorities and 4 from international or regional organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Definition of local government 
</b></p>
<p>6. Local government is commonly defined as the lower tier of public administration 
</p>
<p>within a given State. In unitary States, local government usually comprises the second or 
</p>
<p>third tier of government, whereas in federal States, it is constituted as the third or 
</p>
<p>sometimes fourth tier of government. The organization and functioning of local government 
</p>
<p>vary considerably between countries. Different names are used for local government 
</p>
<p>entities in different countries (county, prefecture, district, city, town, borough, parish, 
</p>
<p>municipality, village, etc.). Local governments exist geographically both in urban and rural 
</p>
<p>settings. 
</p>
<p>7. Local governments perform three main roles: they promote sustainable and 
</p>
<p>successful development of their territory, in the interests of their citizens; they organize, 
</p>
<p>commission, finance and deliver essential public services, both universal and targeted to 
</p>
<p>those most in need; and they act as the democratic voice and advocate for their 
</p>
<p>communities.1 
</p>

<p>8. Local government aims at bringing government to the grass-roots and enabling 
</p>
<p>citizens to participate effectively in the making of decisions affecting their daily lives. As 
</p>
<p>the level closest to the citizens, local government is in a much better position than central 
</p>
<p>government to deal with matters that require local knowledge and regulation on the basis of 
</p>
<p>local needs and priorities. 
</p>
<p>9. Local governments possess certain powers conferred upon them by legislation or the 
</p>
<p>directives of the higher levels of government. Those powers consist, in substance, in 
</p>
<p>regulating and managing certain public affairs and delivering certain public services. The 
</p>
<p>extent of the powers of local government should always be analysed in the context of 
</p>
<p>relations between local authorities and central government or regional authorities (in federal 
</p>
<p>States). One of the important features of local government is that it has a specific, 
</p>
<p>subordinate regulatory power for the exercise of its functions which is, however, subject to 
</p>
<p>compliance with the law. 
</p>
<p>10. Although in some countries &#8220;local government&#8221; and &#8220;local self-government&#8221; are 
</p>
<p>used interchangeably, given the fact that local government has different forms in different 
</p>
<p>countries, these two concepts should be differentiated. Local public administration can be 
</p>
<p>exercised not only by local self-government entities (e.g. municipalities), but also by local 
</p>
<p>units of State administration; the former are directly elected by the local population and 
</p>
<p>enjoy wide-ranging autonomy, whereas the latter act as agents of the higher authorities and 
</p>
<p>their officials are appointed by and responsible to those authorities. Local self-government 
</p>
<p>is based on the principle of decentralization, and local State administration is based on the 
</p>
<p>principle of deconcentration. 
</p>
<p>11. The degree of self-government enjoyed by local authorities can be regarded as a key 
</p>
<p>element of genuine democracy. In that regard, political, fiscal and administrative 
</p>
<p>decentralization is essential for localizing democracy and human rights. It should be borne 
</p>
<p>in mind that democracy is not possible without respect for human rights and no human 
</p>
<p>rights can be achieved without democracy. 
</p>
<p>12. The role of local authorities should not be limited to mere executors of decisions 
</p>
<p>taken and policies developed without them. On the other hand, local independence should 
</p>
<p>have certain limits clearly prescribed by law, and mechanisms ought to be available for 
</p>
<p>supervising the legality of local authorities&#8217; activities. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and regulatory framework of local government 
</b></p>
<p>13. To ensure effective local governance and adequate implementation of human rights 
</p>
<p>at the local level, it is important to have a proper legal framework for local government. 
</p>
<p>The organization, powers and functions should be clearly prescribed by law. Further, 
</p>
<p>national legislation should delineate clearly the responsibilities and powers of central and 
</p>
<p>local government authorities in relation to one another. 
</p>
<p>14. Local government should preferably be recognized in the national constitution; 
</p>
<p>indeed in a number of countries, the constitutions specifically protect local government 
</p>
<p>autonomy. It should be underlined that constitutional protection provides the greatest 
</p>
<p>guarantee of stability. A specific law on local government passed by national parliament is 
</p>
<p>the next best solution in that regard. In a few countries, legal safeguards are in place to 
</p>
<p>maintain the stability of laws governing local government. In Hungary, for example, the 
</p>
<p>Law on Local Authorities can be adopted or amended only by a two-thirds majority of the 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians present. The same applies to any legislation restricting the rights 
</p>
<p>associated with local self-government. </p>


<p>15. It is noteworthy that the principles of subsidiarity, decentralization and 
</p>
<p>accountability are explicitly envisaged in a number of countries as main principles of local 
</p>
<p>government. Furthermore, the respective laws provide for the right of local authorities to 
</p>
<p>have recourse to a judicial remedy in order to ensure respect for such principles. 
</p>
<p>16. International law does not, in principle, concern itself with the internal territorial 
</p>
<p>structure of the State. The relationship between a State and its local government is generally 
</p>
<p>considered as an internal matter. In other words, it is a sovereign right of States to organize 
</p>
<p>their local governments in accordance with their domestic legislation and to freely 
</p>
<p>determine whether local governments are elected or appointed, and whether they can 
</p>
<p>function independently or only with express approval from higher authorities, and which 
</p>
<p>public services are to be provided by local government. 
</p>
<p>17. Nevertheless, certain rules and regulations have been developed, both at the 
</p>
<p>international and national level, that directly relate to local government. It should be 
</p>
<p>stressed that very few such rules are legally binding. Particular mention should be made of 
</p>
<p>the European Charter on Local Self-Government, a regional treaty adopted in 1985 within 
</p>
<p>the framework of the Council of Europe. The Charter, which has been ratified by all the 47 
</p>
<p>member States of the Council of Europe, is the first international legally binding instrument 
</p>
<p>that guarantees the rights of communities and their elected authorities. It lays down 
</p>
<p>common European standards to protect the rights of local self-government authorities. 
</p>
<p>18. Another legally binding instrument is the African Charter on Democracy, Elections 
</p>
<p>and Governance2 which was adopted by the African Union in January 2007. The Charter 
</p>
<p>contains some provisions concerning local government. In particular, it obliges State parties 
</p>
<p>to &#8220;decentralize power to democratically elected local authorities as provided in national 
</p>
<p>laws&#8221; (art. 34). The Charter further stipulates that &#8220;given the enduring and vital role of 
</p>
<p>traditional authorities, particularly in rural communities, the State Parties shall strive to find 
</p>
<p>appropriate ways and means to increase their integration and effectiveness within the larger 
</p>
<p>democratic system&#8221; (art. 35). 
</p>
<p>19. A number of instruments have been adopted under the auspices of the Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe that are aimed at safeguarding local authorities&#8217; rights, among them: the European 
</p>
<p>Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or 
</p>
<p>Authorities (1980 and the three protocols thereto);3 the European Code of conduct for the 
</p>
<p>political integrity of local and regional elected representatives (1999);4 the European 
</p>
<p>Landscape Convention (2000);5 the European Urban Charter I (1992);6 the European Urban 
</p>
<p>Charter II &#8212; Manifesto for a new urbanity (2008);7 and the Additional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>European Charter of Local Self-Government on the right to participate in the affairs of a 
</p>
<p>local authority (2009).8 Reference should also be made to the following recommendations 
</p>
<p>of the Council of Europe&#8217;s Committee of Ministers to member States that contain important 
</p>
<p>principles and norms relating to competences, financial resources and capacity of local 
</p>
<p>authorities: recommendation Rec(1998)12 on supervision of local authorities&#8217; action; 
</p>
<p>recommendation Rec(2004)12 on the processes of reform of boundaries and/or structure of 
</p>
<p>local and regional authorities; recommendation Rec(2005)1 on the financial resources of

<p>local and regional authorities; recommendation Rec(2001)19 on the participation of citizens 
</p>
<p>in public local life; and recommendation Rec(2004)1 on financial and budgetary 
</p>
<p>management at local and regional levels.9 
</p>
<p>20. Two sets of guidelines approved by the Governing Council of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Human Settlement Programme (UN-HABITAT) in 2007 and 2009, namely guidelines on 
</p>
<p>decentralization and strengthening of local authorities, and guidelines on access to basic 
</p>
<p>services for all,10 should be considered as important contributions to the international 
</p>
<p>standard-setting process in the field of local government. By approving those documents, 
</p>
<p>States Members of the United Nations committed themselves to the promotion of 
</p>
<p>decentralization and strengthening of local authorities, as well as access to basic services 
</p>
<p>for all. 
</p>
<p>21. The existing regulatory framework for local government also includes rules and 
</p>
<p>guidelines that have been developed by the global and regional associations of local 
</p>
<p>government. Thus, the Council of European Municipalities and Regions, the largest 
</p>
<p>European association of local and regional governments that brings together the national 
</p>
<p>associations of local and regional authorities from 41 European countries, has drawn up a 
</p>
<p>number of normative documents, among them: the European Charter of Municipal Liberties 
</p>
<p>(1953);11 the European Charter for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life (2006);12 the 
</p>
<p>European Charter on Local and Regional Services of General Interest (2009).13 
</p>
<p>22. United Cities and Local Governments, the largest local government organization in 
</p>
<p>the world, founded in 2004, has greatly contributed to establishing a global normative 
</p>
<p>framework for local government, particularly for cities. Special mention should be made of 
</p>
<p>such important documents as the World Charter for the Right to the City (2005) and the 
</p>
<p>Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City (2010).14 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Role of different tiers of government in the implementation of 
international human rights obligations of the State 
</b></p>
<p>23. As a matter of international law, the State is one single entity, regardless of its 
</p>
<p>unitary or federal nature and internal administrative division. In that regard, only the State 
</p>
<p>as a whole is bound by obligations stemming from international treaties to which it is a 
</p>
<p>party. Thus, by becoming a party to an international human rights treaty, a State assumes 
</p>
<p>obligations to respect, to protect, and to fulfil human rights. More specifically, only States 
</p>
<p>are obliged to submit reports as required by the respective universal and regional human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties and only States can be the subject of individual or inter-State complaints 
</p>
<p>under certain of such treaties. Furthermore, a State appearing before an international human 
</p>
<p>rights complaints mechanism cannot defend itself by claiming that the alleged violation was 
</p>
<p>committed by a local authority. 
</p>
<p>24. It should also be emphasized that, under general international law, a State, as 
</p>
<p>represented by the central government, is responsible for all acts of all its organs and 
</p>
<p>agents.15 It is commonly recognized that &#8220;the conduct of any State organ shall be

</p>
<p> 14 See section VI of the present report. 
</p>
<p> 15 In that respect, a reference could be made, mutatis mutandis, to article 50 of the International 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises 
</p>
<p>legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the 
</p>
<p>organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central government 
</p>
<p>or of a territorial unit of the State&#8221;.16 In paragraph 4 of its general comment No. 31 (2004) 
</p>
<p>on the nature of general legal obligations imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Committee made it clear that all public or governmental authorities, at 
</p>
<p>whatever level &#8212; national, regional or local &#8212; are in a position to engage the responsibility 
</p>
<p>of the State party. Similarly, in paragraph 42 of its general comment No. 16 (2005) on the 
</p>
<p>equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasized that violations of the 
</p>
<p>rights contained in the Covenant can occur through the direct action of, failure to act or 
</p>
<p>omission by States parties, or through their institutions or agencies at the national and local 
</p>
<p>levels. It should be noted that the conduct of certain institutions exercising public powers is 
</p>
<p>attributed to the State even if those institutions are regarded in internal law as autonomous 
</p>
<p>and independent of the executive government.17 
</p>
<p>25. Illegal acts of any public authority, including local government, are attributable to 
</p>
<p>the State even if they are ultra vires or contravene the domestic laws and instructions.18 
</p>
<p>That flows directly from the principle contained in article 27 of the Vienna Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Law of Treaties, according to which a State party may not invoke the provisions of its 
</p>
<p>internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. 
</p>
<p>26. It is the central government which has the primary responsibility for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of international human rights obligations of the State, while local 
</p>
<p>government has a complementary role to play. Upon ratifying an international human rights 
</p>
<p>treaty, the State may delegate implementation thereof to lower tiers of government, 
</p>
<p>including local authorities. In that respect, the central government might need to take 
</p>
<p>measures at the local level, in particular, to establish procedures and controls in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the State&#8217;s human rights obligations are implemented. Local authorities are 
</p>
<p>obliged to comply, within their local competences, with their duties stemming from the 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations of the State. Representatives of local authorities 
</p>
<p>should be involved in the drafting of national human rights strategies and policies. Local 
</p>
<p>authorities are actually those who are to translate such policies into practical application. In 
</p>
<p>decentralized States, local government can play a more proactive and autonomous role in 
</p>
<p>the promotion and protection of human rights. Institutionalized cooperation on human 
</p>
<p>rights between the central and local governments could have a positive impact on the level 
</p>
<p>of implementation of the international human rights obligations of the State. 
</p>
<p>27. To comply with their human rights responsibilities, local authorities should have 
</p>
<p>necessary powers and financial resources. Adequate implementation of human rights, 
</p>
<p>particularly economic, social and cultural rights, by local authorities require financial 
</p>
<p>resources which are not available everywhere; that should be taken into consideration both 
</p>
<p>at the national and international level. It should be particularly emphasized that whatever 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, according to which the provisions of the Covenant &#8220;shall 
</p>
<p>extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions&#8221;.

</p>

<p> 17 Commentaries to the draft articles on responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts adopted 
</p>
<p>by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), <i>Official Records of the General 
</i></p>

<p> 18 Article 7 of the annex to General Assembly resolution 56/83 (see note 16 above). </p>


<p>powers are conferred upon local authorities, they would not be effective if no financial 
</p>
<p>resources are available to carry them out.19 
</p>
<p>28. The principle of shared responsibility of different tiers of government for the 
</p>
<p>protection and promotion of human rights has been on several occasions underlined by the 
</p>
<p>human rights treaty bodies and special procedures. Thus, in paragraph 12 of its general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 4 (1991) on the right to adequate housing, the Committee on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights noted that States parties to the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights should take steps &#8220;to ensure coordination between 
</p>
<p>ministries and regional and local authorities in order to reconcile related policies 
</p>
<p>(economics, agriculture, environment, energy, etc.) with the obligations under article 11 of 
</p>
<p>the Covenant&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
</p>
<p>consequences, when visiting Italy in 2012, did not only speak to representatives of the 
</p>
<p>national government and various non-governmental organizations, but also visited Rome, 
</p>
<p>Milan, Bologna and Naples, and in her subsequent report (A/HRC/20/16/Add.2) explicitly 
</p>
<p>referred to the importance of local political will to address violence against women. In one 
</p>
<p>of its judgments, the European Court of Human Rights stated that &#8220;the authorities of a 
</p>
<p>territorial entity of the State are public-law institutions which perform the functions 
</p>
<p>assigned to them by the Constitution and the law. In that connection, the Court reiterates 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;in international law the expression &#8216;governmental organisation&#8217; cannot be held to refer 
</p>
<p>only to the government or the central organs of the State. Where powers are distributed 
</p>
<p>along decentralised lines, it refers to any national authority exercising public functions&#8221;.20 
</p>
<p>29. In the context of monitoring of the domestic implementation of international human 
</p>
<p>rights commitments, the relevant<b> </b>United Nations mechanisms could be encouraged to 
</p>
<p>engage in a dialogue with local governments as well. Local authorities should be involved 
</p>
<p>in the universal periodic review in respect of their Government; that would improve the 
</p>
<p>quality of the follow-up to the accepted recommendations. Recommendations made during 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review and the concluding observations of the treaty bodies should be 
</p>
<p>disseminated by central government to the local authorities. A reference should also be 
</p>
<p>made to the harmonized guidelines on reporting to the treaty bodies (HRI/MC/2005/3) in 
</p>
<p>which the reporting States are encouraged to make sure that governmental departments at 
</p>

<p><b> V. Role of local government in respecting, protecting and 
fulfilling human rights 
</b></p>
<p>30. The legislation of a number of countries &#8212; in some cases, at the constitutional level 
</p>
<p>&#8212; explicitly requires local government to respect human rights (e.g. Australia, C&#244;te 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire, Morocco and Slovenia). In some other countries, the respective constitutional 
</p>
<p>requirement applies to all public powers (e.g. Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
</p>
<p>Germany, Kenya, Lithuania, Malaysia, South Sudan, Spain and Togo). In Luxembourg, the 
</p>
<p>powers of the communes must be exercised in accordance with the law which means that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 19 The European Charter on Local Self-Government (see note 1 above) provides that local authorities 
</p>
<p>&#8220;shall be entitled, within national economic policy, to adequate financial resources of their own, of 
</p>
<p>which they may dispose freely within the framework of their powers&#8221;, and that their resources &#8220;shall 
</p>
<p>be commensurate with the responsibilities provided for by the constitution and the law&#8221; (art. 9, paras. 
</p>
<p>1 and 2).

<p>they are obliged to observe human rights guaranteed by the law. In some countries, the duty 
</p>
<p>of local government to observe human rights is limited in the law to specific rights or 
</p>
<p>principles. For instance, the Local Self-Government Act of Serbia stipulates that 
</p>
<p>municipalities must ensure the promotion and protection of the rights of national minorities 
</p>
<p>and ethnic groups. In Ireland, the local government legislation does not specifically provide 
</p>
<p>for the promotion and protection of human rights, but in discharging their functions local 
</p>
<p>authorities are required to have regard to the need to promote social inclusion. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>the legislation on local governments in India does not specifically mention protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights among their responsibilities; however, the constitutionally mandated 
</p>
<p>municipal functions directly relate to core human rights, such as implementation of 
</p>
<p>initiatives for democratic inclusion, welfare measures and local justice system. 
</p>
<p>31. Having an explicit legal provision which obliges local government to protect and 
</p>
<p>promote human rights appears to be a preferable approach. Local authorities are thus made 
</p>
<p>aware of their human rights responsibilities, understanding that any failure to comply with 
</p>
<p>those responsibilities will entail their liability under national law as well as international 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the State as a whole. Further, such a provision imposes a clear obligation 
</p>
<p>on local authorities to apply a human rights-based approach to delivering public services 
</p>
<p>within their defined competences. Consequently, it may well encourage rights holders to 
</p>
<p>claim their rights vis-&#224;-vis local authorities. 
</p>
<p>32. Local authorities are close to citizens&#8217; everyday needs and they deal with human 
</p>
<p>right issues on an everyday basis. Therefore there exists a clear and strong connection 
</p>
<p>between human rights and local government. When performing their functions, local 
</p>
<p>authorities take decisions relating in particular to education, housing, health, the 
</p>
<p>environment and law and order, which are directly connected with the implementation of 
</p>
<p>human rights and which may enforce or weaken the possibilities of its inhabitants to enjoy 
</p>
<p>their human rights. Actually, it is difficult to imagine a situation of human rights being 
</p>
<p>realized where there are no local authorities to provide the necessary services. Local 
</p>
<p>officials are thus responsible for a wide range of human rights issues in their day-to-day 
</p>
<p>work. However, that work is rarely perceived as human rights implementation, either by the 
</p>
<p>authorities, or by the public. Consequently, human rights remain distant as a frame of 
</p>
<p>reference or analysis in most policies and practices at the local level, while they may 
</p>
<p>actually be human rights in practice.21 In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the real 
</p>
<p>effect of human rights is experienced locally. 
</p>
<p>33. Human rights duties of local government may be classified in three main categories: 
</p>
<p>the duty to respect, the duty to protect and the duty to fulfil. The duty to respect means that 
</p>
<p>local officials must not violate human rights through their own actions. It requires local 
</p>
<p>government to refrain from interfering with the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms of all 
</p>
<p>persons within its jurisdiction. For example, in relation to the freedom of religion, local 
</p>
<p>government may not prohibit religious communities, beyond the permissible limitations, 
</p>
<p>from using public squares or municipal buildings for religious celebrations. Regarding the 
</p>
<p>right to health, local government may not deprive certain communities or groups of access 
</p>
<p>to health-care facilities. The duty to protect requires measures to ensure that third parties do 
</p>
<p>not violate the rights and freedoms of the individual. For example, local authorities are 
</p>
<p>required to take action to ensure that children are not prevented by others from attending 
</p>
<p>school. The duty to protect can necessitate creating safer urban environments that reduce 
</p>

</p>
<p>twenty-sixth session, document CG(26)5FINAL, &#8220;Best practices of implementation of human rights 
</p>
<p>at local and regional level in member states of the Council of Europe and other countries (Rapporteur: 
</p>
<p>O. Molin), Resolution 365 (2014), Explanatory Memorandum&#8221;, paras. 8 and 14. Available from

<p>the risk of violence, for example against women. The duty to fulfil means that local 
</p>
<p>government must take positive action to facilitate the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>For example, local authorities are obliged to fulfil the right to education by sustaining a 
</p>
<p>good educational system. To comply with the duty to fulfil the right of individuals not to be 
</p>
<p>discriminated against, local human rights mechanisms such as ombudsmen or specialized 
</p>
<p>anti-discrimination agencies can be established. 
</p>
<p>34. Further, local authorities should promote the understanding of and respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights of all individuals within their jurisdiction through education and training. In 
</p>
<p>particular, local authorities should organize, on a systematic basis, human rights training for 
</p>
<p>their elected representatives and administrative staff and the dissemination of relevant 
</p>
<p>information among citizens about their rights. By promoting human rights, local authorities 
</p>
<p>can help build a culture of human rights in the community. 
</p>
<p>35. Local authorities should pay particular attention to the protection and promotion of 
</p>
<p>the rights of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, such as persons with disabilities, ethnic 
</p>
<p>minorities, indigenous communities, victims of sexual discrimination, children and elderly 
</p>
<p>people. In that respect, the quality of the services that local governments provide such 
</p>
<p>groups &#8220;tests&#8221; the degree to which local governments in practice respect human rights.22 
</p>
<p>36. In a number of countries, efforts are made to mainstream human rights into local 
</p>
<p>authorities&#8217; activities. Thus, measures are taken to foster participatory governance, to 
</p>
<p>conduct human rights-based audits and impact assessments, to reframe local concerns as 
</p>
<p>human rights issues, to establish procedures for verifying the compatibility of local policies 
</p>
<p>and regulations with human rights, to report on local compliance with human rights treaties, 
</p>
<p>to have a clear allotment in the municipal budget for the implementation of human rights, to 
</p>
<p>provide systematic human rights training to local civil servants, to raise public awareness of 
</p>
<p>human rights, etc. Drafting a local human rights charter (or, preferably, human rights 
</p>
<p>ordinance which makes the charter legally binding)23 setting out specific human rights 
</p>
<p>responsibilities that fall upon the local government can be regarded as another important 
</p>
<p>step towards localizing human rights. In that context, it is highly desirable that local 
</p>
<p>authorities have human rights offices with sufficient human and financial resources that 
</p>
<p>could fully take charge of human rights issues within the respective local competences. 
</p>
<p>37. The following are the key challenges faced by local government in the promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of human rights: lack of political will, long-term vision/planning and/or 
</p>
<p>commitment; lack of autonomy, institutional capacity and/or resources; prevailing 
</p>
<p>centralistic and/or non-democratic regimes; political conflicts and tensions in the country; 
</p>
<p>the difficult economic situation in the country; non-recognition of the role and contributions 
</p>
<p>from civil society; lack of adequate coordination between central and local government; 
</p>
<p>and lack of understanding of human rights at the local government level.

<p> 23 Human rights ordinances adopted in several cities of the United States of America, beginning from 
</p>
<p>the San Francisco ordinance on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women, could be specifically mentioned as they represent a good example of incorporation of 
</p>
<p>human rights into local policies and measures. </p>


<p><b> VI. Human rights city: conceptual framework and guiding 
principles 
</b></p>
<p>38. The idea of a &#8220;human rights city&#8221; is one of the globally developed initiatives aimed 
</p>
<p>at localizing human rights. It is based on the recognition of cities as key players in the 
</p>
<p>protection and protection of human rights and refers in general to a city whose local 
</p>
<p>government and local population are morally and legally governed by human rights 
</p>
<p>principles. The initiative derives from the idea that, for international human rights norms 
</p>
<p>and standards to be effective, all inhabitants of a city need to learn and understand human 
</p>
<p>rights as a framework for sustainable development of their local community. The concept 
</p>
<p>was launched in 1997 by the People&#8217;s Movement for Human Rights Education, a non-profit 
</p>
<p>international service organization.24 It was further developed, particularly as a normative 
</p>
<p>concept, by the World Human Rights Cities Forum that takes place annually in the city of 
</p>
<p>Gwangju (Republic of Korea). 
</p>
<p>39. The Gwangju Declaration on Human Rights City25 adopted on 17 May 2011 defines 
</p>
<p>human rights city as both a local community and socio-political process in a local context 
</p>
<p>where human rights play a key role as the fundamental values and guiding principles.26 A 
</p>
<p>human rights city requires a shared human rights governance in the local context where 
</p>
<p>local government, local parliament (council), civil society, private sector and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders cooperate together to improve the quality of life for all people in the spirit of 
</p>
<p>partnership based on human rights standards and norms. A human rights approach to local 
</p>
<p>governance includes the principle of democracy, participation, responsible leadership, 
</p>
<p>transparency, accountability, non-discrimination, empowerment and rule of law. The 
</p>
<p>concept of a human rights city also emphasizes the importance to secure the broad 
</p>
<p>participation of all actors and stakeholders, in particular marginalized and vulnerable 
</p>
<p>groups, and the importance of effective and independent human rights protection and 
</p>
<p>monitoring mechanisms to which all people have recourse. It recognizes the importance of 
</p>
<p>inter-local and international cooperation and solidarity among cities engaged in the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights.27 
</p>
<p>40. The following factors could be indicated as the main reasons that have led to the 
</p>
<p>emergence of &#8220;human rights cities&#8221;: (a) a shift from standard-setting to implementation, 
</p>
<p>especially at that level of government, i.e. local government, which is best placed to realize 
</p>
<p>human rights, in particular, economic and social rights; (b) the global trend, initiated in the 
</p>
<p>1980s, towards the decentralization of governmental powers &#8212; indeed, most countries in 
</p>
<p>the world have, over the past decades, transferred important powers to local authorities; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 24 The Human Rights Cities Programme run by the People&#8217;s Movement for Human Rights Education 
</p>
<p>(PDHRE) includes the development of 30 human rights cities and the training of 500 young 
</p>
<p>community leaders at four regional learning institutions for human rights education.

</p>
<p>cisdp.org/sites/default/files/Gwangju_Declaration_on_HR_City_final_edited_version_110524.pdf.  
</p>
<p> 26 PDHRE defines a human rights city as a &#8220;city or a community where people of good will, in 
</p>
<p>government, in organizations and in institutions, try and let a human rights framework guide the 
</p>
<p>development of the life of the community&#8221; (see &#8220;Human Rights Learning and Human Rights Cities: 
</p>
<p>Achievements Report&#8221;, 2007; available from www.pdhre.org/achievements-HR-cities-mar-07.pdf). A 
</p>
<p>human rights city has also been defined as &#8220;a community, all of whose members &#8211; from ordinary 
</p>
<p>citizens and community activists to policy-makers and local officials &#8211; pursue a community-wide 
</p>
<p>dialogue and launch actions to improve the life and security of women, men and children based on 
</p>
<p>human rights norms and standards&#8221;. See Stephen P. Marks and Kathleen A. Modrowski with Walther 
</p>
<p>Lichem, <i>Human Rights Cities: Civic Engagement for Social Development</i>. (UN-Habitat-PDHRE,

<p>(c) changes in global demographics: in 2008, for the first time in history, more than half of 
</p>
<p>the world lived in towns and cities, and the number is expected to rise to almost 5 billion 
</p>
<p>people in 2030. Cities hold a unique potential for human empowerment and for solving 
</p>
<p>social and environmental problems. At the same time, they face important challenges in the 
</p>
<p>field of social cohesion. With people from many different areas and backgrounds grouped 
</p>
<p>together who have often moved to the city in search of individual autonomy, citizens and 
</p>
<p>governments alike seek to identify a discourse that unites urban residents and forms a 
</p>
<p>common frame of reference in setting out the mutual expectations of the city and its 
</p>
<p>inhabitants.28 
</p>
<p>41. The Gwangju Guiding Principles for a Human Rights City adopted on 17 May 
</p>
<p>201429 at the Fourth World Human Rights Cities Forum contains the following principles 
</p>
<p>for a human rights city: the right to the city; non-discrimination and affirmative action; 
</p>
<p>social inclusion and cultural diversity; participatory democracy and accountable 
</p>
<p>governance; social justice, solidarity and sustainability; political leadership and 
</p>
<p>institutionalization; human rights mainstreaming; effective institutions and policy 
</p>
<p>coordination; human rights education and training; and right to remedy. 
</p>
<p>42. A number of cities throughout the world have officially declared themselves &#8220;human 
</p>
<p>rights cities&#8221;,30 and several international networks of cities have developed. 
</p>
<p>43. Other concepts have been developed, both in doctrine and practice, that essentially 
</p>
<p>pursue the same objective. One of them is &#8220;the right to the city&#8221; first articulated by the 
</p>
<p>French philosopher Henri Lefebvre;31 it refers mainly to the right of the inhabitants and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;users&#8221; of the city to participate in local public affairs and define the space of the city.32 So 
</p>
<p>far the concept of &#8220;the right to the city&#8221; has been limitedly institutionalized, examples being 
</p>
<p>the City Statute of Brazil (2001),33 the Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities 
</p>
<p>(2006)34 and the Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City (2010).35 The latter identifies 
</p>
<p>six fundamental principles that are indispensable to promoting the right to the city: (a) the 
</p>
<p>full exercise of human rights in the city; (b) the social function of the city, of land and of 
</p>
<p>property; (c) the democratic management of the city; (d) democratic production of the city 
</p>
<p>and in the city; (e) the sustainable and responsible management of the commons (natural, 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage and energetic resources) of the city and its surroundings; and (f) the 
</p>
<p>democratic and equitable enjoyment of the city.

<p>44. The right to the city was specifically laid down in the World Charter for the Right to 
</p>
<p>the City (2005);36 a wide range of organizations and networks, including UNESCO and 
</p>
<p>UN-HABITAT, participated in the preparation of that important document. The Charter 
</p>
<p>defines the right to the city as the equitable use of cities according to principles of 
</p>
<p>sustainability, democracy, equity and social justice. It is a collective right of urban 
</p>
<p>inhabitants that confers upon them the legitimate right to action and organization, based on 
</p>
<p>respect of their differences, cultural expressions and practices, with the objective of 
</p>
<p>exercising their right to self-determination and attaining an adequate standard of living. The 
</p>
<p>right to the city is interdependent with other internationally recognized human rights, 
</p>
<p>including civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental rights as defined in 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties. The Charter also claims as rights and corresponding 
</p>
<p>obligations certain values not yet enshrined explicitly in international treaty law. Those 
</p>
<p>include the social production of housing/habitat and the rights to &#8220;sustainable and equitable 
</p>
<p>urban development&#8221;. The Charter also asserts a right to transport and public mobility, as 
</p>
<p>well as a right to the environment. 
</p>
<p>45. The concept &#8220;the rights of the city&#8221; has emerged during the past decades as an 
</p>
<p>alternative to the withdrawal of central and state governments&#8217; responsibilities and 
</p>
<p>resources in the globalized market. Many cities are increasingly subordinated to central 
</p>
<p>decision-making institutions, public budgets and investment, whereas municipalities have 
</p>
<p>to fend for themselves and/or compete over resources for development and services, often 
</p>
<p>without the authorities to levy revenues or participate effectively in decisions affecting 
</p>
<p>allocations. In such cases, local authorities face the prospect of resorting to the privatization 
</p>
<p>of public goods and services &#8212; with their typically harmful economic consequences for the 
</p>
<p>poor &#8212; and/or to seek fiscal support from the private financial market. The concept may 
</p>
<p>refer to the administrative, political and economic rights of the local governments in 
</p>
<p>relation to national/federal authorities, and to the presence and role of local authorities vis-
</p>
<p>&#224;-vis the international and multilateral institutions (the United Nations, the World Bank, the 
</p>
<p>International Monetary Fund, etc.). 
</p>
<p>46. The concept &#8220;the human rights in the city&#8221; developed mainly in the European 
</p>
<p>Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City37 and Global Charter-Agenda for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights in the City38 implies: the commitment to respect, protect and fulfil all 
</p>
<p>internationally recognized human rights at the local level; the commitment to give priority 
</p>
<p>attention to marginalized groups and population living under vulnerable conditions; and the 
</p>
<p>commitment to mainstream a human rights approach to local policies (not just the 
</p>
<p>implementation of human rights programmes). 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p> 37 That important document is the result of the preparatory work initiated in Barcelona in 1998 in the 
</p>
<p>framework of the Conference &#8220;Cities for Human Rights&#8221;, which was organized to commemorate the 
</p>
<p>fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hundreds of mayors and political 
</p>
<p>representatives participated in the event and united their voices to call for a stronger political 
</p>
<p>acknowledgement as key actors in safeguarding human rights in a highly urbanized world. For more 
</p>
<p>details, see www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/right-to-the-city/european-charter#sthash.E5JeKdIt.dpuf.  
</p>
<p> 38 The Charter was drafted by the United Cities and Local Governments Committee on Social Inclusion, 
</p>
<p>Participatory Democracy and Human Rights. It was discussed and approved by elected 
</p>
<p>representatives, experts and representatives of civil society from all over the world in 2011. The 
</p>
<p>added value of the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City is that each human right 
</p>
<p>featured in the document is accompanied by an action plan that serves as reference for specific steps 
</p>
<p>for local governments to take. Signatory cities are invited to set up a local agenda with deadlines and 
</p>
<p>indicators in order to assess their efficiency in implementing those rights. Full text of the Charter is 
</p>
<p>available from www.cdp-hrc.uottawa.ca/uploads/Charter_Agenda_oct_2010_EN.pdf. </p>


<p>47. Apart from the cities that generally adopt human rights as a policy framework, there 
</p>
<p>are also many cities that opt for basing policies on one particular treaty, and &#8212; in doing so 
</p>
<p>&#8212; going further than the standards set nationally. One example is the way in which San 
</p>
<p>Francisco adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women as a local ordinance in 1998. In adopting it, San Francisco agreed to be kept 
</p>
<p>to the Convention&#8217;s standards of human rights protection, and to establish a related task 
</p>
<p>force. Over the years, that task force has focused on conducting gender analyses and on 
</p>
<p>thematic areas such as violence against women, women in the workplace and girls. Another 
</p>
<p>example of cities focusing on one particular human rights issue is the International 
</p>
<p>Coalition of Cities against Racism, an initiative launched by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in March 2004 to establish a 
</p>
<p>network of cities interested in sharing experiences in order to improve their policies to fight 
</p>
<p>racism, discrimination, xenophobia and exclusion.39 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Human rights mechanisms at the local level 
</b></p>
<p>48. The protection of human rights requires independent human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>Such mechanisms may take different forms in different communities, and there are several 
</p>
<p>examples that could serve as a model &#8212; local ombudspersons, consumer complaints 
</p>
<p>boards, patient injury boards, anti-discrimination agencies, etc. The competences and 
</p>
<p>structures of those mechanisms can be very diverse, but they must be seen as important 
</p>
<p>means of safeguarding human rights and handling citizens&#8217; complaints in the first instance. 
</p>
<p>Importantly, the establishment of a local human rights mechanism gives visibility to the 
</p>
<p>role of local authorities in human rights protection. In order to effectively discharge their 
</p>
<p>functions, local authorities should be provided with sufficient human and financial 
</p>
<p>resources and be accessible to everyone within the respective locality. 
</p>
<p>49. The European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City adopted in 
</p>
<p>Saint-Denis in 2000 provides for the creation of ombudspersons as a prevention mechanism 
</p>
<p>and also as a means of upholding human rights at the local level. Ombudspersons monitor 
</p>
<p>local administrations to ensure they do not violate the rights and principles set down in the 
</p>
<p>Charter. 
</p>
<p>50. Only a few States have human rights protection mechanisms at the local level. Thus, 
</p>
<p>in Canada, ombudsperson offices are present in many local governments (e.g., in Montreal 
</p>
<p>and Toronto). In Switzerland, several cities have established ombudsperson offices. Those 
</p>
<p>offices are independent organs that mediate in case of conflicts between private individuals 
</p>
<p>and authorities. Even though they are not authorized to make binding decisions, only 
</p>
<p>recommendations, they have proven to be a successful means to resolve disputes. In the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea, several local governments have established human rights commissions. 
</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, complaints regarding human rights violations can be filed with the 
</p>
<p>national ombudsperson or with the complaint mechanism of a municipality. In Denmark, 
</p>
<p>the Copenhagen Citizens&#8217; Counsellor was the country&#8217;s first citizen counselling institution 
</p>
<p>established by the Municipal Council to create an independent ombudsman function in 
</p>
<p>Copenhagen. Today 21 municipalities have a citizen counselling institution. Municipalities 
</p>
<p>in Norway have ombudspersons for certain administrative areas. In Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina, a number of local governments have established a human rights commission 
</p>
<p>which acts as an advisory body to municipal councils, although it is not a true mechanism 
</p>
<p>for the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 39 See note 25 above. </p>


<p>51. In a number of countries (e.g., Azerbaijan, Ireland and Slovenia), the national 
</p>
<p>ombudsperson office is empowered to investigate complaints not only against State 
</p>
<p>agencies but also local self-government authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Role of civil society in the planning and implementation of 
activities for the protection and promotion of human rights 
at the local level 
</b></p>
<p>52. Civil society should actively be involved in human rights planning and 
</p>
<p>implementation at the local level. It can pressurize local authorities in adopting a human 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach and making them more engaged. It also has an important monitoring 
</p>
<p>role and can provide independent information and assessment of local government 
</p>
<p>performance. Civil society organizations may also work directly with local government to 
</p>
<p>strengthen its human rights expertise and awareness. Outside large urban municipalities, 
</p>
<p>however, civil society is often weak and has little experience of monitoring or cooperating 
</p>
<p>with local government.40 
</p>
<p>53. Local public officials should keep up ongoing dialogue with citizens and with civil 
</p>
<p>society. There have to be well-developed channels for such communication and 
</p>
<p>collaboration. 
</p>
<p>54. Measures should be taken, both nationally and internationally, to strengthen civil 
</p>
<p>society capacity to monitor and engage with local government. International city networks 
</p>
<p>such as United Cities and Local Governments can play a key role in developing toolkits, 
</p>
<p>foster research, provide opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and create communities for 
</p>
<p>action. 
</p>
<p>55. Analysis of the responses received to the questionnaire shows that civil society plays 
</p>
<p>an important role in boosting local action in the field of human rights in the respective 
</p>
<p>countries. In Hungary, for example, non-governmental organizations can participate in the 
</p>
<p>planning and the implementation phase of regulations and programmes of the 
</p>
<p>municipalities, in accordance with the law. In Burundi, civil society participates actively in 
</p>
<p>the training on human rights for the creation of programmes of information and awareness-
</p>
<p>raising. In India, civil society representatives have been contributing to strengthening the 
</p>
<p>roles of local governments in effectively addressing rights of marginalized citizens at local 
</p>
<p>level. In Switzerland, organizations are free to bring forth different projects, for example 
</p>
<p>against racism. In Luxembourg, the National Council for Foreigners is an example of the 
</p>
<p>participation of civil society in the promotion and protection of human rights. The Council 
</p>
<p>is composed of civil society representatives and is a consultative body that studies the 
</p>
<p>situations of foreigners and their integration. It gives recommendations on government 
</p>
<p>projects and recommends policies. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that in some 
</p>
<p>countries civil society does not have any role in protecting human rights at the local level. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>56. Some of the responses received to the questionnaire contain information on best 
</p>
<p>practices with regard to the role of local government in the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights. The present section of the report attempts to analyse said information. It 
</p>
<p>should be underlined that many other initiatives have been launched in different countries 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 40 International Council on Human Rights Policy, &#8220;Local Government and Human Rights&#8221;, p. 76. </p>


<p>aimed at ensuring local implementation of human rights. The best practices illustrated 
</p>
<p>below can be divided into two categories: (a) practices relating to human rights in general, 
</p>
<p>i.e., mainstreaming human rights into local authorities&#8217; activities; and (b) those relating to 
</p>
<p>specific human rights or human rights of specific groups. 
</p>
<p>57. For instance, in Australia, all government services, including local government, are 
</p>
<p>required to operate according to a code of conduct that includes &#8220;recognition of human 
</p>
<p>rights&#8221;. The Australian Local Government Association and the National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission work in cooperation to operationalize human rights locally. Further, the 
</p>
<p>Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission facilitates local government 
</p>
<p>forums, and has developed a toolkit for local government. The latter commission reviews 
</p>
<p>local government programmes and practices on request to ensure they are compatible with 
</p>
<p>the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities and provide training to local 
</p>
<p>councils.
 
</p>
<p>In the United States of America, human rights mainstreaming in local 
</p>
<p>administration is taking place through initiatives such as &#8220;Bringing Human Rights Home: 
</p>
<p>how state and local governments can use human rights to advance local policy&#8221;. In an 
</p>
<p>inclusive approach to development that gives equal chances to citizens, Burundi maintains a 
</p>
<p>policy of integrating the new national policy on human rights into the plans of local 
</p>
<p>administration. In Hungary, a priority goal is to monitor implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made to Hungary under the universal periodic review, which can and will 
</p>
<p>be done via local government. In Colombia, through its programme &#8220;Medellin Protects 
</p>
<p>Human Rights&#8221;, the City Council seeks to guarantee for the city integral protection, 
</p>
<p>acknowledgement, restoration and reparation of human rights. The organs empowered for 
</p>
<p>the implementation of those goals are the Sub-Secretariat of Human Rights, which is 
</p>
<p>composed of three units, including a Human Rights Unit. 
</p>
<p>58. A number of initiatives are building local governments&#8217; capacity on human rights. 
</p>
<p>Burundi has targeted the police for human rights training. Mexico conducts sessions for 
</p>
<p>civil servants on the new constitutional principles, including human rights. Georgia focuses 
</p>
<p>capacity-building on citizens directly, rather than local governments. In Switzerland, best 
</p>
<p>practices include the activities of the Swiss Centre of Expertise in Human Rights aimed at 
</p>
<p>raising awareness on human rights issues, such as racism; three examples of best practices 
</p>
<p>on racism include actions to inform, train and raise the public&#8217;s awareness in different 
</p>
<p>regions. 
</p>
<p>59. In Luxembourg, many best practices apply to the integration of foreigners into 
</p>
<p>society and promoting multilinguism and multiculturalism. For example, an office for 
</p>
<p>welcoming and integrating foreign nationals in Luxembourg has been created to facilitate 
</p>
<p>the integration process and is supported by the national, local authorities and civil society. 
</p>
<p>In Hungary, local governments are required to analyse the conditions of disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>groups in their area and promote equal opportunities for them. The Alliance for Democracy 
</p>
<p>and Tolerance &#8212; against Extremism and Violence focuses on transferring successful 
</p>
<p>projects and possible solutions from municipality to municipality across regions of 
</p>
<p>Germany. In Slovenia, the Local Government Act defines the rights of national minorities 
</p>
<p>and the Roma population to have formal representation in municipal councils, and other 
</p>
<p>municipalities might establish municipal bodies to deal with human rights issues. A 
</p>
<p>programme there for solving settlement issues of Roma population is managed by the State 
</p>
<p>and financially supported by the State budget. Furthermore, local governments in Slovenia 
</p>
<p>must ensure and work towards gender mainstreaming. In April 1998, in the United States, 
</p>
<p>San Francisco became the first municipality in the world to adopt a local ordinance 
</p>
<p>reflecting the principles of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women. The Commission on the Status of Women was designated 
</p>
<p>as the implementing and monitoring agency for the Convention in San Francisco. </p>


<p><b> X. Additional elements to be included in the final report 
</b></p>
<p>60. The present paper contains a preliminary analysis of the issues relating to the role of 
</p>
<p>local government in the promotion and protection of human rights. The Committee has 
</p>
<p>therefore recommended to the Human Rights Council to request it to submit a final report 
</p>
<p>to the Council at its thirtieth session (see Advisory Committee action 13/4). It is envisaged 
</p>
<p>that this final report would further elaborate on some of the issues, including the main 
</p>
<p>challenges faced by local government in the protection and promotion of human rights, the 
</p>
<p>operationalization of the concept of a &#8220;human rights city&#8221;, as well as best practices on 
</p>
<p>ensuring local implementation of human rights and relevant international and regional 
</p>
<p>initiatives.
