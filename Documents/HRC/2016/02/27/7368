<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context 
</b></p>
<p>1. Iraq has endured decades of authoritarianism, followed by a difficult transition that 
</p>
<p>was marked by an international presence, unrest and continuous violence, resulting in 
</p>
<p>thousands of civilian casualties. Despite positive steps towards building a constitutional 
</p>
<p>republic, this period has witnessed a wide range of human rights violations. They include 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, reprisal killings, shortcomings in fair trial and 
</p>
<p>due process standards, lack of accountability and failure to deliver many basic services. 
</p>
<p>Since 2003, thousands of suicide attacks, carried out by terrorist groups, have killed 
</p>
<p>thousands of civilians. 
</p>
<p>2. The so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)1 surfaced in this unstable 
</p>
<p>and violent environment. A lack of inclusive participatory processes and a failure to 
</p>
<p>promote and protect political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights amidst regional 
</p>
<p>turmoil paved the way for ISIL and other radical groups to advance into northern Iraq, 
</p>
<p>exploiting the frustration of local tribes and, shortly after, cracking down on many with the 
</p>
<p>utmost brutality and cruelty.  
</p>
<p>3. In April 2013, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) used force to end a demonstration in 
</p>
<p>the town of Hawija in Kirkuk governorate and a number of demonstrators died. Rallies and 
</p>
<p>sit-ins followed in the provinces of Anbar, Ninewa, Salah ad-Din and Diyala. The 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s crackdown on these protests exacerbated a sense of exclusion among the 
</p>
<p>sizeable Sunni population.  
</p>
<p>4. In January 2014, the city of Fallujah in Anbar province fell into the hands of ISIL. In 
</p>
<p>April, Anbar was a battleground. By May, 500,000 civilians had been internally displaced. 
</p>
<p>While ISF scored some victories against ISIL in Anbar, the latter stormed the cities of 
</p>
<p>Mosul and Tikrit in a blitz offensive in June, taking control of large swathes of the northern 
</p>
<p>provinces. ISIL carried out massacres at Badush prison and Camp Speicher and besieged 
</p>
<p>the town of Amerli in Diyala province.  
</p>
<p>5. In August 2014, ISIL seized the districts of Sinjar, Tel Afar and the Ninewa Plains. 
</p>
<p>Allegations began to surface of serious human rights abuses perpetrated by ISIL and 
</p>
<p>associated armed groups, including the intentional and systematic targeting of members of 
</p>
<p>ethnic and religious communities in areas seized. This led to a mass exodus of Yezidis, 
</p>
<p>Christians and members of other ethnic and religious groups from the Ninewa Plains. 
</p>
<p>Operations in Mosul and Sinjar triggered the displacement of a further 1.5 million people. 
</p>
<p>By the time Mosul fell to ISIL, ISF were in disarray. The Government of Iraq turned to 
</p>
<p>other armed actors, alongside ISF, to halt ISIL advances and reverse its territorial gains. 
</p>
<p>Many young Iraqis volunteered to fight ISIL as part of the &#8220;Popular Mobilization 
</p>
<p>Movement&#8221;.2 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 ISIL is on the Al-Qaida Sanctions List established pursuant to Security Council resolutions 1267 
</p>
<p>(1999) and 1989 (2011), which impose financial sanctions, an arms embargo and a travel ban on the 
</p>
<p>members of the groups on the list. 
</p>
<p> 2 The Popular Mobilization Movement was established following the seizure of territories by ISIL in 
</p>
<p>June 2014 when Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani called on volunteers to defend their homeland. On 
</p>
<p>30 September 2014, the Cabinet passed a resolution calling on Prime Minister al-Abadi to ensure the 
</p>
<p>provision of the Movement with weapons, logistics, training and salaries.  </p>


<p>6. Throughout the summer of 2014, the Popular Mobilization Movement &#8216;volunteers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>and Shia militia moved from their southern heartlands towards ISIL-controlled areas in 
</p>
<p>central and northern Iraq. While their military campaign against the group gained ground, 
</p>
<p>the militias seemed to operate with total impunity, leaving a trail of death and destruction in 
</p>
<p>their wake.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate and terms of reference 
</b></p>
<p>7.  A special session of the Human Rights Council was requested inter alia by Iraq and 
</p>
<p>convened in the light of increasing violations and abuses of human rights and violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, including unlawful killings, deliberate targeting of civilians, 
</p>
<p>forced conversions, targeted persecution of groups and individuals on the basis of their 
</p>
<p>religion or belief, acts of violence against members of ethnic and religious groups, as well 
</p>
<p>as destruction of places of worship and cultural heritage sites.. The United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights dispatched a mission to Iraq pursuant to Council 
</p>
<p>resolution S-22/1, adopted on 1 September 2014 without a vote. In that resolution, the 
</p>
<p>Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>to dispatch a mission to Iraq to investigate alleged violations and abuses of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law committed by ISIL and associated terrorists groups, and to establish the 
</p>
<p>facts and circumstances of such abuses and violations, with a view to avoiding impunity 
</p>
<p>and ensuring full accountability.  
</p>
<p>8. Also in resolution S/22-1, the Council requested the High Commissioner to provide 
</p>
<p>an oral update on the implementation of the resolution at an interactive dialogue during its 
</p>
<p>twenty-eighth session. The present report, submitted pursuant to this request, covers events 
</p>
<p>linked to the armed conflict involving ISIL which took place in Iraq between June 2014 and 
</p>
<p>February 2015. All the information it contains is based on rigorous human rights 
</p>
<p>investigations carried out in Iraq between December 2014 and February 2015. The Office 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also verified information 
</p>
<p>received on human rights violations and abuses, and violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law that have been perpetrated by other parties to the conflict and documents 
</p>
<p>them herein.
3
 
</p>
<p><b> C. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>9. The mission reviewed all available information, including testimony from witnesses 
</p>
<p>and victims and documentation from the Government of Iraq,
4
 Member States and relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations and non-governmental organizations. It followed up on reports of violations 
</p>
<p>of international human rights and humanitarian law in Iraq to verify their veracity and 
</p>
<p>establish further facts. The mission conducted investigations in Chamchamal, Dohuk, Erbil, 
</p>
<p>Kalar, Suleimaniyah and Zakho, and camps for internally displaced persons in those areas. 
</p>
<p>10. Owing to insecurity and heightened conflict in some areas of the country, and 
</p>
<p>logistical constraints, the mission could not conduct investigations in many areas of Iraq 
</p>
<p>where serious human rights abuses and violations had allegedly taken place, such as Kirkuk 
</p>
<p>governorate and Mosul, Tel Afar and Zummar in Ninewa governorate. For areas that were 
</p>
<p>physically inaccessible, the mission undertook telephone interviews or, when possible, met 
</p>
<p>victims and witnesses in more secure locations. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48/141. 
</p>
<p> 4 See notes verbales in the annex to the present document. </p>


<p>11. The findings outlined in the present report are based on an analysis of first-hand 
</p>
<p>information obtained through in-depth interviews conducted with over 100 victims and 
</p>
<p>witnesses. The credibility of information was assessed on the basis of consistency among 
</p>
<p>witness accounts and the existence of other corroborative information. The factual certainty 
</p>
<p>of the findings is not uniform; for each of its findings, the mission specifies the degree to 
</p>
<p>which it is confident that the incident occurred.  
</p>
<p>12. OHCHR thanks the Government of Iraq for extending full cooperation to the 
</p>
<p>investigation mission and facilitating access to various parts of the country. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. Human rights law and international humanitarian law are applicable to Iraq. The 
</p>
<p>events described in resolution S-22/1 amount to an armed conflict of a non-international 
</p>
<p>character involving ISIL and other affiliated armed groups, on one side, and ISF and other 
</p>
<p>armed forces which support them, on the other. The mission therefore relied on 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts of a non-international 
</p>
<p>character as its specialized legal framework alongside international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>14. Iraq is a party to core international human rights treaties and a number of treaties 
</p>
<p>containing rules applicable in non-international armed conflict. All parties to the conflict in 
</p>
<p>Iraq are bound by applicable rules of international humanitarian law, including customary 
</p>
<p>rules. The Government has faced tremendous challenges in ensuring law and order within 
</p>
<p>its territory. Nevertheless, it must abide by its obligations under international law. This duty 
</p>
<p>is explicitly recognized in the Constitution of Iraq (art. 8). 
</p>
<p>15. In resolution S-22/1, the member States stressed the need for those responsible for 
</p>
<p>violations of international humanitarian law or serious violations and abuses of 
</p>
<p>international human rights law to be held to account through appropriate mechanisms and 
</p>
<p>called upon the Government of Iraq to ensure that all perpetrators were brought to justice, 
</p>
<p>with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring full accountability. In the light of those 
</p>
<p>requirements, the mission focused on acts that would possibly constitute genocide, crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity or war crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Patterns of violations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violations perpetrated by ISIL 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Attacks against religious and ethnic groups 
</b></p>
<p>16. The mission gathered reliable information about acts of violence perpetrated against 
</p>
<p>civilians because of their affiliation or perceived affiliation to an ethnic or religious group. 
</p>
<p>It is reasonable to conclude, in the light of the information gathered overall, that some of 
</p>
<p>those incidents may constitute genocide. Other incidents may amount to crimes against 
</p>
<p>humanity or war crimes. Ethnic and religious groups targeted by ISIL include Yezidis, 
</p>
<p>Christians, Turkmen, Sabea-Mandeans, Kaka&#8217;e, Kurds and Shia.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Attacks against Yezidis 
</b></p>
<p>17. Based on interviews conducted with victims and witnesses, corroborated by other 
</p>
<p>sources, the mission collected information regarding the killing of members of the Yezidi 
</p>
<p>community and acts that caused serious bodily or mental harm to members of that group. 
</p>
<p>The information also pointed to the intent of ISIL to destroy the Yezidi as a group when 
</p>
<p>perpetrating those acts and to the existence of a manifest pattern of attacks against that </p>


<p>community, whose identity is based on its religious beliefs. If confirmed, such conduct may 
</p>
<p>amount to genocide. Numerous Yezidi witnesses provided credible and consistent accounts 
</p>
<p>of separate incidents and attacks, detailing how they were forced to convert to Islam or face 
</p>
<p>death.  
</p>
<p>18. At the beginning of August 2014, a series of systematic and widespread attacks took 
</p>
<p>place against a backdrop of ISIL incursions into the Ninewa plains and Yezidi-populated 
</p>
<p>cities and villages. Interviews with numerous victims and witnesses from Al-Adnaniya, Al-
</p>
<p>Qahtaniyah, Barah, Bazwaya, Dogore, Gogjali, Hardan, Khanasor, Kocho, Qani, Sharaf ad-
</p>
<p>Din, Sinjar city, Solagh, Tel Banat, Tel Qasab and Zummar point to a pattern whereby 
</p>
<p>members of ISIL systematically separated the men from the women and young children; the 
</p>
<p>men were subsequently taken away to nearby ditches and summarily executed. Some 
</p>
<p>victims and witnesses added that they had been asked to convert to Islam and that the men 
</p>
<p>who refused were killed, while in other instances even the men who converted were 
</p>
<p>summarily executed. Men who managed to survive such executions, largely through being 
</p>
<p>shielded by the bodies of other victims, relayed their accounts to the investigation team. 
</p>
<p>Women and children who were held captive near execution sites also witnessed some 
</p>
<p>executions. In some instances, villages were entirely emptied of their Yezidi population. 
</p>
<p>19. For instance, on 3 August, in Qani village (Sinjar) at least 80 men were killed in a 
</p>
<p>single incident. The mission interviewed survivors. One of them recounted how they were 
</p>
<p>rounded up and taken to a nearby ditch, where ISIL fighters opened fire on them. He added 
</p>
<p>that at least 50 members of his extended family had been killed. In Kocho, at least 700 men 
</p>
<p>were killed in August. A survivor of one of the several Kocho village (Sinjar) massacres 
</p>
<p>recounted how, around 11 August, Yezidi men who refused to convert were separated from 
</p>
<p>the women and then taken to a farm. An ISIL fighter told them &#8220;you will see now what will 
</p>
<p>happen to you, you pagans and peacock worshippers&#8221;. Although the villagers were initially 
</p>
<p>given assurances that they would be freed once they handed over their possessions, ISIL 
</p>
<p>divided the men in four groups of 15. The Yezidi men were ordered to lie face down on the 
</p>
<p>ground; they were filmed by ISIL fighters before being shot several times. Survivors 
</p>
<p>informed the mission that some residents from surrounding areas assisted ISIL in 
</p>
<p>perpetrating those killings. Witnesses consistently reported that ISIL fighters had acted 
</p>
<p>upon direct orders they received via telephone.  
</p>
<p>20. ISIL fighters abducted Yezidis on a mass scale and detained many for months. For 
</p>
<p>instance, a group of 196 disabled Yezidis, including elderly and ill persons and children, 
</p>
<p>were held captive in Mosul and Tel Afar and only released in January 2015. Many victims 
</p>
<p>were forced to convert to Islam during their captivity. Around 3,000 persons, mainly 
</p>
<p>Yezidis, allegedly remain in ISIL captivity. Further investigation is needed to establish the 
</p>
<p>precise number of those who continue to be held by ISIL and the numbers killed, estimated 
</p>
<p>to be in the thousands.
5
  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(b) Attacks against Christians 
</b></p>
<p>21. Although perceived as the &#8220;People of the Book&#8221;,6 a classification that grants them a 
</p>
<p>certain protection in comparison with other ethnic and religious groups, Christians suffered 
</p>
<p>forced displacement and deprivation of property. By 6 August, an estimated 200,000 
</p>
<p>Christians and members of other ethnic and religious groups had fled from Al-Hamdaniya, 
</p>
<p>Bashiqa, Bartella, Tel Keif and other towns and villages in the Ninewa plains before they 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 It is difficult to determine the exact number, particularly given that many of those who are listed as 
</p>
<p>missing were killed. Civil society organizations shared lists containing the names of thousands of 
</p>
<p>alleged victims with the investigation mission. 
</p>
<p> 6 Ahl al-Kitab in Islam includes Christians, Jews and Sabea-Mandeans.  </p>


<p>were taken over by ISIL. Among them were 50,000 persons previously displaced from 
</p>
<p>Mosul, mostly Christians, who had fled in mid-June in fear of ISIL threats when they were 
</p>
<p>given the choice to pay a tax, convert or leave. Houses and property of Christians in Mosul 
</p>
<p>have been seized by ISIL.  
</p>
<p>22. On or around 6 August, ISIL stormed the city of Al-Hamdaniya (also referred to as 
</p>
<p>Qaraqosh). Many witnesses stated that ISIL fighters pillaged and destroyed buildings in the 
</p>
<p>city, including historic Christian cathedrals and churches. Approximately 150 families were 
</p>
<p>unable to flee. Before expelling them, members of ISIL took possession of all their 
</p>
<p>valuables and identity documents. Witnesses also reported that, during the attack, grenades, 
</p>
<p>mortars and rockets landed in areas still occupied by civilians.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(c) Attacks against Shia 
</b></p>
<p>23. Interviews conducted with victims and witnesses, corroborated by reliable sources, 
</p>
<p>make it reasonable to conclude that attacks were perpetrated against Turkmen, Shabak and 
</p>
<p>other Shia groups. 
</p>
<p>24. Victims and witnesses from Amerli (Salah ad-Din), Barawjali, Bashir, Jerdghali and 
</p>
<p>Qaranaz in Diyala governorate, as well as Bashiqa, Bazwaya, Gogjali and Omar Kan in 
</p>
<p>Ninewa governorate consistently reported the same pattern of events. ISIL surrounded the 
</p>
<p>village, killed the inhabitants who could not escape, burned and destroyed houses and 
</p>
<p>businesses, destroyed Shia places of worship, and pillaged private and public properties. 
</p>
<p>25. On 17 June 2014, for instance, ISIL attacked the predominantly Shia Turkmen 
</p>
<p>villages of Barawjali, Jerdghali and Qaranaz, north of Amerli, allegedly burning and 
</p>
<p>destroying houses and property, as well as at least two Shia religious places known as 
</p>
<p>Husseiniyas. Several people were killed defending the village, and at least eight were 
</p>
<p>summarily executed by being shot in the head. Also on 17 June, the Shia Turkmen village 
</p>
<p>of Bashir, Kirkuk, was attacked by ISIL. More than 60 people were killed, including 
</p>
<p>women, children and the elderly. 
</p>
<p>26. In late June and early July, in the Ba&#8217;shika, Bazwaya, Gogjali and Omar Kan 
</p>
<p>villages, Ninewa, ISIL members allegedly summarily executed a number of men and 
</p>
<p>abducted numerous Shabak community members. At the end of February 2015, their 
</p>
<p>whereabouts remained unknown. One woman reported that, on 20 June 2014, her son and 
</p>
<p>brother-in-law disappeared after being stopped at an ISIL checkpoint. Three days later, they 
</p>
<p>were found dead in a cemetery &#8212; her son beheaded and her brother-in-law shot several 
</p>
<p>times. 
</p>
<p>27. ISIL also laid siege to Amerli, Salah ad-Din governorate, starting on 11 or 12 June 
</p>
<p>2014. Twenty days into the siege, ISIL members cut off the water and electricity supplies to 
</p>
<p>the town. At least 15,000 people allegedly suffered from a lack of power, food, drinking 
</p>
<p>water, medical services and medicine. Residents were forced to drink contaminated water, 
</p>
<p>which caused many to fall ill, especially children and the elderly. A woman and her 
</p>
<p>newborn baby died due to lack of medical services. The city was shelled daily with mortar 
</p>
<p>rounds. One child, four men and a woman allegedly died from the shelling. The siege was 
</p>
<p>broken on 1 September 2014 by ISF and affiliated armed groups. 
</p>
<p>28. Based on interviews with survivors, the mission received reliable information that, 
</p>
<p>on 10 June 2014, more than 600 inmates of Badush prison, Ninewa governorate, were 
</p>
<p>summarily executed by members of ISIL. Early in the morning, the prison, which housed 
</p>
<p>over 3,000 inmates, was taken over by ISIL. Prisons guards had allegedly fled before the 
</p>
<p>attack. The prisoners were separated into groups according to their ethnic or religious 
</p>
<p>affiliation. Sunnis were freed, while others, mainly Shia, were loaded on trucks, driven to a 
</p>
<p>nearby ravine and shot. Some survivors said they immediately rolled into the ravine and </p>


<p>were saved by other bodies landing on top of them. ISIL fighters kept shooting into the 
</p>
<p>ravine at any moving body, including men who were screaming in pain. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Politically motivated attacks 
</b></p>
<p>29. Interviews with victims and witnesses, corroborated by reliable sources, have led the 
</p>
<p>mission to reasonably conclude that there has been a pattern of attacks by members of ISIL 
</p>
<p>against those it perceives to be affiliated with the Government. Targets include police 
</p>
<p>officers, members of the Iraqi armed forces, the Awakening Movement,
7
 public servants, 
</p>
<p>members of parliament, tribal and religious leaders, candidates in parliamentary and 
</p>
<p>legislative elections and those who had publicly criticized, or were perceived to be opposed 
</p>
<p>to, ISIL. Those violations were not based on perceived ethnic or religious identity but 
</p>
<p>targeted Iraqis, usually Sunnis, deemed to be linked to the Government, or who refused to 
</p>
<p>pledge allegiance to ISIL. 
</p>
<p>30. The mission interviewed men and women from the Al-Jebouri, Albu Hishma and 
</p>
<p>Albu Nimr tribes who had fled their homes in Diyala, Salah ad-Din and Anbar 
</p>
<p>governorates. ISIL fighters are reported to have relied on lists of targets to conduct house-
</p>
<p>to-house and checkpoint searches. Numerous men allegedly disappeared after being taken 
</p>
<p>by ISIL from their homes or workplace or at checkpoints. Several relatives who witnessed 
</p>
<p>those arrests stated that the victims were forced to &#8220;repent&#8221; by ISIL.8 
</p>
<p>31. The mission received information about several politically motivated killings. At 
</p>
<p>least 602 members of the Albu Nimr tribe were allegedly killed in six separate incidents 
</p>
<p>between September 2014 and January 2015 in Anbar province. Witnesses reported that, on 
</p>
<p>28 October 2014, 48 people &#8212; including seven children aged between 13 and 18 &#8212; were 
</p>
<p>summarily executed in Hit in Anbar governorate and that, on 29 October, 213 tribesmen 
</p>
<p>were allegedly summarily executed in Al-Furat. A police officer from Mosul who managed 
</p>
<p>to escape recounted how &#8220;on 10 June, my two brothers were stopped and shot at an ISIL 
</p>
<p>checkpoint at al-Karama district in Mosul&#8221;. A former police officer recounted that in mid-
</p>
<p>June 2014, in Tikrit, &#8220;ISIL fighters asked me for my police ID card; when I showed them, 
</p>
<p>one of them took a knife and cut the throat of my father, my five-year-old boy and my five-
</p>
<p>month-old daughter. I begged them to kill me instead, but they told me: &#8220;we want to make 
</p>
<p>you suffer, we want you to feel it burns inside your heart&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>32. Based on interviews with survivors, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq 
</p>
<p>reported that approximately 1,500 to 1,700 members of the Iraqi armed forces from Camp 
</p>
<p>Speicher in Salah ad-Din governorate were summarily executed on 12 June 2014 by ISIL, 
</p>
<p>allegedly after being captured or having surrendered. The mission interviewed people who 
</p>
<p>went to Camp Speicher after the massacre and had seen numerous dead bodies in the streets 
</p>
<p>around the military base and in some parts of Tikrit. The results of a government 
</p>
<p>investigation into that incident are yet to be made public. 
</p>
<p>33. Numerous reports of ISIL looting, burning and destroying houses were received. As 
</p>
<p>a woman from Yathrib, Salah ad-Din governorate, lamented: &#8220;In August, after the fall of 
</p>
<p>Yathrib, ISIL fighters forced me out of my home with my children and made me watch the 
</p>
<p>destruction of my house. Years of my life have gone. We Sunni Arabs have nowhere to go, 
</p>
<p>we are targeted by everybody.&#8221; Similar accounts were provided by numerous other victims 
</p>
<p>who fled ISIL violence. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 The Awakening Councils (Sahwa) consist of tribal sheikhs who joined forces with the United States 
</p>
<p>military in the fight against Al-Qaida in Iraq from 2006. 
</p>
<p> 8 Reportedly, the &#8220;repentant&#8221; has three options: &#8220;repent&#8221; in a Mosque in the presence of an ISIL 
</p>
<p>appointed &#8220;emir&#8221;, pay 1,000,000 Iraqi dinar (850 United States dollars) or face execution.  </p>


<p>34. Survivors of the Badush prison massacre of 10 June 2014 consistently reported that 
</p>
<p>some Sunni detainees were asked whether they were ISF or Awakening Council 
</p>
<p>representatives. Reportedly, those Sunni prisoners listed as defending their cellmates or 
</p>
<p>defined as &#8220;apostates&#8221; were reportedly made to line up with Shia and other prisoners, and 
</p>
<p>were then summarily executed. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Sexual and gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>35. The mission gathered corroborated witness statements indicating clear patterns of 
</p>
<p>sexual and gender-based violence against Yezidi women. When attacking Yezidi villages, 
</p>
<p>ISIL reportedly engaged in the systematic and widespread killing of men, including boys 
</p>
<p>over the age of 14. Women and children were subjected to different violations. Accounts 
</p>
<p>indicate that ISIL views captured women and children as spoils of war which it owns. 
</p>
<p>Numerous interviews conducted with Yezidi women and girls who fled ISIL captivity 
</p>
<p>between November 2014 and January 2015 provided reliable information on killings, 
</p>
<p>widespread and systematic enslavement, including selling of women, rape, and sexual 
</p>
<p>slavery, the forced transfer of women and children, and inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>Many of the women interviewed were able to identify the origins of their ISIL captors, who 
</p>
<p>were from a wide range of countries.  
</p>
<p>36. Following the systematic separation of men, women and young children, Yezidi 
</p>
<p>women were further divided into three groups: married women with children, married 
</p>
<p>women without children, and unmarried women and young girls. Each of those groups was 
</p>
<p>transferred to different locations in ISIL-controlled territory. Some victims were transferred 
</p>
<p>to more than 10 different locations during a four-month period. These repeated 
</p>
<p>displacements were apparently intended to reinforce ISIL control over the victims by 
</p>
<p>instilling in them feelings of fear, insecurity and disorientation. 
</p>
<p>37. Girls and unmarried women who escaped from ISIL captivity consistently recounted 
</p>
<p>the process by which they were raped and sexually enslaved. ISIL members numbered them 
</p>
<p>or recorded their names on lists, and inspected them to evaluate their beauty. While some 
</p>
<p>were given as &#8220;gifts&#8221;, others were sold to local or foreign ISIL fighters. Some victims were 
</p>
<p>privy to price negotiations between &#8220;vendors&#8221; and &#8220;buyers.&#8221; An &#8220;emir&#8221;9 would instruct 
</p>
<p>ISIL fighters to inspect and choose girls for &#8220;marriage&#8221;. Girls would then be prepared for 
</p>
<p>&#8220;marriage&#8221; (rape), involving, in some cases, full body searches. Mission investigators met 
</p>
<p>with victims as young as 11 years of age.
10
</p>
<p> A 30-year-old woman described how young 
</p>
<p>girls were prepared for sale at a house in Mosul. They were ordered to stand and remove 
</p>
<p>their headscarves to be inspected. Then they were forced to smile while ISIL fighters took 
</p>
<p>photographs.  
</p>
<p>38. A victim witnessed similar cruel and inhuman treatment following her transfer to 
</p>
<p>Adnaani, a 15-minute drive from Baaj, Ninewa governorate. She recounted that an &#8220;emir&#8221; 
</p>
<p>wrote the names of 14 girls on small pieces of paper and called two ISIL fighters, who each 
</p>
<p>picked one piece of paper. The &#8220;emir&#8221; asked the ISIL fighters to call out the name written 
</p>
<p>on the paper. The 15- and 18-year-old girls whose names were called were forcibly taken 
</p>
<p>by the two fighters into another room. The &#8220;emir&#8221; and a so-called &#8220;imam&#8221; who was in the 
</p>
<p>room laughed when they heard the two girls screaming. After around 20 minutes, the two 
</p>
<p>girls were brought back into the room. The witness said both girls were in shock and had 
</p>
<p>blood on their trousers. Both confirmed to the witness that they had been &#8220;married&#8221; (raped). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 &#8220;Emirs&#8221;, local ISIL commanders, report to &#8220;sheikhs&#8221; in the ISIL chain of command.  
</p>
<p> 10 The pattern described by numerous witnesses is corroborated by an ISIL pamphlet on female slaves 
</p>
<p>released in October/November 2014, entitled, &#8220;Questions and answers on taking captives and slaves&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>It outlines ISIL regulations on the treatment of non-Muslim &#8220;slaves&#8221;, including young girls. </p>


<p>39. A 19-year-old pregnant married woman explained that she was repeatedly raped by 
</p>
<p>an ISIL &#8220;doctor&#8221; for two and a half months in Hawija district, Kirkuk governorate.11 There 
</p>
<p>were visible lacerations on her breast, indicating that she may have been tortured. 
</p>
<p>According to the woman, the &#8220;doctor&#8221; sat on her stomach, aiming to kill her unborn child, 
</p>
<p>saying, &#8220;this baby should die because it is an infidel; I can make a Muslim baby&#8221;.12 
</p>
<p>40. The mission obtained credible reports about the rape of young girls, including a 9-
</p>
<p>year-old and 6-year-old. The former was raped for three days by an ISIL fighter in Tel 
</p>
<p>Qaseb, Ninewa governorate. A witness stated that she could clearly hear the girl being 
</p>
<p>assaulted and screaming out her name for help. The girl told the witness that she was 
</p>
<p>blindfolded, handcuffed, beaten and repeatedly raped. Eventually, her &#8220;owner&#8221; sold her to 
</p>
<p>another ISIL fighter from the Syrian Arab Republic. In the same house, a 6-year-old girl 
</p>
<p>was raped by another ISIL fighter. A witness heard the child screaming.
 
She was reportedly 
</p>
<p>sold to an ISIL fighter in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>41. Witnesses reported that a doctor conducted abortions on two women in a school in 
</p>
<p>Ba&#8217;aj, Ninewa; they were two and three months pregnant, respectively. Prior to the 
</p>
<p>abortion, one witness reportedly heard an ISIL fighter stating: &#8220;we do not want more 
</p>
<p>Yezidis to be born&#8221;. Both women received an injection and were made to take pills. A week 
</p>
<p>after the abortions, both women were sold. 
</p>
<p>42. Women who escaped ISIL custody recounted how they were forcibly transferred 
</p>
<p>multiple times to different locations in Iraq, including Adnaani, Al-Nufus, Baaj, Fallujah, 
</p>
<p>Gayara, Hawija, Khaini, Kirkuk, Kocho, Mosul,
13 
</p>
<p>Rambosi, Sheba, Solagh, Tel Afar,
14 
</p>
<p>Tel 
</p>
<p>Qaseb, Tel Banat and Wardya. Other women and children were transferred to Al-Hassakeh, 
</p>
<p>Al-Shadadiyah, Deir-ez-Zoor, Ghazna, Membij, Raqqa and Tel Abyad in the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic.  
</p>
<p>43. Many survivors of sexual violence experienced the loss of loved ones killed by ISIL. 
</p>
<p>Some witnessed those attacks and are severely traumatized. Suicides and attempted suicides 
</p>
<p>have sharply risen amongst those women and girls. Many survivors interviewed displayed 
</p>
<p>visible signs of trauma and depression. The mission investigators spoke to men who were 
</p>
<p>desperate and felt helpless after being separated from their wives and children. One said: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;losing my wife and children to ISIL is the worst nightmare that could happen to a man&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Recruitment and use of children 
</b></p>
<p>44. Based on information provided by victims and witnesses, it is reasonable to 
</p>
<p>conclude that ISIL used, conscripted or enlisted children between the ages of 8 and 18 to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 The pattern described by numerous witnesses is corroborated by an ISIL pamphlet on female slaves 
</p>
<p>released in October/November 2014, entitled, &#8220;Questions and Answers on Taking Captives and 
Slaves.&#8221; It clarifies ISIL regulations on the treatment of non-Muslim &#8220;slaves&#8221;, including young girls. 
</p>
<p> 12 Another witness told the mission that the same &#8220;doctor&#8221; also raped victims as young as 11 and 16 
</p>
<p>years of age. 
</p>
<p> 13 Locations around Mosul included Badush prison, the village Hay Tiraan, the &#8220;Galaxy building&#8221; and 
several private houses. 
</p>
<p> 14 Locations within Tel Afar included several former Shia villages, such as Ghizel Khoun and Qasr 
</p>
<p>Mihrab. </p>


<p>participate in the armed conflict, in breach of international human rights law,15 international 
</p>
<p>criminal law16 and customary international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>45. The mission investigators interviewed Yezidi children who had escaped ISIL 
</p>
<p>captivity. In August 2014, following the abduction of thousands of Yezidis by ISIL 
</p>
<p>fighters, children aged between 8 and 15 were separated from their mothers and transferred 
</p>
<p>to different locations in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, including a school in Tel Afar 
</p>
<p>and a school on the outskirts of Raqqa, Syrian Arab Republic. Children recounted how they 
</p>
<p>had received religious and military training following their forced conversion. Training 
</p>
<p>lasted from 13 days to 3 weeks and included how to load and unload guns, shoot using live 
</p>
<p>bullets and launch small and medium-sized rockets. Boys reported being forced to watch 
</p>
<p>videos of beheadings several times. When they refused, they were severely beaten. A child 
</p>
<p>was told: &#8220;this is your initiation into jihad, you have to be strong, because you will do this 
</p>
<p>when you will go to jihad for the Islamic State; you are an Islamic State boy now&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>46. Numerous other incidents reported by reliable sources require further investigation. 
</p>
<p>For instance, residents of Fallujah, Anbar governorate, and Mosul, Ninewa governorate, 
</p>
<p>reported that children in their late teens man checkpoints for ISIL. Other allegations 
</p>
<p>indicate that children as young as 12 or 13 undergo military training with ISIL in Mosul. In 
</p>
<p>areas it controls in Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, ISIL has allegedly established 
</p>
<p>centres for military and religious training of children in an effort to indoctrinate them and 
</p>
<p>build a new generation of fighters. An ISIL video portrays one such camp near Mosul, 
</p>
<p>referring to the children as the &#8220;cubs of the caliphate&#8221;. Children are shown exercising and 
</p>
<p>reciting the Holy Koran, while an instructor explains that they are being trained to fight 
</p>
<p>&#8220;hate-filled Shia&#8221;. It is unclear how many children have received such training and how 
</p>
<p>many are actively engaged in hostilities.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Use of prohibited weapons 
</b></p>
<p>47. Allegations of the use of chlorine gas by members of ISIL were reported. The use of 
</p>
<p>chlorine gas as a chemical weapon is prohibited in all circumstances. It was alleged that a 
</p>
<p>chemical agent, likely chlorine, was used on 22 September 2014 when ISIL attacked and 
</p>
<p>killed 300 Iraqi soldiers in Anbar. Officials from Balad and Dulu&#8217;iya in Salah ad-Din 
</p>
<p>governorate have alleged that ISIL used bombs with chlorine-filled cylinders during clashes 
</p>
<p>in late September 2014. Those allegations require further investigation. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Other human rights violations in ISIL-controlled areas 
</b></p>
<p>48. The mission documented other serious human rights violations committed by ISIL 
</p>
<p>in areas under its de facto control. They include unfair trials, torture, cruel and inhuman 
</p>
<p>treatment and extrajudicial killings. 
</p>
<p>49. ISIL-established sharia courts in Mosul allegedly sentence people to such cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman and degrading treatment as stoning and amputation. Two men accused of 
</p>
<p>homosexuality were convicted by an ISIL &#8220;court&#8221; and thrown from the top of a tall 
</p>
<p>building. Four physicians were reportedly executed after refusing to treat ISIL fighters. 
</p>
<p>Thirteen teenage boys were sentenced to death for watching a football match. In January 
</p>
<p>2015, a document attributed to ISIL showed two men being &#8220;crucified&#8221; after they were 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in 
</p>
<p>armed conflict states that non-State armed groups should not, &#8220;under any circumstances&#8221; recruit or 
</p>
<p>use children under 18 years in hostilities. 
</p>
<p> 16 Article 8, paragraph 2 (e) (vii), of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides that 
</p>
<p>conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 years into armed forces or groups or using them 
</p>
<p>to participate actively in hostilities is a war crime. </p>


<p>accused of banditry. Other documents attributed to ISIL revealed that in Al-Qaim, Anbar 
</p>
<p>governorate, an ISIL soldier&#8217;s hand was cut off for theft. Owing to lack of access to ISIL-
</p>
<p>controlled areas, and the complete breakdown of telecommunications in Mosul, it was not 
</p>
<p>possible for the mission to follow up those cases.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Violations perpetrated by other parties to the conflict  
</b></p>
<p>50. The mission gathered information from multiple credible sources highlighting 
</p>
<p>alleged violations of international humanitarian and violations and abuses of human rights 
</p>
<p>law by ISF and associated armed groups in their counter-terrorism efforts to defeat ISIL. It 
</p>
<p>is reasonable to conclude that those forces carried out extrajudicial killings, torture and 
</p>
<p>abductions and forcibly displaced a large number of people, often with impunity.  
</p>
<p>51. Since the fall of Mosul, various armed groups have become an integral component 
</p>
<p>of the Government&#8217;s response to ISIL, with the line between regular and irregular pro-
</p>
<p>Government forces, and particularly between Popular Mobilization volunteers and militia 
</p>
<p>becoming increasingly blurred. As a result, the mission was not always able to clearly 
</p>
<p>determine which group was directly involved in reported incidents or identify the chain of 
</p>
<p>command. A number of victims interviewed by the mission stressed that militia groups are 
</p>
<p>in de facto command over regular forces. Such claims could not be independently verified. 
</p>
<p>Additional information is needed to establish the link between some militia forces and the 
</p>
<p>Government. The Government, however, has the obligation to exercise due diligence in 
</p>
<p>protecting persons under its jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Extrajudicial killings, abductions and torture 
</b></p>
<p>52. Between June and August 2014, a series of attacks occurred in the Diyala 
</p>
<p>governorate when militia, at times jointly with ISF, waged a retaliatory campaign against 
</p>
<p>members of the Sunni community. Numerous victims and witnesses described a number of 
</p>
<p>incidents in the villages of Baquba, Imam Weis and Sinsil, which, they alleged, all 
</p>
<p>specifically targeted Sunnis. In mid-June, fleeing armed forces allegedly set fire to an army 
</p>
<p>base in Sinsil where 53 Sunnis were being held. Witnesses discovered their bodies: some 
</p>
<p>were charred beyond recognition; others were only partially burnt, revealing gunshot 
</p>
<p>wounds, severe bruises and broken limbs.
17
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>53. On 16 June, at least 43 prisoners from the Al-Wahda police station in Baquba were 
</p>
<p>allegedly summarily executed by gunshots to the head. Some victims had broken limbs, 
</p>
<p>suggesting torture.
18 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>54. On 22 August, militia members and Iraqi police allegedly carried out two 
</p>
<p>consecutive attacks against the Musab Ibn Umair mosque in Imam Weis village, killing 
</p>
<p>34 civilians, including a woman and a 17-year-old boy, who were attending Friday prayers. 
</p>
<p>An investigation has been launched; the findings are yet to be made public.  
</p>
<p>55. The mission received multiple allegations that members of militia and ISF executed 
</p>
<p>at least 70 Sunni civilians in different locations in Barwana, Diyala governorate, on 26 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The bodies were reportedly removed to an unknown location and the 
</p>
<p>victims&#8217; families were unable to retrieve them. Other civilians arrested on the same day 
</p>
<p>allegedly remain unaccounted for. The Government has announced an investigation. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 Several militia groups were reportedly present in Sinsil following the fall of Mosul on 10 June 2014. 
</p>
<p> 18 Information suggests that the massacre was carried out by militia members and Iraqi police.  </p>


<p>56. Attacks allegedly perpetrated by militia affiliated to ISF were reported in Baghdad, 
</p>
<p>Baquba, Kirkuk, Mosul, Samarra and Tel Afar, allegedly in revenge for attacks by ISIL. 
</p>
<p>The mission could not independently verify those incidents, which require further 
</p>
<p>investigation. 
</p>
<p>57. Against the background of attacks against Sunni villages in Salah ad-Din and Diyala 
</p>
<p>governorates, numerous witnesses reported incidents involving illegal arrests and the taking 
</p>
<p>of hostages. They allegedly occurred in Al-Hatimiya, Baquba, Dujail, Tuz Khormato and 
</p>
<p>Yathrib. Some families said that they had secured the release of loved ones by paying 
</p>
<p>ransoms.  
</p>
<p>58. In August and September 2014, as ISF and affiliated militia moved against ISIL in 
</p>
<p>Yathrib, Salah ad-Din governorate, Sunni men from the area were allegedly systematically 
</p>
<p>arrested in the village of Jami&#8217;iya and at checkpoints in Al-Hatimiya and Dujail. Victims 
</p>
<p>provided consistent accounts of being ordered to hand over mobile phones, valuables and 
</p>
<p>identity documents. They were blindfolded, handcuffed and taken to the Al-Bakr (Balad) 
</p>
<p>airbase in Salah ad-Din governorate, where they were tortured or ill-treated for several days 
</p>
<p>while being interrogated about ISIL forces and their positions in the region. 
</p>
<p>59. On the night of 8 to 9 August 2014, a militia stationed at the Youth Sports Club in 
</p>
<p>Tuz Khormato town in Salah ad-Din governorate abducted up to seven Sunnis from their 
</p>
<p>houses. One Sunni was brutally beaten, tortured and killed,
19
</p>
<p> while the fate of the others 
</p>
<p>remains unknown. The mission received multiple reports that militia groups are running 
</p>
<p>detention facilities at Al-Bakr airbase, Salah ad-Din, where torture is allegedly undertaken 
</p>
<p>routinely. On 25 October 2014, for example, two Sunnis were taken from the Brigade 17 
</p>
<p>checkpoint in Dujail to Al-Bakr airbase. They were handcuffed, blindfolded and tortured 
</p>
<p>for five days by beatings, kicks and electric shocks. Up to 40 men allegedly shared a cell 
</p>
<p>with them and suffered the same treatment. One of their captors allegedly urged them daily 
</p>
<p>to convert to Shia Islam. On 11 December, a Sunni man was abducted at the Al-Hatimiya 
</p>
<p>checkpoint by fighters
20 
</p>
<p>and was taken to the Al-Bakr airbase, where he was held and 
</p>
<p>tortured for four days. He was released once his family had paid 6,000 United States dollars 
</p>
<p>in ransom. 
</p>
<p>60. The mission gathered information from a number of victims and witnesses about an 
</p>
<p>attack on 25 January 2015 against Sunni Arabs in the villages Al-Sibaya and Al-Jeri, north 
</p>
<p>of Sinjar. Based on evidence gathered, it may be reasonable to conclude that the attack was 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by a Yezidi armed group. Twenty-two people were allegedly shot dead, 
</p>
<p>including women, children and the elderly; several others were injured. The bodies of at 
</p>
<p>least six people were burnt in their homes after they had been shot. Several houses were 
</p>
<p>allegedly burnt, properties were looted and villagers were allegedly ordered to hand over 
</p>
<p>valuables. Witnesses reported that 17 people were abducted; their whereabouts remain 
</p>
<p>unknown. Inhabitants of both villages were displaced.  
</p>
<p>61. These allegations could not be thoroughly investigated by the mission and warrant 
</p>
<p>further investigation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Forced displacement and preventing access to safe areas 
</b></p>
<p>62. Multiple accounts indicate that militia conducted operations targeting Sunni in Salah 
</p>
<p>ad-Din and Diyala that resulted in forced displacement. Witnesses reported that during an 
</p>
<p>operation in Al-Jami&#8217;iya, Salah ad-Din in September 2014, militia members forced Sunni 
</p>
<p>civilians from their homes at gunpoint, beat them and shouted &#8220;you are all ISIL, you are 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 19 Documented in a YouTube video provided to the mission by the family. 
</p>
<p> 20 The fighters identified themselves as members of Jamaat al-Ataba militia. </p>


<p>against Islam&#8221;. One victim recounted that militiamen entered his house, smashed furniture 
</p>
<p>and stole large amounts of money and gold. He was told to leave and never return; his 
</p>
<p>home and car were torched. The mission received similar reports of the destruction and 
</p>
<p>burning of houses in villages in Yathrib, Salah ad-Din governorate. Victims told the 
</p>
<p>mission that militia had prevented Sunnis from returning to their villages. 
</p>
<p>63. The mission also interviewed victims from dozens of Sunni villages in Amerli and 
</p>
<p>Suleiman Bek, Salah ad-Din governorate, who reported a similar pattern of looting and 
</p>
<p>destruction after the siege of Amerli was broken. As one witness recounted, &#8220;we hoped for 
</p>
<p>the best when the Iraqi army and the &#8216;volunteers&#8217; liberated the area from ISIL. Instead, once 
</p>
<p>the &#8216;volunteers&#8217; took control, they pillaged, burnt and blew up houses, claiming that all 
</p>
<p>villagers are part of ISIL. This is not true; we are just ordinary poor people.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>64. While more information is needed on the link between the militia and the 
</p>
<p>Government, such incidents point, at the very least, to a failure by the Government to 
</p>
<p>protect persons under its jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>65. On the basis of interviews conducted with victims and witnesses, it is reasonable to 
</p>
<p>conclude that Iraqis were deprived of their fundamental rights to safety and security. In 
</p>
<p>November 2014, members of the Sunni community leaving villages taken over by ISIL in 
</p>
<p>Yathrib, Salah ad-Din governorate, were allegedly blocked for several days at the Makthab 
</p>
<p>Khalid checkpoint in Kirkuk governorate. The checkpoint, manned by forces under the 
</p>
<p>control of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), was the main entry point for those 
</p>
<p>who wanted to reach safety in Kirkuk city or Suleimaniyah governorate. Some interviewees 
</p>
<p>waited at the checkpoint for 15 days, sleeping in the street in the bitter cold. Many 
</p>
<p>witnessed children dying of cold while their families waited to be allowed through. 
</p>
<p>66. Numerous other incidents reported by reliable sources could not be verified by the 
</p>
<p>mission and require further investigation. For instance, it was reported that Shia Turkmen 
</p>
<p>who fled the conflict in Tel Afar were stranded at checkpoints operated by armed forces 
</p>
<p>under the control of KRG.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Indiscriminate attacks  
</b></p>
<p>67. The mission received a number of reports alleging indiscriminate attacks against 
</p>
<p>civilians. While it was unable to determine the intended target of these attacks, it 
</p>
<p>established that they often caused civilian deaths and injuries, raising the possibility of a 
</p>
<p>lack of precautionary measures to protect civilians. 
</p>
<p>68. On 29 November 2014, for example, in Zour, Salah ad-Din governorate, two rockets 
</p>
<p>fired from a helicopter hit a car, killing one person and injuring seven. On the same day, 
</p>
<p>fire from another Iraqi helicopter hit a house in the same area, killing at least 17 people, 
</p>
<p>including five children. 
</p>
<p>69. Numerous other incidents reported by reliable sources could not be independently 
</p>
<p>verified by the mission and require further investigation. For instance, the use of barrel 
</p>
<p>bombs by ISF was widely alleged. The use of this low-accuracy weapon in residential areas 
</p>
<p>would likely amount to indiscriminate attacks. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Mass graves 
</b></p>
<p>70. As State forces have retaken some ISIL-controlled areas, mass graves have been 
</p>
<p>discovered. The KRG Committee on Mass Graves informed the mission that seven mass 
</p>
<p>graves had been discovered in Hardan, Khanasor, Sinone and Zummar. Four mass graves 
</p>
<p>were also discovered in Khanaqin, Diyala. A further 12 mass graves are reportedly located 
</p>
<p>in areas that remain under ISIL control. </p>


<p>71. Although some measures have been put in place to protect mass graves and prevent 
</p>
<p>attempts to exhume the bodies, more needs to be done in order to make sure that the dead 
</p>
<p>can be identified and the cause of death determined.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal responsibility  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. </b>States&#8217; <b>legal responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>72. Information gathered by the mission strongly suggests that international crimes may 
</p>
<p>have been perpetrated and continue to be perpetrated in Iraq by ISIL. The primary legal 
</p>
<p>responsibility for addressing those international crimes lies with the State of Iraq whose 
</p>
<p>duty it is to protect persons under its jurisdiction and ensure accountability. 
</p>
<p>73. All States are required to determine how to implement their obligations to ensure 
</p>
<p>respect for international humanitarian law, especially in the framework of their obligation 
</p>
<p>to investigate and prosecute allegations of war crimes and genocide. The Government of 
</p>
<p>Iraq has a duty to investigate all allegations which concern ISIL, ISF and affiliated armed 
</p>
<p>groups, as well as other armed militias, and to prosecute perpetrators, including the 
</p>
<p>responsible commanders and other superiors. 
</p>
<p>74. Information gathered by the mission suggests that some militia groups may enjoy de 
</p>
<p>facto command over regular forces. If that is true, it is the Government&#8217;s responsibility to 
</p>
<p>ensure that all organized armed forces, groups and units are placed under a command 
</p>
<p>responsible for the conduct of its subordinates. 
</p>
<p>75. In light of the violations perpetrated by parties to the armed conflict in Iraq, other 
</p>
<p>States who lend support to the various parties to the conflict need to determine whether 
</p>
<p>such support is compatible with their obligations under international law.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Individual criminal responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>76. The following crimes may have been committed.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Genocide, by killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm and forced transfer of 
</p>
<p>children, as part of a manifest pattern of similar conduct aimed at the destruction of 
</p>
<p>a particular group. Information gathered strongly suggests that ISIL may have 
</p>
<p>perpetrated those crimes against the Yezidi population. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Crimes against humanity, such as murder, enslavement, deportation or forcible 
</p>
<p>transfer of population, imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty, 
</p>
<p>torture, rape, sexual slavery, sexual violence and persecution, committed as part of 
</p>
<p>widespread and systematic attacks directed against civilian populations pursuant to, 
</p>
<p>or in furtherance of, an organizational policy to commit such attacks. Information 
</p>
<p>provided strongly suggests that ISIL has perpetrated some of those crimes against 
</p>
<p>Christian, Shia and Yezidi communities.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; War crimes of murder, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture, outrages upon 
</p>
<p>personal dignity, the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without 
</p>
<p>previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court, directing attacks 
</p>
<p>against the civilian population, directing attacks against buildings dedicated to 
</p>
<p>religion, historic monuments, pillaging a town or place, committing rape, sexual 
</p>
<p>slavery and any other form of sexual violence, conscripting or enlisting children or 
</p>
<p>using them to participate actively in hostilities, ordering the displacement of the </p>


<p>civilian population, destroying or seizing the property of an adversary. Information 
</p>
<p>gathered points to ISIL having perpetrated such crimes.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Information gathered demonstrates that ISF and affiliated militia may have 
</p>
<p>committed some war crimes.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The High Commissioner is impressed by the vast number of credible witnesses 
</b></p>
<p><b>and victims who, despite severe trauma and in some cases at considerable risk to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>personal safety and security, bravely spoke out about the violations perpetrated to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that they are documented with the aim that the perpetrators will be brought to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice. He salutes their courage. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Subject to a determination by an independent and competent court, the mission 
</b></p>
<p><b>concludes that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Members of ISIL may have perpetrated genocide against the Yezidi community 
</b></p>
<p><b>by killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm and forcibly transferring 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of the group, including children, in the context of a manifest pattern 
</b></p>
<p><b>of conduct aimed at the destruction of the group. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Members of ISIL may have committed crimes against humanity by 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrating murder, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer of 
</b></p>
<p><b>population, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual violence and persecution, committed as part of widespread or systematic 
</b></p>
<p><b>attacks directed against civilian populations pursuant to or in furtherance of an 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizational policy to commit such attacks. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b> Members of ISIL may have committed war crimes by perpetrating murder, 
</b></p>
<p><b>mutilation, cruel treatment and torture, outrages upon personal dignity, taking 
</b></p>
<p><b>of hostages, the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without 
</b></p>
<p><b>previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court, directing 
</b></p>
<p><b>attacks against the civilian population, directing attacks against buildings 
</b></p>
<p><b>dedicated to religion or against historic monuments, pillaging a town or place, 
</b></p>
<p><b>committing rape, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 years or using them to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participate actively in hostilities, ordering the displacement of the civilian 
</b></p>
<p><b>population or destroying or seizing the property of an adversary. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>ISIL is perpetrating serious human rights violations in areas which are under 
</b></p>
<p><b>its de facto control; including torture, cruel and inhuman treatment, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>extrajudicial killings. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>While more information is needed on the link between the militia and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government, some incidents addressed in the report point, at the very least, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>a failure on part of the Government to exercise due diligence as regards its 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligation to protect persons under its jurisdiction.</b> <b>Members of ISF and 
</b></p>
<p><b>affiliated armed groups may have committed war crimes by perpetrating 
</b></p>
<p><b>murder, cruel treatment and torture, taking hostages, directing attacks against 
</b></p>
<p><b>the civilian population, pillaging a town or place, ordering the displacement of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the civilian population or destroying or seizing the property of an adversary.  </b></p>


<p>79. <b>In order to ensure justice for all victims in Iraq of violations of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law and human rights, and in the light of the ongoing armed conflict, 
</b></p>
<p><b>The High Commissioner recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The Government of Iraq: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that all alleged crimes are investigated in line with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights standards, and perpetrators are brought to justice. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Take the necessary steps for Iraq to become a party to the Rome Statute of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Criminal Court and ensure that the international crimes defined 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the Rome Statute are criminalized under domestic law; and in the meantime, 
</b></p>
<p><b>accept the </b>Court&#8217;s <b>jurisdiction over the current situation, under article 12, 
</b></p>
<p><b>paragraph 3 of the Rome Statute.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that the findings of all Government-initiated investigations into 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of international humanitarian and human rights law are made public 
</b></p>
<p><b>and lead to effective remedies for victims. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Engage in a rights-based, inclusive and meaningful political dialogue to bring 
</b></p>
<p><b>the current crisis to an end; and foster a national reconciliation process that 
</b></p>
<p><b>represents the legitimate interests and grievances of all Iraqis.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that all Iraqis currently displaced have access to essential services and 
</b></p>
<p><b>fundamental rights, such as access to adequate health care and education; 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish non-discriminatory procedures for access to safe zones, taking into 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration the humanitarian imperative; and ensure durable solutions for 
</b></p>
<p><b>all displaced populations, recognizing their right to return and their right as 
</b></p>
<p><b>Iraqi citizens to reside in any part of the country. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that victims of the international crimes documented in the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>report, particularly survivors of sexual abuse and sexual slavery, receive 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate support, including psychosocial support and medical care. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure the protection of mass graves and that with measures are taken to 
</b></p>
<p><b>identify the dead and launch an efficient investigation to determine the 
</b></p>
<p><b>circumstances under which death occurred.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Investigate allegations that ISF and armed groups acting under its control 
</b></p>
<p><b>failed to protect communities persecuted by ISIL. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Invite the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, in particular the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and on 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, to visit Iraq to monitor and 
</b></p>
<p><b>report on the human rights situation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The Human Rights Council:

<p><b>ensuring that perpetrators of violations of international humanitarian law and

<p><b>violations and abuses of human rights law are held accountable through the 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Urge the Security Council to remain seized of and to address, in the strongest
