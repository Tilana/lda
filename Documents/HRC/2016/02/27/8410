<p><b> I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is prepared pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 7/34, as 
updated in Council resolution 16/33.  
</p>
<p>2. At the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia 
and Related Intolerance, States adopted a victim-oriented approach and declared that &#8220;the 
victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance are individuals 
or groups of individuals who are or have been negatively affected by, subjected to, or 
targets of these scourges&#8221;, 1  recognizing further that &#8220;racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance occur on the grounds of race, colour, descent or national 
or ethnic origin and that victims can suffer multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination 
based on other related grounds such as sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
social origin, property, birth or other status&#8221;.2 Similarly, at the Durban Review Conference, 
States acknowledged &#8220;that all victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance should receive the same necessary attention and protection and 
accordingly appropriate treatment&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance has previously emphasized the need to adopt a victim-
oriented approach, to ensure that actions undertaken truly respond to the concrete needs of 
those experiencing racism and discrimination. In line with the Durban documents, the 
Special Rapporteur has highlighted that all victims should receive the same attention and 
protection and that it is essential to avoid establishing any hierarchy among the different 
manifestations of discrimination, even if they may vary in nature and degree depending on 
the historical, geographical and cultural context. All forms of racism and discrimination 
should be addressed with the same emphasis and determination. The Special Rapporteur is 
further convinced of the need to have a comprehensive approach which encompasses all 
manifestations of racism and discrimination. It is with this background in mind that he 
focuses in the present report on racial discrimination and racism against Roma, and 
discrimination based on work and descent.   
</p>
<p>4. Racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against Roma is 
addressed in chapter II, and discrimination based on work and descent in chapter III. 
Chapter IV contains a summary of the activities of the Special Rapporteur undertaken since 
June 2010. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are presented in chapter V.

<p>5. The human rights situation of Roma4 remains a pressing issue widely addressed by 
different actors. Since the establishment of the mandate on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, all three mandate holders have

 4 The term Roma, without going into the different and at times controversial definitional discussions, 
</p>
<p>refers to such persons who self-define themselves as such. Policies and practices referred to in this 
report covering such persons may also have an impact on other marginalized minorities groups.  </p>


<p>considered this issue.5 In the present chapter, the Special Rapporteur aims to show that 
despite the wide range of measures taken by States in order to eliminate racism and racial 
discrimination against Roma, they continue to be discriminated against in a number of 
areas. The current chapter also addresses the reasons of such a situation. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to emphasize that while the situation in the countries referred to in 
the present report raise concern as to racial discrimination against Roma, this does not 
imply that Roma living in other countries do not encounter similar violations. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  Legal, political and institutional initiatives at regional and national 
levels 
</b></p>
<p>6. The need to develop effective policies and implementation mechanisms for the full 
achievement of the equality of Romas/Gypsies/Sinti/Travellers is recognized in the Durban 
Declaration. 6  Valuable initiatives to eliminate racism and racial discrimination against 
Roma have been developed by a number of Governments including in Europe, where Roma 
represent a large minority. In this regard measures have been initiated within the European 
Union, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe (OSCE).  
</p>
<p>7. The Council of Europe has developed a number of legal instruments relevant to 
Roma that includes, inter alia, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms, the European Social Charter, the Framework Convention for 
the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority 
Languages. In this regard the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize the important 
contributions of the European Court of Human Rights, the European Committee of Social 
Rights and the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of 
National Minorities. The resolutions and recommendations of the Parliamentary Assembly 
and the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers on Roma and Travellers in the 
areas of education, employment, housing, access to health care, as well as policies for 
Roma and/or Travellers, should also be highlighted. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur 
notes with appreciation the expertise provided to the Council of Europe by the Ad hoc 
Committee of Experts on Roma Issues (CAHROM), the European Commission against 
Racism and Intolerance, and the team working specifically on Roma issues under the 
supervision of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Roma Issues.  
</p>
<p>8. OSCE also contributes widely to the prevention of racism and racial discrimination 
against Roma. The High Commissioner on National Minorities, the Contact Point for Roma 
and Sinti Issues within the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, the 
Representative on Freedom of the Media and the different OSCE field operations play 
important roles in this regard. The Special Rapporteur welcomes in particular the OSCE 
Action Plan on Improving the Situation of Roma and Sinti within the OSCE Area, 
Ministerial Council decision No. 6/08 (2008) on enhancing OSCE efforts to implement the 
Action Plan on Improving the Situation of Roma and Sinti within the OSCE Area, and 
Ministerial Council decision No. 8/09 (2009) on enhancing OSCE efforts to ensure Roma 
and Sinti sustainable integration.  
</p>
<p>9. The European Union has a strong human rights legal framework and a range of 
policies and mechanisms to address racial discrimination and racism against Roma. The 
</p>

</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/19/Add.4; A/HRC/4/19/Add.3; A/HRC/4/19/Add.4; E/CN.4/2005/18;

</p>
<p> 6 Para. 68. </p>


<p>European Commission and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights play an 
important role in this regard. Among other initiatives, the Special Rapporteur notes with 
interest the regular European Union Roma Summits, the European Commission&#8217;s 
communication on a framework for national Roma integration strategies, the 2010 
amendment of Regulation (EC) No. 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council on the European Regional Development Fund as regards the eligibility of housing 
interventions in favour of marginalized communities, and the activities of the Integrated 
European Platform for Roma Inclusion. At the subregional level, the involvement of a 
number of European States in the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 and the activities 
of the Roma Education Fund have also been important. 
</p>
<p>10. While the Special Rapporteur encourages cooperation of States with international 
and regional institutions, he also welcomes efforts taken by States at the national and local 
levels. He notes in particular the development of national action plans and strategies for 
Roma, national laws against racism and racial discrimination that provide good protection, 
and the emergence of good practices. For instance, the Special Rapporteur noted that Roma 
and Sinti communities in Germany acknowledged the commitment on the part of public 
institutions to ensure that the memory of the Roma and Sinti people is preserved 
(A/HRC/14/43/Add.2, para. 57). As further positive examples he also notes the 
establishment and training of Roma employment and health mediators, the establishment of 
mobile health clinics, the creation of job fairs, the establishment of Roma consultation 
mechanisms, and initiatives such as municipal Roma mediators. He also takes note of 
encouraging initiatives such as awareness campaigns focusing on the education of Roma 
girls, initiatives to ensure access to justice for Roma, and programmes on the training of 
Roma teacher assistants. 
</p>
<p>11. This non-exhaustive list of different initiatives developed at regional and national 
levels seems to demonstrate a certain degree of political will to prevent and eliminate 
racism and racial discrimination against Roma. Nevertheless, more remains to be done in 
the light of the current situation of Roma in Europe and in other regions, including Central 
Asia and Latin America.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Persistent racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance against Roma  
</b></p>
<p>12. Roma are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
intolerance when it comes to the enjoyment of their rights to education, health, 
employment, housing, their political participation, access to citizenship and justice. The 
widespread discrimination Roma face feeds their marginalization and social exclusion in a 
vicious manner. For the most vulnerable, the situation can even be worse. This is the case, 
in particular, for Roma children, Roma women who suffer multiple forms of discrimination, 
and Roma migrants who face double discrimination as Roma and non-citizens. 
Furthermore, Roma are also victims of racist violence and abuse by private actors and 
public officials.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Challenges in the areas of economic, social and cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p>13. Roma children remain subjected to discrimination in the area of education. They 
suffer higher drop-out rates and poorer educational achievements, and are often victims of 
racial prejudices and harassment, both by teachers and students. In some countries, the lack 
of identification documents and the ignorance or limited knowledge of the teaching 
language are further barriers to their access to education. This was evidenced for instance </p>


<p>by data from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, France and Serbia7 
and raised by the then Special Rapporteur during his country visits to Latvia 
(A/HRC/7/19/Add.3, para. 62) and Lithuania (A/HRC/7/19/Add.4, para. 57). Roma 
children also face segregation in schools. They continue to be placed in separate schools or 
separate classes in mainstream schools, or in special schools for children with disabilities. 
Such segregation was reported for instance in Bulgaria8, the Czech Republic9, France 
(A/HRC/7/23/Add.2, para. 67), Greece10, Hungary11, Portugal12, the Republic of Moldova13, 
Romania14, the Russian Federation15, Slovakia16, Spain17, the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia18 and the United Kingdom (in particular Northern Ireland)19. 
</p>
<p>14. Roma are also discriminated against in the area of employment in a number of 
countries, where their rate of unemployment is often high. This situation is exacerbated by 
their lack of educational skills and qualifications. It should be highlighted that Roma are 
victims of racial discrimination at all stages of access to labour markets, where they are 
often offered short-term or low-skilled employment and are subjected to racial prejudice 
and harassment in the workplace. These concerns were reported for instance in Denmark20 
and the United Kingdom.21  
</p>
<p>15. The poverty resulting from discrimination faced in employment aggravates the 
situation of Roma in terms of access to housing. Indeed Roma are discriminated against in 
their access to private and public rental housing, lack security tenure and remain exposed to 
racist violence in this context. Often they live in the worst housing conditions, in 
segregated, unhealthy neighbourhoods lacking the most basic services and infrastructures. 
Reports of Roma living in slums where they are exposed to environmental hazards such as 
flooding are also of concern. In 2010, concerns were expressed about the degrading housing 
and living conditions of Roma in Croatia (A/HRC/16/42/Add.2, para. 56); similar concerns 
about the housing conditions of Roma in Hungary had been expressed in 2006 
(A/HRC/4/9/Add.2, paras. 79-84). Housing segregation of Roma is growing in many 
countries. In 2009, it was reported that such segregation remains evident in Bulgaria, 
Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Greece<b>, </b>Hungary,<b> </b>Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, 
Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.22 Roma are also exposed to forced evictions, sometimes in 
violation of international human rights law and without adequate alternative housing

<p>solutions. Destruction of property and racist attacks also occur in this context.<b> </b>Such 
evictions of Roma were reported for instance in the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal and 
Slovakia.23 The Special Rapporteur has also expressed concern in this regard with respect to 
cases in Bulgaria24, Greece25 and Serbia.26 Roma who have a nomadic lifestyle are also 
affected in this context. They are often forced to move from one place to another because of 
a lack of, and strict legislation on, &#8220;camp sites&#8221;, which endangers their traditional lifestyle. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the significant barriers that racial 
discrimination represents for their access to health care and services. Indeed, discriminatory 
practices such as health services refusing to treat Roma, the refusal to send emergency 
services into Roma communities, verbal abuse, and segregation of Roma in hospital 
facilities reportedly remain common practices.27 The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
practice of forced sterilization of Roma women has been reported in countries such as the 
Czech Republic in 2006 and 200728, Hungary in 200629 and Slovakia in 2009 and 2010.30 
He calls for its immediate cessation where it still occurs and for the ensured enactment of 
preventive measures. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Challenges in the areas of civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>17. While the socio-economic marginalization and exclusion of Roma is one of the most 
frequent manifestations of the racism and racial discrimination they face, Roma are also 
victims of discrimination in the enjoyment of their civil and political rights. Indeed, a 
number of Roma are discriminated against in their access to citizenship and as a result are 
unable to exercise the full range of rights afforded by citizenship. Such concerns were 
emphasized by the then Special Rapporteur during his country visits to Italy 
(A/HRC/4/19/Add.4, para. 38) and the Russian Federation (A/HRC/4/19/Add.3, para. 53). 
Discrimination in access to justice is also a concern for a number of Roma, including in the 
criminal justice system where discriminatory attitudes by prosecutors, excessive delays in 
dealing with cases brought by Roma and racial profiling by the police were reported. Such 
concerns were raised for instance in Greece (A/HRC/10/11/Add.3, para. 65) and Hungary 
(A/HRC/4/9/Add.2, para. 48).  
</p>
<p>18. Roma are still widely excluded from the public and political life of many countries, 
where they remain underrepresented or not represented at all in States&#8217; public 
administration and institutions, or in political parties. A number of factors hamper their 
effective participation in the conduct of public affairs, including the persistence of negative 
stereotypes assuming that Roma have no interest in politics or do not have the capacity to 
engage, as well as the fear of political actors that the inclusion of Roma issues in political 
debate or political parties&#8217; programmes would engender a reaction of the majority of the 
population that may damage their political prospects. Legal and practical obstacles such as 
discriminatory regulations regarding voter registration, their poor educational levels and 
lack of political experience further contribute to the political exclusion of Roma. The lack 
of identification documents is also an important problem affecting some Roma that 
hampers the enjoyment of other rights and underlines the fragility of their legal status in a

<p>number of countries. Sometimes this lack of identification documents can be the result of a 
lack of registration in the country, administrative and financial barriers or the denial of 
States to recognize the validity of such documents.  
</p>
<p>19. Violence against Roma by private and public actors, sometimes resulting in injuries, 
death and the destruction of property remains a serious and increasing problem in many 
countries. In 2010, for instance the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
expressed its concern at the increase in manifestations of racism and racist violence against 
Roma in France (CERD/C/FRA/CO/17-19 and Corr. 1, para. 14). Similar concerns were 
expressed by the Committee with regard to Germany<b> </b>in 2008 (CERD/C/DEU/CO/18, para. 
18). Roma are also subjected to police violence and abuse, as reported for instance in<b> 
</b>France31 and in Slovakia32. Others racist incidents against Roma were also reported in 
countries such as the Czech Republic33, Hungary34, Italy35, the Russian Federation36, the 
United Kingdom37 and Turkey38. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned that 
investigations of racially motivated violence and crimes against Roma remain limited. The 
rise of extremism in Europe increases Roma vulnerability to racist violence. The then 
Special Rapporteur addressed this concern during his country visits to Latvia 
(A/HRC/7/19/Add.3, para. 61) and the Russian Federation (A/HRC/4/19/Add.3, para. 53). 
Furthermore it was reported that a group of skinheads assaulted Roma in Bulgaria in 
2007.39 In February 2011, the Special Rapporteur received information about racist slogans 
against Roma, written on walls by a neo-Nazi group named Nazi Swastika in<b> </b>Rome. The 
persistence of racist and xenophobic discourse against Roma by public officials and 
politicians is also of concern. In recent years anti-Roma statements have been made by 
high-ranking State officials including Heads of State, as reported in France, and 
Government ministers, as reported in Bulgaria 40 , Denmark 41 , Czech Republic 42 , and 
Romania43.

<p>marginalization, often helps explain their emigration. Once in the country of destination, 
Roma migrants who suffer double discrimination as Roma and non-citizens are often 
stereotyped as causing security problems and abusing the welfare system, and they remain 
discriminated against in a number of areas. In the field of housing they are frequently 
subjected to forced evictions, sometimes in a growing anti-Roma climate. In 2009 for 
instance, a number of Roma families, many of whom were migrants from Kosovo and the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, were evicted and accommodated in overcrowded 
and cold metal containers in Serbia (A/65/261, para. 61). In France,<b> </b>in 2010, the 
Government ordered 300 illegal camps of Travellers and Roma to be dismantled and the 
undocumented migrants residing there to be deported (ibid., para. 62). For several years 
Roma migrants have frequently been targeted by security policies and discourse that has 
sometimes resulted in their expulsion. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
express his concern about the targeted expulsions of Roma migrants to their country of 
origin, which are sometimes undertaken without their free, full and informed consent, 
including to countries where they are likely to face discrimination. In 2010, about 8,000 
Roma were reportedly expelled from France 44  and cases of expulsion of Roma from 
Denmark45, Germany46, Italy47 and Sweden48 were also reported.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Addressing the reasons for the failure to eliminate racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against Roma  
</b></p>
<p>21. While the Special Rapporteur is aware that assessing the reasons for racial 
discrimination and racism against Roma remains complex, he believes that three main 
factors, which should not be considered as exhaustive, may explain the persistence of such 
a situation. They include the lack of participation of Roma in decision-making processes, 
the lack of implementation of policies and legislation targeting Roma, and the structural 
dimension of the racism and racial discrimination they face. 
</p>
<p>22.  It is important to reconsider the place given to Roma in decision-making processes. 
In many countries Roma individuals are not sufficiently involved in the design and 
implementation of policies, and are not therefore able to voice their concerns and make 
their own propositions to protect their rights. The lack of implementation resulting from the 
absence of political will and the limited resources is also an important factor. Indeed, the 
elimination of racial discrimination and racism against Roma is not always seen as a 
priority at the national level and local authorities often fail to implement properly the 
legislation and policies developed for Roma. Furthermore, the refusal of some countries to 
collect ethnically disaggregated data in order to assess the effectiveness of the measures 
taken also remains a major obstacle for the implementation process.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>23. As stated by the former Special Rapporteur in his report on the country visit to 
Estonia, the Roma community suffers mostly from structural discrimination 
(A/HRC/7/19/Add.2, p. 2 and para. 81). Structural discrimination experienced by Roma 
finds its origins in the past historical injustices perpetrated against them for centuries, 
which created structural inequalities that still persist and continue to have a

<p>disadvantageous or disproportionate effect on them. Furthermore, Roma encounter a 
societal structural racism and racial discrimination manifested by racist, discriminatory, 
xenophobic or intolerant behaviours within societal structures, including racial prejudice 
and negative stereotypes, as well as racist violence by individuals. The building in 2008 of 
walls to separate Roma from the non-Roma population in Brasov, Romania and in the 
district of Beja, Portugal demonstrate the extent to which racism and intolerance against 
Roma is sometimes deeply rooted in people&#8217;s mindsets.49  
</p>
<p>24. Racism and racial discrimination against Roma is also deeply rooted in State 
institutions. While the Special Rapporteur is aware of the difficulty in acknowledging such 
a reality, he is however convinced that recognition is the necessary first step towards ending 
racial discrimination against Roma by State officials. Indeed, Roma are confronted with an 
institutionalized discrimination reflected both in legislation, policies and administrative 
measures, and in the discriminatory attitudes of State officials. This institutionalized 
discrimination may be reflected by, inter alia, the exclusion of Roma from national policies 
or their absolute non-existence in data and figures. Policies such as the fingerprinting of 
Roma, abuse by police, and racist statements by public officials, or the refusal to employ 
Roma in public administrations, outlined above,<b> </b>are further symptoms of the existence of 
racism and racial discrimination within State institutions in a number of countries, 
including at the highest level. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Discrimination based on work and descent, including 
discrimination based on caste and analogous systems of 
inherited status 
</b></p>
<p>25. Over the past three years, the Special Rapporteur has recalled that racial 
discrimination affects individuals in all societies and regions of the world. While the 
manifestations of racism may vary in nature and degree depending on the historical, 
geographical and cultural context, all individuals, regardless of their race, colour, descent or 
national or ethnic origin, should be offered robust and effective protection against 
discrimination. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur highlighted last year at the General 
Assembly that since the 2001 World Conference against Racism, the issue of discrimination 
based on descent has been on the international agenda. He has noted that the main human 
rights bodies working in the area of racism and discrimination have clearly stated that the 
prohibition of this type of discrimination falls within the scope of existing instruments, 
particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (the Convention). The Special Rapporteur has also referred to the draft 
principles and guidelines for the effective elimination of discrimination based on work and 
descent and has encouraged States to engage in substantive discussions on this topic and 
eventually rally around these draft principles.  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur has associated himself with the position taken by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which, in its concluding 
observations, has stated that &#8220;the term &#8216;descent&#8217; in article 1 of the Convention does not 
solely refer to race. The Committee affirms that the situation of scheduled castes and 
scheduled tribes falls within the scope of the Convention&#8221; (CERD/C/304/Add.13, para. 14). 
The Committee also stated that &#8220;discrimination on the grounds of caste constituted a form 
of racial discrimination&#8221; (A/64/271, para. 57) and that &#8220;the term &#8216;descent&#8217; had its own 
meaning and was not to be confused with race or ethnic or national origin&#8221; 
(CERD/C/304/Add.114, para. 8). More broadly, in its general recommendation No. 29 
</p>
<p>  
 49  Council of Europe, Parliamentary Assembly, &#8220;Report of the Committee&#8221; (note 31), para. 26. </p>


<p>(2002) on article 1, paragraph 1 (descent), the Committee further clarified its position by 
&#8220;strongly reaffirming that discrimination based on &#8216;descent&#8217; includes discrimination against 
members of communities based on forms of social stratification such as caste and 
analogous systems of inherited status which nullify or impair their equal enjoyment of 
human rights&#8221; (preamble). 
</p>
<p>27. Within the context of the Durban Review Conference, the Special Rapporteur 
highlighted his serious concern about an estimated 250 million people around the world 
being at risk of human rights violations on the grounds of caste and other systems based on 
inherited status.50 He expressed concern at reports of the prohibition of or limitations on the 
ability to alter inherited status; socially enforced restrictions on marriage outside the 
community; public and private segregation, including in housing and education, and access 
to public spaces and places of worship and public sources of food and water; limitations on 
the freedom to renounce inherited or degrading occupations or hazardous work; and 
subjection to debt and bondage.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur reaffirmed that the legal framework on discrimination based 
on descent is unambiguous but is not properly implemented. The vital first step is for States 
to recognize that discrimination on the grounds of descent constitutes a form of racial 
discrimination prohibited by the Convention. Without such recognition it is not possible to 
effectively address the serious human rights violations and discrimination against 
individuals and groups on the grounds of caste and other systems of inherited status 
(A/64/271, para. 58). States should also raise awareness and challenge long-entrenched 
perceptions to help shape public opinion towards fairer and more equitable societies. 
</p>
<p>29. Despite Government efforts to eradicate this type of discrimination through 
constitutional guarantees, legislation and affirmative action programmes, caste-based 
discrimination remains deplorably widespread and deeply rooted. Victims face structural 
discrimination, locking them in a persistent and vicious cycle of poverty and 
marginalization. 
</p>
<p>30. The problem is neither confined to one geographical area nor exclusively practised 
within one particular religion or belief system. It is found in all geographical regions, 
including within diaspora communities. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Manifestations 
</b></p>
<p>31. Common denominators among victims of this kind of discrimination in the 
forthcoming examples include, inter alia, untouchability, which in some cases prevents 
them from using the same public wells or water taps, drinking from the same cups in tea 
stalls, or visiting the same temples as members of higher castes or of noble clans; 
occupational segregation, which impairs their access to employment, restricting them to 
traditionally assigned jobs (generally sweeping and manual scavenging); enforced 
endogamy, thus limiting intermarriage; severe restrictions on commensality; and social 
ostracism, including social boycotts and blockades. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Caste-based occupations and untouchability 
</b></p>
<p>32. Discrimination against members of the affected groups manifests itself in work or 
occupation. Designated tasks considered ritually polluting and unclean to others in the 
social system further marginalize them as they are considered &#8220;untouchables&#8221; based on 
their employment. Untouchability has been banned in many countries (along with caste-
</p>
<p>  
 50 Joint contribution of mandate holders (A/CONF.211/PC/WG.1/5), para. 44. </p>


<p>based discrimination), but notions of impurity and pollution linked to jobs continue to 
persist through descent-based discrimination. Therefore, the notion of pollution ascribed 
through work is intertwined with caste-based occupations, which include sweeping and 
manual scavenging (the cleaning of excreta from dry latrines).  
</p>
<p>33. Bonded labour and forced prostitution disproportionately affect those in lower 
castes, with a large number of Dalits in South Asia making up the majority of people in 
domestic bonded labour. A large number of victims of human trafficking, sexual slavery 
and other forms of labour exploitation are members of low castes. Wage discrimination and 
discrimination in hiring are prevalent.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Multiple discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>34. Multiple discrimination compounds the severity of the plight of low castes. 
Sometimes lower caste societies form part of a religious minority. For instance, in Pakistan 
victims of discrimination on the basis of caste, descent and occupation are also 
disadvantaged as they are members of the Hindu minority referred to as &#8220;scheduled castes&#8221; 
(Dalits).  
</p>
<p>35. Dalits also experience segregation in access to housing; most live below the poverty 
line, earn less than the minimum wage and have no access to education. They suffer from 
numerous diseases, not least because of lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, 
and sometimes face discrimination in accessing public-health facilities (A/HRC/15/55 and 
Corr. 1, para. 25). Pervasive discrimination keeps them poor, uneducated, in terrible living 
conditions and in menial jobs (ibid., para. 26). 
</p>
<p>36. Discriminated against in terms of education (CERD/C/IND/CO/19, para. 25), 
children of lower castes are among the most vulnerable, facing recruitment as child labour, 
soldiers or as sex workers, and rampant torture and corporal punishment. Trafficking (ibid). 
and the sale of children, especially young girls, and infanticide of female children are other 
multiple forms of discrimination.51  
</p>
<p>37. Women and girls face multiple discrimination, including through sexual exploitation 
or forced prostitution (A/HRC/7/19 and Corr. 1, para. 71). Women are socio-economically 
positioned at the bottom of the caste, gender and class hierarchy, and face violence in their 
family and communities, and from actors in other castes.52 Women in Dalit Communities in 
Asia are subjected to physical abuse, sexual harassment, trafficking and sexual violence 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2001/16, para. 45). Violations of land and property rights also affect these 
women (A/HRC/10/7/Add.1, para. 52), who suffer disproportionately in terms of health 
care, education, and subsistence wages. Dalit women in India and Nepal make up the 
majority of landless labourers and scavangers.53  
</p>
<p>38. The practice of <i>devadasi</i> (in which girls are pledged for life to temples at an early 
age by parents in return for heavenly favours and to placate the gods) continues in India.54  
However, once women are ceremonially &#8220;dedicated&#8221;, they are forced to become prostitutes 
for upper-caste community members.55 Recently, most devadasis have ended up working in 
the sex trade industry. In some cases, sexual violence is linked to debt bondage.56 In Nepal,

<p>badis are viewed as a prostitution caste.57 Many Dalit women and girls, including badis, are 
trafficked into sex work. In Pakistan, it is reported that rape of female bonded labourers is 
one of the most pressing problems facing the movement to end debt bondage. 58  In 
Mauritania, women referred to as &#8220;slaves&#8221; are often forced to remain with their &#8220;masters&#8221; 
as they are threatened with separation from their children if they escape.59 
</p>
<p><i>  Intermarriage 
</i></p>
<p>39. Discrimination based on caste and analogous systems of inherited status permeates 
all aspects of life, including marriage. Seen as a method of &#8220;status advancement&#8221; for some 
in the lower castes, intermarriage is a way to dispel the stereotypes and persistent artificial 
divisions between castes. However, this practice is condemned and socially discouraged 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2001/16, para. 8) in a number of countries including India, Japan, Senegal, 
Sri Lanka and among members of the South Asian diaspora (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2004/31, para. 
37). Intermarriage can lead to violent reprisals from the families. 
</p>
<p><i>  Religious conversion  
</i></p>
<p>40. Religious conversion is viewed as a way of escaping this kind of discrimination. 
However, in certain countries it permeates religious communities. Despite constitutional 
provisions and legal measures to protect the rights of members of scheduled castes and 
scheduled tribes, de facto segregation and discrimination persist.  
</p>
<p>41. In some countries, members of discriminated castes who convert to other religions 
lose out on the basic safeguards provided to them in policies of affirmative action, while the 
previous caste status and related social bias remains at the social level. Such is the case in 
India. Unlike converts who become Buddhists or Sikhs (CERD/C/IND/CO/19, p. 21), 
Dalits who convert to Islam or to Christianity reportedly lose their entitlement under 
affirmative action programmes (A/HRC/10/8/Add.3, para. 28), including the system of 
reservation (a quota system of posts reserved in employment in Government, public sector 
units, and all public and private educational institutions).

<p><b> B. Good practices and contemporary challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
</i></p>
<p>42. The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights invested 
efforts to address discrimination based on work and descent. Four substantive reports60 and 
a draft set of principles and guidelines for the elimination of discrimination based on work 
and descent were considered by this body. These draft principles61 have been cited and 
referred to, on various occasions, by treaty bodies, special procedures, civil society and 
national human rights institutions.

<p><b> 2. National 
</b></p>
<p>43. To better illustrate manifestations of this form of discrimination, information has 
been collected from various sources and geographical regions. The identification of 
challenges and good practices has been done on the basis of publicly available information. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Asia  
</i></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the efforts of countries that have adopted 
legislation to counter discrimination based on work and descent. A number of national 
constitutions list caste within their articles on non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>45. The Constitution of India specifically provides for the abolition of the practice of 
untouchability. Constitutional bodies, special legislative measures and executive orders, a 
national commission and State institutions were established to protect scheduled castes and 
help them seek redress for violations. The Indian Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 
(Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 and the subsequent addition in 1995 were enacted to 
protect these castes. Despite this, the practice of untouchability remains a part of rural 
India.  
</p>
<p>46. The Government of India has committed itself to developing policies aimed at the 
advancement of the Dalit population. The Special Central Assistance to Scheduled Castes 
Sub Plan62 is an example, as is the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of 
Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act of 1993. Despite this Act and Government investment, the 
National Scheme of Liberation and Rehabilitation of Scavengers and their Dependants has 
failed to achieve its objectives. 63 
</p>
<p>47. In Nepal, discrimination based on caste and on ethnicity persists, particularly in less-
developed and more remote areas. The Interim Constitution and the Civil Code criminalize 
discrimination on the basis of caste and penalize acts that perpetuate untouchability with 
imprisonment or fines, but there are considerable gaps in enforcement and implementation 
of anti-discrimination laws. Marginalized groups, including Dalits, face socio-economic 
and cultural obstacles to access justice. The Government has reported increased expenditure 
on social measures at the local government level and has implemented awareness-raising 
programmes and legal safeguards (A/HRC/16/23, para. 41).  
</p>
<p>48. The current legal framework has proved inadequate to effectively curb caste-based 
discriminatory practices or to hold perpetrators accountable. Due to the vagueness of 
provisions of the Civil Code, Government officials fail to view specific acts of 
discrimination as crimes and to take appropriate action. The submission of the draft bill on 
caste-based discrimination and untouchability crime elimination and punishment to 
Parliament in July 2009 is a positive development (A/HRC/16/23, paras. 54-55). 
</p>
<p>49. The Constitution of Bangladesh prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, 
religion, caste or sex, and states that no one can be detrimentally affected in respect of life, 
liberty, body, reputation or property (part III, art. 31). The pattern of discrimination against 
occupational groups related to caste systems has been recognized in the National Strategies 
for Accelerated Poverty Reduction. In the strategies, the Government envisioned that 
disadvantaged and stigmatized groups could be included into the mainstream by allowing 
their participation in socio-economic activities. While this is a strong step, more practical 
action is needed to redress this discrimination, such as the enforcement of current laws and 
the creation of a commission mandated to address concerns related to the lower castes.

<p>50. In Sri Lanka there are two caste systems: one for the Sinhalese and one for the 
Tamils (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2001/16, para. 28). Caste differentiation occurs in both of Sri 
Lanka&#8217;s main Tamil communities.64 Caste-based discrimination is sometimes applied to 
non-Hindus&#8212;including Tamil Christian and Muslim converts and members of other 
minority groups. Caste differences between Indian-origin Tamil plantation workers also 
remain prominent. Untouchables are made to perform specific tasks during Hindu rituals 
that are particular to their low-caste status. 
</p>
<p>51. In 1957, the Government passed the Prevention of Social Disabilities Act, making it 
an offense to deny access to various public places to persons by reason of their caste. A 
1971 amendment imposed stiffer punishments for the commission of these offenses. The 
1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka does not provide for community-based affirmative action, 
but does prohibit discrimination on the grounds of caste, including caste-based restrictions 
on access to public places, including places of worship of one&#8217;s own religion. However, 
serious problems remain. 
</p>
<p>52. In Japan, discrimination against Buraku, also known as <i>eta</i> (&#8220;pollution abundant&#8221; or 
&#8220;unclean&#8221;), persists despite the official abolition of the Buraku system by the Emancipation 
Edict of 1871 and other Government measures. Nevertheless, the implementation of special 
policy measures, based on the Law on Special Measures of 1969 aimed at improving the 
living environment of Buraku districts and improving access to employment and education 
for Buraku (E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.2 and Corr. 1, para. 15), gave positive results. Other 
achievements include the increase in the rate of Buraku children going to senior high 
school, and a certain increase of public understanding of the problems facing Buraku.65 
</p>
<p>53. The only provision in national legislation prohibiting racial discrimination is article 
14 of the Constitution, but its provisions are not considered by courts to be self-executing. 
Since the provisions of the Convention are also considered to be not self-executing, there is 
no provision in national legislation that outlaws racial discrimination and provides for a 
judicial remedy for the victims (E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.2 and Corr. 1, para. 11). 
</p>
<p>54. The governmental strategy to fight discriminatory mentality against Buraku and 
other groups is carried out principally through human rights education policies promoted by 
the Ministry of Education (ibid., para. 16). However, there is still no public authority 
specifically mandated to deal with burakumin discrimination. 
</p>
<p>55. The practice of hiring investigation or detective agencies to investigate the personal 
backgrounds of people to identify whether someone is of Buraku origin is not unusual in 
Japan. Some companies even continue to use &#8220;Buraku lists&#8221; (ibid., para. 21).  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Africa 
</i></p>
<p>56. Descent-based discrimination is mainly of three types in Africa. First are caste 
systems based on &#8220;occupational specialization of endogamous groups, in which 
membership is based on ascription and between which social distance is regulated by the 
concept of pollution&#8221;.66 The second is discrimination based on real or perceived descent 
from slaves, leaving many in &#8220;virtual&#8221; slavery, unable to leave their owner&#8217;s employ for 
fear of reprisals or starvation. The third is against the hunter-gatherer societies and their

<p>descendants. This marginalization may contain aspects of a purity-pollution dyad, as well 
as degrees of real or perceived occupation specialization.67 
</p>
<p>57. Many African states have adopted measures to tackle caste-based discrimination. 
Some have adopted constitutional provisions guaranteeing freedom from discrimination. 
Others have enacted laws banning caste discrimination and slavery. However, these 
provisions have not been enforced.  
</p>
<p>58. In Nigeria, discrimination against Osu descendants remains a concern. Osu people 
were historically &#8220;owned&#8221; by deities among communities in Igboland, in south-east 
Nigeria. They were dedicated and &#8220;sacrificed&#8221; to these gods and were forced to live on the 
outskirts of villages to be the target of any bad luck that might occur. Being an Osu is a 
position ascribed at birth, based on descent.68 
</p>
<p>59. Chapter IV, article 42, of the Constitution guarantees the right to freedom from 
discrimination for every citizen of Nigeria. In addition, the 1958 Osu Abolition Law legally 
abolished work- and descent-based discrimination. However, concerns remain about 
persistent allegations that members of Osu and other similar communities are still subjected 
to social exclusion, segregation and mistreatment, as well as discrimination in 
employment69 and marriage (CERD/C/NGA/CO/18, para. 15). Since the enactment of the 
Osu Abolition Law, no cases have been prosecuted in connection with the law because no 
claims of its violation have been made (CERD/C/SR.1720, para. 3). In this regard, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has made recommendations to 
Nigeria (CERD/C/NGA/CO/18, para. 15). 
</p>
<p>60. Caste systems exist within several ethnic groups in Senegal. All characteristics of 
caste can be found among the Wolof community, principally divided between the <i>geer</i> and 
the <i>neeno</i>. The Constitution of Senegal proclaims the right of all citizens to equal protection 
of the law regardless of race, religion, sex, or origin, a reference to one&#8217;s caste background 
(art. 1), and prohibits all acts of racial, ethnic and religious discrimination (art. 5). 
However, the extent to which neeno castes approach the courts for legal redress on 
discrimination claims is negligible.70 
</p>
<p>61. In Somalia, society is divided into patrilineal segmented and ranked clan groups. 
Among Somalia&#8217;s minorities, the &#8220;occupational groups&#8221; include Midgan (or Madhiban), 
Tumal and Yibro.71 These groups are also known as &#8220;sab&#8221;, a collective term for &#8220;low-
caste&#8221;. Tumal are traditionally blacksmiths; Yibro, ritual specialists; and Midgan, 
traditionally hunters and leatherworkers, but who also undertook various arts and craft 
work, male circumcision and female genital mutilation. The few educated members of 
occupational groups work in any chosen field, but most work in manual and service jobs.72 
The occupations of the sab groups are generally regarded as polluting. The sab groups are 
also feared and avoided as they have a reputation for occult practices. With the 
disappearance of their traditional lifestyles, and as a result of conflict, many have moved to 
urban settlements or internally displaced persons camps or fled to refugee camps in

</p>
<p>62. The situation of minorities varies in terms of geographical areas. In Somaliland, 
article 8, paragraph 1, of the Constitution of May 2001 states that all citizens &#8220;shall enjoy 
equal rights and obligations before the law, and shall not be accorded precedence on 
grounds of colour, clan, birth, language, gender, property, status, opinion, etc&#8221;. Under 
article 8, paragraph 2, &#8220;precedence and discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, clan 
affiliation, birth and residence is prohibited&#8221;; and &#8220;programmes aimed at eradicating long 
lasting bad practices shall be a national obligation&#8221;. However, there is no specific anti-
discrimination legislation. 73  Puntland has provided little protection or assistance to 
minorities and the parliament has no seats reserved for small minority communities, 
including for Madhiban.74

<p>63. In Yemen, work- and descent-based discrimination affects the Akhdam (&#8220;servant&#8221; or 
&#8220;the marginalized ones&#8221;) social group. Traditionally, land was the most important resource 
and those who did not own agricultural land worked in marginal occupations and services, 
and became part of the servant class (CERD/C/YEM/16, para. 159). Typical Akhdam 
occupational roles include garbage collection, street sweeping, and cleaning toilets and 
drains. They are often referred to generically as &#8220;sweepers&#8221; and are widely regarded as 
being dirty, immoral and dependent. The &#8220;low social status of this group stems from the 
members occupation as well as their [reputed] ethnic origins&#8221; (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/24, 
paras. 31-34). Dominant social opinion considers their men unscrupulous, lazy, unfit and 
unable to hold respectful jobs. The women are often stereotyped as promiscuous, unclean 
and leading lives as beggars and even prostitutes75 and children are considered to belong to 
a social category of so-called &#8220;servants&#8221; (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2004/31, para. 32). 
</p>
<p>64. The Yemeni Constitution maintains a bill of rights guaranteeing a wide range of 
rights and freedoms (arts. 41-61) to &#8220;all citizens&#8221;. It also provides for equal opportunities in 
all economic, social, political and cultural activities (art. 24) and guarantees equal treatment 
before the Law. According to article 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, &#8220;citizens are 
equal before the law and an individual may not be punished or harmed on grounds of 
nationality, race, origin, language, belief, occupation, standard of education or social status&#8221; 
(CCPR/C/YEM/2001/3, para. 9). However, de facto discrimination persists. The 
Constitution is neither implemented nor adequate to address the specific discrimination 
against this minority.76 
</p>
<p>65. The Government looks at the issue of marginalization of the &#8220;servant class&#8221; from a 
socio-economic perspective, since the legislative framework does not discriminate among 
citizens (CERD/C/YEM/16, para. 160).

<p>  Diaspora communities  
</p>
<p>66. Discrimination on the basis of work and descent continues to affect diaspora 
communities whose original cultures and traditions include aspects of inherited social 
exclusion. For example, the caste system has migrated with the South Asian diaspora and is 
observed, to varying degrees, in different geographical regions. Some reports indicate 
ongoing discrimination against Midgan-Madibhan in the Somali diaspora, and in certain 
West African diaspora communities (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2004/31, para. 35). 
</p>
<p>67. Despite the limited information available on the issue, the Special Rapporteur has 
identified a good practice regarding the diaspora community in the United Kingdom, where 
the previous anti-discrimination legal regime has been replaced by the Equality Act 2010. 
This legislative framework aims to protect the rights of individuals and advance equality of 
opportunity for all. Initially, the Act covered nine protected characteristics (sex, gender 
reassignment, race, religion or belief, age, disability, sexual orientation, marriage and civil 
partnership, and pregnancy and maternity) in areas such as work, education and goods and 
services. It makes provision for the advancement of equality, through the public sector 
equality duty and through positive action.  
</p>
<p>68. During the passage of the Equality Bill through Parliament, the Government 
considered that available evidence did not indicate that caste discrimination was a 
significant problem in the United Kingdom in the areas covered by discrimination 
legislation; however, it acknowledged that the protected characteristics of race, religion and 
belief might not always allow an avenue of redress for caste discrimination. It accepted an 
amendment to the Equality Bill, inserting section 9 of the Act, which provides that a 
Minister may by order amend that section to provide for caste to be an aspect of race (and 
to provide for exceptions in the Act to apply, or not to apply, to caste). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>69. Country visits are an essential part of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities. They 
provide an important opportunity for the mandate holder to interact with Government 
representatives and members of civil society. In the planning of such fact-finding missions 
the Special Rapporteur pays particular attention to geographic balance.  
</p>
<p>70. From 21 to 28 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur visited Singapore. He expresses 
his sincere gratitude to the Government of Singapore for its full cooperation and openness 
in the preparation and conduct of his visit. The report is included in document 
A/HRC/17/40/Add.2. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia, which has accepted his request to visit the country. He plans to undertake 
the mission before the end of 2011.  
</p>
<p>72. He would like also to thank the Government of South Africa for inviting him to 
conduct a mission, which he plans to carry out before the end of 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Other activities  
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur has participated in several seminars and conferences since 
June 2010. On 1 June 2010, he delivered a statement on racism and xenophobia affecting 
migrants at a conference on human rights and migrants organized by the Council of Europe, </p>


<p>the Government of Portugal and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR). On 15 June 2010, he addressed the issue of racism and conflict 
in a joint press release concerning ethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan. On 30 June 2010, he 
participated for the first time in the session on xenophobia organized within the framework 
of the annual consultations of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees with non-governmental organizations in Geneva. On 18 October 2010, he 
delivered a statement at the thematic discussion on &#8220;Structural discrimination: definitions, 
approaches and trends&#8221; during the eighth session of the Intergovernmental Working Group 
on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>74. In the context of the International Year for People of African Descent, the Special 
Rapporteur contributed in writing to the thematic discussion on &#8220;Racial discrimination 
against People of African Descent&#8221; held by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination in Geneva on 7 March 2011. In addition, on 29 March 2011, he delivered a 
statement at the tenth session of the Working Group of Experts on People of African 
Descent. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur has also submitted written contributions to the following 
meetings: the seminar on data collection and the use of indicators to promote and monitor 
racial equality and non-discrimination held by OHCHR in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 5 May 
2010; the seminar on the fight against discrimination based on racial, ethnic, religious, or 
other bias held by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance in Ankara on 
10 and 11 January 2011; and the expert workshops on the prohibition of incitement to 
national, racial or religious hatred, held by OHCHR in Vienna on 9 to 10 February 2011 
and in Nairobi on 6 and 7 April 2011.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
against Roma 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur takes note of efforts undertaken to eliminate racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against Roma. However, 
while positive developments and good practices have been identified, both at the 
regional and national levels, they have been insufficient. Indeed, important challenges 
remain that reveal grave and deep-rooted problems of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against Roma that need to be addressed in the 
most vigorous manner.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>To this end, it is essential that States develop a comprehensive approach based 
on stronger legal, political and institutional measures that would: (a) take into account 
the structural dimension of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related 
intolerance against Roma; (b) duly consider the interrelation between the racism and 
racial discrimination they suffer and their socio-economic marginalization and 
political exclusion; and (c) pay due attention to the situation of the most vulnerable 
Roma. In this regard the necessary legislative measures should be adopted and 
complemented by key measures such as: (a) affirmative actions to redress historical 
inequalities; (b) human rights training of State agents; and (c) educational and 
awareness-raising measures to foster mutual understanding, respect and tolerance. 
States should bear in mind that efficiency could be achieved and progress realized 
only with appropriate implementation of the measures adopted for Roma, effective 
participation of Roma, and due cooperation with civil society, and international and 
regional mechanisms. States are also encouraged to share good practices that have </b></p>


<p><b>contributed to improving the human rights situation of Roma. In line with this, the 
following recommendations can be used by States as tools for further progress.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Concerning the challenges faced by Roma in education, employment, housing, 
and health, the Special Rapporteur recommends that States:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that Roma children and youth, including girls, are given equal 
access to education, and refrain from any legal or any other measures leading to 
imposed racial segregation in any form in access to schooling. Firm measures to 
eliminate racial prejudices and harassment of Roma children in schools should also be 
taken; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure a more robust enforcement of their legislation prohibiting 
discrimination in employment and take further measures to protect Roma against the 
discriminatory practices that affect them in the labour market. Affirmative action to 
promote their employment is also encouraged; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Guarantee the right of Roma to housing without discrimination as 
provided in article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Racial Discrimination (the Convention) and act firmly against any discriminatory 
practices affecting them in this area, taking into consideration general 
recommendation No. 27 (2000) of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination on discrimination against Roma and general comment No. 7 (1997) of 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on forced evictions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Take all the necessary measures to ensure that Roma enjoy the full right 
to health and health care, and address the discriminatory practices among medical 
professionals, including through sensitization measures on Roma rights, culture and 
identity among such personnel. Forced sterilization of Roma women must be 
prohibited under the law and sanctioned properly, and the victims should be provided 
with effective remedies and appropriate medical assistance.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Regarding racial discrimination and racism experienced by Roma in the 
enjoyment of their civil and political rights, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
States:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Further promote the participation of Roma in political and public life, 
and ensure their adequate representation in State institutions and political parties. In 
this regard, special measures to improve their political, policymaking and public 
administration skills should be taken. Political parties should also work towards fair 
representation of Roma within and at all levels of their party system; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that their legislation regarding nationality, citizenship and 
naturalization does not discriminate against Roma, and take appropriate measures to 
ensure their access to justice and effective remedies without discrimination. 
Furthermore, all the necessary measures should be taken to ensure that Roma 
individuals have access to personal documents to effectively enjoy all their human 
rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Condemn and prohibit racial violence against Roma. In this regard 
States should introduce in criminal law a provision according to which committing an 
offence with racist or xenophobic motivations or aims constitutes an aggravating 
circumstance allowing for enhanced penalties. Prompt, thorough and impartial 
investigations of racist acts against Roma should also be undertaken and the 
responsible persons adequately prosecuted and sanctioned. Roma victims should be 
provided with access to effective legal remedies and adequate reparation. Efforts 
should also be taken to improve relations between the police and Roma to restore 
confidence and allow a better reporting of racist acts to the police. Furthermore, due </b></p>


<p><b>to the audience they reach and the moral authority they carry, politicians are urged to 
avoid the stigmatization of Roma in their statements and political debates, and to 
firmly condemn any racist or xenophobic action or discourse against Roma. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States avoid portraying the situation 
of Roma migrants as an issue of public security and refrain from implementing 
security policies targeting Roma migrants in violation of international human rights 
standards and which lead to their collective expulsions. He calls upon States to respect 
the rights of Roma migrants as guaranteed by the relevant regional and international 
human rights instruments.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>States are urged to adopt appropriate measures to ensure that Roma, including 
Roma women, participate effectively in the design, decision-making, implementation, 
and evaluation processes of the policies that affect them. States are also encouraged to 
strengthen and better coordinate their implementation efforts at the national and 
local levels, and to allocate the requisite resources in this regard. Regular assessment 
of the measures taken, including through the collection of ethnically disaggregated 
data, is also recommended. Such a collection must be done in consultation with Roma 
and in accordance with international human rights standards. Finally, appropriate 
mechanisms of dialogue between Roma and local authorities should be established to 
ensure appropriate implementation of the policies and legislation applying to Roma at 
the local level.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>To address the root causes of racism and racial discrimination against Roma 
within society and build a society based on tolerance, respect for cultural diversity and 
non-discrimination, the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that States invest in 
education. In this regard he recommends in particular the teaching in school of the 
history of Roma, including the genocide they suffered during the Nazi regime. 
Awareness-raising measures to inform and sensitize non-Roma populations about the 
Roma history, identity and culture should complement education efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Racial discrimination and racism within State institutions is a reality that 
States should not deny. In this regard it is important to ensure that their legal 
framework and the attitudes of their agents comply with their international human 
rights obligations. Therefore, States should ensure that their legal framework is 
consistent with international human rights standards, including the Convention, the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, and the outcome document of the 
Durban Review Conference. They should also provide mandatory human rights 
trainings focusing on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance to States officials, and take measures to ensure that the composition of 
State institutions and the public administration reflects the multicultural diversity of 
their population. Special measures to promote the employment of Roma in the public 
administration and institutions at all levels should be taken in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>To conclude, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall the importance of 
cooperating with civil society and international and regional human rights institutions 
to effectively eliminate discrimination against Roma. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Discrimination based on work and descent, including discrimination 
based on caste and analogous systems of inherited status 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur encountered difficulties in researching for the present 
report, particularly in the area of discrimination based on work and descent, 
including discrimination based on caste and analogous systems of inherited status. 
These difficulties included the paucity of sources and lack of recent public </b></p>


<p><b>information, in particular regarding affected communities outside Asia. Further study 
of this issue is necessary.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Notwithstanding the existence of international legal obligations to protect 
against discrimination based on work and descent, certain Governments have failed to 
implement such obligations effectively and have, in some instances, sidestepped the 
question of caste discrimination by claiming that it does not fall under the scope of the 
international conventions, such as the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, in contrast to the opinion of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>However, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that some 
Governments have taken initiatives to address the problems facing communities 
affected by discrimination based on work and descent, and encourages them to 
continue their efforts, share best practices and take the lead in regional and 
international initiatives to eliminate this form of discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In several cases, the Special Rapporteur notes that shortcomings do not stem 
only from Governments and institutions but from the population itself, including 
within communities considered of lower caste or status. He recommends that 
measures with regard to the legal framework be taken hand-in-hand with awareness-
raising, with a special emphasis on the judiciary, police and civil service, to ensure 
effective implementation and enforcement of the law by the police and civil service to 
ensure access to justice and right to an effective remedy for victims.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Encourages the participation of Governments and civil society in broad 
local and national consultations on discrimination based on work and descent;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Calls upon States to foster the empowerment of victims, and especially 
women;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Recommends the collection of disaggregated data, on a regular basis, to 
be able to identify the number of people affected and design appropriate strategies to 
fight this kind of discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Moreover, the Special Rapporteur recommends: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The enactment of laws and consistent implementation of existing laws, 
including the monitoring of domestic legal provisions as recommended by treaty 
bodies and other Special Rapporteurs. The general measures contained in general 
recommendation No. 29 (2002) of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination should also be implemented. Specific legislation to outlaw direct and 
indirect racial discrimination against the affected groups is recommended;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The continued use of the draft principles and guidelines on 
discrimination based on work and descent as a guiding framework for the elaboration 
of effective measures to be taken by States to fulfil international legal obligations, 
including the duty of Governments to engage in genuine efforts to dispel the 
prejudicial beliefs that constitute, support and reinforce discrimination based on work 
and descent, including notions of untouchability; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) That, where appropriate and taking into consideration the specific 
situation of each country, the design and implementation of affirmative action 
measures or programmes, including quota systems in the areas of education and 
employment, be considered. </b></p>


<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites Governments: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To engage in programmes promoting capacity-building and technical 
assistance through bilateral, regional and international cooperation aiming at the 
elimination of discrimination based on work and descent, including discrimination 
based on caste and analogous systems of inherited status;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To implement recommendations of United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, civil society and NHRIs pertaining to patterns of human rights violations 
against the so-called lower castes, and, where necessary, to expand the mandates of 
NHRIs to ensure appropriate monitoring and follow up to recommendations;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To consider creating a consultative body of regional human rights 
institutions to study the issue and raise regional awareness; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) To include information on the issue of discrimination based on caste and 
other analogous systems of inherited status in their reports to United Nations human 
rights bodies.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the full spectrum of special 
procedures address the issue of discrimination based on caste and other analogous 
systems of inherited status in the context of their respective mandates. 
</b></p>
