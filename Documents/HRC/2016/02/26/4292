<p><b>  16/&#8230; Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
 punishment: mandate of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that no one shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>that freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment is a non-derogable right under international law that must be respected and<b> 
</b>protected<b> </b>under all circumstances, including in times of international and internal armed 
conflict or internal disturbance or any other public emergency; that the absolute prohibition 
of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is affirmed in the 
relevant international instruments; and that legal and procedural safeguards against such 
acts must not be subject to measures that would circumvent this right, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that the prohibition of torture is a peremptory norm of international 
law, and<b> </b>that international, regional and domestic courts have held the prohibition of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to be customary international law,  
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the definition of torture contained in article 1 of the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, without 
prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation that contains or may contain 
provisions of wider application, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that, under the Geneva Conventions of 1949, torture and inhuman treatment 
are a grave breach and that, under the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>Former Yugoslavia, the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, acts of torture can constitute crimes 
against humanity and war crimes,  
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Welcoming<b></b></i><b> </b>the entry into force of the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the implementation of which will make a 
significant contribution to the prevention and prohibition of torture, including by 
prohibiting places of secret detention and encouraging all States that have not ratifyied or 
acceded to the Convention to consider doing so,  
</p>
<p> <i>Commending</i> the persistent efforts by civil society, in particular non-governmental 
organizations, national human rights institutions and national preventive mechanisms, and 
the considerable network of centres for the rehabilitation of torture victims to prevent and 
combat torture and to alleviate the suffering of victims of torture,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council 
and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Council of 18 
June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her duties in 
accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> all relevant resolutions of the General Assembly<b>,</b> the Economic and 
Social Council<b>, </b>the Human Rights Council and the Commission on Human Rights on the 
subject,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns</i> all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including through intimidation<b>, </b>which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States<b> </b>to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable<b> </b>prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in particular</i> any action or attempt by States or public officials to 
legalize, authorize or acquiesce to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment<b> </b>under any circumstances, including on grounds of national security or 
through judicial decisions, and urges States to ensure accountability for such actions or 
attempts to commit them; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>3.<b> </b><i>Stresses</i> the contribution of the ad hoc international criminal tribunals and the 
International Criminal Court to ending impunity, through ensuring accountability and 
punishing perpetrators, and urges States to consider ratifying or acceding as a matter of 
priority to the Rome Statute, which entered into force on 1 July 2002;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 4.  <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment for a further period of three years:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To seek, receive, examine and act on information from Governments,

degrading treatment or punishment;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>)  To conduct country visits with the consent or at the invitation of 
Governments;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>)  To study, in a comprehensive manner, trends, developments and challenges

</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>)  To identify, exchange and promote best practices on measures to prevent, 
punish and eradicate torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To integrate a gender perspective throughout the work of his or her mandate;  </p>


<p> (<i>f</i>) To continue to cooperate with the Committee against Torture, the 
Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture and relevant United Nations mechanisms and 
bodies and, as appropriate, regional organizations and mechanisms, national human rights 
institutions, national preventive mechanisms and civil society, including non-governmental 
organizations;  
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To report on his or her activities, observations, conclusions and 
recommendations to the Council, in accordance with its programme of work, and annually 
on the overall trends and developments with regard to his or her mandate to the General 
Assembly;  
</p>
<p> 5.  <i>Takes note</i> <i>with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur and the 
victim-centred approach contained therein;1 
</p>
<p> 6.  <i>Urges</i> States:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>)  To cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his 
or her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to fully and 
expeditiously respond<b> </b>to and follow up on his or her urgent appeals, and urges those 
Governments that have not yet responded to communications transmitted to them by the 
Special Rapporteur to answer without further delay;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>)  To give serious consideration to responding favourably to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s requests to visit their countries and to enter into a constructive dialogue with 
the Special Rapporteur on facilitating requested visits to their countries;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure, as an important element in the prevention and combat of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, that no authority or 
official orders, applies, permits or tolerates any sanction or other prejudice against any 
person or organization for having been in contact with the Special Rapporteur or any other 
international or national monitoring or preventive body active in the prevention and combat 
of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;<b> </b>  
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>)  To ensure proper follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions of the 
Special Rapporteur;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also urges</i> States:  
</p>
<p>  (<i>a</i>)  To implement effective measures to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, particularly in places of detention and other places 
where persons are deprived of their liberty, including education and training for personnel, 
who may be involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment of any individual subjected 
to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment, and ensure that conditions of detention 
respect the dignity and human rights of detainees;<b> </b> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>)  To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations 
of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment investigated 
promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent, competent domestic authority, as 
well as whenever there is reasonable ground to believe that such an act has been committed; 
to hold persons who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts responsible, to have 
them brought to justice and punished in a manner commensurate with the gravity of the 
offence, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act 
is found to have been committed; and to take note, in this respect, of the Principles on the 
Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the updated set of principles for the protection of 
human rights through action to combat impunity as a useful tool in efforts to prevent and 
combat torture;  
</p>

<p> (<i>c</i>)  To ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of 
torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of 
torture as evidence that the statement was made, and calls upon States to consider extending 
that prohibition to statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, and recognizes furthermore that adequate corroboration of statements, 
including confessions, used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for 
the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>)  Not to expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), extradite or in any other way transfer a 
person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture,<b> </b>stresses the importance of effective legal 
and procedural safeguards in this regard, and recognizing that diplomatic assurances, where 
used, do not release States from their obligations under international human rights, 
humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To ensure that victims of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment obtain redress<b>,</b> are awarded fair and adequate compensation and 
receive appropriate social, psychological,<b> </b>medical and other relevant specialized 
rehabilitation, and urges States to establish, maintain, facilitate or support rehabilitation 
centres or facilities where victims of torture can receive such treatment and where effective 
measures for ensuring the safety of their staff and patients are taken; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>)  To ensure that all acts of torture are offences under domestic criminal law 
and encourages States to prohibit under domestic law acts constituting cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(<i>g</i>)<b> </b>To<b> </b>recognize<b> </b>that acts of torture<b> </b>are serious violations of international human 
rights law and humanitarian law and can constitute crimes against humanity and war 
crimes, and that the perpetrators are liable to prosecution and punishment; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(<i>h</i>) To ensure that persons convicted of torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment have no subsequent involvement in the custody, 
interrogation or treatment of any person under arrest, detention, imprisonment or other 
deprivation of liberty, and that persons charged with torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment have no involvement in the custody, interrogation or treatment of 
any person under arrest, detention, imprisonment or other deprivation of liberty while such 
charges are pending;  
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>)  Not to punish personnel for not obeying orders to commit or conceal acts 
amounting to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>)  To protect medical and other personnel for their role in documenting torture 
or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and in treating 
victims of such acts;  
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>)  To ensure appropriate follow-up to conclusions, recommendations, request 
for further information and views on individual communications of the relevant treaty 
bodies, including the Committee against Torture and the Subcommittee on the Prevention 
of Torture;  
</p>
<p> (<i>l</i>) To adopt a gender-sensitive approach in the fight against torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, paying special attention to gender-
based violence that constitutes torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment;<b>  
</b></p>
<p> (<i>m</i>) To become parties to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as a matter of priority, and to give early 
consideration to signing and ratifying the Optional Protocol thereto and to designating or 
establishing truly independent and effective national preventive mechanisms for the </p>


<p>prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in a 
timely manner;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reminds</i> States that:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Intimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of the Convention against 
Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death threats, to the physical 
integrity of the victim or of a third person can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or to torture; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to 
respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to 
ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Welcomes</i> the reports of the Committee against Torture and the 
Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture;

framework of the United Nations, the provision of an adequate and stable level of staffing, 
as well as the necessary facilities for the bodies and mechanisms involved in preventing and<b> 
</b>combating torture and assisting victims of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, including in particular the Special Rapporteur on torture, the 
Committee against Torture and the Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, 
commensurate with the strong support expressed by Member States for preventing and 
combating torture and assisting victims of torture, in order to enable them to discharge their 
mandates in a comprehensive, sustained and effective manner, including by making best 
use of the increased membership of the Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, and 
taking fully into account the specific nature of their mandates;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Recognizes</i> the global need for international assistance to victims of torture, 
stresses the importance of the work of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations 
Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and appeals to all Governments, organizations and 
individuals to contribute annually to the Fund, preferably with a substantial increase in the 
contributions, and encourages contributions to the Special Fund established by the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention to help finance the implementation of the recommendations 
made by the Subcommittee on Prevention, as well as education programmes of national 
preventive mechanisms;  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and United Nations bodies and agencies, as well as relevant 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to commemorate, on 26 June, the
