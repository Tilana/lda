on three key entry points:  security of tenure, consultation and participation, and 
institutional coordination, through which the elements of the right to adequate housing are 
highlighted. To conclude, the report addresses a number of recommendations to States and 
the international community on how to improve prevention, relief and rehabilitation efforts 
by incorporating the right to adequate housing.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the third annual report submitted to the Council by the current Special 
Rapporteur, Raquel Rolnik.  
</p>
<p>2. The area of post-disaster and post-conflict reconstruction is of particular relevance to 
this mandate. Whether in natural disasters and their aftermath, or in countries recovering 
from conflict, the need to integrate human rights standards into prevention, relief and 
rehabilitation has been widely admitted.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur undertook research into how the right to adequate housing 
has been incorporated into national and international relief and reconstruction initiatives in 
post-disaster and post-conflict contexts. The present report summarizes her findings1 .  
</p>
<p>4. The first section of the report discusses human rights in the context of post-disaster 
and post-conflict situations. The second looks at key issues and questions concerning the 
right to adequate housing arising in those situations, with a focus on three areas: tenure 
security as a dimension of the right to adequate housing; the crucial role of consultation and 
participation; and institutional, coordination and phasing of action. The report concludes 
with a number of recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights in post-disaster and post-conflict situations 
</b></p>
<p>5.  Armed conflicts and natural disasters are a massive and growing problem 
worldwide. They have devastating consequences for the people affected and cause daunting 
challenges on a massive scale. Each year conflicts result in dislocation for hundreds of 
thousands of people. According to calculations by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the total number of people forcibly uprooted 
through conflict and persecution stood at 43.3 million at the end of 2009, &#8220;the highest 
number since the mid-1990s&#8221;. This included 15.2 million refugees, 983,000 asylum 
seekers, and 27.1 million internally displaced persons (IDPs).2 At the same time the world 
is facing natural disasters on an unprecedented scale. During the period 2000-2008 an 
average of 392 disasters per year occurred worldwide. During 2009 a total of 335 disasters 
were reported, killing 10,655 and affecting more than 119 million persons, and causing 
more than US$41.3 billion in damages3 .    
</p>
<p>6. There are similarities and differences between post-disaster and post-conflict 
contexts4. While conflicts and disasters often result in large-scale human displacement, 
deliberate destruction of land records and systems is far more likely in post-conflict than in 
post-disaster contexts, as is the extent of secondary occupation of homes of those displaced. 
Housing rights issues in post-conflict situations arise mainly as a consequence of

<p>International Humanitarian Law or International Human Rights Law violations committed 
during the conflict. In post-conflict situations there is therefore the question of how to 
redress the situation, how to guarantee justice to the victims and support the reconciliation 
process. Peace agreements and the establishment of transitional justice law frameworks and 
mechanisms can constitute an opportunity to address the right to adequate housing during 
post-conflict situations but everything depends on if and how these questions are addressed 
by these mechanisms and frameworks. The fact that conflicts can last for a long time also 
implies important differences between post-conflict and post-disaster situations. While 
taking account of such differences, this report will mainly focus on common issues and 
questions that arise in both contexts. 
</p>
<p>7. The impacts of both conflicts and disasters for the individuals, families and 
communities affected can be devastating. These include the loss of life and livelihoods; 
destruction of homes, property and infrastructure; disruption or termination of essential 
services; and the prolonged and sometimes even permanent forced displacement from land, 
home and community. Although wealth and power do not offer any immunity from these 
impacts, it is in most cases the poor and socially disadvantaged who are worst affected; and 
it is also they who are least able to withstand economic shocks and so generally take the 
longest to recover.  
</p>
<p>8. The poor often stand to lose most in disaster contexts because they often have to 
settle on fragile and exposed land that is highly susceptible to the effects of disasters. When 
a disaster strikes, their pre-existing vulnerabilities are exacerbated, with women, children 
and marginalized groups bearing the brunt of the impact. After the disaster, the poor often 
also find their attempts to return to their homes officially denied on the grounds that return 
would be unsafe, and/or not permissible as they did not have official proof of a right to live 
there in the first place. This can have dramatic consequences for the livelihoods of 
individuals, families and entire communities. In the case of conflicts, the displacement and 
dispossession of specific groups are often deliberate strategies of one group or side in the 
conflict against another. This can result in the total destruction and/or secondary occupation 
of their lands and homes, and obstruction of their attempts to return and reclaim what was 
theirs. 
</p>
<p>9. In addition to facing serious humanitarian problems and challenges, victims of 
disasters and conflicts are often exposed to grave human rights violations, invariably 
including the right to adequate housing. Humanitarian crises are human rights crises. 
Notwithstanding, given the concentration of international and national attention, resources 
and effort they often receive, such crises can also present important human rights 
opportunities. The World Bank has noted that &#8220;&#8230;while conflicts unleash horror and 
suffering, they also destabilize old ways of doing things and create new openings for poor 
people to get ahead. However, there is a narrow window of opportunity in the aftermath of 
conflict before old barriers begin to surface5 .&#8221; 
</p>
<p>10. Since the 1990s there has been a growing recognition of the importance of adopting 
a human rights approach (and the use of human rights enforcement mechanisms) in the 
resolution of conflicts and peacebuilding. The Secretary-General emphasized that the 
promotion of human rights is the common thread in the Organization&#8217;s work in peace and 
security: &#8220;Human rights bodies are involved in early-warning and preventive activities, and 
human rights considerations are increasingly embodied in our response to crises6 .&#8221; He also 
announced that the United Nations had commenced implementation of a rights-based

<p>approach to development, which &#8220;describes situations not simply in terms of human needs, 
or of developmental requirements, but in terms of society's obligation to respond to the 
inalienable rights of individuals. It empowers people to demand justice as a right, not as 
charity, and gives communities a moral basis from which to claim international assistance 
where needed7 &#8221;. He then issued guidelines to his Special Representatives on how human 
rights standards should guide peace negotiations8 . In 2000 the Report on the Panel on 
United Nations Peace Operations (the &#8220;Brahimi Report&#8221;) emphasized the importance of 
incorporating human rights into the work of peace missions. The Panel&#8217;s key 
recommendations on a peacebuilding strategy for the United Nations included &#8220;a doctrinal 
shift in the use of civilian police, other rule of law elements and human rights experts in 
complex peace operations to reflect an increased focus on strengthening rule of law 
institutions and improving respect for human rights in post-conflict environments9 &#8221;. It also 
recommended that &#8220;the ability of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to plan and support the human rights components of peace operations needs 
to be reinforced10 &#8221;.  
</p>
<p>11. Another important development was the formulation of the Principles on Housing 
and Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons, generally known as the 
&#8220;Pinheiro Principles11 &#8221;. These were the culmination of a shift that commenced in the early 
1990s &#8220;from what were essentially humanitarian-driven responses to voluntary repatriation 
to more rights-based approaches to return [&#8230;] increasingly grounded in the principle of 
restorative justice and of restitution as a legal remedy which can support refugees and 
internally displaced persons in their choice of a durable solution (whether return, 
resettlement or local integration)12 &#8221;. 
</p>
<p>12. It has taken longer for the human rights implications of post-disaster responses to be 
clearly recognized. According to the United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee 
(IASC), natural disasters have traditionally &#8220;been seen as situations that create challenges 
and problems mainly of a humanitarian nature13&#8221;. although the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights in its general comment No. 4 had explicitly included victims of 
natural disasters and people living in disaster-prone areas among a list of disadvantaged 
groups that &#8220;should be ensured some degree of priority consideration in the housing 
sphere14 &#8221;. During the past decade there have been important and welcome shifts in this 
approach. According to IASC: &#8220;Increasingly, it has come to be recognized that human 
rights protection also needs to be provided in these contexts. The tsunamis, hurricanes and 
earthquakes, which hit parts of Asia and the Americas in 2004/2005, highlighted the need 
to be attentive to the multiple human rights challenges victims of such disasters may face.

<p>All too often the human rights of disaster victims are not sufficiently taken into account. 
[&#8230;] Often the human rights violations are not intended or planned. Sometimes they result 
from insufficient resources and capacities to prepare and respond to the consequences of the 
disasters. More often, they are the result of inappropriate policies, neglect or oversight. 
These violations could be avoided if both national and international actors took the relevant 
human rights guarantees into account from the beginning15 .&#8221; 
</p>
<p>13. IASC has further asserted that &#8220;Human rights have to be the legal underpinning of 
all humanitarian work pertaining to natural disasters. There is no other legal framework to 
guide such activities, especially in areas where there is no armed conflict&#8221;. This shift is also 
about longer-term sustainability. It helps the relevant actors to plan for what follows 
beyond the initial relief and stabilization operations16 .  
</p>
<p><b> III. The right to adequate housing in post-disaster and post-
conflict situations: key issues and questions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Complex situations, difficult challenges 
</b></p>
<p>14. The right to housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living is 
internationally recognized. &#8220;[T]he right to housing should not be interpreted in a narrow or 
restrictive sense which equates it with, for example, the shelter provided by merely having 
a roof over one's head or views shelter exclusively as a commodity. Rather it should be 
seen as the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity17 &#8221;. In line with this 
interpretation, &#8220;adequacy&#8221; is measured against a list of key factors including: legal security 
of tenure; availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure; affordability; 
habitability; accessibility; location; and cultural adequacy 18 . Housing is therefore not 
simply a shelter commodity. It is much more than a physical structure for protection from 
the elements, and its value extends beyond what it will cost to buy, sell or rebuild. Housing 
has inherent social value.  
</p>
<p>15. The right to adequate housing can be severely compromised by disasters and 
conflicts, through damage and destruction, loss of records and the displacement of 
individuals, families and communities. While the numbers of people affected are often 
staggering, the impact of conflicts and disasters on this right should not be measured simply 
in terms of numbers of physical assets destroyed and people displaced. It should also and 
perhaps primarily be understood in terms of the extent of disruption of social relationships, 
networks and assets; destruction of home-centred livelihoods built up over many years; and 
the undermining of complex, multi-layered land tenure rights. Destruction of housing as a 
physical asset can be addressed through repair, rehabilitation and reconstruction. This is an 
urgent and difficult enough task in the aftermath of disasters and conflicts. Destruction of 
housing as a social asset, on the other hand, requires more multi-faceted and longer-term 
responses based on a deeper understanding of the tenure systems and histories of the 
affected settlements and, in particular, of their poorer and marginalized residents. It also 
requires vigilance in the course of the restoration and reconstruction to ensure that 
previously held tenure rights are not undermined or diminished in any way but are, instead, 
protected and where possible strengthened. 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 15 IASC, Human Rights and Natural Disasters: Operational Guidelines and Field Manual, pp. 1-2. 
 16 Ibid., p. 2. 
 17 General comment 4, para. 7. 
 18 Ibid., para. 8. </p>


<p>16. These tasks are all the more challenging in cases of prolonged, mass displacement. 
Displacement is a notorious driver of human and particularly housing-rights violations. 
According to displacement and resettlement experts there are eight major displacement 
impoverishment risk areas: landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, marginalization, 
increased morbidity and mortality, food insecurity, loss of access to common property 
resources, and social/community disarticulation19. While the impacts of displacement are 
devastating for all who are affected, they are most acutely felt by those groups more 
vulnerable to discrimination, including women, minorities, children and persons with 
disabilities. If not mitigated through intensive, concerted effort, the consequences are long-
term, entrenching patterns of poverty, exclusion, dependency and disempowerment.  
</p>
<p>17. The process of return, recovery and reconstruction is regarded as an urgent priority 
in post-disaster and post-conflict contexts.  According to IASC: &#8220;Experience has shown that 
the longer the displacement lasts, the greater the risk of human rights violations. In 
particular, discrimination and violations of economic, social and cultural rights tend to 
become more systemic over time 20 .&#8221; The guiding principles put forward in a recent 
<i>Handbook for Reconstructing After Natural Disasters</i> suggest that a good reconstruction 
policy helps reactivate communities and empowers people to rebuild their housing, their 
lives, and their livelihoods and that reconstruction begins the day of the disaster21. 
</p>
<p>18. However, numerous obstacles often stand in the way of rapid return, recovery and 
reconstruction. These can include dangers (e.g. damage to buildings, health risks, unstable 
ground); difficulty of access; inability of the authorities to provide services to the area; and 
lack of resources. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon the relevant authorities to take 
measures to overcome such obstacles with a minimum of delay. According to IASC 
guidelines: &#8220;After the emergency phase, persons displaced by the natural disaster should be 
granted the opportunity to choose freely whether they want to return to their homes and 
places of origin, to remain in the area to which they have been displaced, or to resettle to 
another part of the country. Their right of choice may not be subjected to any restrictions 
except those which are provided by law, and are necessary to protect national security, the 
safety and security of affected populations, public order (<i>ordre public</i>), safety, public health 
or morals or the rights and freedoms of others. In particular, the return of persons displaced 
by the disaster to their homes and places of origin should only be prohibited if these homes 
or places of origin are in zones where there are real dangers to the life or physical integrity 
and health of the affected persons. Restrictions should only last as long as such dangers 
exist and only be implemented if other, less intrusive, measures of protection are not 
available or possible22.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>19. Failure to take timely appropriate measures can have serious consequences for the 
people affected. In post-conflict contexts the situation can be even more complex, as 
obstacles in the way of return and recovery can also include threats of violence against a 
returning family or group/s, secondary occupation of land and houses, among others. 
</p>
<p>20. In both post-disaster and post-conflict situations there is an inevitable tension 
between the pressing need to act quickly and decisively in order to facilitate the return of 
the displaced to their lands and homes, and the need to be comprehensive and thorough in 
dealing with what are in fact very complex questions. In post-conflict situations this can

<p>become particularly complicated, with the tension playing itself out between short-term 
peace demands and compromises, and the longer-term needs of a sustainable reconciliation 
and reconstruction process. Finding practical and locally appropriate ways to resolve the 
dilemma is very important. Given the expansive content of the right to adequate housing, 
protecting and realizing that right is never a clear-cut, linear process where an obvious 
causal link can easily be established between action on the ground and ultimate impact. 
Massive displacement, frequent destruction of records related to land and property, the 
equally frequent absence of documentation to prove the prior occupation history of long-
term informal users and occupants of land, the emergence of &#8220;rights in conflict&#8221; (such as 
occupation versus restitution), inadequate legal frameworks governing land management, 
the actions of powerful interest groups keen on capitalizing on the opportunity for 
profitable investment; are all factors which would in principle call for caution and careful 
analysis of strategic options. In crisis situations, where the initial, overriding objectives for 
Government and for those external actors engaged on the ground would first and foremost 
be of an emergency shelter and basic livelihood support nature, housing rights and land 
tenure challenges may therefore seem impossible to address.  
</p>
<p>21. How should governments, bilateral and multilateral agencies, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and other support institutions respond to these complex situations 
and difficult challenges? The Special Rapporteur has identified three key issues that she 
regards as crucial entry points to incorporate the right to adequate housing in the 
reconstruction efforts: security of tenure, participation and coordination, considering the 
impact they have on other elements of the right to adequate housing which are usually 
neglected or overlooked, including location, cultural adequacy and availability of services, 
facilities and infrastructure. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Tenure security  
</b></p>
<p>22. Security of tenure is a fundamentally important dimension of the right to adequate 
housing. It is included in the list of factors comprising adequacy of housing and offers 
important guidelines to institutions responding to post-conflict and post-disaster situations. 
According to general comment No. 4 &#8220;Tenure takes a variety of forms, including rental 
(public and private) accommodation, cooperative housing, lease, owner-occupation, 
emergency housing and informal settlements, including occupation of land or property. 
Notwithstanding the type of tenure, all persons should possess a degree of security of tenure 
which guarantees legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and other threats. 
States parties should consequently take immediate measures aimed at conferring legal 
security of tenure upon those persons and households currently lacking such protection, in 
genuine consultation with affected persons and groups23 &#8221;.  
</p>
<p>23. This recognition of a multiplicity of legitimate tenure forms, together with the 
obligation to offer protection to those holding them, is of great importance in developing 
responses to housing destruction or the displacement of residents. Security of tenure is 
essential for the realization of the right to adequate housing and has a great impact on 
location as another fundamental element of adequacy. Paradoxically, the absence of such 
security is often a pre-existing contributory cause of conflict and vulnerability to disaster. 
In trying to address housing rights in post-disaster and post-conflict situations, it is 
therefore important to investigate the tenure security challenges presented by those 
situations. Post-crisis responses to housing destruction and/or displacement that fail to take 
this into account are likely to be counterproductive, and could even themselves become 
drivers of future conflicts, dispossession and exacerbation of vulnerabilities. On the other 
</p>

 23 General comment No. 4, para. 8(a). </p>


<p>hand, timely and decisive responses built on informed assessment and analysis of those 
underlying challenges can contribute significantly to strategies for restoration, 
reconstruction and development.  
</p>
<p>24. According to the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG): &#8220;Post-disaster operations 
need to deal early and forcefully with land ownership issues. Where possible land titles 
should be regularized or a functional proxy for land title should be provided [...] Where 
such measures are not possible, alternative means need to be found to ensure that land is not 
seized outright or that fraudulent claims are not honoured. The local government must help 
prevent profiteering on land that is urgently needed for the reconstruction process24.&#8221; This 
assessment of urgency and need for forceful action is absolutely correct. However the 
emphasis on title regularization, with other forms of tenure covered by &#8220;functional proxy&#8221;, 
is problematic. Care should be taken that this does not result in programmes of rushed or 
enforced commodification of land and housing; or a process of favouring formal title 
resulting in the weakening or pushing aside of legitimate alternative forms of tenure 
security, as has happened in the case of Cambodia, discussed later. Many other equally 
legitimate forms of tenure require recognition, protection and support in their own right. 
</p>
<p>25. A useful example of the dangers of failing to deal with land tenure security 
challenges in a timely manner can be found in the case of post-conflict East Timor. It is 
estimated that during the violence that followed the 1999 referendum, 67,500 out of an 
estimated 170,000 houses (40 per cent of all housing stock) were rendered uninhabitable25 ; 
while approximately 70 per cent of all physical infrastructure was destroyed or rendered 
inoperable26 . Administrative documents, including land title records, were also destroyed 
or taken to Indonesia27 . Approximately 300,000 people fled or were forced into Indonesian 
West Timor; while an estimated 450,000 were internally displaced, out of a total population 
of 900,00028 . Houses left empty by the refugees were occupied by others, often because 
their own homes had been destroyed. Over the following months and years, returning 
refugees frequently found their homes occupied and had to pay the secondary occupants 
compensation for &#8220;guarding&#8221; or improving their homes so that they would leave. In many 
cases the secondary occupants refused to vacate, forcing the returnees to seek shelter 
elsewhere29 . This left an extraordinarily complex land and housing rights legacy for the 
transitional administration and future government to unravel and resolve. To add to the 
complexity, the post-referendum events took place against a historical backdrop of waves 
of dispossession and displacement and externally imposed land systems through Portuguese

<p>26. The outcome was a situation of widespread tenure insecurity and tensions over land, 
property and housing during the period of transitional government under the United Nations 
and in the first years of the Government of the newly independent Democratic Republic of 
Timor Leste. In spite of urgent calls from 1999 onwards from a variety of actors, and the 
formulation of proposals by various agencies and Government units, the key tenure issues 
were never fully addressed. This failure is seen as one of the drivers of the violence that 
subsequently occurred in 2006-7, in the course of which 150,000 people (15 per cent of the

<p>total population of Timor-Leste) fled their land and homes; 65 IDP camps and transitional 
shelters were set up; secondary occupants inhabited many of the abandoned properties; an 
estimated 6,000 houses in Dili were destroyed or severely damaged; and in rural areas there 
were cases of entire villages being burned down30 . 
</p>
<p>27. This subsequent wave of violence and dispossessions prompted a well-considered 
and ambitious set of remedial actions in the form of a National Recovery Strategy (NRS) 
called <i>Hamutuk Hari&#8217;I Futuru</i> (Together Building the Future) launched in December 2007. 
The five pillars of this strategy focused on: IDP return and resettlement; establishing a 
social security system for the most vulnerable groups in society; addressing security issues 
including working with communities to identify and address sources of conflict; creating 
livelihood opportunities through job generation schemes; and building trust within 
communities and between the people and the government. However, various aspects of the 
strategy were not implemented. For example the range of options that was initially stated to 
be available to returning IDPs was drastically cut &#8211; essentially limited to the mass payout of 
cash compensation amounts. Ultimately these payments, combined with a reconciliation 
and dialogue process (discussed below), constituted the extent of the programme 
implemented to return or resettle IDPs and reconstruct housing. As of July 2010 payments 
were still being made and in total there had been approximately 17,000 recipient 
households 31. Under the circumstances of potential further disturbances and lack of State 
capacity there were good arguments for giving people the funds with which to address their 
own housing and immediate livelihood needs. The approach also allowed for individually 
tailored solutions for housing and livelihood restoration. However there were a number of 
problems from a human rights perspective, including the following: (a) most payments 
went to male heads of households, with no measures in place to ensure that the funds would 
be spent on housing for the whole family; (b) families under severe financial stress could be 
under pressure to use the cash payments to cover more urgent, short-term expenses instead 
of housing; (c) through resorting to cash payments, the State missed an important 
opportunity to channel funds towards the provision of properly serviced sites for housing. 
</p>
<p>28. An even more serious concern was the fact that the NRS had to be implemented in 
the ongoing absence of a legal framework on land and property ownership and dispute 
resolution, in spite of many calls for action and proposals on establishing such a framework 
in order to bring certainty in a situation of profound tenure insecurity. Despite some 
commendable efforts to deal with the land tenure puzzle by a number of dedicated 
Timorese government officials and international advisors, visible progress towards such 
certainty only started during 2008. A &#8220;Decree on the Cadastre&#8221; was passed in July 2008, 
which authorized the restructured National Directorate for Land, Property and Cadastral 
Services and the <i>Ita Nia Rai</i> programme to undertake land tenure data collection around the 
country; and a draft Transitional Land Law was approved by the Council of Ministers on 10 
March 2010 and as of September 2010 awaits consideration by Parliament.  
</p>
<p>29. Another significant post-conflict case is Cambodia, a country still recovering from 
the destructiveness of the Khmer Rouge era. Among other things, the Khmer Rouge 
systematically destroyed the prior land tenure system, forcibly evicted millions of people 
from their homes (including emptying the city of Phnom Penh), and destroyed land 
ownership records. Despite the passage of new land laws, weaknesses in the rule of law and 
lack of institutional capacity have allowed a culture of corruption and have facilitated land-
grabbing, often by elites at the expense of the poor. A recent claim to the World Bank 
Inspection Panel, brought on behalf of people threatened with eviction from their homes

<p>near Boeung Kak Lake in Phnom Penh, illustrates some of these problems. The claimants 
challenged the design and implementation of the Land Management and Administration 
Project (LMAP), which was designed to support the Land Law of 2001. The project, funded 
primarily by the World Bank, &#8220;aimed at developing a land policy and regulatory 
framework, building capacity of the relevant Government agencies, developing a land 
registration system and a titling program, strengthening mechanisms for land disputes and 
developing State land management32.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>30. LMPAP was able to accomplish a number of its goals including the development of 
key parts of the legal framework and the issuing of around 1.3 million land titles. However, 
&#8220;despite these achievements, the failure of the project to tackle fundamental inequities in 
the control and management of land meant that it did not improve tenure security for the 
segments of Cambodian society that are vulnerable to displacement33 .&#8221; Those who had less 
formal rights saw their security of tenure undermined: &#8220;The recognition of possession rights 
in the 2001 Land Law, including the right to convert possession into full ownership through 
title, was intended as a mechanism to incorporate this pre-existing tenure system into the 
formal centralized system&#8230;.[However these] legal possessors are accused of being &#8216;illegal 
squatters&#8217; because they do not have &#8216;hard&#8217; formal title, and this in turn has become a 
common justification for eviction&#8230;.By expanding the reach of the formal titling system, 
LMAP has increased the actual and perceived superiority of hard titles issued under the 
project vis-&#224;-vis soft titles issued under the pre-existing tenure system. LMAP has thus 
unwittingly weakened the tenure status of those households who have been excluded from 
the formal system and must continue to rely on their &#8216;soft titles&#8217; as proof of their rights to 
the land34.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>31. Similar lessons can be learnt from post-disaster situations. Disasters occur in a social 
context framed by complex issues of power, politics and longstanding vulnerability and 
poverty, including widespread tenure insecurity. Understanding this complexity is 
fundamental to developing and implementing successful responses. This is illustrated in the 
case of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in October 1998. According to official estimates 
Hurricane Mitch left 21 cities severely damaged, 82,735 houses damaged, 66,188 houses 
destroyed and 44,150 people homeless. In addition 123 health centres and 531 roads were 
damaged and eight health centres and 189 bridges were destroyed35  . As a result, an 
estimated 1.5 million people were negatively affected.  
</p>
<p>32. While people from all economic groups suffered from the effects of the hurricane, 
the damage disproportionately affected the most marginalized sectors of the population &#8211; 
poor women, peasants, indigenous groups. Significantly, many of these had been living 
under insecure tenure conditions in irregular settlements and inadequate housing, located in 
vulnerable areas exposed to strong winds, flooding and landslides. Although evacuation 
orders were issued, many refused to leave their homes for fear of losing their belongings, 
with disastrous and often fatal consequences. Vulnerability and in particular tenure 
insecurity was both the cause and effect of the disaster for such families. In the absence of 
officially recognized tenure rights, people ended up living on the fringes in dangerous 
areas, which due to their location were often worst affected by the hurricane. Any post-
disaster response measures intended to form the basis for longer-term recovery would 
therefore have needed to address pre-existing insecurity, in order to provide a basis for the 
full realization of the right to adequate housing.

<p>33. In the wake of Hurricane Mitch, a combination of factors militated against satisfying 
the most basic housing needs of the affected Honduran population, much less the full 
realization of their right to adequate housing. Most analyses of post-Mitch responses 
conclude that both the country&#8217;s government and the national emergency management 
system (as represented by its main agency, COPECO) were not adequately prepared to 
respond to the need of the victims. On the positive side, Hurricane Mitch led to the arrival 
of significant human and financial resources. Post-disaster housing response initiatives 
represented unprecedented opportunities to &#8220;build back better 36 &#8221;. In particular, many 
women gained access to land and participation through some of these donor-funded 
responses who insisted that the deeds to all reconstructed houses bear the names of the 
female spouses (instead of the males), which was justified by the assumption that &#8220;women 
won&#8217;t sell&#8221;. Other projects compromised by proposing that post-disaster housing be 
registered under joint title and then established as family patrimony.  
</p>
<p>34. A number of successful rehabilitation and reconstruction initiatives in Honduras, 
where undisputed land was available at a reasonable distance from livelihood opportunities 
and facilities, illustrated how settlement development could be an appropriate means to 
support disaster-affected populations and introduce better practices in areas such as site 
planning, house design, use and production of building materials, water supply and 
sanitation and environmental protection. Cases such as El Progreso and Choluteca also 
included direct involvement by local authorities working in collaborating with other support 
institutions as well as members of the beneficiary community, all with the help of 
unprecedented levels of support from donors and relief organizations.  
</p>
<p>35. The post-Hurricane Mitch period also saw development in the legal framework 
related to land and housing issues, though the judicial system remained weak and so the 
potential benefits of the new legislation remained inaccessible to the poor. Missing from the 
current strategy in Honduras is a comprehensive programme to increase the supply of 
urbanized land and improve tenure security for the poor and the marginalized.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Consultation and participation  
</b></p>
<p>36. The long-term success of post-disaster and post-conflict responses to a great extent 
depends on a properly informed understanding of the local context. It also requires high 
levels of consultation with and direct involvement of the people directly affected in the 
process of relief and reconstruction within that context. With respect to the right to 
adequate housing and displacement, this specifically includes those people with less 
formalized land use and occupation rights.  
</p>
<p>37. Given the urgent, crisis nature of post-conflict and post-disaster situations, the 
approach of collecting and analysing detailed information, and of direct participation by the 
people affected, may seem difficult to achieve. This approach is likely to contradict 
powerful humanitarian and political pressures that emphasize speedy resettlement, 
rebuilding and re-housing. In post-conflict and post-disaster situations, &#8220;quick wins&#8221; easily 
become equated with rapid physical delivery, often with scant consideration, or even 
awareness, of possible counterproductive longer-term consequences. Getting &#8220;policy 
choices&#8221; right in the field of land and housing requires, in normal circumstances, the 
undertaking of complex analytical processes. In the midst of crises, the need for speedy 
decisions and practical livelihood support-oriented action may run counter to the need for 
caution and for intensive consultation with those directly affected.  
</p>

<p>38. In spite of these challenges, it is very important to ensure that time and opportunity 
are made for gathering of information, analysis and assessment of policy choices; and for 
intensive consultation with, and the involvement of, those affected. People directly affected 
by conflicts and crises are not mere helpless victims. They are invariably the first people 
&#8220;on the scene&#8221; and are often the first to take some form of action. In Honduras following 
the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch the immediate post-disaster processes of rescue, 
relief and stabilization were characterized by remarkable personal determination and great 
displays of social solidarity, with private and public buildings opening their doors to the 
displaced and homeless. Communities in different parts of the country self-organized and 
developed their own survival strategies. Citizens joined neighbourhood or community 
solidarity groups, which, because of insufficient official assistance and their isolation, 
frequently carried out emergency tasks on their own initiative37. Some of the most basic 
emergency interventions implemented included search and rescue operations, provision of 
temporary shelter, sanitation programmes such as the disposal of human and animal 
remains, and the distribution of water, food, blankets, and domestic items. This was in 
contrast to the Government&#8217;s response to the crisis which included immediate centralization 
of State power and, two days later, the announcement that plans to draft a national plan for 
reconstruction had been initiated, conducted without transparency in a secretive fashion.  
</p>
<p>39. Research conducted by the Active Learning Network for Accountability and 
Performance (ALNAP) and the ProVention Consortium in the wake of the 2005 South Asia 
earthquake found &#8220;accumulated evidence that <i>people affected by disasters want to 
participate fully in the response</i>, even if this means a slower implementation process. 
However, disbursement pressure &#8211; the need to get money out of the door &#8211; has in the past 
partly determined response mechanis38.&#8221;While emphasizing the importance of participation, 
the study also cautions: &#8220;When considering communities [&#8230;] it is important to remember: 
not to romanticise the coping capacities and resilience of local people and communities &#8211; 
they often face insurmountable difficulties when responding to major disasters; that often 
&#8216;communities&#8217;, particularly in areas of high inequality, are made up of different interest 
groups, and include marginalised groups who may well have difficulty getting their views 
represented; cultural &#8216;norms&#8217; may also, for example, work against women&#8217;s rights39.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>40. Ways need to be found around such obstacles, for at the heart of the matter lie the 
issues of ownership and accountability. In his 2006 report on lessons learned from the 
Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004, the United Nations Secretary-General&#8217;s Special Envoy for 
Tsunami Recovery found that &#8220;It is a false trade-off to sacrifice local ownership for speed if 
that means short-circuiting the rights of affected populations to be informed in a timely 
manner about their choices, the assistance available to them, and any delays that are being 
experienced. The other side of this coin, of course, is accountability to the families and 
communities our recovery efforts are serving. Typically, demands for accountability come 
loudest from donors &#8211; private and institutional &#8211; and implementing agencies are more likely 
to focus on this kind of upward accountability. Too often, the less organized voices of the 
survivors are not heard, and this equally vital downward accountability is given second-
priority at best. This is unfortunate, as a disaster&#8217;s survivors are best placed to design the

<p>recovery strategy that best meets their needs. And they should be the ultimate judges of a 
recovery effort&#8217;s success or failure40&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>41. With the correct approach and support from the national government and outside 
agencies, the people directly affected by disasters and conflicts ought to remain directly 
involved despite the enormity of the challenges they face. This is particularly important in 
the areas of resettlement and reconstruction. The individuals, families and communities 
affected possess vital local knowledge and experience, and when working together can be 
an invaluable partner in designing and implementing creative solutions. Community-based 
reconstruction, linked to planning and reconstruction processes developed at the municipal 
and national levels, should be promoted wherever possible. The IASC guidelines 
accordingly advise agencies &#8220;In the planning and rehabilitation of housing and human 
settlements, [to] devise community-based strategies to maximize the participation of all 
sectors of affected communities (e.g. community housing teams). Local communities 
should be involved in decision-making regarding the location, design and infrastructure of 
housing and settlements to ensure that they are safe, habitable, accessible and culturally 
appropriate 41.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>42. Studies have demonstrated the potential negative effects of failing to follow this 
approach. One example is research done in Gujarat, India, in the aftermath of the 2001 
earthquake which left 1.2 million people homeless and damaged 1.7 million properties 
including 15,000 schools, affecting a total of 490 towns and 8,000 villages42. This was met 
with a comprehensive, generally successful and internationally acclaimed relief and 
rehabilitation effort managed by the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority. The 
response was coordinated through a system of &#8220;village adoption&#8221;, whereby NGOs and other 
entities took on responsibility for the reconstruction of the villages. Most affected 
households were offered two options: owner-driven reconstruction and donor-driven 
reconstruction. In the process different approaches were followed, allowing for flexibility, 
with varying success. A number of the lessons drawn from the study emphasized the 
importance of the involvement and active agency of the affected people, as well as the 
influence of location on the lives of affected communities. In one case, a new township 
constructed three kilometres from the original village that had been destroyed was found six 
years after the earthquake to be empty but for one or two houses occupied by migrant 
workers renting the properties from the intended owners. The intended inhabitants of this 
settlement, who had initially accepted the offer of houses built for them, had returned to the 
original village and built their own: &#8220;[The villagers said] that they did not want to leave 
their village, <i>&#8216;&#8230;it is the home of our ancestors&#8217;</i>. When asked who built the village, the 
proud response is that they did it themselves43&#8221;. In another village, while people had 
occupied the houses that had been built for them, they described their new settlement in 
&#8220;wholly negative&#8221; terms such as: &#8220;It is dead&#8221;; &#8220;We are bored&#8221;; &#8220;There are no shops 44 &#8221;.  
</p>
<p>43. The Gujarat study points to some of the dangers of resorting to rushed, donor-driven 
programming, which can neglect the social capital of the affected residents, and to 
contractor-driven reconstruction projects, which are rarely developmental in nature. The 
authors conclude that &#8220;The drive to rebuild quickly inevitably leads early on to the decision 
to hire commercial contractors. At this point projects such as these usually cease to be

<p>developmental initiatives and become construction projects. The participation of residents 
is relegated to mixing concrete or making building blocks, or worse. [&#8230;] Fundamentally, 
the contractor-driven approach to shelter is focused on the construction of housing units. 
Yet shelter is far more than that45 &#8221;. They also warn that: &#8220;When powerful external agents 
are driving the process within an affected village, the social capital present within long-
standing communities can be ignored or even damaged46&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>44. In the case of East Timor discussed earlier, the importance and value of direct 
participation of the affected population in re-establishing a system of housing, land and 
property rights in the aftermath of the 1999 referendum was emphasized from an early 
stage. A 2000 report to the United Nations indicated that the majority of Timorese 
interviewed during a fact-finding study had confirmed the importance of involvement of 
customary local dispute resolution structures in future land dispute resolution and 
adjudication mechanisms, on the grounds of their persisting legitimacy in spite of decades 
of conflict and dispossession and also their role as a valuable source of &#8220;information, 
including details of boundaries, levels of rights and history of acquisition and loss47 &#8221;. On 
the basis of these submissions from a broad range of Timorese, the report recommended 
that where feasible, existing local dispute resolution structures should be used as a crucial 
first step in dealing with land, housing and property disputes. This mediation could 
commence &#8220;at any of a number of levels, right down to the level of family meetings48&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>45. These and other proposals to address housing, land and property rights through the 
active participation of the affected people, and to build on existing community processes, 
were not taken up by the transitional authorities or the newly independent Government. In 
the aftermath of the later wave of violence, destruction and displacement of 2006-7, the 
need for such involvement became prominently recognised. The five pillars of the National 
Recovery Strategy included one aimed at building trust within communities and between 
the people and the Government. This was in the context of urgent attempts to achieve the 
reintegration and return of IDPs displaced by the violence to their communities, with the 
incentive of cash compensation from the State with which they could repair their homes or 
settle in alternative areas in cases where reintegration proved impossible. As part of a 
Dialogue, Communications and Outreach Programme, dialogue teams were established to 
manage the necessary conflict resolution, mediation and negotiation processes. This 
required the participation of local authorities, youth leaders and other groupings. The 
programme, which was still continuing in some communities in May 2010, incorporated the 
use of customary dispute resolution practices and peacebuilding ceremonies. It is widely 
regarded as having been successful and necessary for peacebuilding and the safe return of 
IDPs. Women reportedly participated far more actively than men in the community 
dialogue and reconciliation process. This was in contrast to the compensation payment 
process, which had been male-dominated. 
</p>
<p>46. The case of post-conflict Rwanda illustrates the use of a top-down developmental 
approach to land allocation, resettlement and housing in an effort to deal with the legacy of 
dispossession and displacement in the years leading up to and immediately following the 
1994 Genocide. The majority of Rwandans had experience of forced displacement, either 
within the country or to a second or even third country, a reality which has shaped all 
subsequent efforts to manage land issues and to realize housing rights. From 1997 the 
Government attempted to implement the <i>imidugudu (</i>villagization) model nationwide, 
requiring the entire rural population of Rwanda to be concentrated in rural villages instead

<p>of the traditionally scattered settlement patterns. Any further construction outside of 
dedicated village sites would be forbidden, while people were forced by the authorities to 
abandon and destroy their homes near their fields. Justified and pursued as an emergency 
shelter policy to deal with successive waves of approximately 2.5 million &#8220;old case&#8221; and 
&#8220;new case&#8221; refugees returning home after 1994, the <i>imidugudu</i> model had longer-term 
demographic, economic and governance goals. In the north-west of the country, it also 
served as a counterinsurgency measure in the context of incursions from ex-FAR and 
<i>Interahamwe</i> in Congo and violent reaction from Government troops. 
</p>
<p>47. While the Government directed significant domestic and foreign funding towards 
the construction of new housing, primarily through the <i>imidugudu</i> (villagization) model, 
and achieved some positive results, these efforts were only very rarely based upon 
consultation with local people, and in some cases involved direct pressure, eviction and 
dispossession that would appear incompatible with international human rights law. The 
opportunity of moving to housing constructed as part of the <i>imidugudu</i> programme was 
popular among some residents living in inadequate shelter, but it was much less popular 
amongst households who already lived in good-quality homes49 . Villagers were seriously 
concerned that the new villages put people further away from their fields, making 
cultivation more difficult, especially for women. They were also concerned that those who 
had given up some of their land to make way for the villages seldom received 
compensation, which caused tension and potential conflict. In addition, houses provided in 
the <i>imidugudu</i> were often of poor quality and the authorities frequently placed unreasonable 
restrictions upon existing home-owners, requiring them to upgrade or replace their homes 
without due regard for questions of affordability and cultural adequacy and appropriateness. 
The indigenous <i>Twa</i> people suffered particularly severely as a result, through the 
imposition of requirements ignoring their traditional values and housing practices50. 
</p>
<p>48. The Rwandan <i>imidugudu</i> model was not simply about provision of shelter in an 
emergency context, the underlying vision was of a drastically re-engineered rural society, 
Consultation was limited, and participation mainly took the form of required &#8220;obligatory 
labour participation in construction activities51&#8221;. In spite of these obvious problems, and of 
lessons learnt in previous villagization projects in East Africa, the &#8220;emergency&#8221; status of 
post-1994 Rwanda secured the involvement of some international agencies52. However by 
1999 international pressure and a related lack of donor funds essentially put a stop to the 
villagization programme.  
</p>
<p>49. The Rwandan Government remained in principle committed to the policy and re-
launched the concept in 2007 following the promulgation of the 2004 Human Settlement 
Policy. In 2008, the Government announced plans to establish 30 pilot villages, one in 
every district, to encourage people to move into <i>imidugudu </i>through a system of positive 
incentives, such as the provision of agricultural tools and livestock. Major services, such as 
water sources and electricity supplies, have yet to be supplied in most cases, while many 
newly created villages have no services whatsoever. In addition, although the authorities 
stated their wish to be more open and to shift to an incentive-based rather than mandatory 
approach, the programme is still felt by many to be implemented in a &#8220;top-down&#8221; manner53. 
Nevertheless the overall process is proceeding apace and the Government estimates that by

<p>May 2010 some 51 per cent of the rural population was located in <i>imidugudu</i>, a remarkably 
rapid increase from 22  per cent in 2008, and well on the way to the target for its 
<i>Vision2020</i> objective of 70  per cent by 201454 . The long-term social consequences of 
these achievements are still unclear. In adopting and implementing the policy there has 
been a blurring of humanitarian, development and &#8220;security&#8221; or population control agendas, 
in the absence of genuine consultation, negotiation and reconciliation. This, coupled with a 
lack of sufficient pro-poor urban settlement practices, may lead to future problems. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Institutional coordination, phasing and the promotion of the right to 
adequate housing  
</b></p>
<p>50. In high-profile or &#8220;complex emergency&#8221; 55  cases, conflicts and disasters elicit 
international interventions and massive relief responses from a variety of institutions and 
States. In recent years, given the overwhelming scale, frequency and complexity of 
unfolding crises, there have been signs of a creeping sense of donor fatigue56 . 
</p>
<p>51. In response to serious problems experienced in the past, the humanitarian response 
system has since the 1990s undergone a process of reform to reduce the fragmentation of 
efforts which had beset its earlier engagements and been responsible for numerous 
contradictions and tensions. This has produced a much stronger co-ordination framework 
also involving bilateral institutions, International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and NGOs.  
</p>
<p>52. The process started in 1991 with General Assembly Resolution 46/182 designed to 
&#8220;strengthen the United Nations response to complex emergencies and natural disasters&#8221; as 
well as &#8220;aiming at improving the overall effectiveness of humanitarian operations in the 
field&#8221;. Crises in subsequent years (above all the Rwanda genocide in 1994 where the 
international community was explicitly faulted for inability to predict, prevent and respond) 
accelerated the pace of reform. The United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) was established in 1998, as a department of the United 
Nations Secretariat with the mandate of co-ordinating humanitarian response, policy 
development and humanitarian advocacy. It merged all humanitarian functions of the 
United Nations until then performed by the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization 
(UNDRO) and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs under a single United Nations 
Focal Point, the Emergency Relief Co-ordinator (ERC). General Assembly Resolution 
46/182 further established important inter-agency mechanisms and operational tools. These 
include: the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), gathering all humanitarian partners 
from United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, the World Bank, the Red Cross and 
the main international NGOs to function as an inter-agency decision-making body in 
response to complex emergencies; and, structured in clusters and phases related to specific 
funds and plans of action: the Flash Appeal (FA), the Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP), 
the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the Common Humanitarian Action 
Plan (CHAP). 
</p>
<p>53. In spite of these advances, a number of grey areas and fault lines remain, as does the 
need for further focusing on better systemic arrangements for the integration of human 
rights perspectives in disaster response. Post-conflict and post-disaster responses remain 
plagued by disconnections between various phases of activity. Many bilateral donors called

</p>
<p> 55 &#8220;Complex emergencies&#8221; occur where different natural and/or human crises blend and mutually 
reinforce each other. 
</p>
<p> 56 See for example: &#8220;Donor fatigue hits UN aid to Sudan&#8221;, BBC, 19 February 1998; &#8220;U.N. battles donor 
fatigue for funds for Pakistan&#8221;, Reuters, 17 August 2010. </p>


<p>upon to provide the funding to address crises have remained rigidly caught within two main 
areas of engagement, i.e. &#8216;humanitarian assistance&#8217; and &#8216;development&#8217;. Budgets for these 
are not interchangeable and so the result has been an artificial separation of what should 
ideally be more interconnected activities. Current funding instruments (Flash Appeals) 
hardly allow for undertaking, from the start of humanitarian operations, the type of analyses 
and consultations which would help reduce the margins of uncertainty and error in 
resettlement, reconstruction, land tenure and the protection and realisation of the right to 
adequate housing. The history of applications by development agencies for FA funding for 
initiatives designed to build longer-term sustainability in humanitarian operations is a 
mixed one, and the scope for accessing resources to undertake critical policy development, 
legal reform and planning work has been very limited.  
</p>
<p>54. Part of the problem is an as yet incomplete understanding of the concept of 
&#8220;Recovery&#8221; (in its defined two phases of &#8220;Early&#8221; and &#8220;Long-term&#8221;) and of its programmatic 
implications in the course of humanitarian assistance. The earlier conceptualization of the 
transition from &#8220;relief&#8221; to &#8220;development&#8221; was not useful. The problem was that it attempted 
to establish a rigid sequential logic, which tended to overlook certain essential &#8220;non-
humanitarian&#8221; actions that would need to commence from the very start of humanitarian 
assistance and carry through into the resumption of normal development processes.  
</p>
<p>55. The stakes in determining the ultimate success in ensuring equitable and efficient 
reconstruction and recovery are highest in the period immediately following the initial 
crisis &#8220;event&#8221;, which normally coincides with the start of humanitarian assistance. Key 
determinants for ultimate success or failure in long-term reconstruction and development 
are normally drawn during that early period, either through informed and proactive policy 
choices, or simply by default. This applies to many areas of recovery; perhaps nowhere 
more than in the area of human settlement, the right to adequate housing and land tenure. It 
is a matter of concern that there is a general lack of awareness of the consequences of 
overlooking key issues related to human rights and land tenure systems during the first 
critical months of a response. Steps are needed to ensure that early opportunities are 
recognized and utilized, in a way that protects and promotes instead of undermines the right 
to adequate housing for everyone affected by conflicts and disasters. In a context of 
stretched resources and huge pressure to deliver concrete results, costly policy mistakes can 
be made which, particularly in the area of the right to adequate housing and land tenure, can 
have serious long-term consequences. However not taking crucial necessary steps can also 
have disastrous consequences.  
</p>
<p>56. To do this requires resources from within countries, bilateral and multilateral 
international donors, relief agencies and NGOs etc. With regard to post-disaster housing 
challenges: &#8220;Reducing the impact of natural disasters on poorer countries is directly related 
to their ability to access sufficient funding to reconstruct properly in the post-disaster 
period. Post-disaster funding stimulates economic activity and restores critical components 
of ongoing economic growth. The key is whether or not the country can access financing 
early in the post-disaster phase of recovery57.&#8221; Once accessed, allocation and use of those 
funds is also vitally important. If initial needs assessments are conducted on a competitive, 
sector-driven basis, this can result in competition between agencies for &#8220;their&#8221; projects and 
programmes, instead of much needed integration of forward-looking strategies. If such 
inputs are well used, crises resulting from disasters can in spite of all their negative impacts 
also be times of opportunity: &#8220;In post-disaster situations, intense periods of social 
rearrangement can occur, and legitimacy, authority and rules are much more fluid and open 
than perhaps at other times. While such situations present challenges such as low 
predictability and sometimes the overlooking of safeguards on the other hand they can also

<p>provide a window of opportunity for implementing positive changes. Care must be taken, 
however, to ensure that good intentions are grounded in &#8216;Do no harm&#8217; principles for 
humanitarian action.&#8221;58  
</p>
<p>57. Given the lessons of the past two decades, and the institutional reforms already 
initiated, humanitarian agencies, and one would assume bilateral donors, are now much 
more aware of the risk of doing unintended long-term harm through well-meaning early 
action which ends up increasing the vulnerability of the poor. In the area of the right to 
adequate housing and particularly on the issues of security of tenure, location, cultural 
adequacy and availability of services, facilities and infrastructure, at least, the time has 
come for &#8220;Do no harm&#8221; guidelines to move to a next step where specific tools for timely 
analysis and proactive interventions (&#8220;Do the right thing&#8221;) are provided at the field level. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> Violations of the right to adequate housing can both contribute to and result 
from armed conflicts and natural disasters. The poorer and marginalized members of 
society are disproportionately affected.  Addressing existing vulnerabilities can play 
an important role in both preventing and mitigating the impacts of disasters and 
conflicts. States should therefore: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Urgently step up their efforts to respect, protect and fulfil the right to adequate 
housing, in all its dimensions, in both urban and rural contexts; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Develop and implement land tenure reform policies and programmes that 
make suitably located, secure, safe and affordable housing accessible to all; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Recognize and protect a variety of land tenure forms, instead of a predominant 
or exclusive focus on freehold ownership. 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> In the wake of a specific disaster or conflict, the right to adequate housing 
should be integrated as a key component of planning, preparation and 
implementation of any ensuing humanitarian, reconstruction and development 
responses.   
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> Governments, with sustained support from international support agencies, 
should provide immediate, temporary shelter in reasonable adequate living conditions 
for anyone displaced by conflict or disaster.  
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> In preparing for reconstruction and development, all relevant parties and 
actors should acknowledge that housing has an inherent social value of vital 
importance for social stability, alleviation of poverty and development. Any response 
to the impacts of conflicts or disasters on the right to adequate housing should go 
beyond a focus on the damage, loss or destruction of shelter and infrastructure and 
should seek to address, inter alia: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The disruption of social and economic relationships and networks;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The destruction of home-centred livelihoods;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The specific rights and concerns of women and other groups particularly 
vulnerable to discrimination;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Compromised access to facilities, amenities and livelihood opportunities;  
</b></p>

<p>&#8226; <b>The loss of tenure security, particularly by those who had been living under 
customary or informal tenure systems prior to the disaster or conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> A rapid assessment and analysis of pre-existing tenure and property rights 
systems should be conducted in the immediate aftermath of a disaster or conflict. The 
aims of this assessment should be: (1) to guide on urgent steps to be taken to protect 
the right to adequate housing and tenure security of all, but particularly the poorer 
and marginalized members of society; (2) to identify areas of opportunity where, with 
the presence and support of bilateral and multilateral international agencies, 
opportunities could arise for improvement and innovation (for example securing of 
previously unavailable housing-related rights and entitlements for women); (3) to 
identify and warn against risk areas where  poorly informed actions would result in 
further housing rights violations. This rapid assessment should be an essential step 
towards the formulation of a more detailed and comprehensive land management, 
allocation and registration strategy for sustainable rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> Dedicated funding mechanisms or channels should be established to provide 
resources to initiatives aimed at respecting, protecting and fulfilling the right to 
adequate housing from the very outset of humanitarian operations. In addition, 
structured capacity-building networks should be created at field level, accompanied 
by focused operational support. A documented body of evidence on past violations 
(and their causes) should be produced, made available and developed into guidelines 
for action. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> The effective consultation and direct participation of affected communities in 
the design and implementation of post-conflict and post-disaster responses, 
particularly on matters of housing and land, should be ensured. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> The right of all people displaced as a result of conflict or disaster (refugees or 
IDPs) to voluntarily return to their land and homes or any other location within their 
country should be recognized and all possible steps should be taken to assist them to 
exercise that right. In cases where the displaced have settled and begun to build new 
lives and communities, their preference to remain should also be respected and 
supported. Further, in cases where secondary occupants are in possession of the land 
and houses of people displaced, sustained efforts should be made to achieve a 
negotiated agreement that satisfies all parties, prior to any legal action being taken.  
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> Housing and land issues should be addressed in peace agreements and where 
necessary institutions to deal specifically with property claims should be established. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> In post-conflict and post-disaster situations mechanisms should be put in place 
to monitor violations of the right to adequate housing, including forced evictions. 
Victims of such violations should be entitled to legal remedies and have access to 
justice.
