<p><b>A/HRC/23/10/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> GE.13-14140 
</p>
<p>1. Luxembourg wishes to point out that it received 121 recommendations at its review 
in January 2013. It immediately accepted 41 recommendations1 and took note of 4 
recommendations.2 
</p>
<p>2. This document deals with the consideration of the remaining 76 recommendations, 
71 of which have been accepted. Luxembourg is of the view that recommendations 118.4, 
118.22, 118.53, 118.65, 118.70 and 118.71 have already been implemented. 
</p>
<p>3. Luxembourg takes note of recommendations 118.3, 118.6, 118.7, 118.42 and 
118.75. 
</p>
<p><b> I. International instruments and their implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>  118.1 
</b></p>
<p>4. Luxembourg plans to ratify this convention shortly. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.2 
</b></p>
<p>5. Luxembourg plans to consider removing this reservation. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.7 
</b></p>
<p>6. See national report.3 In addition, as part of general training the majority of civil 
servants attend a course provided by the National Institute of Public Administration on 
protection for citizens in the face of administrative decisions, which includes a human 
rights component. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Protection of the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum 
seekers 
</b></p>
<p><b>  118.5, 118.68, 118.70 and 118.73 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Government has made considerable efforts to enlarge the staff of its refugee 
department, which now has sufficient means to process applications within a reasonable 
time frame. 
</p>
<p>8. With regard to statelessness, a formal procedure is now in place4 for de facto 
stateless persons, and a procedure for de jure stateless persons will soon be finalized. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.6, 118.41, 118.42, 118.56 and 118.66 
</b></p>
<p>9. Luxembourg has established a fast and effective system whereby applicants for 
international protection can receive basic care in the country. Under the reception and 
support system, once the application for asylum has been lodged, the applicant is enrolled 
in the general health insurance system and undergoes a series of individual examinations in 
the interest of public health. 
</p>
<p>10. The main initial reception centre for applicants for international protection has a 
psychologist on staff, paid for by the Government. In addition to this psychological care 
provided, any applicant can use the services offered by the various psychiatry professionals 
operating outside the hospital setting. 
</p>
<p>11. Applicants for international protection are housed in specialized shelters for the 
duration of the procedure. During this period, they have access to the forms of aid described 
in the national report. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/10/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-14140 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>12. All applicants for international protection, including unaccompanied minors and 
persons with specific needs, live under an &#8220;open&#8221; system. 
</p>
<p>13. The Act of 1 July 2011 introduced the option of restricted residence as an alternative 
to detention when it is reasonable to assume that the person will be returned but the 
procedure has been postponed for technical reasons. There is a strong focus on voluntary 
return before a person is placed in detention. The number of voluntary returns is four times 
greater than the number of persons placed in detention. 
</p>
<p>14. No decision to return an unaccompanied minor may be issued, except on the basis of 
serious public security concerns, or unless the deportation is in the minor&#8217;s best interests.5 If 
a minor is deported on the basis of serious public security concerns, confinement in the 
detention centre cannot be ruled out, whereas if the deportation is in the minor&#8217;s best 
interests, he or she must be placed in suitable accommodation outside the detention centre. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.39 
</b></p>
<p>15. Only 17 detainees, or 3.5 per cent of the total number, have been held for 4 months 
or longer. The average length of detention among the 487 detainees held at the detention 
centre since it became operational in September 2011 is 28 days, and legislation stipulates 
that families with minor children cannot be held for more than 72 hours.6 
</p>
<p><b>  118.44 
</b></p>
<p>16. Applications for family reunification, including those lodged by recognized 
refugees, are considered in a positive spirit. However, the applications are often not lodged 
until after several months or even years have passed. In such cases, ordinary law applies, 
including with regard to the applicant&#8217;s means of support. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.54 
</b></p>
<p>17. Luxembourg is currently studying the issue of resettlement. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.75 
</b></p>
<p>18. All asylum applications are examined individually. If the legal conditions have been 
met, the person is granted international protection. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Equality between women and men 
</b></p>
<p><b>  118.9, 118.10, 118.11, 118.12 and 118.13 
</b></p>
<p>19. The recommendations on equality between men and women have already been 
incorporated into the National Action Plan on Equality between Women and Men 2009&#8211;
2014, which includes a set of positive measures aimed at private enterprises, government 
ministries and public administration offices and facilitates the taking of suitable measures 
to combat any existing discrimination or to narrow the gender wage gap.7 
</p>
<p>20. Luxembourg will also continue its efforts to combat all forms of discrimination 
through the 2010&#8211;2014 National Plan of Action to Achieve Integration and Combat 
Discrimination, awareness-raising activities and partnerships with civil society. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.26 and 118.27 
</b></p>
<p>21. Parliament is in the process of amending the legislation on domestic violence to 
strengthen the rights of adult and child victims and make perpetrators more accountable for 
their actions,8 enabling better protection of women and men from all forms of violence. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/10/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.13-14140 
</p>
<p>22. The Committee on Cooperation between professionals in the field of combating 
violence is responsible for monitoring implementation of the relevant legislation and for 
conducting activities to raise awareness of and prevent domestic violence. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Access to employment and social services 
</b></p>
<p><b>  118.14, 118.49, 118.50, 118.51, 118.52 and 118.53 
</b></p>
<p>23. Generally speaking, all citizens, including foreign nationals legally settled in 
Luxembourg, enjoy the same rights with regard to employment and work, as well as 
benefits and welfare payments. 
</p>
<p>24. The guaranteed minimum income system provides all rights holders with a 
minimum income and mandatory personalized support to help them either enter the labour 
market or integrate in society. 
</p>
<p>25. Current policies focus on reducing inequalities with respect to prospects in the job 
market. 
</p>
<p>26. An information and vocational guidance service was established in 2011 to promote 
access to the labour market for third country nationals, applicants for international 
protection and recognized refugees. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Integration and the fight against all forms of discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>  118.4 
</b></p>
<p>27. Luxembourg considers that its legislation covers persons who have undergone 
gender reassignment.9 
</p>
<p><b>  118.15, 118.16, 118.17, 118.20, 118.21, 118.22, 118.23, 118.24, 118.25, 118.52, 118.69, 
118.72 and 118.74 
</b></p>
<p>28. Luxembourg has a legislative framework of effective, proportionate and dissuasive 
measures to combat racist, xenophobic and Islamophobic acts.10 Luxembourg legislation 
prohibits any direct or indirect discrimination based on a real or assumed ethnic or racial 
affiliation or non-affiliation, sexual orientation, religion or belief, disability or age. In this 
regard, the Centre for Equal Treatment was established as an independent body with the 
authority to promote, analyse and monitor equality of treatment with regard to the 
aforementioned grounds of discrimination, including sex. The Centre also provides 
information and awareness-raising on discrimination, particularly for awareness-raising 
campaigns. 
</p>
<p>29. Under the National Plan of Action to Achieve Integration and Combat 
Discrimination, the Government supports specific projects and activities to benefit groups 
at risk of discrimination or activities to promote diversity in general. It also encourages the 
communes to carry out similar activities. 
</p>
<p>30. The reception and integration contract has been a great success. 
</p>
<p>31. Many tools are in place to implement a consistent and sustainable integration policy. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.46 
</b></p>
<p>32. This bill should be adopted in 2013.11 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/10/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-14140 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b>  118.59 and 118.60 
</b></p>
<p>33. Implementation of the Five-Year Action Plan for Persons with Disabilities12 began 
in 2012. It focuses on a different theme every year; the theme for 2013 is &#8220;empowerment&#8221;. 
Within this framework, the Government promotes the wide availability of information in 
accessible formats so that persons with disabilities can stay informed independently without 
needing to constantly seek help from others. 
</p>
<p>34. A &#8220;Life Academy&#8221; has been established to strengthen the autonomy, self-
determination and self-representation of persons with disabilities. The Academy&#8217;s 
underlying principle is that persons with disabilities are experts in the areas that concern 
them and that they should be involved in the discussions affecting them and be given the 
opportunity to make their own choices in life. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.61 
</b></p>
<p>35. With regard to accessibility, an increasing number of the projects carried out go 
beyond the requirements set out in current regulations.13 An agency that is contracted and 
subsidized by the Government14 serves as the chief adviser on accessibility in Luxembourg. 
Thanks to its suggestions, a number of large-scale projects have been made more 
accessible. In the medium term, current legislation on the accessibility of public spaces will 
be reviewed with a view to broadening its scope of application to cover private spaces open 
to the public. 
</p>
<p>36. The dependent persons&#8217; insurance provides persons with the technical aids they may 
need, including alterations to housing. 
</p>
<p>37. Many measures are in place to maintain and facilitate access to employment for 
persons with disabilities (such as disabled employee status, sheltered workshops and 
vocational training) and for employees who have reduced work capacity or are unable to 
continue performing their last job (such as internal and external reclassification). The 
Agency for the Development of Employment can partially or fully cover the costs of 
counselling, training, rehabilitation and vocational retraining and may also grant subsidies 
to employers.15 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Combating trafficking in persons 
  118.18, 118.28, 118.31, 118.32, 118.33, 118.34, 118.35, 118.43 and 118.63 
</b></p>
<p>38. With regard to trafficking in persons, Luxembourg has partnerships with 
associations that provide both residential and non-residential services for the recovery, 
support, empowerment and integration of victims of trafficking in persons adapted to their 
specific needs (for women, children and men, and depending on their origin, religion, 
nationality, disability, origin, status and other factors) regardless of the purposes of the 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>39. The Ministry of Equal Opportunity and the Ministry of Family Affairs and Social 
Integration, together with the criminal investigation service and associations, coordinate the 
assistance, protection and security provided for victims. 
</p>
<p>40. The victims have a right to legal aid and translation and interpreting services and 
under certain conditions have a right to assistance with entry into the labour market. 
</p>
<p>41. The Informal Committee on Human Trafficking,16 which brings together persons 
working on the ground, particularly to monitor and coordinate activities to prevent and 
combat trafficking in persons, is continuing its work. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/10/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.13-14140 
</p>
<p>42. A bill17 strengthening the rights of victims of trafficking in persons has just been 
tabled in parliament. The bill also calls for the Ombudsman to be appointed as the National 
Rapporteur on Trafficking. 
</p>
<p>43. Various regulations are also being drafted.18 
</p>
<p><b>  118.27, 118.29, 118.30 and 118.36 
</b></p>
<p>44. See the efforts undertaken since the first universal periodic review to strengthen the 
legal framework protecting children from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.19 The bill 
referred to in paragraph 46 of the national report, which has since been adopted, imposes 
stronger penalties for such criminal offences.20 
</p>
<p>45. A system of accommodation and social welfare provision has been established for 
minors who apply for international protection in order to prevent any risk of their sexual 
exploitation and abuse. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b>  118.19, 118.47 and 118.48 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Government will continue to work with the Muslim community on the new 
draft agreement. It reaffirms the right of the Shura to be officially recognized as a body 
representing Muslims in Luxembourg. 
</p>
<p>47. Work continues in connection with the experts&#8217; report on the development of 
relations between the State and religious or non-faith-based philosophical communities 
published in October 2012. Parliament will soon provide guidance on the new arrangement 
and on the content of a constitutional reform, which will also involve the documents on 
relations between the State and religious communities. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Education 
</b></p>
<p><b>  118.8 
</b></p>
<p>48. The 2009&#8211;2014 government programme calls for the systematic implementation of 
education on sexuality and emotional health at all levels of education. A 2013&#8211;2016 
&#8220;emotional and sexual health&#8221; action plan will be finalized in 2013.21 
</p>
<p>49. The basic education curriculum is checked, adapted and supplemented in 
collaboration with the National School Commission and the Basic Education Department. 
The Division of Preventive Medicine and the Division of School Health Care are involved 
in initiatives to promote sexual health. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.57 
</b></p>
<p>50. Students are encouraged to pursue the type of education that best corresponds with 
their profile, based on their academic record as established by the Educational Reception 
Unit. 
</p>
<p>51. Regular meetings are planned with students&#8217; parents so as to take better 
consideration of their views when deciding which track students should be encouraged to 
follow. All possibilities are discussed during these meetings. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/10/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.13-14140 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b>  118.58 and 118.67 
</b></p>
<p>52. In addition to some Portuguese and Italian language courses added to the 
Luxembourg school timetable, which are taught by teachers hired and paid by the 
embassies of Portugal and Italy respectively, Portuguese native speakers may act as 
assistants to preschool teachers so as to gradually expand their multilingual and 
multicultural skills. 
</p>
<p>53. The &#8220;Opening up to Languages&#8221; programme has been introduced in the areas of 
education provided for under the Basic Education Act. It is a comparative approach that 
makes use of the resources students have and allows them to build on their knowledge of 
one language to help them better understand another one and gradually expand their 
multilingual and multicultural skills. 
</p>
<p>54. Several measures have been taken to reduce failure at school among immigrant 
students in secondary schools, including reception and integration classes with intensive 
French lessons for newly arrived students, classes taught using French or English, special 
German or French classes and International Baccalaureate classes taught in French or 
English. 
</p>
<p>55. The ALLET and French + classes are offered for secondary students experiencing 
difficulties in German or French respectively, while in technical secondary education these 
needs are met through specific language classes. 
</p>
<p>56. Intercultural mediators take part in information meetings and interviews to foster 
dialogue between parents who speak foreign languages, school authorities, teachers and 
students. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.62 
</b></p>
<p>57. In January 2013 the Government conducted an initial assessment of the school 
reform. With regard to differentiated learning, it intends to improve the functioning of 
multidisciplinary teams, strengthen their presence and availability in schools and 
collaborate with teachers to provide better support for students. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Good administration of justice 
  118.37 and 118.38 
</b></p>
<p>58. A new prison being built will, from 2018, house detainees who have not yet been 
convicted. Health and hygiene in prisons is an issue of constant concern for the prison 
authorities.22 
</p>
<p><b>  118.40 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Dreiborn security unit will open in 2013. 
</p>
<p><b>  118.45 
</b></p>
<p>60. As part of the reform of the prison administration,23 a proposal has been made to 
prohibit the admission of minors to prison, unless a juvenile judge has ordered that the 
minor should be tried according to ordinary criminal law.24 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/10/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.13-14140 
</p>
<p><b> X. Other matters 
  118.55  
</b></p>
<p>61. Luxembourg has strengthened its efforts to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Improve information on the health of pregnant women and newborns by developing 
a monitoring system that operates in all maternity wards in the country; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Facilitate access to contraception by covering 80 per cent of the costs of 
contraceptives for all women under 25 years of age; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promote emotional and sexual health by coordinating an interdepartmental initiative 
to develop a national programme on emotional and sexual health; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strengthen support services throughout the country for women requesting assistance 
in the areas of reproductive health or early childhood (such as school health services, 
La Ligue M&#233;dico-Sociale, Aidsberodung and Planning Familial). 
</p>
<p>62. In 2009, Luxembourg adopted a law on palliative care, advance directives and end-
of-life care.25 
</p>
<p><b>  118.64 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Government supports the activities of NGOs working in many areas to assist 
families.26 
</p>
<p><b>  118.76 
</b></p>
<p>64. Since the submission of its national report, Luxembourg has adopted four new 
legislative measures.27
