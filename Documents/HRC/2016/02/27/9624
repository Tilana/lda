(E/CN.4/2006/67 and Add.1-3) 
1. <b>Mr. Mudho</b> (Independent Expert on the effects of economic reform policies and 
foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights), introducing his report 
(E/CN.4/2006/46 and Add.1), said that the situation of the heavily indebted poor countries 
had improved only slightly over the past year and their overall debt was still estimated at 
US$ 500 billion. Debt-servicing continued to undermine poor countries&#8217; ability to use 
internal and external resources in order to further the implementation of human rights and 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Some progress had been made through the 
approval of debt-service relief of US$ 56 billion for 28 countries under the Heavily 
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The relief operation was expected to reduce 
those countries&#8217; debt-service payments by US$ 1 billion annually. 
2. In addition, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) endorsed by the Group of 
Eight in July 2005 provided for the cancellation of 100 per cent of debt which the world&#8217;s 
most indebted poor countries owed the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World 
Bank and the African Development Bank. The total amount of debt relief granted under the 
MDRI was estimated to be about US$ 50 billion. Although the amount of debt cancelled 
was modest compared with the US$ 500 billion still owed and the initiative only extended 
to a limited number of poor countries and three financial institutions, it was an important 
first step and provided participating countries with some US$ 1.2 billion for MDG-related 
spending that would otherwise have been paid to multilateral creditors. 
</p>
<p>3. If debt-relief initiatives were to yield the expected results, it must be ensured that 
gains from debt relief were not simply offset by a reduction in future official development 
assistance. According to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, that principle had not always been respected in the past. Donors should 
consider broadening the scope of the initiative to include a greater number of developing 
countries, all multilateral credit institutions, and all bilateral and private creditors. He 
reminded the Council that, despite all debt relief efforts and calls for increased aid, net 
resource outflows from developing countries had continued in 2004. 
</p>
<p>4. States had primary responsibility for their own development, the realization of the 
human rights of their people and the management of additional policy space created by debt 
relief. Beneficiary States needed to invest the resources derived from debt relief in a 
manner conducive to the implementation of human rights and the achievement of MDGs. 
Good governance, accountability and transparency were also crucial conditions for 
realizing the benefits accruing from debt relief. Country-owned poverty reduction strategy 
papers were increasingly seen as a basis for debt relief operations; the integration of a 
human rights perspective was essential in that context. 
</p>
<p>5. Civil society and independent national human rights institutions should be actively 
involved in monitoring budget processes in order to ensure that the resources freed under 
the HIPC and MDRI initiatives were used in accordance with human rights and MDG 
priorities. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/2/SR.12 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-17372 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>6. The report highlighted some of the obstacles and challenges relating to the 
formulation of draft general guidelines pursuant to resolutions 2004/18 and 2005/19 of the 
Commission on Human Rights. In order to finalize the proposed guidelines, it would be 
necessary to: determine the &#8220;sustainable&#8221; level of external debt of a country; undertake an 
independent estimation of the resources needed to meet the minimum core obligations of a 
country under international human rights instruments; and reflect further on operational 
questions. Given those conceptual and operational challenges, an extended time frame for 
the formulation of the guidelines would be necessary, in particular to allow proper and 
meaningful consultations with all stakeholders and to obtain the views of a significant 
number of Member States on the need and scope of such guidelines, which he had already 
solicited. 
</p>
<p>7. Referring to his mission to Mozambique in July 2005, he said that that country had 
made important strides in achieving economic growth, microeconomic stability and debt 
sustainability. The HIPC Initiative and debt-rescheduling had enabled the Government to 
protect social expenditure, but the country remained highly dependent on external 
assistance and faced important challenges in terms of both poverty reduction and human 
rights. Despite the high rate of economic growth in recent years, Mozambique remained 
very low on the Human Development Index. Progress in poverty reduction varied widely 
from region to region. The mission had revealed that economic growth and macroeconomic 
stability were necessary, but not in themselves sufficient, conditions for the reduction of 
poverty and the realization of human rights. Although the efforts made by all stakeholders 
to implement the country&#8217;s poverty reduction strategy were commendable, more specific 
efforts were needed to integrate human rights into the goals, plans and processes under the 
Strategy in order to ensure that the opportunities created by debt relief had a sustainable 
impact on poverty reduction. 
</p>
<p>8. Mozambique was also an instructive illustration of innovative partnership and 
cooperation between donors and the Government. General budget support and joint review 
mechanisms provided ample opportunities to ensure country ownership, transparency and 
accountability. Human rights principles could provide a strong legal basis for those 
concepts. 
</p>
<p>9. The prolonged civil war had had serious debilitating effects on human development 
and capacity. Despite the Government&#8217;s commitment to the promotion and protection of all 
human rights, its capacity to protect those rights and citizens&#8217; capacity to exercise them 
were limited. Further progress with judicial reform and the establishment of an independent 
human rights institution were essential in that regard. He had been pleased to learn that the 
revised &#8220;Poverty reduction strategy paper II (2006&#8211;2010)&#8221; contained improvements and 
innovations, including: the establishment of human rights as one of the priorities of 
democratic governance; provisions for human rights training and anti-discrimination 
activities; the explicit recognition of food, housing and education as social, economic and 
cultural rights; and the recognition of HIV/AIDS as a significant challenge to the effective 
enjoyment of all human rights and acknowledgement that the rights of people affected by 
HIV/AIDS must be protected. The Government&#8217;s decision to take priority measures under 
the revised strategy in order to establish an accessible, transparent and inclusive justice 
system was also commendable. The implementation of the new cycle of the revised 
Strategy should be guided by human rights principles. The continued monitoring of public 
expenditure and the securing of new loans were crucial. He welcomed efforts to strengthen 
the &#8220;poverty observatory&#8221; and recommended further strengthening the capacity of NGOs 
and other stakeholders in monitoring public spending from a human rights stand point. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>Mr. Qerimaj</b> (Observer for Albania), referring to the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography on his mission 
to Albania (E/CN.4/2006/67/Add.1), said that some of the issues mentioned in that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/2/SR.12 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.09-17372 
</p>
<p>document had already been resolved or were currently being addressed. His Government 
attached great importance to close cooperation and dialogue to facilitate the early 
implementation of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations. The report contained a 
number of inaccuracies, but any comments by his Government should be seen in a wider 
context of cooperation and dialogue. 
</p>
<p>11. In response to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur, on 27 
February 2006 Albania and Greece had signed a Bilateral Agreement on the Protection and 
Assistance of Child Victims of Trafficking, which provided for assistance to, and 
preventive protection and rehabilitation of, all victims of trafficking. Also following up the 
recommendations, the Ministry of Justice had established a working group to prepare 
amendments to the Criminal Code reinforcing the protection of children. 
</p>
<p>12. Issues relating to gender equality discussed in paragraphs 41 to 44 of the report did 
not fall within the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate, although his Government was keenly 
aware of the persistent problems in that area. 
</p>
<p>13. Although the Albanian National Strategy for the Improvement of Living Conditions 
of the Roma Minority (2003&#8211;15) was an effective policy directly linked to the protection of 
persons vulnerable to trafficking, the report had regrettably remained silent about the 
outcomes of the Strategy. Under the National Strategy on Combating Trafficking in 
Persons, the National Strategy for Children and the National Strategy on Social Protection, 
his Government had taken preventive action by supporting underprivileged families whose 
children were particularly vulnerable to trafficking and by reintegrating trafficked children. 
</p>
<p>14. His Government would gladly host further special procedures missions in support of 
progress in the area of human rights in Albania. 
</p>
<p>15. <b>Mr. Verros</b> (Observer for Greece) commended the in-depth analysis of the situation 
contained in the report of the Special Rapporteur on his mission to Greece in November 
2005 (E/CN.4/2006/67/Add.3). It showed that the work of special procedure mandate-
holders was crucial to the implementation of programmes and actions aimed at 
strengthening national human rights protection mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>16. Combating trafficking in children, victim protection and assistance to 
unaccompanied minors were key priorities for his Government. In recent years, Greece had 
become a major migrant-receiving country and a series of measures had been taken to 
tackle the new situation. New legislation had been adopted on human trafficking. The 
attendant action plan provided for special protection measures for under-age victims of 
trafficking; the establishment of shelters; free legal aid; public information campaigns; the 
establishment of appropriate mechanisms for the identification of under-age victims; the 
issuance of residence permits; the establishment of education and training centres; and the 
creation of a nationwide database. Programmes and specialized services had been 
established in order to improve the reception, social integration and health-care access of 
foreign minors. 
</p>
<p>17. Under the national action plan, much had been done to improve infrastructures, raise 
awareness of the problem of trafficking and encourage victims to seek help. Workshops and 
other events had been organized in cooperation with UNHCR in order to build the capacity 
of public institutions to address the scourge. A cooperation agreement had been signed with 
16 major NGOs in order to enhance the involvement of civil society. 
</p><p>18. Greece engaged actively with neighbouring countries and countries of origin of 
trafficking, as illustrated by the conclusion by Greece and Albania in 2006 of the Bilateral 
Agreement on the Protection and Assistance of Child Victims of Trafficking. His 
Government was encouraged by the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s positive evaluation of measures 
taken thus far; his useful recommendations would be given careful consideration. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/2/SR.12 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-17372 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Greek Parliament was currently debating legislation on domestic violence which provided, 
inter alia, for heavier sentences for sexual abuse of minors. Draft legislation on the 
ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography had already been approved. 
</p>
<p>19. <b>Mr. Carlos</b> (Observer for Mozambique), thanking the Independent Expert for his 
mission to Mozambique and preparation of an important report, said that the Government 
would continue to work on improving living conditions for its people. 
</p>
<p>20. <b>Mr. Fathallah</b> (Observer for Iraq), also referring to the report of the Independent 
Expert, said that although his country was rich in natural and human resources, as a result 
of equivocal economic policies pursued by the previous regime it currently faced a debt 
burden of an estimated US$ 150 trillion. The effect of the wars with neighbouring countries 
aggravated the situation. Despite the debt relief granted by IMF and the World Bank, the 
commitments deriving from foreign debt had had a severe impact on the welfare of the 
population, especially low-income segments, with rising oil and commodity prices resulting 
in an overall cost-of-living increase of approximately 70 per cent. He asked whether the 
Independent Expert had examined the conditions which IMF and the World Bank imposed 
on countries in transition and their impact on human rights. 
</p>
<p>21. <b>Mr. Gala L&#243;pez</b> (Cuba), speaking with reference to the report of the Independent 
Expert, said that his Government attached particular importance to the effects of economic 
reform policies and foreign debt on human rights. Concrete measures must be taken at the 
international level to find lasting, equitable solutions to the foreign debt burden on 
developing countries and to reverse the social deterioration resulting from neo-liberal 
structural adjustment programmes. Experience had shown that poverty and inequality had 
increased in developing countries following the implementation of those programmes, and 
that those countries had accumulated unsustainable levels of external debt. 
</p>
<p>22. When preparing the proposed draft guidelines, the Independent Expert might wish to 
draw on relevant work carried out by United Nations bodies and international conferences. 
He enquired whether the concept of shared responsibility of developed and developing 
countries and national and international financial institutions would be included in the draft 
guidelines. 
</p>
<p>23. <b>Ms. Leyemanne</b> (Sri Lanka), referring to the report by the Special Rapporteur, said 
that her country had a national child protection authority with a special police unit 
responsible for investigations of sexual abuse and exploitation of children. At the &#8220;treaty 
event&#8221; held on the sidelines of the 2006 World Summit of the General Assembly, Sri Lanka 
had ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and also the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime in an effort to strengthen the country&#8217;s 
legal framework for the promotion of children&#8217;s rights and combating transnational 
organized crime. 
</p>
<p>24. In November 2005, three police officers belonging to the National Child Protection 
Authority had been abducted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during an 
investigation relating to a foreign paedophile and had been illegally held for one year. Their 
detention had impeded the investigation and effective dispensation of justice, which 
illustrated how investigations into child sexual abuse and exploitation could be hampered 
by a non-State entity. 
</p>
<p>25. Responding to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s concern over the high incidence of violence 
against women, she said that currently reported information on gender-based violence 
revealed low figures, which might be due to cultural barriers to reporting. Steps had been 
taken towards establishing women and child desks, to be staffed by trained women police 
officers, in the hope of improving reporting rates and follow-up. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/2/SR.12 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.09-17372 
</p>
<p>26. <b>Ms. De Bellis</b> (Uruguay) said that the prosecution of persons trafficking children for 
the purpose of sexual exploitation must go hand in hand with measures to curb demand for 
sexual services involving minors. She agreed with the Special Rapporteur that the demand 
factor warranted additional attention. The growing, indiscriminate use of the Internet for the 
dissemination of child pornography clearly increased the incidence of such conduct and 
must be tackled. Despite the lack of reliable data, it was easy to imagine how the existence 
of child pornography sites could encourage users to proceed to action, thus increasing 
demand for child sexual services. The issue should be addressed through multilateral 
action. Education programmes aimed at combating the phenomenon were of paramount 
importance. Her delegation looked to the Special Rapporteur for guidance on preventive 
measures, including the role of social educators and victim rehabilitation centres. It would 
welcome additional information on those aspects in the next report. 
</p>
<p>27. <b>Mr. Garcia</b> (Philippines) welcomed the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s focus on the demand 
factor in the commercial sexual exploitation of children and enquired which prevention and 
awareness-raising measures he had found to be effective in reducing such demand. He 
asked whether efforts by Governments to criminalize and raise awareness of sex tourism 
had resulted in a reduction in cases of child exploitation. 
</p>
<p>28. Turning to the report by the Independent Expert, he said that although there was 
agreement that debt-servicing should not undermine the realization of human rights, the 
opposite was unfortunately true in many developing countries. Debt-ridden countries often 
sacrificed budget allocations for education, health care and social services in the name of 
fiscal responsibility and continued access to international capital markets. Endorsing the 
proposal by the Independent Expert to link debt relief with the achievement of MDGs, he 
asked what the Independent Expert thought of debt-for-equity schemes whereby part of a 
country&#8217;s external debt would be invested in national projects promoting social, economic 
and cultural rights, including the right to development. 
</p>
<p>29. <b>Ms. Pohjankukka</b> (Finland), speaking on behalf of the European Union, enquired 
about the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s views on mechanisms and methods required to strengthen 
international cooperation and improve operational follow-up in the area of the protection of 
children&#8217;s rights. It would be useful to know how the complementarity of existing human 
rights mechanisms could be ensured. 
</p>
<p>30. Protection of, and assistance to, child victims and consideration of their special 
needs were crucial in countering the commercial sexual exploitation of children. It would 
thus be useful to learn of any activities planned by the Special Rapporteur that would 
improve such protection and assistance. Her delegation would welcome additional 
information about concrete plans for activities to be undertaken in collaboration with the 
Special Rapporteur in relation to trafficking in persons, especially women and children. 
</p>
<p>31. <b>Mr. Logar</b> (Observer for Slovenia) said he wished to know what action might 
effectively reduce demand for the sexual exploitation of children. It would be useful to 
obtain concrete examples of the prosecution of offenders in the 30 countries that had 
already adopted legislation on sexual activities of their citizens involving minors abroad, 
and information on the difficulties encountered in such cases. 
</p>
<p>32. <b>Mr. Rahman</b> (Bangladesh), commending the Independent Expert for his efforts in 
developing the draft general guidelines, said he deplored the lack of cooperation on the part 
of States and other stakeholders and the resulting need for more time to prepare those 
guidelines. The integration of human rights perspectives in economic policies and debt-
servicing was an attractive and noble undertaking, as external debt burdens hampered the 
realization of fundamental social, economic and cultural rights in many developing 
countries. The resources freed by debt relief would no doubt enhance countries&#8217; capacity to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/2/SR.12 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-17372 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>achieve the MDGs and meet their core obligations under the international human rights 
instruments. 
</p>
<p>33. Referring to the Independent Expert&#8217;s mission to Mozambique, he asked whether the 
benefits derived from foreign debt relief had produced any tangible results. If not, it would 
be useful to know what obstacles were hampering progress. Did the Independent Expert 
believe that debt relief alone might not be a solution and that innovative financial processes 
like &#8220;front-loading&#8221; might be needed to jump-start the process? 
</p><p>34. With regard to the need to integrate human rights considerations in microeconomic 
policy making, he said that while respect for human rights was important, it should not 
become an impediment to economic growth. What were now developed countries had not 
been subject to human rights-related conditions in the early days of their development. He 
invited the Independent Expert to offer his views on the effectiveness of mutually 
reinforcing methods. 
</p>
<p>35. <b>Ms. Diallo</b> (Mali) said that the 2005 Multilateral Agreement to Combat Child 
Trafficking in West Africa mentioned in the report of the Special Rapporteur demonstrated 
the commitment of the countries in the subregion to combat child trafficking effectively. In 
addition, Mali had withdrawn its reservation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and concluded bilateral cooperation agreements with several neighbouring countries with 
the aim of combating trafficking. Within that framework, dozens of Malian children 
working on plantations in neighbouring countries had been repatriated. 
</p>
<p>36. The promotion and protection of the rights of women and children was one of the 
key priorities of Mali&#8217;s human rights policy. To give effect to that political will, her 
Government had established a special Ministry for the Promotion of Women, Children and 
the Family and a &#8220;Children&#8217;s parliament&#8221;. While her delegation supported the 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur, too much emphasis had been placed on 
the sexual exploitation of children and not enough had been said about children sold as 
cheap labour falling victim to a merciless market economy. 
</p>
<p>37. <b>Ms. Khavn</b> (Russian Federation) asked whether the Special Rapporteur could 
provide up-to-date information on effective action taken by Governments to prevent the use 
of the Internet for the exploitation of children, or recommend suitable measures to that end. 
She would be interested to learn the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s views on the globalization of 
prostitution and requested clarification on the distinction between voluntary and forced 
sexual services mentioned in the report. 
</p>
<p>38. <b>Mr. Cerda</b> (Argentina) agreed with the Special Rapporteur on the need for greater 
emphasis on the demand factor in the commercial sexual exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p>39. Turning to the Independent Expert&#8217;s report contained in document 
E/CN.4/2006/Add.1, he drew particular attention to paragraphs 25 and 37 (d). The 
Independent Expert had recommended that the indicators for measuring qualitatively the 
basic requirements for the realization of human rights should be developed by the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It might be preferable to 
develop those indicators in the context of the Open-ended Working Group on the Right to 
Development, which had already pointed to the need for certain human rights indicators to 
measure debt-service sustainability in quantitative terms. 
</p>
<p>40. <b>Mr. Solano Ortiz</b> (Observer for Costa Rica) agreed with the Special Rapporteur that 
child-abusers should be effectively prosecuted. He also shared the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
view that effective action must be taken to prevent sexual abuse of minors by United 
Nations peacekeepers and employees of international organizations and to punish such 
conduct severely when it occurred. He asked whether it might be feasible in the short term 
for the international community to classify such acts as crimes under international law and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/2/SR.12 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.09-17372 
</p>
<p>to criminalize the dissemination of child pornography on the Internet. He would welcome 
suggestions by the Special Rapporteur on possible urgent measures to prevent such abuse. 
</p>
<p>41. <b>Ms. Janjua</b> (Pakistan), referring to the report by the Independent Expert, said that 
reducing the crushing debt burden of developing countries was of paramount importance. 
The Independent Expert might wish to take account of the debt situation of low and middle-
income countries and its impact on the enjoyment of all human rights; examine further the 
impact of debt reduction and the diversion of resources to social sector development, 
especially in areas relating to women and children; and continue his work on the creation of 
additional policy space in developing countries. Experience had shown that standard 
prescriptions for structural reform did not work globally. The focus, including in the work 
of the Independent Expert, should be on home-grown solutions and country-based 
requirements. As the human rights machinery was being reviewed in accordance with 
General Assembly resolution 60/251, attention should focus on issues relevant to the 
Independent Expert&#8217;s mandate and of critical interest to developing countries. 
</p>
<p>42. <b>Mr. Endo</b> (Japan), referring to the report by the Special Rapporteur, reminded the 
Council of the Second World Congress against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of 
Children hosted by Japan in 2001, which had called for the promotion of effective policies 
to address the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In recognition of the crucial 
importance of the demand factor in addressing child prostitution, his Government had 
amended the Law on the Punishment of Acts relating to Child Prostitution and Child 
Pornography, and on the Protection of Children (Law No. 52 of 1999), and had ratified the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography. The Japanese tourism authorities had signed the Code 
of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism, 
obliging travel agents to train personnel concerning destinations and prohibiting sexual 
exploitation of children in contracts concluded with local agents. Given the fact that 
measures to counter child prostitution and pornography could only be effective through the 
cooperation of the countries concerned, the Japanese police had held an international 
symposium to expand and strengthen cooperation in overseas investigations within South-
East Asia in 2002. 
</p>
<p>43. <b>Mr. Tichenor</b> (Observer for the United States of America) agreed that the demand 
factor in the commercial exploitation of children deserved additional attention. As stated in 
the report, sex tourism was a serious problem and he invited the Special Rapporteur to 
elaborate on measures States should take on a priority basis in that area. Commending the 
Special Rapporteur for his initiative in coordinating his work closely with the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, he requested additional information on actions 
planned. 
</p>
<p>44. <b>Mr. Zevallos &#193;guilar</b> (Peru) said that his Government had launched an information 
campaign at all points of entry into Peru to inform foreigners that the exploitation of 
children was a punishable offence in his country, liable to heavy penalties commensurate 
with the seriousness of the offence committed. The campaign was being implemented 
jointly by the Ministry for Women and Social Development and the Ministry of the Interior. 
The Criminal Code had also been amended recently to establish the sexual abuse of minors 
as a very serious offence and information campaigns had been conducted to raise public 
awareness. In addition, the dissemination of child pornography on the Internet had been 
criminalized and a specialized police unit had been set up to prosecute paedophiles and 
persons possessing, producing or disseminating child pornography. 
</p>
<p>45. <b>Mr. Musa</b> (Observer for the Sudan), referring to the report of the Independent 
Expert, noted that only 10 per cent of developing countries&#8217; debt had been cancelled. 
Strategies adopted by developed countries vis-&#224;-vis developing countries often failed to 
take account of the importance of good governance or the debilitating effect of conflict </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/2/SR.12 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-17372 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>situations. Structural adjustment policies and debt relief-related strategies should take 
account of country situations, governance and domestic policies in line with the MDGs. 
</p>
<p>46. <b>Mr. Larensa Serrano</b> (Ecuador), referring to the report by the Special Rapporteur 
on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, said that the international 
community must devote priority attention to the protection of children, including in 
international law. It was alarming that only 4 out of 25 Governments of States which had 
received a total of 34 communications from the Special Rapporteur concerning the sale, 
trafficking or sexual exploitation of children had responded. Effective and immediate action 
should be taken to ensure that Governments responded in accordance with their obligations. 
</p>
<p>47. <b>Ms. Sosa Nishizaki</b> (Observer for Mexico) welcomed the focus by the Special 
Rapporteur on the demand factor in the fight against child sexual exploitation. She 
endorsed the recommendations contained in paragraph 131 (b) and (e) of his report, 
especially the proposal to set up a mandatory educational and training programme for 
military and United Nations personnel on human trafficking, gender equality, the effects of 
buying women and children for sex, and identifying and assisting trafficking victims. 
</p>
<p>48. Turning to the report by the Independent Expert, she expressed support for his 
recommendation in paragraph 37 (c) that the Council urge States to cooperate with him in 
the discharge of his mandate and, in particular, to respond to his requests for their views 
and suggestions on possible elements for consideration in the draft general guidelines. 
</p>
<p>49. <b>Ms. Schenk</b> (World Organization against Torture), also speaking on behalf of the 
International Save the Children Alliance, the International Alliance of Women, Plan 
International, the World Movement of Mothers, Defence for Children International, the 
Women&#8217;s World Summit Foundation, the International Federation of Social Workers, 
World Vision International, ECPAT International, the World Union of Catholic Women&#8217;s 
Organizations and the Child Rights Information Network, said that while child rights 
should be mainstreamed into the human rights system as a whole, the Council should adopt 
a specific child rights focus in recognition of children&#8217;s specific needs and concerns. The 
Council should highlight the Convention on the Rights of the Child in its work and assert 
its commitment to child rights by including a separate relevant item in the agendas for 
future sessions. 
</p>
<p>50. The Council should take action on violence against children; the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography; children affected by armed conflict and 
displacement; and children in conflict with the law. It should ensure the meaningful and 
substantive participation of NGOs and independent human rights institutions focusing on 
children&#8217;s rights in their work, including under the universal periodic review. Specific 
facilities should be created to allow children themselves to participate in the work of the 
Council. Special procedures must be maintained and strengthened and include the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols in their mandate.  
</p>
<p>51. <b>Mr. Pary</b> (Indian Movement &#8220;Tupaj Amaru&#8221;), referring to the report of the 
Independent Expert, said that 30 years after the establishment of a new global economic 
order, speaking about the fundamental right to food, clothing and decent housing meant 
speaking about extreme poverty, increasingly unsustainable foreign debt, bankruptcy 
leading to social crises and the corruption of modern society. Those phenomena constituted 
fertile ground for ethnic conflict, racial discrimination, hatred, violence and terrorism. Ever 
since their inception, the World Bank and IMF, which had been originally created to 
promote economic development and prosperity for all, had continually imposed an ultra-
liberal development model on countries and peoples, the perverse effects of which were 
tearing the world apart. Using and abusing its binding recommendations, IMF had 
advocated market-economy-based global trade, devaluation, price deregulation, salary </p>

</p>
<p>freezes, reduction of health and education budgets, and the unbridled privatization of public 
companies and services. 
</p>
<p>52. He invited the Independent Expert to express his views on ways to address poverty 
and the foreign debt burden that weighed heavily on the developing world. Did the 
Independent Expert see a need for fundamental changes in the way the World Bank and 
IMF operated? 
</p>
<p>53. <b>Ms. Soderlund</b> (World Young Women&#8217;s Christian Association) said that more than 
2 million children were exploited in the multibillion dollar sex industry every year; 1.2 
million children were trafficked annually; girls as young as 13, mainly from Asia and 
Eastern Europe, were trafficked as mail order brides; and child pornography was a growing 
problem on the Internet. The consequences of that abuse were devastating, as children 
subjected to violence and sexual exploitation suffered lasting physical, psychological and 
mental damage. Cross-generational sex constituted a crime by adults against children; 
action must be taken to end such violence and bring the perpetrators to justice. The 
punishment should be as severe as the crime was serious, and there should be no limitation 
period for bringing child-abusers to justice. An abused child must be entitled to justice even 
if the defendant was charged many years later. International police cooperation must be 
enhanced to prevent child pornography and trafficking. Governments must identify victims 
and perpetrators and share such information systematically. National justice systems must 
apply the United Nations definition of a child; horrific crimes of sexual abuse should not be 
condoned or ignored simply because the child appeared older than his or her actual age. 
</p>
<p>54. <b>Mr. Mudho </b>(Independent Expert on the effects of economic reform policies and 
foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights), thanked the Government of 
Mozambique for its assistance and cooperation during his mission. 
</p>
<p>55. He thanked the delegation of Mexico for supporting his request for extension of the 
time frame for the formulation of the proposed draft guidelines and expressed his gratitude 
to the Governments of Cuba, Mexico, the Russian Federation and South Africa for 
responding to his request for views and comments in that regard. Given the scantiness of 
input from Governments to date, he had desisted from completing the guidelines so as to 
ensure that the final text would reflect the position of all Council members. 
</p>
<p>56. Referring to the comments made by the representative of Iraq, he said although his 
report focused on heavily indebted countries, he was well aware of the devastating effect 
the war in Iraq had had on the country&#8217;s economy. In his previous report, he had 
recommended that debt relief operations should not be restricted to heavily indebted 
countries.  
</p>
<p>57. He agreed with the representative of the Sudan that governance should be an 
important factor when considering a country&#8217;s debt situation. 
</p>
<p>58. He supported the suggestion by the representative of Cuba that the work of United 
Nations bodies, international conferences and human rights organizations should inform the 
preparation of the draft guidelines, and that the concept of shared responsibility should be 
incorporated. 
</p>
<p>59. In his future work, he would consider the idea of applying debt-for-equity schemes 
in debt relief operations, as mentioned by the representative of the Philippines. The notion 
of granting aid for debt relief, which had surfaced recently, was also worth exploring. 
</p>
<p>60. In reply to the enquiry by the representative of Bangladesh about visible effects of 
debt relief in Mozambique, he said that while he had noted positive and encouraging 
developments, debt relief alone was insufficient.
