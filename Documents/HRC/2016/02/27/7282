<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the right to education undertook an official visit to 
</p>
<p>Bhutan from 26 May to 3 June 2014. The present report sets out his findings and 
</p>
<p>recommendations on the situation of the right to education in Bhutan. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur welcomes the progress made by Bhutan in the field of education in recent years, 
</p>
<p>including the increasing access of boys and girls to primary and secondary education, and 
</p>
<p>measures taken to improve the quality of education. 
</p>
<p>As a result of those efforts, basic education, comprising one year of pre-primary 
</p>
<p>education to six years of primary school and four years of secondary school, is free and 
</p>
<p>compulsory. Forty per cent of meritorious students are offered government scholarships for 
</p>
<p>two additional years of secondary schooling. Students completing basic education can take 
</p>
<p>advantage of tertiary education and technical and vocational education and training.  
</p>
<p>University-level education is available, based on merit, for graduates of grade 12. 
</p>
<p>Bhutan has achieved near universal primary education enrolment. While equality 
</p>
<p>between boys and girls is ensured throughout primary education levels, girls are 
</p>
<p>underrepresented in the final two years of secondary school and at all tertiary levels.

<p>Despite the significant recent progress made with modest means, some areas of 
</p>
<p>concern remain. The right to education forms part of the constitution, but an education act 
</p>
<p>has not yet been developed. Children without citizenship or residency rights may not 
</p>
<p>always be enrolled in schools. Technical and vocational education and training is not 
</p>
<p>adequately responsive to the needs of the nation and reforms to remedy that situation 
</p>
<p>remain insufficient.  
</p>
<p>The report also takes special note of the efforts by the Government of Bhutan to 
</p>
<p>develop an education system which considers factors beyond literacy and numeracy. 
</p>
<p>Educating for &#8220;gross national happiness&#8221; is an outstanding feature of the Bhutanese 
</p>
<p>conception of human development. That is commendable as a national goal. However, it 
</p>
<p>requires additional work and support to ensure that it is adequately mainstreamed into the 
</p>
<p>education system and made relevant to Bhutanese students and society at large. 
</p>
<p>Bhutan has sought to replace the concept of gross national product with gross 
</p>
<p>national happiness and by bringing those values into the education system, Bhutan may be 
</p>
<p>demonstrating a way to promote sustainable development without causing undue harm to 
</p>
<p>the environment, or social and cultural traditions, and by reducing inequalities between 
</p>
<p>rural and urban students.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Kishore Singh, carried out an 
</p>
<p>official visit to Bhutan from 26 May to 3 June 2014 at the invitation of the Government. He 
</p>
<p>wishes to extend his gratitude to Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay for taking the time to 
</p>
<p>meet with him and engage in a genuine dialogue on the right to education as a national 
</p>
<p>development priority. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with a number of high authorities, 
</p>
<p>including the Minister of Education,  Mingbo Dukpa; the Minister of Home and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Affairs, Damcho Dorji; Minister of Labour and Human Resources, Ngeema Sangay 
</p>
<p>Tshempo; and Minister of Finance, Namgay Dorji.  
</p>
<p>3. He also met with senior government officials, including the Director-General of the 
</p>
<p>Policy Planning Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Secretary of Education; the 
</p>
<p>Director of the Gross National Happiness Commission; members of the Royal Education 
</p>
<p>Council and of the National Commission for Women and Children; the Vice-Chancellor of 
</p>
<p>the Royal University of Bhutan and a number of parliamentarians. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit a number of educational 
</p>
<p>institutions, including pre-primary, primary and secondary schools, as well as technical 
</p>
<p>post-secondary education institutions and the Royal University of Bhutan. He also met with 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society and United Nations agencies, in particular the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government of Bhutan for its 
</p>
<p>invitation and the full cooperation extended throughout his visit. He also extends his thanks 
</p>
<p>to the Resident Coordinator of UNDP in Bhutan and her staff and all those who took time to 
</p>
<p>meet with him and share their experiences in the field of education.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Education as a high priority for national development 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to see that education is a high priority for 
</p>
<p>national development. The eleventh five-year plan (2013&#8211;2018)1 demonstrates Bhutan&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to education. The plan sets out the  pledge by the Government of ensuring 
</p>
<p>&#8220;prosperity for all&#8221; through the effective empowerment of its people (<i>wangtse chhirpel</i>)<i>.</i> It 
</p>
<p>provides a path for Bhutan to achieve self-reliance and an indispensable role for education. 
</p>
<p>The policy framework entitled &#8220;Bhutan 2020: a vision for peace, prosperity and happiness&#8221; 
</p>
<p>and the education sector strategy, &#8220;Realizing vision 2020&#8221;,2 articulate the goals and 
</p>
<p>processes for achieving Bhutan&#8217;s unique development objectives of gross national 
</p>
<p>happiness.  
</p>
<p><b> III. International human rights obligations of Bhutan  
</b></p>
<p>7. At the international level, Bhutan is party to several international human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols on 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution 
</p>
<p>and child pornography, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women. Bhutan has signed but not ratified the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Collectively, those instruments contain many 
</p>
<p>provisions related to the right to education and place an obligation on the State to take all 
</p>
<p>necessary steps to protect, promote and fulfil the right to education for all persons in its 
</p>
<p>territory, without discrimination.  
</p>
<p>8. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that Bhutan has not ratified the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, or the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention against 
</p>
<p>Discrimination in Education. Those treaties are important, as they provide comprehensively 
</p>
<p>for the right to education.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Constitutional and policy framework for education 
</b></p>
<p>9. The constitution of Bhutan was adopted on 18 July 2008 in connection with its 
</p>
<p>transition to a democratic, constitutional monarchy and contains several provisions on the 
</p>
<p>right to education in its various dimensions.3  
</p>
<p>10. Article 9.15 of the constitution states that: &#8220;The State shall endeavour to provide 
</p>
<p>education for the purpose of improving and increasing knowledge, values and skills of the 
</p>
<p>entire population with education being directed towards the full development of the human 
</p>
<p>personality.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>11. Article 9.16 stipulates that &#8220;The State shall provide free education to all children of 
</p>
<p>school-going age up to tenth standard and ensure that technical and professional education 
</p>
<p>is made generally available and that higher education is equally accessible to all on the basis 
</p>
<p>of merit.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>12. Those constitutional provisions are further supported by a number of important 
</p>
<p>policies. The national education policy of 2011 ensures that all Bhutanese children, 
</p>
<p>including those with special needs, have access to a quality basic education (up to grade 10 
</p>
<p>or equivalent) that is free (in terms of tuition fees and textbooks) and equitable. The policy 
</p>
<p>also sets standards for access, quality, curricula, assessment, the management of school 
</p>
<p>performance and teaching.4  
</p>
<p>13. The tertiary education policy of 2010 provides a framework for universities, colleges 
</p>
<p>and autonomous institutions.5  
</p>
<p>14. The technical and vocational education and training policy of 2013 provides the 
</p>
<p>framework for vocational education and training. The policy requires the development of a 
</p>
<p>vocational qualifications framework, which will allow for the recognition of skills already

</p>
<p>learned, as well as providing a mechanism whereby students can continue into post-
</p>
<p>secondary education programmes.6  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur is appreciative of the fact that the constitution and the 
</p>
<p>education policies provide a solid framework which ensures 10 years of free and 
</p>
<p>compulsory primary and secondary education, as well as merit-based opportunities for 
</p>
<p>further education, regardless of race, gender or social class.  
</p>
<p>16. The national language is Dzongkha, which is the medium of instruction during the 
</p>
<p>first two years of primary education. Education beyond that period is provided in English. 
</p>
<p>However, Dzongkha continues to be taught as a separate course, as nearly 75 per cent of 
</p>
<p>Bhutanese speak one of 24 other languages and dialects.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that much work remains to be done to 
</p>
<p>develop a framework based on laws, rather than practices, policies or interpretations, so that 
</p>
<p>in keeping with the provisions of the constitution, the right to education is placed within a 
</p>
<p>national legal framework. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Education system  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Profile of the education system 
</b></p>
<p>18. Basic public education in Bhutan is available without restriction. It is open to all 
</p>
<p>children, regardless of their race, gender, social or economic status, or background, who are 
</p>
<p>legally residing in the country. It is also integrated and inclusive, taking students of all 
</p>
<p>religions and backgrounds, and accommodates children with disabilities in eight schools, 
</p>
<p>with plans to staff and equip seven more. Further, it is co-educational, with boys and girls 
</p>
<p>studying together in schools. However, only children who are Bhutanese citizens, or who 
</p>
<p>have applied for refugee or immigrant status, are enrolled. Others, including stateless 
</p>
<p>children, remain outside the education system. 
</p>
<p>19. Education in Bhutan begins with one year of free pre-primary education at the age of 
</p>
<p>six, followed by grades 1 to 6, as the primary education cycle. That is followed by a six-
</p>
<p>year secondary education cycle of grades 7 to 12, which includes four free and compulsory 
</p>
<p>years and two final years available for free to the top 40 per cent of grade 10 students. The 
</p>
<p>10 years of free and compulsory primary and secondary education are referred to as &#8220;basic 
</p>
<p>education&#8221;. Twelve years of primary and secondary education can also be provided in 
</p>
<p>private schools. Those who complete grade 12 are then eligible to apply for tertiary 
</p>
<p>education, based on academic merit, in public and private colleges. All students who have 
</p>
<p>completed grade 10 may apply for technical and vocational education and training 
</p>
<p>programmes.  
</p>
<p>20. At the end of the primary cycle, students are required to sit for a national-level 
</p>
<p>examination, which is set by the Bhutan Council for School Examinations and Assessment 
</p>
<p>but administered and assessed by the schools. At present, about 85 per cent of the students 
</p>
<p>who reach the end of the primary cycle continue to the next level of education, while others 
</p>
<p>drop out or repeat classes.  
</p>
<p>21. Secondary cycle students take national examinations at the end of grades 10 and 12. 
</p>
<p>As of 2013, nearly three quarters of students who completed grade 10 have continued for

<p>the final two years, while about one third of those who completed grade 12 have continued 
</p>
<p>on to a general academic degree programme. The remaining students either repeat their 
</p>
<p>exams to improve their scores, enrol in one of the technical and vocational education and 
</p>
<p>training institutes, or leave education to find employment.  
</p>
<p>22. Tertiary education is currently provided through the Royal University of Bhutan, 
</p>
<p>which administers a number of colleges.7 In addition, Bhutan sends about 200 students 
</p>
<p>annually on scholarships to universities in other countries, mostly to study medicine, 
</p>
<p>engineering and agricultural sciences.  
</p>
<p>23. It is reported that private tertiary education is emerging in Bhutan, with three private 
</p>
<p>colleges being proposed to the Government for approval, which are aimed at students who 
</p>
<p>are currently studying internationally. Two of them seek to teach management, while the 
</p>
<p>third will be a nursing and technical college. The Special Rapporteur cautions that the 
</p>
<p>emergence of private tertiary education may draw talent and financial resources away from 
</p>
<p>the public system. The Government should identify strategies to strengthen the public 
</p>
<p>system to attract students currently studying abroad, rather than promoting privatized 
</p>
<p>tertiary level institutions.  
</p>
<p>24. Bhutan has a decentralized, private monastic education system, offering education 
</p>
<p>through 388 monastic schools and 3 nunneries, where a total of over 7,000 students are 
</p>
<p>currently enrolled.8 The monastic education system was formalized in the seventeenth 
</p>
<p>century at the time of the foundation of the Kingdom of Bhutan and was the primary form 
</p>
<p>of education until the introduction of the modern education system in the early twentieth 
</p>
<p>century. Monastic education is aimed at teaching spiritual values through the study of 
</p>
<p>ancient texts. The curriculum consists largely of religious rituals, grammar, poetry, 
</p>
<p>numeracy, graphic arts and painting, chanting rhymes, philosophy, logic and meditation. 
</p>
<p>From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, monks held most government and 
</p>
<p>administrative positions. However with the introduction of modern education, that is no 
</p>
<p>longer the case. Today, monks are primarily involved in religious and ceremonial functions. 
</p>
<p>Graduates of the monastic education system are entitled to apply to tertiary education 
</p>
<p>programmes and may sit the civil service examinations, along with graduates of grade 12 in 
</p>
<p>the formal public and private systems. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Access to education 
</b></p>
<p>25. Enrolment rates in education in Bhutan have risen dramatically in the last decade. 
</p>
<p>According to a report of the Ministry of Education, in 2013 enrolment for grades 1 to 10 
</p>
<p>was 94 per cent. Children not currently enrolled live primarily in very remote areas which 
</p>
<p>lack schools, or with nomadic families.  
</p>
<p>26. The overall literacy rate, comprising children and adults, is 63 per cent (72 per cent 
</p>
<p>for males and 55 per cent for females), although there is an urban/rural divide at 79 and 56 
</p>
<p>per cent respectively.9 With equal access to educational opportunities, that divide is 
</p>
<p>expected to narrow. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 They include Sherubtse College, Gaedugg College of Business Studies, two National Institutes of 
</p>
<p>Education at Paro and Samtse, the College of Science and Technology, the College of Natural 
</p>
<p>Resources, the Institute of Language and Culture Studies, the Royal Institute of Health Science, the 
</p>
<p>National Institute of Traditional Medicine and Jigme Namgyel Polytechnic, which together offer 
</p>
<p>higher education to 8,000 students annually.

<p>27. The Special Rapporteur suggests that, in order to make education accessible to 
</p>
<p>everyone free of cost as a right, free tuition, textbooks and sports items be provided by the 
</p>
<p>Government. Where required, such as in remote and poor areas, meals and boarding 
</p>
<p>facilities are partly subsidized or provided by the Government, which also provides free 
</p>
<p>stationery to rural schools. Parents and communities are requested to provide small 
</p>
<p>contributions or fees for school activities. In addition, a nominal admission fee is charged 
</p>
<p>for every child enrolling in a pre-primary school, which can be waived by local school 
</p>
<p>administrations in cases of need.  
</p>
<p>28. The constitution provides that education shall be free to all until the tenth grade and 
</p>
<p>government scholarships are provided to the top 40 per cent of students for government 
</p>
<p>secondary schools. Private secondary schools are emerging to take in students who have not 
</p>
<p>received merit-based government scholarships, but only those who are able to pay the fees 
</p>
<p>they charge can take advantage of that.  
</p>
<p>29. Despite public education being available to almost all children, the Government is 
</p>
<p>supporting the development of private schools. There are currently 32 private schools, of 
</p>
<p>which 12 cater for pre-primary and primary education and 20 provide secondary education. 
</p>
<p>Six of the secondary schools are located in Thimphu and Phuentsholing, the biggest urban 
</p>
<p>centres in the country. Most teachers in private schools lack academic teaching 
</p>
<p>qualifications, although the Government is facilitating in-service training workshops to 
</p>
<p>improve standards.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that there is no policy or legislation in 
</p>
<p>place to regulate private providers in education; to ensure, for example, that private schools 
</p>
<p>follow the same curriculum as public schools, even if this has been the practice so far.  
</p>
<p>31. Access to education is based on legal residence in Bhutan. One or both parent(s) 
</p>
<p>must be Bhutanese, or in the case of a non-Bhutanese child, proof must be provided that the 
</p>
<p>parents were authorized to bring their child into Bhutan.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. National achievements  
</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize some important progress he 
</p>
<p>observed in Bhutan in implementing the right to education throughout the country, which he 
</p>
<p>believes may be of particular interest to other least developed countries seeking to rapidly 
</p>
<p>improve their educational systems. 
</p>
<p>33. Bhutan has almost achieved the Millennium Development Goals related to education 
</p>
<p>by achieving near universal primary education enrolment with gender parity. It has also 
</p>
<p>taken special measures to combat adult illiteracy. With the support of UNESCO, the non-
</p>
<p>formal education programme was introduced in 1991 with the objective of eradicating 
</p>
<p>illiteracy. The national literacy rate has also improved from 59 per cent in 2005 to 63 per 
</p>
<p>cent in 2013. 
</p>
<p>34. Currently, there are around 9,600 learners taught in 774 non-formal education 
</p>
<p>centres in the country. The programme has had a positive impact, especially on women in 
</p>
<p>rural areas, who constitute more than two thirds of the beneficiaries, by teaching them to 
</p>
<p>read and write. Equally, the continuing education programme offers adults, who have had to 
</p>
<p>leave school before completing their secondary education, the opportunity to upgrade their 
</p>
<p>qualifications. In September 2009, during the award of the UNESCO Confucius Prize, the 
</p>
<p>two programmes received an honourable mention for their emphasis on literacy and their 
</p>
<p>focus on adults and out-of-school youth, particularly women and girls.  
</p>
<p>35. Bhutan has also placed emphasis on supporting the needs of children with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. The Drukgyel Deaf Education School and the Khaling School for the Blind </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 
</b></p>
<p>provide specialized support, while the Ministry of Education oversees special education 
</p>
<p>needs schools and programmes that provide inclusive education. 
</p>
<p>36. Bhutan&#8217;s performance in education was widely recognized at the nineteenth session 
</p>
<p>of the universal periodic review in 2014.  
</p>
<p>37. Bhutan adopted an extensive national human resource development policy in 2010. 
</p>
<p>The Government has set professional, technical and vocational education as the highest 
</p>
<p>priority within the education sector. There are currently 2,400 students, almost equally split 
</p>
<p>between public and private institutions. The Ministry provides instructor training 
</p>
<p>programmes for the staff of training institutes. Besides apprenticeships with partner 
</p>
<p>companies, a village skills development programme, which teaches villagers basic 
</p>
<p>agricultural skills, has been implemented in more than 1,200 villages.10  
</p>
<p><b>  Educating for gross national happiness 
</b></p>
<p>38. The concept of gross national happiness is a uniquely Bhutanese contribution. As a 
</p>
<p>paradigm shift from looking at development from a merely economic angle, it ushered in an 
</p>
<p>alternative model to market-centred approaches to development. Coined in 1972 by the 
</p>
<p>fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who sought to modernize his country, the concept 
</p>
<p>of gross national happiness has its foundation in the philosophic and cultural traditions of 
</p>
<p>Bhutan and of Buddhism and aims to promote a holistic development concept that seeks to 
</p>
<p>nurture both physical and mental well-being.11 It recognizes that economic development 
</p>
<p>serves primarily to improve physical well-being, without addressing the emotional, social 
</p>
<p>and mental needs of people. Gross national happiness promotes the values of individual and 
</p>
<p>social well-being that stress the pursuit of happiness. It is best understood as seeking to 
</p>
<p>improve the overall well-being of citizens, rather than focussing only on economic 
</p>
<p>development. 
</p>
<p>39. In order to address those broad objectives, Bhutan has created a policy which defines 
</p>
<p>gross national happiness according to four pillars: (a) sustainable and equitable 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic development, (b) the preservation and promotion of culture, (c) conservation 
</p>
<p>and the sustainable utilization and management of the environment and (d) the 
</p>
<p>strengthening of good governance. Using those pillars, it seeks to broaden the definition of 
</p>
<p>development beyond a purely economic angle and to encourage citizens to consider 
</p>
<p>development in a holistic manner.  
</p>
<p>40. The purpose of the pillars is to guide the Government in its policymaking by 
</p>
<p>encouraging decisions which are propelled by sustainable development, aligned to fostering 
</p>
<p>national human and spiritual well-being. For example, despite having significant natural 
</p>
<p>resources, Bhutan has declined to permit extensive mining and forestry operations, as the 
</p>
<p>environmental impact of such projects must be weighed against the economic benefits they 
</p>
<p>may bring.  
</p>
<p>41. The Government of Bhutan has developed an elaborate framework of gross national 
</p>
<p>happiness. The four pillars are elaborated into nine domains: psychological well-being,

<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>health, time use, education, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community 
</p>
<p>vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, and living standards.12 In accordance with those 
</p>
<p>nine domains, Bhutan has developed 38 sub-indexes, 72 indicators and 151 variables that 
</p>
<p>are used to define, analyse and evaluate gross national happiness. 
</p>
<p>42. At a time when market-centred approaches to development are being questioned, that 
</p>
<p>paradigm shift in looking at development with a focus on social well-being and the pursuit 
</p>
<p>of happiness should be applauded.13 It is especially significant in furnishing an alternative 
</p>
<p>model in order to align growth to socioeconomic, as well as cultural and spiritual, well-
</p>
<p>being. 
</p>
<p>43. The happiness-based approach to development has important implications for the 
</p>
<p>education system of Bhutan. It must be seen in the light of article 9.15 of the constitution, 
</p>
<p>which requires the country to &#8220;endeavour to provide education for the purpose of improving 
</p>
<p>and increasing knowledge, values and skills of the entire population with education being 
</p>
<p>directed towards the full development of the human personality.&#8221; Those provisions echo 
</p>
<p>article 26 (2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which also calls for education 
</p>
<p>to &#8220;be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>44. The concept of gross national happiness has evoked considerable interest from the 
</p>
<p>international community and its importance as a holistic approach to development has been 
</p>
<p>recognized by the United Nations. In General Assembly resolution 65/309 Member States 
</p>
<p>were invited to &#8220;pursue the elaboration of additional measures that better capture the 
</p>
<p>importance of the pursuit of happiness and well-being in development with a view to 
</p>
<p>guiding their public policies.&#8221; The concept also has significant implications for preserving 
</p>
<p>education as a public good and for its humanist mission, in contrast to the instrumental 
</p>
<p>approach to education, which confines it to the promotion of reading, writing and 
</p>
<p>arithmetic. The Special Rapporteur applauds the efforts of Bhutan to develop a holistic 
</p>
<p>approach through its policy work on educating for gross national happiness. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur, therefore, takes a particular interest in considering how 
</p>
<p>Bhutan has attempted to develop an education system in accordance with the precepts of 
</p>
<p>gross national happiness. Its implementation has required that the concept be embedded into 
</p>
<p>the education system. Initial steps have included the development of a meditation and mind-
</p>
<p>training module for each grade, adding elements of gross national happiness into the school 
</p>
<p>curriculum by, for example, increasing awareness of the environment in daily lessons and 
</p>
<p>teaching classes on critical thinking and media literacy. Innovative school administrators 
</p>
<p>have developed student-led school gardens to bring children from urban backgrounds into 
</p>
<p>contact with nature.  
</p>
<p>46. The inclusion of the concept of gross national happiness is also intended to provide 
</p>
<p>context and background to subjects being taught in educational establishments, with the 
</p>
<p>hope that education will thereby become more relevant and engaging to students and 
</p>
<p>teachers. Such an objective has underpinned education policy. Former Prime Minister Jigme 
</p>
<p>Thinley told participants of a workshop on educating for gross national happiness that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Infusing GNH understanding creates a purpose and goal for teaching and learning to both 
</p>
<p>teachers and students that makes study less burdensome and more enjoyable.&#8221;14

<p>47. The rise of material well-being does not exclude a concomitant rise in environmental 
</p>
<p>and cultural awareness; a capacity for giving primacy to social well-being; and a values-
</p>
<p>based engagement with society and politics. The Special Rapporteur notes that this ambition 
</p>
<p>matches the aspirations found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and numerous 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties. Gross national happiness is akin to a human rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach, which imparts strength and legitimacy to development planning. Human rights 
</p>
<p>standards provide a normative framework that grounds development within a universal set 
</p>
<p>of values, so that development is pursued in an equitable, just and sustainable manner.  
</p>
<p>48. Despite significant efforts by the Ministry of Education and others to promote the 
</p>
<p>concept of gross national happiness, it was also reported during the visit that it needed to be 
</p>
<p>better understood in order to evoke greater interest in the average Bhutanese citizen in 
</p>
<p>fostering the concept as an overriding national cause. The aspiration of &#8220;educating for gross 
</p>
<p>national happiness&#8221; is that it will inculcate values in all Bhutanese citizens which place 
</p>
<p>economic interests within a greater social, environmental and cultural context. It remains a 
</p>
<p>challenge for the Government to find ways to better implement those goals through the 
</p>
<p>education system. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Key challenges 
</b></p>
<p>49. Although Bhutan has placed education at the heart of its national development plans 
</p>
<p>and has<b> </b>a number of achievements in the field of education to its credit, like many countries 
</p>
<p>it is faced with challenges in making the right to education a full reality. A number of 
</p>
<p>concerns were brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur during his visit.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Universalizing access to education as a right 
</b></p>
<p>50. The right to education is enshrined in article 9.16 of the Bhutanese constitution, 
</p>
<p>which provides for 10 years of education for all. Despite that, the most recent education 
</p>
<p>policy continues to tie registration to citizenship or legal immigration status.15 That 
</p>
<p>distinction should be eliminated as soon as possible, and the changes widely advertised, to 
</p>
<p>address children and adults without residency documents, including stateless children, who 
</p>
<p>are present in Bhutan. While Bhutan deserves credit for its recent efforts to provide 
</p>
<p>education to all registered children, especially those in rural areas, it must take measures to 
</p>
<p>address the remaining barriers. 
</p>
<p>51. Bhutan faces the challenge of a small, sparsely populated country that is subject to 
</p>
<p>immense immigration pressure from neighbouring States, including illegal immigration. 
</p>
<p>That concern, however, cannot be addressed by denying the children of parents who lack 
</p>
<p>documentation proving their right to reside in Bhutan their right to an education. All 
</p>
<p>children who are in Bhutan for any period of time must have the right to access education. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that local administrative practices may be 
</p>
<p>preventing children of aliens within Bhutan from receiving an education. The right to 
</p>
<p>education accrues to all children, regardless of their legal status, as described in the 
</p>
<p>constitution. That is particularly relevant, owing to the unresolved status of many people of 
</p>
<p>Nepalese or Indian ancestry who have lived in Bhutan for decades or generations without 
</p>
<p>residency or citizenship rights. The Ministry of Education should continue to ensure local 
</p>
<p><i>dzongkhags</i> (administrative areas) and school administrators process all children without 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 See Policy and Planning Division, Ministry of Education, &#8220;30th education policy guidelines and 
</p>
<p>instructions&#8221;, annex 5.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>regard to their residency rights and that revised policies which clearly outline that are 
</p>
<p>promulgated. 
</p>
<p>53. The Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern about alleged 
</p>
<p>discrimination in education against children of Nepalese ethnic origin, including an 
</p>
<p>inadequate number of educational institutions being built in areas populated by them. They 
</p>
<p>do not receive education in their own language and the Committee also expressed concern 
</p>
<p>about the lack of data on children of Nepalese ethnic origin attending school. The 
</p>
<p>Government has responded by building more schools, reaching almost full enrolment, but 
</p>
<p>instruction remains only in Dzongkha and English. Education statistics should be 
</p>
<p>disaggregated to ensure that minority groups can be identified to eliminate any unintended 
</p>
<p>negative outcomes. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the efforts made by Bhutan to universalize 
</p>
<p>access to education and the remarkable improvements achieved in a short space of time. 
</p>
<p>Although only 1.3 per cent of primary school-aged students are not in schools, those who 
</p>
<p>remain excluded are primarily children living in remote areas or with nomadic families, 
</p>
<p>some of the urban poor and children with learning disabilities, who lack access to adequate 
</p>
<p>facilities. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to take the required measures 
</p>
<p>to reach all students, including at the secondary level.  
</p>
<p>55. A strategy currently being discussed to rationalize schools in remote areas is the 
</p>
<p>construction of regional boarding schools. That would address the relatively high cost of 
</p>
<p>rural schools and the difficulty in deploying qualified teachers. It will be important, 
</p>
<p>however, to ensure that the cultural and emotional needs of children as young as six being 
</p>
<p>taken away from their homes are adequately met and regularly overseen to ensure their 
</p>
<p>welfare is fully respected. Further, the situation of children from disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>backgrounds should not be impaired. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Improving the quality of the education system 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Bhutan Royal Education Council has reported that the current education system 
</p>
<p>does not prepare students adequately for employment or post-secondary education.16 
</p>
<p>Weaknesses were found in student performance; teacher qualifications, skills and ongoing 
</p>
<p>training; classroom assessments; and teacher preparation, curriculum standards, resources 
</p>
<p>and incentives for quality.17 In its report, the Council was particularly concerned with the 
</p>
<p>lack of qualified and motivated teachers, inadequate curricular resources and poor 
</p>
<p>instructional leadership and in-service training. The Special Rapporteur notes that despite 
</p>
<p>continuing improvements, Bhutan faces challenges in post-secondary programmes and the 
</p>
<p>inadequacy of tertiary-level educational facilities. Less than  1 per cent of the total 
</p>
<p>enrolment is in higher education.18 In addition, grade 12 graduates struggle to succeed in 
</p>
<p>foreign universities.  
</p>
<p><b>  C. Strengthening the teaching profession 
</b></p>
<p>57. Having built sufficient schools to reach more than 96 per cent of all children, Bhutan 
</p>
<p>now struggles to find a sufficient number of qualified teachers to staff them. Furthermore,

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>teachers, particularly in rural areas, are not well qualified or trained. Primary school 
</p>
<p>teachers rarely have post-secondary or teaching degrees and not all current teachers have 
</p>
<p>the inclination or aptitude to obtain higher certification. The Government is making a 
</p>
<p>considerable investment in the teacher training college in Paro and provides continuing 
</p>
<p>training opportunities, but the shortage of qualified teachers is likely to persist, as teaching 
</p>
<p>is not perceived as a desirable career by most high-school graduates. The reliance on hiring 
</p>
<p>foreign-qualified teachers, often from India or other nearby countries, must be seen as at 
</p>
<p>best a temporary solution.  
</p>
<p>58. It was repeatedly indicated to the Special Rapporteur that teaching is the least 
</p>
<p>preferred profession for high-school or university graduates. Reasons included a perceived 
</p>
<p>lack of incentives, including low to average pay, a poor career path and a lack of social 
</p>
<p>esteem for the profession.  
</p>
<p>59. The significant growth in the past 10 years of schools in remote and small 
</p>
<p>communities has created considerable recruitment challenges, as few university-educated 
</p>
<p>teachers are inclined to live in such conditions. At present, some schools in remote regions 
</p>
<p>have fewer than 20 students in all grades, with only two teachers to staff them. Housing and 
</p>
<p>poor quality of life discourage teachers from applying for remote job postings, as does the 
</p>
<p>lack of transportation infrastructure, which can mean hours of arduous travel to the nearest 
</p>
<p>large community. The financial incentives are insufficient to attract enough teachers to 
</p>
<p>volunteer to accept remote placements. However, the planned construction of boarding 
</p>
<p>schools for children from rural areas would entail prolonged separation from parents and its 
</p>
<p>repercussions on the best interests of the child need to be borne in mind.  
</p>
<p>60. Current efforts at mainstreaming gross national happiness into teaching methods are 
</p>
<p>a valuable contribution in this regard; incorporating the four pillars of gross national 
</p>
<p>happiness into all curricula deserves further efforts. At the same time, it is important for the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Education to better explain the concept of gross national happiness and its key 
</p>
<p>importance to both teachers and students through the media and public information training.  
</p>
<p>61. Achieving higher academic scores for students and improving employment outcomes 
</p>
<p>for secondary school graduates are the overwhelming concerns of educators and parents, 
</p>
<p>and the value and applicability of gross national happiness in teaching are inadequately 
</p>
<p>understood. While such concerns are legitimate, efforts to promote educating for gross 
</p>
<p>national happiness must be intensified. 
</p>
<p>62. It is opportune for Bhutan to explore the possibility of taking measures within the 
</p>
<p>framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) for 
</p>
<p>promoting education through collaborative endeavours, based on the experience of the 
</p>
<p>SAARC development goals. That is an area which has enormous potential for Bhutan to 
</p>
<p>take the initiative in exchanging experiences and learning from available examples, with a 
</p>
<p>view to strengthening the right to education in the countries of the region. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Education of girls 
</b></p>
<p>63. Access to education for girls remains a challenge in rural settings, where girls are 
</p>
<p>often kept at home to assist in domestic chores and where social expectations that women 
</p>
<p>should be concerned with starting a family are strong. Affirmative action programmes are 
</p>
<p>necessary, pursuant to the recommendation made by the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women in 2009 that Bhutan take temporary special measures to 
</p>
<p>accelerate de facto equality between women and men, particularly through special education 
</p>
<p>measures for promoting gender equality (see CEDAW/C/BTN/CO/7, paras. 15 and 16). The 
</p>
<p>gender gap in secondary and higher education, where girls are increasingly falling behind, is 
</p>
<p>a particular concern. According to 2013 national enrolment statistics, the number of girls </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>attending school exceeds that of boys in primary education, but that is not the case at the 
</p>
<p>secondary level, owing to higher levels of females dropping out. Those statistics also show 
</p>
<p>that the number of girls entering technical and vocational education and training is lower 
</p>
<p>than that of boys and fewer girls are progressing to tertiary education.  Many girls stop their 
</p>
<p>education after 10 years and seek to start a family.  
</p>
<p>64. In post-secondary programmes, including technical post-secondary institutions, 
</p>
<p>overall boys outnumber girls, with boys representing two thirds of university students. As 
</p>
<p>university education is merit-based, that disparity is a result of complex social factors, 
</p>
<p>including parental support and expectations. Non-traditional portrayals of women, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the media, were suggested by educators as an important means to foster the 
</p>
<p>interest of girls and women in post-secondary education. Low female interest in technical 
</p>
<p>and vocational education and training may be related to employment perspectives, as some 
</p>
<p>employers, such as construction or logistics companies, are unwilling to accommodate 
</p>
<p>female staff. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Eliminating child labour 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur was informed during his visit that in rural areas child labour, 
</p>
<p>particularly related to subsistence agriculture, continued to be a concern. In its concluding 
</p>
<p>observations, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
</p>
<p>expressed concerned at the persistence of child labour, in particular the situation of girl 
</p>
<p>child domestic workers, who do not have access to education. The Committee urged Bhutan 
</p>
<p>to strengthen its efforts to eradicate domestic child labour, and ensure that children, in 
</p>
<p>particular girls, have access to education. The Committee also recommended that Bhutan 
</p>
<p>engage in a public outreach campaign to inform the population about the need to ensure that 
</p>
<p>the rights of all children including access to education are respected (see 
</p>
<p>CEDAW/C/BTN/CO/7, paras. 31 and 32). The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to find 
</p>
<p>that the Ministry of Education was aware of those concerns and continued to address them. 
</p>
<p>However, he believes that more needs to be done to fully eradicate child labour. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Children with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur shares the concerns expressed by the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child in its most recent concluding observations on Bhutan 
</p>
<p>(CRC/C/BTN/CO/2). The Committee noted the measures Bhutan had undertaken to 
</p>
<p>enhance access to specialized services and education for children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>However, the Committee regretted that there were no accurate figures on the number of 
</p>
<p>children with disabilities in Bhutan and that the resources dedicated to guaranteeing the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the rights of children with disabilities were inadequate. The Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>appreciates that Bhutan has since conducted the two-stage child disability survey in 2010&#8211;
</p>
<p>2011 and continues to work with partners to strengthen access for children with special 
</p>
<p>needs. 
</p>
<p>67. The Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that Bhutan develop more 
</p>
<p>schools which cater to children with special needs, develop an inclusive education strategy 
</p>
<p>and elaborate a plan of action in order to increase the school attendance of children with 
</p>
<p>special needs, while focusing on day-care services for such children in order to prevent their 
</p>
<p>institutionalization.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur would like to refer to the national report of Bhutan to the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review in 2014, which notes that there will soon be 15 schools capable of 
</p>
<p>including children with special needs (see A/HRC/WG.6/19/BTN/1, para. 50). The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur encourages Bhutan to strengthen the provisions related to special needs in its 
</p>
<p>education policy framework.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Regulating private education 
</b></p>
<p>69. The emergence of a private education sector in Bhutan is a matter of concern to the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur. There will need to be a sound regulatory framework, in order to ensure 
</p>
<p>conformity with human rights law, as well as constitutional law and national education 
</p>
<p>policies. That is critically important in order to to prevent for-profit education providers 
</p>
<p>from undermining the right to education.  
</p>
<p>70. The guidelines for private schools in Bhutan provide for a memorandum of 
</p>
<p>understanding between the Department of School Education and the proprietor of a school, 
</p>
<p>pursuant to the government policy regarding the establishment of private schools, which 
</p>
<p>requires them to fix and declare the yearly lump-sum school fees for a student for one 
</p>
<p>academic year. Such guidelines should be strengthened and take the form of regulations, so 
</p>
<p>that private providers are not allowed to charge exorbitant fees and reap profits. 
</p>
<p>71. Regulations are also important in other respects, such as when private providers seek 
</p>
<p>to exploit parents by providing substandard education or deploying underqualified teachers, 
</p>
<p>which compromises minimum standards of education. Moreover, expensive, elite private 
</p>
<p>schools will draw the best-performing teachers from public schools. Catering to the children 
</p>
<p>of the emerging middle class, privatization also engenders disparities in access to education, 
</p>
<p>resulting in marginalization and social inequality. Regulations and their enforcement for 
</p>
<p>private sector institutions will therefore become increasingly important. It was reported to 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur that private schools actually follow the public school curriculum, but 
</p>
<p>that there was no particular policy or regulation in that regard. The Ministry of Education, 
</p>
<p>which is responsible for quality control, has very limited capacity to carry it out effectively. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to pass regulations which mandate private 
</p>
<p>schools to meet national standards, including those regarding access for persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, and to develop administrative procedures, such as a school oversight board or 
</p>
<p>committee, which allow parents easily to file complaints about violations by schools with 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Education. That will supplement any official oversight mechanisms, which 
</p>
<p>are often inadequately staffed. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Technical and vocational education and training and skills development  
</b></p>
<p>72. In 2010, Bhutan adopted an extensive national human resource development policy. 
</p>
<p>The Government has set professional, technical and vocational education as the highest 
</p>
<p>priority within the education sector. Areas of priority concern include public-private 
</p>
<p>partnerships and industry collaboration; on-the-job training; flexible career pathways; the 
</p>
<p>introduction of short-term courses in vocational institutes; the promotion of 
</p>
<p>entrepreneurship by training institutions; targeting the needs of women students; further 
</p>
<p>development of the Bhutan vocational qualifications framework; and recognition of prior 
</p>
<p>learning. The main strategy for implementation is to strengthen coordination between and 
</p>
<p>among stakeholders in human resources development. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur witnessed the success of students pursuing the traditional 
</p>
<p>arts and crafts being taught by the Institute of Zorig Chosum. Graduates have found a ready 
</p>
<p>market for their skills, and have become successful, self-employed artists, which is an 
</p>
<p>important means of supporting the national cultural heritage. He considers that those 
</p>
<p>programmes, fostered with the contribution of the Tarayana Foundation, should be carefully 
</p>
<p>expanded, as they provide an excellent way of promoting both cultural development and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>avenues for employment generation. Technicians, craftsmen, managers and operators are 
</p>
<p>critical to the success of industry. As Bhutan modernizes, the need for such skills will only 
</p>
<p>grow. 
</p>
<p>74. Private providers of vocational training in Bhutan are subject to registration and 
</p>
<p>accreditation. Accreditation of specific courses is voluntary and confers on the recipient 
</p>
<p>official recognition. However, challenges remain for understaffed departments and their, at 
</p>
<p>times, undertrained officials. 
</p>
<p>75. Vocational training is seen by primary and secondary school students, teachers and 
</p>
<p>administrators as a career path for low-performing students and school dropouts. Making 
</p>
<p>technical and vocational training and education better esteemed within Bhutan must begin 
</p>
<p>in the school system. At present, the final two years of secondary school are focused on 
</p>
<p>streaming students into university or white-collar careers, with only those who do not 
</p>
<p>succeed considering options for vocational training. The Special Rapporteur considers it 
</p>
<p>critically important to take steps towards transforming the perception of technical and 
</p>
<p>vocational education and training as a career path of last resort; technical and vocational 
</p>
<p>education and training should be made more attractive and better esteemed socially and 
</p>
<p>professionally. It should be geared to produce the skilled workers that Bhutan requires. 
</p>
<p>76. Collaboration with the private sector was reported to be weak in all areas apart from 
</p>
<p>tourism and many companies prefer to hire employees from abroad, justifying their choice 
</p>
<p>by the lack of skilled local workers. In part, that is because technical programmes are not 
</p>
<p>aligned with the needs of the private sector, while employers find it more expedient to hire 
</p>
<p>workers internationally, rather than engage with improving the education system.  
</p>
<p>77. During the visit, the Rapporteur noted the weak infrastructure of technical and 
</p>
<p>vocational education and training institutions and their lack of financial resources, which 
</p>
<p>are constraints on the system. In that context, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall the 
</p>
<p>UNESCO Revised Recommendation concerning technical and vocational education (2001), 
</p>
<p>which states that: &#8220;Government and the private sector should recognize that technical and 
</p>
<p>vocational education is an investment, not a cost, with significant returns&#8221;. A high level of 
</p>
<p>technical education is important for graduates to be attractive to potential employers.  
</p>
<p>78. Unlike other types of education, technical and vocational education and training 
</p>
<p>require institutionalized cooperation with industry, with a focus on skills development, 
</p>
<p>which responds to industry requirements. Education Ministry officials should actively seek 
</p>
<p>engagement with industry, in order to ensure that students have assured opportunities of 
</p>
<p>receiving vocational training in enterprises and are able to acquire technical competencies 
</p>
<p>attuned to the requirements of their future employers.  
</p>
<p>79. Recognizing the weaknesses of technical and vocational education and training, the 
</p>
<p>Government has recently undertaken significant reforms to the system. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur hopes that those reforms will lead to a transformation of technical and 
</p>
<p>vocational education and training under the aegis of the National Technical Training 
</p>
<p>Authority, which is responsible for regulation under the Ministry of Labour and Human 
</p>
<p>Resources.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Monastic education  
</b></p>
<p>80. Bhutan has an ancient tradition of accepting young men, and now young women, 
</p>
<p>into monasteries to pursue an alternative form of education. The monastic education system 
</p>
<p>is self-regulated and, while it is still held in high esteem, care must be taken to ensure that 
</p>
<p>the system modernizes in tandem with other reforms in Bhutan. The monastic system does 
</p>
<p>provide valuable cultural and historical teachings, which may complement the curricula in 
</p>
<p>the public education system. Experiments were conducted at Sang Chokhor Shedra and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p>other places in an effort to find convergence between traditional and modern pedagogy and 
</p>
<p>curricula, and this should be strengthened and continued, with the full understanding that 
</p>
<p>public education, in contrast to the monastic system, must be secular in nature. The 
</p>
<p>monastic education system should also allow for students to join the public system at any 
</p>
<p>time and vice versa, to ensure that those complementary traditions work together to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the social fabric of the nation and do not result in the creation of further 
</p>
<p>inequalities. It was reported that many students in the monastic system are from very poor 
</p>
<p>backgrounds, whose parents have brought them there, as they are unable to support their 
</p>
<p>children. It is difficult for such children to exit the system and attend the formal school 
</p>
<p>system.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Preserving and valorizing national languages 
</b></p>
<p>81. The decision to provide education in English is an important means for a small, 
</p>
<p>landlocked country to ensure its graduates are able to avail themselves of international 
</p>
<p>opportunities. The success of its students in international programmes and in the ongoing 
</p>
<p>development of the economy is perhaps a testimony to this.  
</p>
<p>82. However, the preservation of Dzongkha as a national language is an issue which 
</p>
<p>deserves consideration. The Special Rapporteur was concerned to receive reports during his 
</p>
<p>visit that some students were unable to write well in Dzongkha and that other Bhutanese 
</p>
<p>languages were not even offered as a second language in any curriculum. In some cases, 
</p>
<p>particularly with grade 10 school leavers, students were reportedly not fully proficient in 
</p>
<p>either Dzongkha or English. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur considers this a cause of great concern, as it would be a 
</p>
<p>national setback if English became the national language and Dzongkha and other 
</p>
<p>languages were gradually forgotten. That would also be contrary to the second pillar of 
</p>
<p>gross national happiness, which seeks to celebrate the diversity of Bhutanese cultures and 
</p>
<p>languages. It should be addressed seriously and quickly, particularly at the primary school 
</p>
<p>level where language skills are most easily learned. The Government should consider 
</p>
<p>whether a bilingual education, with English, mathematics and science taught in English and 
</p>
<p>all other subjects taught in Dzongkha, might prove an effective long-term strategy for 
</p>
<p>preserving Dzongkha. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Bhutan should be commended for its commitment to strengthening its 
</b></p>
<p><b>education system and for placing it at the heart of its national development plans. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Attaining the education-related Millennium Development Goals and achievements in 
</b></p>
<p><b>literacy for a least developed country such as Bhutan is praiseworthy. That 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment is already paying dividends, as it has contributed to the rapid 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of the country. Bhutan is also showing a path to development that seeks 
</b></p>
<p><b>to escape the social and environmental damage seen in many other countries. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>pledge by the </b>Government of ensuring &#8220;<b>prosperity for all</b>&#8221; through the effective<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>empowerment of its people (<i>wangtse chhirpel</i>) must be applauded.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The rich traditions of Bhutan have led to the development of the concept of 
</b></p>
<p><b>gross national happiness. Educating for gross national happiness is a commendable 
</b></p>
<p><b>national endeavour to instil into children the social and moral values that help to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address the challenges which may arise with rapid economic development. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>importance of a model of development founded upon concepts of happiness and well-
</b></p>
<p><b>being, which echoes the philosophic traditions of Bhutan, and which seeks to put the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>19</b> 
</p>
<p><b>human being at the centre of development, must be recognized in terms of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights values and a human rights-based approach to development. While it remains a 
</b></p>
<p><b>work in progress, the Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that this concept is an 
</b></p>
<p><b>invaluable contribution to the global understanding of the need for an alternative 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach to measuring growth and development merely in terms of gross national 
</b></p>
<p><b>product.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Educating for gross national happiness seeks to put the concept of gross 
</b></p>
<p><b>national happiness into practice. In addition to integrating it in the school curriculum, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bhutan seeks to incorporate its values into teaching methods, school facilities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>student behaviour patterns. The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages all nations to 
</b></p>
<p><b>look at the Bhutanese example of how that concept has been operationalized and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopt measures which expand education to include measures beyond those furthering 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic development alone. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Taking into consideration his findings during the visit, the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>wishes to make the following recommendations with a view to contributing to the full 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of the right to education in Bhutan. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Ratification of international treaties related to the right to education 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Bhutan should take steps to sign and ratify the International Covenant on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the UNESCO Convention on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Elimination of Discrimination in Education, which provide comprehensively for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to education. Bhutan can enhance its international standing and further 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognize its constitutional and policy achievements by adopting those instruments. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B. Strengthening the domestic legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The State should adopt comprehensive legislation in keeping with the provisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the right to education in the constitution and with its international obligations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Accordingly, the Government should develop a legal framework for the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education covering key areas, such as the right to quality education, the status of 
</b></p>
<p><b>teachers, domestic financing of education and the regulation of private providers of 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. That can be achieved either by a new comprehensive law, or by specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation in those areas of critical importance.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Such a legal framework should be applicable to both State-run and private 
</b></p>
<p><b>schools. Bhutan should take additional measures to strengthen its education system 
</b></p>
<p><b>and adopt a legal framework, which sets a minimum floor for spending on education. 
</b></p>
<p><b>That would ensure that education remains a high priority even as governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>change. 
</b></p>
<p><b>C. Universalizing access to education without discrimination or exclusion 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Bhutan must take further measures aimed at ensuring the enjoyment of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to education by every child throughout the country, without discrimination or 
</b></p>
<p><b>exclusion. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to take the necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>steps to ensure that all children, even in remote areas, are able to enrol in schools, 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue their education and not to be sidelined by a lack of the support they need. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>also encourages the Government to consider further ways whereby students with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities are given the opportunity to integrate into the regular system. Similarly, 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues around the exclusion of some children lacking appropriate documentation must </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20 
</b></p>
<p><b>be addressed. The continuing existence of school or university admission policies or 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices which may discriminate against some students must be identified and 
</b></p>
<p><b>abolished.  
</b></p>
<p><b>D. Special consideration for education for the empowerment of girls 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the Government to give special 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration to education aimed at the empowerment of girls and to take additional 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to improve the educational achievements of girls in the later years of 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. Targeted measures are needed to ensure that girls have the confidence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>support to reach their full potential in education and any barriers to that should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressed. Efforts aimed at achieving gender parity in tertiary education should 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue, as there are still only three women for every five men in tertiary institutions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Increased female representation in the civil service and the national parliament will 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide additional role models for schoolgirls and encourage them to transform their 
</b></p>
<p><b>lives. 
</b></p>
<p><b>E. Improving the quality of education  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Despite tremendous progress made in Bhutan, particularly in the area of 
</b></p>
<p><b>improving access to education for all, there is a need to focus on quality, which has 
</b></p>
<p><b>been recognized by the Government.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>In order to improve quality, curriculum reform should be continued in an effort 
</b></p>
<p><b>to improve educational attainments in academic disciplines and bring the values of 
</b></p>
<p><b>gross national happiness and national traditions to children. Recognizing that 
</b></p>
<p><b>qualified teachers are indispensable for enhancing the quality of education, teacher 
</b></p>
<p><b>training should be increased, particularly for teachers at the primary level, who 
</b></p>
<p><b>remain underqualified. Improving the working conditions of teachers and enhancing 
</b></p>
<p><b>their social standing, as well as their professional status, should be a key concern in 
</b></p>
<p><b>education reforms.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Any decision to close rural schools and construct regional boarding schools 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be taken in consultation with parents and communities, bearing in mind the 
</b></p>
<p><b>best interests of the children concerned. The public authorities must ensure that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>education provided in schools in the largely rural and marginalized communities 
</b></p>
<p><b>meets national standards and does not foster inequalities. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Government should step up its efforts to promote education for democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>citizenship, as part of its programme of education and training on human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal values. The dimension of human rights education of the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures, which was launched in 2013, is an 
</b></p>
<p><b>important emerging concern in the field of education. 
</b></p>
<p><b>F. Reinforcing educating for gross national happiness 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to commend the Government of Bhutan for 
</b></p>
<p><b>embracing the concept of education for gross national happiness and its efforts to give 
</b></p>
<p><b>shape to it. The efforts to counterbalance increasing materialism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commercialization in society by attaching a high degree of importance to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanistic mission of education are commendable, as rapid economic development 
</b></p>
<p><b>and urbanization risk creating a generation which focuses solely on material well-
</b></p>
<p><b>being. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>Educating for gross national happiness, curriculum reform and practical 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to ensure teachers are demonstrating gross national happiness in their daily 
</b></p>
<p><b>actions, will all assist in operationalizing the overarching concept for creating 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal values. The Government should continue to support efforts by universities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the intellectual community to conduct research to better understand the concept 
</b></p>
<p><b>of gross national happiness and to find the most effective means of operationalizing it. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Efforts made by the Royal University of Bhutan, the Centre for Bhutan Studies, GNH 
</b></p>
<p><b>Research, and others  in that field deserve support.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Special Rapporteur supports the preparation of the national blueprint for 
</b></p>
<p><b>education, built upon past experiences, as a road map that will impart further strength 
</b></p>
<p><b>to a people-centred, holistic path to development, making Bhutan exemplary as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>small country in terms of educating for gross national happiness. 
</b></p>
<p><b>G. Preserving and valorizing national languages 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Government should take steps to preserve and valorize Dzongkha as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national language. That would respond to the second pillar of gross national 
</b></p>
<p><b>happiness, which seeks to celebrate the diversity of the cultures and languages of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bhutan. Dzongkha should be a medium of instruction, particularly at the primary 
</b></p>
<p><b>school level where language skills are most easily learned. The Government should 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider whether bilingual education, with English, mathematics and science taught in 
</b></p>
<p><b>English and all other subjects in Dzongkha, might prove an effective long-term 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy for preserving Dzongkha.  
</b></p>
<p><b>H. Regulating private education 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Government must develop a policy and legislative framework to regulate 
</b></p>
<p><b>private education institutions to ensure that education is safeguarded as a public good 
</b></p>
<p><b>and is not reduced to a for-profit business. The negative impact of private providers in 
</b></p>
<p><b>education on the right to education as an inalienable right of every child, without 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard to economic status, social situation or property, should be a matter of critical 
</b></p>
<p><b>concern to the public authorities.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>In Bhutan, as in other countries, privatization in education is a growing trend. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Government should ensure that private schools follow the public curriculum and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that only qualified teachers are employed in them. It should also ensure that fees 
</b></p>
<p><b>charged by private providers are well regulated. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourage the Government to build on the existing guidelines for private schools in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bhutan by legislating for a regulatory framework that will ensure that the social 
</b></p>
<p><b>interest in education is not sacrificed for the sake of private profit and education is 
</b></p>
<p><b>preserved as a common good. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Further, special care must be taken to ensure that private schools do not 
</b></p>
<p><b>replace the public system for higher performing or wealthy students and thereby 
</b></p>
<p><b>exacerbate the inequality within the country. That is best addressed by ensuring that 
</b></p>
<p><b>public education remains the first choice of all parents owing to its high quality. 
</b></p>
<p><b>I. Strengthening technical and vocational education and training 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Government should ensure that a viable, attractive technical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>vocational education and training programme, integrated into secondary education, 
</b></p>
<p><b>receives full support so that all students receive a high-quality education geared to </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22 
</b></p>
<p><b>skills development. It should review its post-secondary educational investment 
</b></p>
<p><b>priorities, with more funding for such programmes and institutions. They are of 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategic importance in terms of skills development and can provide great leverage in 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing the present 12 per cent poverty rate by empowering students from poor 
</b></p>
<p><b>families through technical and vocational education and training. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Developing innovative approaches in national human resource policies and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>education system, including competency-based qualifications programmes for 
</b></p>
<p><b>technical and vocational education and training aimed at creating a competent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>skilled national workforce, are necessary if Bhutan is to reduce its dependence on 
</b></p>
<p><b>foreign workers. Programmes in technical and vocational education and training for 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing the skills needed in natural resource extraction, hydropower and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ecotourism can prepare graduates for deployment in the workforce in those areas. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary steps should be taken to develop an institutionalized framework of 
</b></p>
<p><b>collaboration with the private sector for promoting technical and vocational education 
</b></p>
<p><b>and training and developing the necessary skills. Such collaboration could include, for 
</b></p>
<p><b>example, sponsorship of specific programmes needed by particular industries; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>work placement programmes for students in technical and vocational education and 
</b></p>
<p><b>training based upon the dual system (training in schools as well as in enterprises). In-
</b></p>
<p><b>school vocational training fairs, on-site school visits and similar initiatives may help 
</b></p>
<p><b>students to appreciate better the career possibilities associated with non-academic 
</b></p>
<p><b>career options. Teachers must also be trained to enable them to guide students better 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards non-academic career options, for example through aptitude tests.  
</b></p>
<p><b>J. National investment in education on an enduring basis 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Bhutan should adopt a legal framework which ensures a minimum floor for 
</b></p>
<p><b>spending on education, such as 4 to 6 per cent of GDP, or 15</b>&#8211;<b>20 per cent of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national budget on an enduring basis. That is necessary to sustain education as one of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the highest priorities, even as governments change over time. Bhutan should begin 
</b></p>
<p><b>planning for the possibility of receiving less international financial assistance as it 
</b></p>
<p><b>advances towards becoming a middle-income country. To maintain its growth, it will 
</b></p>
<p><b>need to find domestic, sustainable ways to support its education system. A legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework is essential to ensure sustainability and continuity in investment in 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. 
</b></p>
<p><b>K. Compatibility of monastic education with the formal education system 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>There is space for the formal education sector to import some of the universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>human values and philosophic traditions being taught in the monastic system. At the 
</b></p>
<p><b>same time, the Government should engage in discussions with the monastic authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure that graduates of that system receive the same basic education in fields such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as languages, arts, science and mathematics. The State must ensure that children from 
</b></p>
<p><b>economically disadvantaged families are not further disadvantaged in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>employment or academic opportunities through a monastic education.  
</b></p>
<p><b>L. Fostering global interest in educating for gross national happiness in the 
context of the post-2015 development agenda 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>As stated in the report entitled </b>&#8220;<b>Happiness: towards a new development 
</b></p>
<p><b>paradigm</b>&#8221;, the &#8220;time has never been more opportune to re<b>-orient the goal of 
</b></p>
<p><b>development towards genuine human happiness and the well-being of all life. There is </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>a growing global consensus on the need and urgency for such a holistic new model.&#8221;<b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>There is much for the world to learn from that concept and the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>would like to urge the Government of Bhutan to make every effort to share and 
</b></p>
<p><b>disseminate those ideas throughout the world, recognizing that educating for gross 
</b></p>
<p><b>national happiness is an important way to achieve the education objectives set out in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In resolution 65/309, the General 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly recognized happiness as a holistic approach to development and welcomed 
</b></p>
<p><b>further international discussions on the theme. That demonstrates the global interest 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the concept of gross national happiness and the Special Rapporteur considers that it 
</b></p>
<p><b>is opportune for the Government to continue its pioneering efforts to bring the concept 
</b></p>
<p><b>forward in discussions on education-related goals in the post-2015 development 
</b></p>
<p><b>agenda, particularly on the occasion of the United Nations summit for the adoption of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the post-2015 development agenda, to be held in September 2015.
