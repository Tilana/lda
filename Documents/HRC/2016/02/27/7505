<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session 
from 28 April to 9 May 2014. The review of Portugal was held at the 5th meeting, on 
30 April 2014. The delegation of Portugal was headed by Mr. Bruno Ma&#231;&#227;es, Secretary of 
State for European Affairs and Ms. Teresa Morais, Secretary of State for Parliamentary 
Affairs and Equality. At its 10th meeting, held on 2 May 2014, the Working Group adopted 
the report on Portugal. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Portugal: Brazil, the Philippines and the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Portugal: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/PRT/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/PRT/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/PRT/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Portugal through the troika. Those questions are 
available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation said that Portugal strongly supported the UPR process, as a unique 
and ambitious tool of the Human Rights Council. The outcome of the 2009 review and its 
implementation had broadly contributed to the improvement of the human rights situation 
in Portugal. The country&#8217;s longstanding commitment to the promotion and protection of 
human rights should be underscored. 
</p>
<p>6. Despite the current economic and financial crisis, the Government of Portugal was 
deeply committed to implementing its human rights obligations and had adopted measures 
to minimize the impact of austerity, particularly on the most vulnerable persons. The 
adoption of the Social Emergency Programme in October 2011 should be highlighted. 
</p>
<p>7. It was a matter of pride for Portugal to inform the Working Group that all of the 
86 recommendations accepted in 2009 had been implemented, or were being implemented. 
</p>
<p>8. The National Human Rights Commission had been established in April 2010. It 
enhanced coordination and information-sharing, bringing together Government and civil 
society in promoting an integrated approach to human rights. The Commission had proved 
its efficiency by making possible the timely submission of all national reports on </p>


<p>implementation to the United Nations treaty bodies. Portugal currently had no reports 
overdue. 
</p>
<p>9. Portugal was a party, without reservations, to eight core United Nations human 
rights treaties and their optional protocols, of which it had ratified a number since 2009. 
</p>
<p>10. It should be underscored that Portugal had implemented its national action plans on 
gender equality, domestic and gender-based violence, trafficking in human beings, female 
genital mutilation, the integration of Roma (Cigano) communities, United Nations Security 
Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, and persons with 
disabilities.  
</p>
<p>11. The immigration integration policies pursued by Portugal had received international 
recognition in the <i>2010 World Migration Report</i> and had been ranked second in the 
Migration Integration Policy Index in 2010 and 2011. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation responded to the questions submitted in advance by Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as follows.  
</p>
<p>13. In connection with its candidacy for the Human Rights Council (2015-2017), 
Portugal was willing to build bridges and foster dialogue with a view to achieving the 
universality of human rights. It was committed to the promotion and protection of all 
human rights, drawing inspiration from the fact that it had been one of the first countries in 
the world to abolish the death penalty, and was building on its multilateral experience on 
economic, social and cultural rights, and the rights of women, children and youth.  
</p>
<p>14. Portugal strongly supported the International Criminal Court and was deeply 
committed to cooperating with it. Portugal had amended its national Constitution prior to 
ratifying the Rome Statute, and had also amended the relevant national criminal legislation. 
The internal process for the ratification of the Kampala amendments was ongoing. 
</p>
<p>15. Reform of the judiciary system, aimed at making the court system more efficient, 
faster and accessible, was under way. The administrative reorganization of the judicial 
system would be concluded by the end of 2014. 
</p>
<p>16. Under Portuguese law on criminal procedure, pre-trial detention was deemed to be a 
coercive measure of an exceptional nature. It was limited to specific cases and could not 
exceed a period of between 4 and 18 months. In cases of terrorism, violent or highly- 
organized crime or crimes punishable by more than 8 years&#8217; imprisonment, the maximum 
time period in detention could vary from six months to two years. If a criminal 
investigation had not reached a conclusive result within those time periods, detainees were 
released and entitled to claim compensation from the State. There were specific detention 
facilities for pre-trial detainees. 
</p>
<p>17. Training on human rights was provided on an ongoing basis to law enforcement 
officials and members of the security forces in order to prevent ill-treatment and abuse. All 
allegations of ill-treatment and abuse were duly investigated and those found responsible 
were punished. 
</p>
<p>18. It should be emphasized that the use of Taser weapons was subjected to very strict 
rules. The law enforcement forces possessed a mere 76 Tasers, and the use of such weapons 
in prisons had been suspended since 2010. 
</p>
<p>19. Under the inclusive &#8220;More and Better Education&#8221; policy, education was free and 
compulsory up to the age of 18 years. All children, including those of undocumented 
immigrants, had access to the national education system. There were no segregated schools 
or classes, and special attention was given to disadvantaged groups. </p>


<p>20. The National Strategy for the Integration of Roma Communities 2013-2020, adopted 
in 2013, aimed to achieve the full and effective integration of Roma communities in 
Portuguese society by 2020. 
</p>
<p>21. Immigrant communities had full access to public services. All immigrants, 
regardless of their status, had access to the national health system. A number of National 
Support Centres for Migrants offered a wide range of services to facilitate the integration of 
immigrants. 
</p>
<p>22. Portugal had placed emphasis on the importance of maintaining an open dialogue 
with civil society in recent years. The National Human Rights Commission met regularly 
with civil society. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were systematically involved 
in the preparation of reports to the United Nations treaty bodies, as well as in the UPR 
process. 
</p>
<p>23. Portugal was currently preparing an initiative on corporate social responsibility, 
which included a specific chapter on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>24. The Second National Plan against Trafficking in Human Beings had had a 91 per 
cent implementation rate. The Third National Plan against Trafficking in Human Beings 
2014-2017 was being implemented. Action against trafficking in human beings had focused 
on increasing the number of multidisciplinary teams and providing training to security 
forces, labour inspectors and the judiciary, as well as on improving mechanisms for the 
detection of potential victims. 
</p>
<p>25. Pursuant to a European Union directive, Portugal had broadened the definition of the 
crime of human trafficking to include all forms of exploitation. Legislation on combating 
organized crime and on covert operations had also been amended to apply to human 
trafficking. The low number of prosecutions and convictions for that crime was not the 
result of a lack of resources, but arose from the difficulty in proving crimes of great 
complexity, often committed by organized cross-border actors. That issue had been 
addressed by intensifying training for all those involved in investigations and for the 
judiciary. In 2013, the number of shelters for victims of human trafficking had been 
increased from one to three. All those shelters were run by State-funded NGOs. 
</p>
<p>26. The Fourth National Plan against Domestic Violence had been fully implemented 
and the Fifth National Plan to Prevent and Combat Domestic and Gender-based Violence 
2014-2017 was already under way. The Fifth National Plan integrated the Third Programme 
of Action for the Prevention and Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation 2014-2017, and 
invested more heavily in prevention, on inter-service cooperation and victim support. 
</p>
<p>27. Strenuous efforts were being made to disseminate information on gender violence 
and to raise awareness among potential victims, as well as the community at large. 
European Union data indicated that awareness of domestic violence in Portugal was 
significantly above average. The country&#8217;s capacity to provide psychosocial support had 
increased; in addition, security forces were given training on appropriate ways of handling 
domestic violence cases, and on proactive identification of situations of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>28. Portugal had greatly increased its capacity to protect victims of domestic and 
gender-based violence. Not only had the remote assistance service been broadened, but the 
use of surveillance measures, namely, electronic monitoring bracelets for offenders, had 
increased; safe transportation for victims and their children was provided; support and 
shelter capacity had been reinforced, especially for emergency situations; and, lastly, a safe 
and supportive process was in place for those leaving shelters. A municipalities&#8217; network 
and the Institute for Housing and Urban Rehabilitation facilitated access to housing. The </p>


<p>Fifth National Plan reinforced prevention, and enhanced awareness-raising activities with a 
focus on the most vulnerable victims, including elderly persons and women in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>29. With regard to gender equality, according to the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development 62 per cent of posts in the Portuguese civil service were 
occupied by women. Women occupied 38 per cent of high-ranking positions and 58 per 
cent of middle-ranking positions. A Council of Ministers resolution issued in 2012 required 
all State-owned companies to approve and implement an equality plan. The Framework 
Law for Regulatory Entities of 2013 provided that the position of Chairperson of the Board 
of Directors of such entities should be occupied by men and women in rotation, and 
required a minimum of 33 per cent female or male representation on such boards. 
</p>
<p>30. Wage discrimination based on gender was prohibited in Portugal. The average wage 
gap between men and women in Portugal, according to Eurostat, was 15.7 per cent in 2012, 
below the European Union average. A recent report commissioned by the Government on 
women in the labour market would be discussed with social partners. In March 2013, a 
Council of Ministers resolution had been issued, requiring the preparation of reports on pay 
disparities between men and women, in addition to action to combat those disparities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>31. During the interactive dialogue, 74 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>32. The Czech Republic commended the efforts of Portugal to improve the access of 
Roma to education through the National Strategy for the Integration of Roma Communities, 
and drew attention to the challenges involved in addressing the underlying social factors 
and ensuring the full cooperation of all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>33. Ecuador commended the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission. 
It appreciated the priority given by Portugal in recent years to action against gender-based 
violence, human trafficking and female genital mutilation, in addition to action for the 
integration of Roma communities and in support of migrants, persons with disabilities and 
older persons. 
</p>
<p>34. Italy commended the action taken by Portugal to prevent trafficking in human 
beings and violence against women. It noted that the adoption of rigorous budgetary 
measures in response to the economic crisis might have undermined the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights by the most vulnerable children and women. 
</p>
<p>35. Finland asked about measures taken to minimize the impact of austerity policies on 
the Roma community. Noting treaty body recommendations that greater attention should be 
paid to the tendency not to report domestic violence owing to traditional attitudes, it asked 
for further information on measures to investigate cases of domestic violence effectively 
and the impact thereof on women belonging to minority groups. 
</p>
<p>36. France welcomed the ratification by Portugal of the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. It commended the action being taken to counter racism and to address prison 
overcrowding. Since domestic violence persisted despite the measures introduced by the 
Government, France asked whether any additional measures were envisaged to tackle the 
problem. 
</p>
<p>37. Germany praised Portugal for the situation of human rights in the country and 
welcomed, in particular, the recently initiated judicial reform. It requested further 
information on the impact of the National Strategy for the Integration of Roma </p>


<p>Communities, in particular with regard to improvements in living conditions and access to 
social services, and on the main challenges. 
</p>
<p>38. Ghana commended Portugal for having issued a standing invitation to all special 
procedures. Referring to concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination regarding the limited number of complaints of racial discrimination, Ghana 
asked whether Portugal had assessed the impact of initiatives to promote the integration of 
immigrants and to fight racism and racial discrimination. It enquired about the findings of 
the Immigration Observatory study on racist speech, and asked whether Portugal intended 
to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>39. Greece commended the efforts of Portugal to promote and protect economic, social 
and cultural rights and asked about recent policies in that regard. It requested further 
information on measures to combat discrimination against women in the workplace and 
their participation in public life. 
</p>
<p>40. The Holy See acknowledged improvements in areas such as the prevention of 
human trafficking and child labour, as well as racial discrimination, intolerance and 
xenophobia and the integration of immigrants and ethnic minorities. It commended 
Portugal on its ratification of a significant number of human rights and humanitarian 
instruments. 
</p>
<p>41. Hungary welcomed the steps taken to expedite the investigation of crimes of 
domestic violence and the establishment of special teams for that purpose. It was concerned 
that the right of access to a lawyer was not effective for many detainees, and noted that the 
prison population had increased significantly and that juveniles were frequently 
accommodated with adults. 
</p>
<p>42. India enquired about measures taken to ensure accountability in the prevention of 
discriminatory conduct and manifestations of racist stereotypes and prejudice by law 
enforcement officials. It asked whether the Social Emergency Programme addressed the 
impact of austerity measures on the poorest and most vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>43. Indonesia welcomed the action being taken by Portugal to combat racism and 
discrimination and to promote the integration of migrants and marginalized groups. It noted 
that the National Strategy for the Integration of Roma Communities included measures in 
the areas of education, health, housing and employment, and comprised a cross-cutting 
dimension. 
</p>
<p>44. Iraq commended the measures and plans adopted by Portugal to end violence against 
women and children. It also welcomed the action taken to align national legislation with 
recently ratified international human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>45. Ireland requested further information on the regular interaction between the National 
Human Rights Commission and civil society. While welcoming the measures taken to 
address discrimination against children, it noted that instances of discrimination continued 
to occur in practice. It considered that the criminalization of defamation was an 
inappropriate restriction on freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>46. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern about the increase in racist websites, 
particularly those targeting Roma and immigrants, and the increase in cases of 
discrimination, harassment and abuse of members of ethnic minorities. In addition, it 
expressed concern about the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, and 
allegations of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>47. Estonia encouraged Portugal to step up its efforts to ensure that the education system 
was inclusive, particularly for immigrants, ethnic minorities, girls and women. It welcomed </p>


<p>the fact that financial austerity measures had not disproportionately affected human rights 
structures. It encouraged Portugal to continue to promote human rights education, training 
and awareness-raising. 
</p>
<p>48. Kenya welcomed the ratification by Portugal of a number of human rights 
instruments and policy frameworks and encouraged it to ensure their effective 
implementation. It noted that certain human rights mechanisms had expressed concern with 
regard to disparities in the enjoyment of human rights by some minority groups. 
</p><p>49. Kyrgyzstan commended the Government of Portugal for its recognition of human 
rights as an essential component of socioeconomic development strategies. It welcomed the 
ratification by Portugal of a wide range of human rights and humanitarian treaties, as well 
as the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission. It commended Portugal on 
the progress achieved in protecting and promoting migrant rights. 
</p>
<p>50. Libya commended the action taken by Portugal to implement the recommendations 
of the first UPR and the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission. It 
welcomed the steps taken to combat racial discrimination and to promote tolerance. 
</p>
<p>51. Malaysia commended the role of the National Human Rights Commission in 
coordinating and sharing information on human rights issues with the relevant stakeholders. 
It encouraged the Government to implement the human rights policies and programmes that 
it had adopted. It highlighted measures to combat trafficking in persons and to protect 
victims.  
</p>
<p>52. Mauritania commended the action taken by Portugal to combat violence against 
women and to eliminate racial discrimination, and praised the work of the High 
Commissioner for Immigration and Intercultural Dialogue. 
</p>
<p>53. Mexico welcomed the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission and 
commended its impressive efforts to submit pending reports to the treaty bodies. It noted 
the progress made in combating racial discrimination and discrimination based on sexual 
orientation, and the inclusion of such issues in the National Plan for Equality. 
</p>
<p>54. Montenegro welcomed the enhancement of the institutional and legislative human 
rights framework, the development of policy instruments and the establishment of the 
National Human Rights Commission. Noting that immigrants, foreigners and ethnic 
minorities continued to face discrimination, it enquired about the action taken to prevent 
further discrimination against vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>55. Morocco commended the importance attached to the prevention of racist and 
discriminatory acts targeting migrants and ethnic groups. It welcomed the action taken by 
the High Commissioner for Immigration and Intercultural Dialogue, particularly the 
&#8220;Promotion of intercultural life at local level&#8221; initiative. It also commended the measures 
taken to promote economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>56. Mozambique noted that Portugal accorded priority to economic, social and cultural 
rights and the right to education. It commended the fact that Portugal had implemented 
97 per cent of the recommendations from the first UPR and noted that none of its periodic 
reports to the human rights treaty bodies were overdue.  
</p>
<p>57. Namibia noted that the National Human Rights Commission had strengthened 
dialogue, consultations and information-sharing with all human rights stakeholders in 
Portugal and with the country&#8217;s international strategic partners. It noted with satisfaction 
that Portugal had ratified eight core human rights treaties and related optional protocols 
since 2009. 
</p>
<p>58. The Netherlands commended Portugal on its forward position on equal rights for 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, as reflected in the Gender Identity Act. It </p>


<p>expressed concerns about the status of minorities, including Roma, particularly their access 
to public services, and about the duration of legal procedures and the conditions of 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>59. Nicaragua noted that Portugal had made considerable progress since the first UPR in 
the fight against racism and discrimination, in promoting human rights education and in 
countering domestic violence. In addition, it noted that Portugal played a leading role in 
promoting economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>60. Norway expressed concern about the number of deaths among women as a result of 
domestic violence. It drew attention to overcrowding in prisons, allegations of ill-treatment 
of patients in a psychiatric prison hospital and concerns regarding high rates of suicide 
among inmates. A number of judgments handed down by the European Court of Human 
Rights had not been fully executed. 
</p>
<p>61. The delegation of Portugal recalled that the National Strategy for the Integration of 
Roma Communities 2013-2020 incorporated numerous different strands of action aimed at 
promoting Roma rights. Under the Strategy, a survey had been conducted among 
municipalities to ascertain the living or housing conditions of those communities. The 
survey had indicated that 7 per cent of social housing was occupied by members of Roma 
communities, although they represented a mere 0.5 per cent of the total population. As far 
as education was concerned, Portugal was seeking to ensure that Roma communities had 
access to education of a good quality at all levels by means of various programmes, such as 
a programme aimed at raising awareness of the importance of learning and achieving good 
grades. 
</p>
<p>62. With regard to prison conditions, efforts had been made to rehabilitate and build 
prison facilities despite constraints in public funding arising from the commitments 
undertaken in the framework of the Economic and Financial Adjustment Programme. The 
need to promote alternative measures to imprisonment, such as home arrest with electronic 
monitoring, should be underscored, and legislation on that issue had been adopted in 2010. 
Juvenile offenders were housed in separate accommodation from adult prisoners. Legal aid 
was guaranteed to detainees as provided for under the Constitution and prisoners could 
meet with their defence lawyers in private. 
</p>
<p>63. Economic and social conditions in the context of the financial crisis had been 
addressed under the Social Emergency Programme adopted in 2011, and under other 
incentive programmes for the most vulnerable groups. Benefits and pensions had been 
increased and assisted housing had been provided for young people, among other measures. 
Maintaining support for NGOs had been prioritized and a number of programmes had been 
funded. Support for solidarity institutions had increased considerably between 2009 and 
2013, despite the financial crisis. 
</p>
<p>64. While Portugal was unable to ratify the Migrant Workers Convention as a member 
of the European Union, the rights of migrant workers were strongly protected under its 
national laws. 
</p>
<p>65. The training of law enforcement officials was a priority for Portugal, which had 
established human rights training centres and had incorporated human rights in the 
curriculum of the national police force. 
</p>
<p>66. Both of the current national action plans for equality and combating violence against 
women envisaged specific measures for particular vulnerable and minority groups. The 
increase in the number of domestic violence complaints was a positive sign of greater 
awareness of the issue, which itself was a result of public campaigns and of specific 
training provided to law enforcement officials. A number of efforts had contributed to the </p>


<p>increase in complaints, particularly efforts to enable and empower women to make 
complaints. The greatest concern was reserved for cases that did not come to light. 
</p>
<p>67. The Fifth National Plan for Gender Equality, Citizenship and Non-discrimination 
provided for enhanced measures relating to gender equality in the labour market. In 
addition, existing bodies such as the Commission for Equality in Labour and Employment 
were able to receive complaints. Complaints about work conditions could be submitted to 
the Labour Inspectorate, which was able to apply the necessary sanctions. 
</p>
<p>68. The Parity Act of 2006 had helped to increase the participation of women in public 
life through the introduction of a quota policy. The increase was evident in the relevant 
statistics. 
</p>
<p>69. In connection with human trafficking, a system for flagging and identifying victims 
had helped to tackle the phenomenon more effectively. The current Third National Action 
Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking in Human Beings also targeted labour exploitation 
of and trafficking in children. Efforts to address the issues of child labour and of street 
children had produced tangible results. 
</p>
<p>70. Paraguay welcomed the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission 
and the appointment of an Ombudsman. It commended Portugal on the elaboration of 
policies to counter racial discrimination and encouraged it to continue taking resolute action 
to prevent discrimination against immigrants and ethnic minorities in access to housing, 
employment, education and health care. 
</p>
<p>71. The Philippines welcomed the adoption by Portugal of human rights policy 
instruments, including national plans to combat human trafficking and gender-based 
violence and to integrate immigrants and the Roma community. It urged Portugal to 
promote and protect the human rights of migrants in addition to those of its own people. 
</p>
<p>72. Poland expressed appreciation for the efforts of Portugal to comply with 
recommendations on equality and non-discrimination, and commended it on measures 
taken to combat domestic violence, including the adoption of a national plan. 
</p>
<p>73. Qatar welcomed the adoption by Portugal of comprehensive plans and strategies for 
human rights and the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission. It 
commended Portugal on the adoption of the Second National Plan against Trafficking in 
Human Beings and on legislative amendments expanding the concept of trafficking in 
persons to include begging, slavery and exploitation in other criminal activities. 
</p>
<p>74. The Republic of Korea expressed appreciation for the endeavours of Portugal to 
improve human rights, combat discrimination, prevent violence against women, promote 
the rights of the child and establish the National Human Rights Commission. Portugal had 
displayed outstanding leadership in promoting human rights internationally. It invited 
Portugal to pay closer attention to the negative impact of austerity measures on the most 
vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>75. The Republic of Moldova commended Portugal on its commitment to human rights 
and its engagement with international human rights mechanisms. It expressed appreciation 
for the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, and invited Portugal to 
elaborate on the objectives and priorities of the Second Plan for Immigrant Integration. It 
noted the low number of convictions for human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>76. The Russian Federation expressed concern about deteriorating detention conditions, 
reduced safety resulting from cuts in the number of prison officers, and prison 
overcrowding. It also expressed concern about the duration of legal proceedings, and noted 
that trafficking in human beings continued to be an acute problem. It commended the 
campaign to combat domestic violence. </p>


<p>77. Senegal praised the progress made by Portugal in implementing the 
recommendations of the first UPR. It welcomed the adoption of policies that promoted the 
economic, social and cultural rights of the elderly and of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>78. Serbia welcomed the progress made by Portugal in implementing the 
recommendations of the first review cycle. It commended the establishment of the National 
Human Rights Commission and the ratification of international human rights instruments 
including the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance, the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure and the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography. It acknowledged the efforts of Portugal to combat 
racism and promote the socioeconomic integration of migrants. 
</p>
<p>79. Sierra Leone commended the establishment of the human rights mechanism. It was 
important to ensure that austerity measures did not adversely affect vulnerable groups or the 
implementation of existing human rights obligations. Sierra Leone applauded the call by 
Portugal for States to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>80. Slovakia appreciated the commitment of Portugal to human rights and the rights of 
the child and commended it on its ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure and other international human 
rights instruments. It welcomed the establishment of the National Human Rights 
Commission, and asked what further human rights indicators would be developed by that 
body. 
</p>
<p>81. Slovenia welcomed the progress made by Portugal in combating violence against 
women and, in particular, the legislative amendments introduced in order to extend the

Bargaining Convention, 1949 (No. 98). 
</p><p>94. Uruguay noted the ratification by Portugal of international human rights instruments

</p>
<p>95. Uzbekistan expressed concern regarding manifestations of xenophobia and racism as

</p>

concern. 
</p>

its best practices in ensuring respect for economic, social and cultural rights and in </p>


<p>preventing retrogression at times of economic decline. It also invited Portugal to comment 
on best practices and challenges relating to the enjoyment of human rights by young people. 
</p><p>114. The Democratic Republic of the Congo noted the efforts expended by Portugal to 
implement recommendations from the first UPR, including by creating the National Human 
Rights Commission and other institutions and ratifying international human rights 
instruments. Portugal had promoted human rights education, taken action against racism 
and domestic violence and promoted social integration for migrants. The Democratic 
Republic of the Congo asked what the impact of the economic crisis had been on the 
implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>115. The delegation, responding in brief to a number of questions, said that the number of 
short-term employment contracts for women was falling in comparison with the number for 
men. Female participation in the labour market in Portugal was the highest in Europe. 
Despite the financial crisis, the difference in employment rates between men and women 
was less than in 2008. 
</p>
<p>116. Portugal was in compliance with the recommendations of the Group of Experts on 
Action against Trafficking in Human Beings of the Council of Europe and had introduced 
the relevant amendments to the Criminal Code. The national legislation was fully compliant 
with the European Union directive on human trafficking. Specific measures undertaken 
included awareness-raising activities and campaigns targeting the most vulnerable groups, 
particularly children. The number of protection teams and centres had been increased, 
despite the economic crisis. 
</p>
<p>117. In response to concerns expressed relating to domestic violence, actions to shed light 
on hidden violence in the family and to protect children and the elderly should be 
highlighted. A joint campaign proposed by Portugal, entitled &#8220;I stand up to violence&#8221; 
(<i>Contra a viol&#234;ncia eu dou a cara</i>), had been implemented throughout all Portuguese-
speaking countries. Never before had there been so many measures to protect victims. The 
number of convictions for domestic violence was increasing year on year. There were 
119 shelters for victims of domestic violence and 132 welcome and care centres providing 
victims with social, psychological and legal support in line with the Manual on Effective 
Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. A further 113 places had been added for the emergency reception 
of victims. 
</p>
<p>118. Women represented 5.6 per cent of the prison population and were accommodated 
under appropriate conditions. Pregnancy and birth were supported, and facilities for 
children up to the age of 3 years were available. Portugal had had national plans to address 
domestic violence since 1999. The measures envisaged under the current plan included 
increasing the capacity of local authorities to prevent violence, and programmes to prevent 
perpetrators from reoffending. 
</p>
<p>119. The importance of human rights indicators should be underscored. As suggested by 
OHCHR, Portugal had already developed national indicators on the right to education and 
the right to liberty and security of the person. It should be noted that the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
budget had been maintained, and would continue to be maintained, despite the financial 
crisis. In respect of action plans, it should also be recalled that one of the aims of the 
creation of the National Human Rights Commission was specifically to ensure coordination 
and coherence in the relevant sectorial action plans. 
</p>
<p>120. In connection with access to education, particularly for the most vulnerable, it 
should be noted that more opportunities were being provided for lifelong learning for adults 
over 55 years of age, particularly those with disabilities. Moreover, the Government had 
invested in complementary support, so that children with special needs could attend regular 
schools without segregation. </p>


<p>121. In connection with questions related to racism and discrimination against 
immigrants, the delegation said that Portugal wished to address racism in its totality without 
singling out any group. Those determined to have perpetrated acts of discrimination were 
liable to criminal prosecution under the Constitution, and racist motivation was addressed 
in the Criminal Code, where it could be considered an aggravating circumstance. Two plans 
to combat discrimination against migrants had been implemented and the results measured 
in statistical terms. In addition, measures such as the establishment of the Immigration 
Observatory had been taken.  
</p>
<p>122. With regard to the issue of discrimination against migrants in employment, the 
burden fell on the employer to prove the absence of discrimination in cases of complaint. 
Discrimination was categorized as a crime and the authorities could provide the necessary 
compensation to victims. Special services for unemployed immigrants, including vocational 
training and programmes, facilitated the social integration of migrants. 
</p>
<p>123. The existing law respected the principle of non-refoulement of refugees and asylum 
seekers. In practice, that meant that no one could be removed from Portuguese territory 
before a final judicial decision had been handed down in the case. Asylum requests from 
minors were submitted immediately to the family courts, and a centre for refugee children 
housed them. 
</p>
<p>124. The current review was being held at a time when Portugal was going through a 
deep economic crisis. It was hoped that the country&#8217;s efforts to mitigate the effects of the 
crisis on vulnerable groups had been demonstrated. The Government and the National 
Human Rights Commission would do everything possible to implement the accepted 
recommendations, and would submit a mid-term report as part of the UPR process. The 
UPR mechanism played a positive role in the achievement of human rights worldwide, and 
the implementation of its recommendations would be felt in Portugal during the coming 
four years.
