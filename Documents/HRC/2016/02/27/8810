<p><b>  Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</b>*<b> 
</b><i>Chairperson-Rapporteur</i>: El Hadji Malick <b>Sow</b> 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 During 2009, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited Malta and Senegal 
at the invitation of the Governments. The reports on these visits are contained in addenda to 
the present document (A/HRC/13/30/Add.2 and 3). 
 During the period 1 December 2008 to 30 November 2009, the Working Group 
adopted 29 Opinions concerning 71 persons in 23 States. These Opinions are contained in 
the first addendum to the present document (A/HRC/13/30/Add.1). 
 Also during this period, the Group transmitted a total of 138 urgent appeals to 58 
States concerning 844 individuals, including 50 women and 29 boys. The States informed 
the Working Group that they had taken measures to remedy the situation of the detainees: 
in some cases, the detainees were released; in other cases, the Working Group was assured 
that the detainees concerned would be guaranteed a fair trial. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group has sought to engage in a continuous dialogue with those 
countries visited by the Working Group, in respect of which it had recommended changes 
to domestic legislation governing detention or the adoption of other measures. Information 
about the implementation of the recommendations made by the Working Group to the 
Governments of countries visited in 2007 was received from the Governments of Norway 
and Equatorial Guinea. The Government of Angola requested an extension of the deadline 
for submitting its comments. 
</p>
<p> The present report includes several issues which have given rise to concern during 
</p><p>2009. The Working Group welcomes the Human Rights Council panel discussion on the 
human rights of migrants in detention centres, in which its Chairperson-Rapporteur 
participated. However, it remains concerned that the human rights of detained migrants in

<p>an irregular situation and those of asylum-seekers and refugees are still not fully 
guaranteed. It emphasizes in the present report that where obstacles to the removal of 
detained migrants do not lie within their sphere of responsibility, the principle of 
proportionality requires that they should be released. The report also examines the question 
of detention in connection with military tribunals and states of emergency. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group observes that a weak or non-existent institution of habeas 
corpus still prevails in some States, particularly in the context of administrative detention, 
despite recommendations addressed to States since the inception of the Working Group in 
1991, aimed at strengthening this common law prerogative writ. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of an analysis of its jurisprudence and recommendations on compliance 
with international human rights norms, standards and remedies, the Working Group 
concludes that the typical remedy for arbitrarily detained individuals is their immediate 
release. This includes the release of (foreign) detainees arbitrarily deprived of their liberty 
into the territory of the detaining State. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group also raises concerns over an increase in information received 
on reprisals suffered by individuals who were the subject of an urgent appeal or Opinion. 
 The Working Group has decided to devote particular attention in 2010 to the issues 
of video and audio surveillance in interrogation rooms, alternatives to detention, the 
detention of drug users, and a revision of its methods of work. 
</p>
<p> To enable the Working Group to report more systematically and comprehensively, it 
reiterates its proposal to the Human Rights Council to expand the mandate of the Working 
Group, if renewed in 2010, so as to include the examination of conditions of detention 
around the world, and the monitoring of State compliance with obligations concerning all 
human rights of detained and imprisoned persons.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 1991/42 and entrusted with the investigation of instances of 
alleged arbitrary deprivation of liberty, according to the standards set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant international instruments accepted by the 
States concerned. The mandate of the Working Group was clarified and extended by the 
Commission in resolution 1997/50 to cover the issue of administrative custody of asylum-
seekers and immigrants. At its sixth session the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 
6/4 which confirmed the scope of the mandate and extended it for a further three-year 
period. 
</p>
<p>2. During the period 1 January 2009 to 31 July 2009, Manuela Carmena Castrillo 
(Spain) was a member of the Working Group and its Chairperson-Rapporteur. She was 
replaced as a member of the Working Group by Mads Andenas (Norway), who assumed his 
mandate on 1 August 2009. Since then, the Working Group has been composed of Shaheen 
Sardar Ali (Pakistan), Aslan Abashidze (Russian Federation), Roberto Garret&#243;n (Chile) and 
El Hadji Malick Sow (Senegal), in addition to Mr. Andenas.  
</p><p>3. On 31 August 2009, Mr. Sow was appointed as Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group and Ms. Ali as Vice-Chairperson. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group in 2009 
</b>4. During the period 1 January to 30 November 2009, the Working Group held its 
fifty-fourth, fifty-fifth and fifty-sixth sessions. It carried out two official missions to Malta 
(19&#8211;23 January 2009) and to Senegal (5&#8211;15 September 2009) (see A/HRC/13/30/Add.2 and 
3). 
5. On 21 January 2009, Mr. Abashidze participated in a seminar in Geneva on the 
prevention of genocide, reflecting on strategies for effective prevention of genocide and 
other mass atrocities. 
</p>
<p>6. On 10 March 2009, at the tenth session of the Human Rights Council, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism; 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment; the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances, and the former Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention announced that a global joint study into the practice of secret detention 
in the context of contemporary efforts in countering terrorism would be undertaken by these 
respective mandates. The Working Group designated its member and current Vice-Chair, 
Ms. Ali, to represent the Working Group in the joint study.  
7. On 17 September 2009, the Human Rights Council held a panel discussion on the 
human rights of migrants in detention centres as envisaged in its resolution 11/9 of 12 June 
2009, in which Mr. Sow participated. The Working Group recalls that in its annual report 
for 2007 it recommended to the Human Rights Council an in-depth and urgent deliberation 
to seek effective alternatives to prevent violations of rights affecting the large numbers of 
asylum-seekers and irregular migrants in detention around the world<b>1</b> It welcomes the fact

Nos. 17/2008 to 17/2009 are reproduced in addendum 1 to this report. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Opinions of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>10. Pursuant to its methods of work,<b>2</b> the Working Group, in addressing its Opinions to 
Governments, drew their attention to former Commission on Human Rights resolutions 
1997/50 and 2003/31, and Human Rights Council resolution 6/4, requesting them to take 
account of the Opinions of the Working Group and, where necessary, to take appropriate 
steps to remedy the situation of persons arbitrarily deprived of their liberty and to inform 
the Working Group of the steps they had taken. On the expiry of the three-week deadline 
the Opinions were transmitted to the source.

<p><b> 3. Government reactions to Opinions 
</b></p>
<p>11. In a communication dated 18 February 2009, the Government of the Syrian Arab 
Republic stated that the persons mentioned in Opinions 5/2008,3 Messrs. Anwar al-Bunni, 
Michel Kilo and Mahmoud &#8216;Issa, and 10/2008,4 Messrs. Husam &#8216;Ali Mulhim, Tareq al-
Ghorani, Omar &#8216;Ali al-Abdullah, Diab Siriyeh, Maher Isber Ibrahim, Ayham Saqr and 
Allam Fakhour, were detained for reasons that were nothing to do with their activities as 
human rights defenders, but for committing acts against Syrian citizens, society and the 
State. All laws throughout the world draw a distinction between humanitarian activities and 
incitement to unrest. The Government does not have the right to stop the judiciary from 
exercising its constitutional and legal prerogative to detain and prosecute Syrian citizens 
who commit offences. Human rights activists and humanitarian workers do not benefit from 
legal immunity when they commit an offence.  
</p>
<p>12. The Government of Lebanon, in a note verbale dated 31 August 2009, stated that the 
11 Iraqis referred to in Opinion No. 5/20095 had either been voluntarily repatriated, 
released or handed over to the United Nations. The memorandum of understanding between

 Addendum 1 to this report. </p>


<p>GE.10-10294 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Lebanon and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
concerning non-Palestinian asylum-seekers, signed on 9 September 2003, allows foreigners 
entering Lebanon in an irregular manner to submit asylum applications to UNHCR. If the 
criteria of the memorandum are met, UNHCR accepts the asylum application and the 
Government issues a circulation permit, valid for three months and free of charge. If 
UNHCR grants the asylum-seeker refugee status, a six-month circulation permit is issued, 
renewable once for three months, so that UNHCR can identify a resettlement country or 
arrange for voluntarily repatriation.  
</p>
<p>13. The recommendation made by UNHCR dated 18 December 2006, calling on States 
to consider displaced Iraqis from central and southern Iraq as refugees under international 
protection, regardless of their means of entry, contradict the memorandum. As Lebanon is 
not bound by the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and is not a country 
of refuge lacking the capacity to take in additional asylum-seekers, it does not implement 
these recommendations. 
</p>
<p>14. National laws allow Lebanon to detain persons liable for deportation with judicial 
approval. Such detention is not arbitrary. Lebanese courts, in virtually all cases, impose 
minimum prison sentences of one month on humanitarian grounds on foreigners entering 
the country in an irregular manner. The delay in carrying out deportation is due to factors 
such as the failure of embassies to follow up on the situation of their nationals and the lack 
of diplomatic representation of some countries. The Government is currently drafting a 
proposal on establishing a mechanism to deal with this situation. Deportees are entitled to 
appeal against decisions of expulsion, taking ordinary and extraordinary recourse, including 
a plea for clemency. The Government only returns foreigners, including asylum-seekers, 
who have signed a &#8220;voluntary return&#8221; form. Lebanon does not conduct large-scale 
deportations. It is an independent sovereign State which applies its own laws, international 
public law and the provisions of treaties consistent with its own interests and, first and 
foremost, that of its citizens. With regard to refugees, Lebanon acts within the scope of the 
applicable laws and memoranda of understanding.  
</p>
<p>15. In a note verbale dated 17 November 2009, the Japanese Government submitted 
comments related to Opinion No. 9/2009 (Japan).6 It stated that, while everyone has the 
right to express their opinions, which is clearly guaranteed as a fundamental human right in 
the Japanese legal system, no one is allowed to commit a crime for the purpose of 
expression of such opinions. The Greenpeace activists Messrs. Sato and Suzuki, the 
subjects of Opinion No. 9/2009, could not be acquitted of charges of breaking into a 
residence and theft on the basis of their activities as these were beyond the limitations of 
article 19 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The criminal 
investigation into the accusation brought by them against the crew members of a whaling 
research ship was not obstructed by their detention. The prosecutor concluded there was not 
sufficient evidence for the prosecution of the crew. There was no reason to consider the 
detention of Mr. Sato and Mr. Suzuki as arbitrary, as it was determined by a deliberate 
judgement by a fair court strictly observing the requirements of the Japanese criminal 
justice system. The Working Group had disregarded the appraisal of the facts and evidence 
and the application and interpretation of domestic law by the judiciary. The Government 
will ensure that Messrs. Sako and Suzuki continue to be subject to proceedings which meet 
international standards of fairness and that their rights of defence at their trial are fully 
respected.

<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10294 
</p>
<p>16. In a note verbale dated 17 November 2009, the Government of Spain expressed its 
complete disagreement with Opinion No. 17/20097 on the detention of Karmelo Landa 
considering that it contains biased and incorrect assessments lacking a legal basis. The 
decisions on the remand in custody and imprisonment of Mr. Landa were taken by 
independent judicial bodies, in accordance with domestic laws and international human 
rights standards. The Government considers that the Working Group did not give equal 
consideration to the arguments made by the source and the Government.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government cannot agree that the defendant was detained because of his 
membership in leadership bodies of Batasuna. It was rather his alleged membership in or 
association with a terrorist group. In any case, the Working Group cannot consider that 
activities related to a banned political party fall under articles 19, 20 and 21 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and 18, 19 and 22 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. The Opinion appears to ignore the terrorist nature of the banned 
political organization of Batasuna, as confirmed by the Spanish Supreme Court, the Council 
of the European Union, and the European Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>18. Regarding the conditions of detention and allegations of ill-treatment, the 
Government submits that its version and that of the source are incompatible; 
notwithstanding that the Working Group considered the source&#8217;s submission as more 
credible. 
</p>
<p>19. In conclusion, the Government does not consider that the pretrial detention ordered 
by the courts involves any violation of human rights. The Government cannot interfere with 
an independent judicial process. The principle of separation of powers must prevail under 
the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Information received concerning previous Opinions 
</b></p>
<p>20. On 24 February 2009, the Working Group was informed of the release of Mr. Tin 
Htay and Than Htun, who were the subject of Opinion No. 7/2008 (Myanmar).8  
</p><p>21. In connection with Opinion No. 37/2007 (Lebanon),9 the source informed the 
Working Group that Mr. Ahmad Abdel Aal and Mr. Mahmoud Abdel Aal were released on 
bail on 25 February 2009. The Working Group further notes in relation to this Opinion that 
in a decision dated 29 April 2009, a pretrial judge of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon 
ordered that General Jamil Al Sayed, General Ali El Haj, General Raymond Azar and 
General Moustapha Hamdane be released, unless they were being held on other grounds. 
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group was informed by the source that Mr. Zhang Honghai, whose 
detention was declared arbitrary in Opinion No. 32/2007 (China),10 was released on 12 
March 2009, however only after having served his prison term of eight years in full. 
</p>
<p>23. In connection with Opinion No. 3/2008 (United Arab Emirates)11 the Working 
Group was informed by the source that Mr. Abdullah Sultan Sabihat Al Alili was released 
on 8 May 2009 after 28 months of detention in Abu Dhabi.

<p>Mr. Youssef Mahmoud Chaabane (Opinion No. 10/2007, Lebanon)12 was released 
following a presidential pardon after more than 15 years in prison. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Communications giving rise to urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>25. During the period from 1 December 2008 to 15 November 2009, the Working Group 
transmitted 138 urgent appeals to 58 States (including the Palestinian National Authority) 
concerning 844 individuals (765 men, 50 women and 29 boys). In conformity with 
paragraphs 22 to 24 of its methods of work,13 the Working Group, without prejudging 
whether the detention was arbitrary, drew the attention of each of the States concerned to 
the specific case as reported, and appealed to them to take the necessary measures to ensure 
that the detained persons&#8217; right to life and to physical integrity were respected.  
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group emphasizes that the transmission of an urgent appeal to the 
concerned State on a humanitarian basis does not exclude the transmission of the same case 
pursuant to its regular procedure leading to the adoption of an Opinion. According to its 
methods of work, the two communications procedures are distinct, as in the former case the 
Working Group does not take a stance on the question as to whether or not the detention of 
the individual(s) concerned is arbitrary. Only in an Opinion does the Working Group take a 
definite decision on the case, declaring the detention arbitrary or not, or taking any other 
appropriate decision in accordance with paragraph 17 of its methods of work. Accordingly, 
States are requested to provide separate replies to each of the communications. 
</p>
<p>27. During the period under review, 138 urgent appeals were transmitted by the 
Working Group as follows.

two additional persons were freed. The Working Group wishes to thank those States that 
heeded its appeals and took steps to provide it with information on the situation of the 
persons concerned, especially the States that released those persons. In other cases, the 
Working Group was assured that the detainees concerned would be guaranteed a fair trial. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Reprisals in relation to Opinions and urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>29. On 23 February 2009, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group sent a 
joint urgent appeal to Uzbekistan regarding Mr. Erkin Musaev, whose detention had been 
declared arbitrary in Opinion No. 14/2008.14 It was alleged that he was threatened that, if he 
or his family did not withdraw their petitions or continued to make complaints to 
international human rights mechanisms or to spread news about the above decision, they 
would face reprisals. 
</p>
<p>30. On 29 May 2009, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group sent a joint 
urgent appeal to Iran concerning Ayatollah Sayed Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi. 
According to new information received by the Working Group, Ayatollah Boroujerdi wrote 
a letter to the Secretary-General requesting that international observers be sent to Iran, 
following which he was reportedly subjected to beatings. 
</p><p>31. On 21 July 2009, the Working Group received allegations that Tin Min Htut and U 
Nyi Pu were sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment under laws criminalizing the upsetting 
of public tranquillity and peace, following their organization of 92 other members of 
parliament to sign a letter to the Secretary-General and the Security Council that criticized 
the Government of Myanmar and the United Nations itself and which was published on the 
Internet. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country missions 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Request for visits 
</b></p>
<p>32. During 2009, the Working Group was invited to visit on official mission Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Malaysia. It has also received 
invitations to visit Georgia and the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>33. The Working Group has also made requests to visit Algeria, Argentina (a follow-up 
visit), Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea Bissau, India, Japan, Morocco, Nauru, Nicaragua (a follow-
up visit limited to Bluefields prison), Papua New Guinea, the Russian Federation, Saudi 
Arabia, Sierra Leone, Thailand, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

<p><b> 2. Follow-up to country visits 
</b></p>
<p>34. In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group decided in 1998 to 
address a follow-up letter to the Governments of the countries it visited, requesting 
information on such initiatives as the authorities might have taken to give effect to the 
relevant recommendations adopted by the Group contained in its country visit reports.15 
</p>
<p>35. During 2009, the Working Group requested information from the countries it had 
visited in 2007 and received information from the Governments of Norway and Equatorial 
Guinea. The Government of Angola requested an extension of the deadline for submitting 
its comments. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Norway 
</i>36. In a communication dated 17 November 2009, the Government of Norway provided 
information on the steps taken with a view to implementing the recommendations contained 
in paragraph 98 of the report of the Working Group on its mission to Norway (27 April&#8211;2 
May 2007)16 as follows. 
37. Recommendation (a): in 2008, the Government requested the Norwegian Police 
University College to undertake a survey on applications for remand, restrictions and 
complete or partial isolation during pretrial detention. The results will be available at the 
end of 2009.  
</p>
<p>38. Recommendation (b): the supervision of the Correctional Services was still under 
consideration. A White Paper was published in September 2008, in which the Government 
acknowledged that the present system is not fully satisfactory. In the meantime, most 
decisions by the Correctional Services can be challenged at the regional and central level, 
and before the Parliamentary Ombudsman. Certain administrative decisions can be 
reviewed by courts. 
</p>
<p>39. Recommendation (c): the Government submitted its full report, completed on 30 
April 2008, in Norwegian, with a summary in English to follow. The report is under 
consideration by the Ministry of Justice and the Police. 
</p>
<p>40. Recommendation (d): in spring 2008, the Government initiated a revision of the 
<i>infoflyt</i> database system with a view to proposing legal regulations as soon as possible. 
41. Recommendation (e): the Government has discussed the recommendation and 
decided to continue to make use of existing bodies such as the Supervisory Commission 
and the Parliamentary Ombudsman. It emphasized that there is ongoing cooperation 
between prison and health authorities in this respect. A committee was appointed in 
November 2008 to identify the need for special prison units for inmates with mental 
sufferings; the proposals of the committee were to be completed in November 2009. 
</p>
<p>42. With respect to the &#8220;waiting list&#8221; phenomenon, the Government stated that the 
number of convicts waiting to serve their prison sentences is now down to approximately 
</p><p>300. 
</p>
<p><i> (b)  Equatorial Guinea 
</i>43. In a communication dated 29 October 2009, the Government reported on the 
implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group in the report on its mission

<p>of 8 to 13 July 2007.17 It noted that, in order to protect freedom of opinion and expression, 
the registration of political parties, non-governmental organizations and other civil society 
organizations had been facilitated and the corresponding legal procedures simplified. A 
new Organic Law on the Judiciary was adopted by parliament in May 2009 to protect and 
improve its independence and to allow for the development of academic and professional 
competencies and skills to gain access to and obtain promotions within the judiciary. The 
Superior Council of the Judiciary had been strengthened. The Organic Law also established 
the institution of the &#8220;Judge on Execution of Sentences&#8221; to improve prison conditions and 
the legal situation of prisoners. A new Penal Code had been drafted, in conformity with the 
principles and norms enshrined in the Fundamental Law (Constitution). The Government 
had also decided to amend the Penal Procedure Code, the Military Penal Code and the 
Minors Act and to draft a new Law on the Constitutional Court. The publication of laws 
and decrees in the Official State Bulletin had been strengthened through the allocation of 
new national budget resources. 
</p>
<p>44. A new Institute of Judicial Practice had been established as an autonomous entity of 
public law to improve the training and skills of all those participating in the judicial 
process. The public prisons of Bata, Evinayong and Malabo had been rebuilt or refurbished 
and new central police stations in Bata and Malabo had been built. Detention centres for 
minors were being built in Evinayong and in the Riaba District. The national budget 
resources allocated to prisoners and detainees had increased in 2008&#8211;2009 by 700 per cent. 
Mr. Juan Ondo Abaga, whose detention and possible enforced disappearance had been 
considered by the Working Group, had been granted a presidential pardon and released. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Future country missions 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Working Group reiterates its concern in relation to the limitation on the number 
and length of the visits it is able to conduct each year. Two country visits per year, each 
limited to a maximum of eight working days, as in 2009, are insufficient for an adequate 
discharge of the mandate. The Working Group conducted three visits in 2004, two in 2005, 
four in 2006, three in 2007, and four in 2008. Country visits are of great importance to the 
victims of arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>46. To verify implementation of its recommendations, the Working Group should also 
be in a position to undertake follow-up visits. They are essential to the mandate, as they are 
the only means of assessing and monitoring in situ the situation of personal liberty in 
various countries. 
</p>
<p>47. The Working Group reiterates its call to the Human Rights Council to take into 
account the fact that it comprises five members. To best make use of its potential and 
enable it to discharge its mandate more effectively, the Human Rights Council is requested 
to provide additional funds for the Working Group to be able to conduct at least five 
country visits per year and relevant follow-up visits within an appropriate time frame. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Detention of drug users 
</b></p>
<p>48. At its fifty-fourth session, the Working Group decided to globally study in more 
detail the issue of detention of drug users. To prepare a more systematic thematic 
consideration of the issue, on 15 June 2009 it addressed a questionnaire to all Member 
States for response by 14 August 2009.

the Governments of Belarus, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Finland, Germany, Greece, 
Hungary, Iraq, Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Mauritius, Mexico, Montenegro, 
Oman, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Spain, 
Switzerland, Togo, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United States of America and 
Uzbekistan. The Working Group is grateful to these States for their cooperation. To obtain 
the broadest possible views and most comprehensive information, it decided during its 
fifty-sixth session to postpone consideration of this matter until 2010 and requests those 
States which have not yet responded to submit a response. 
</p>
<p><b>  Video and audio surveillance 
</b></p>
<p>50. In its previous annual report, the Working Group requested &#8220;States and other 
stakeholders to provide the Group with information and share their experiences regarding 
the installation of video and/or audio (recording) equipment in rooms where interrogations 
related to criminal investigations are conducted&#8221;.18 It renews its call upon States and other 
stakeholders to provide the Working Group with relevant information. 
</p>
<p><b>  Alternatives to detention 
</b></p>
<p>51. During its fifty-sixth session, the Working Group decided to focus on the issue of 
alternatives to detention, both in criminal law and in the administrative detention context, as 
one of its main priorities in 2010. It requests States and other stakeholders to provide it with 
information, including good practices that it could recommend to States to follow. 
</p>
<p><b>  Extension of mandate to cover all human rights of detained and imprisoned persons 
</b></p>
<p>52. In its previous annual report, the Working Group proposed to the Human Rights 
Council &#8220;to expand [its] mandate &#8230; so as to include the monitoring of State compliance 
with their obligations concerning all human rights of detained and imprisoned persons&#8221;.19 
For the reasons outlined in that report,20 and also in chapter II, section A, of this report, it 
reiterates its proposal. 
</p>
<p><b>  Revision of methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>53. To further enhance cooperation with States, the Working Group, during its fifty-
sixth session, decided to focus on a revision of its revised methods of work,21 both in terms 
of procedure and substance, and to share with Member States its newly revised methods of 
work. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Thematic considerations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Detention of immigrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p>54. In resolution 1997/50 the Commission on Human Rights clarified and extended the 
mandate of the Working Group to cover the issue of administrative custody of asylum-
seekers and immigrants. It has therefore since then devoted particular attention to the 
situation of detained migrants, identified challenges and best practices, explored ways to

<p>promote and protect their right not to be deprived arbitrarily of their liberty, and tried to 
advocate for remedies to redress their plight. All country mission reports contain a chapter 
on administrative immigration detention. Some of the fact-finding missions were 
exclusively focused on the issue of the detention of migrants and asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p>55. The experience made during its missions and the information received in 
communications from various stakeholders throughout the years prompted the Working 
Group to include more in-depth analysis of the issue of immigration detention in its annual 
reports covering the years 1998,22 2003,23 2005,24 and 2008.25 In 1999, it adopted its 
Deliberation No. 5 on human rights guarantees that asylum-seekers and immigrants in 
detention should enjoy.26 It has noted with concern during the period reported upon a 
development towards tightening restrictions, including deprivation of liberty, applied to 
asylum-seekers, refugees and immigrants in an irregular situation, even to the extent of 
making the irregular entry into a State a criminal offence or qualifying the irregular stay in 
the country as an aggravating circumstance for any criminal offence. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group has also publicly expressed its concern regarding a law-making 
initiative by a regional organization mainly comprising receiving countries, which would 
allow concerned States to detain immigrants in an irregular situation for a period of up to 
18 months pending removal. It would also permit the detention of unaccompanied children, 
victims of human trafficking, and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>57. Three Opinions, 45/2006,27 18/2004,28 and 34/1999,29 provided the Working Group 
with the opportunity to express itself specifically on whether or not the detention of the 
concerned migrant was arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>58. It considers that administrative detention as such of migrants in an irregular 
situation, that is to say migrants crossing the border of a country in an irregular manner or 
without proper documentation, or having overstayed a permit of stay, and hence being 
liable for removal, is not in contravention of international human rights instruments. The 
Working Group is fully aware of the sovereign right of States to regulate migration. 
However, it considers that immigration detention should gradually be abolished. Migrants 
in an irregular situation have not committed any crime. The criminalization of irregular 
migration exceeds the legitimate interests of States in protecting its territories and 
regulating irregular migration flows. 
</p>
<p>59. If there has to be administrative detention, the principle of proportionality requires it 
to be the last resort. Strict legal limitations must be observed and judicial safeguards be 
provided for. The reasons put forward by States to justify detention, such as the necessity of 
identification of the migrant in an irregular situation, the risk of absconding, or facilitating 
the expulsion of an irregular migrant who has been served with a removal order, must be 
clearly defined and exhaustively enumerated in legislation. The Working Group is 
concerned about recent developments in some States, which have undertaken 
criminalization efforts.

</p>
<p>60. The detention of minors, particularly of unaccompanied minors, requires even 
further justification. Given the availability of alternatives to detention, it is difficult to 
conceive of a situation in which the detention of an unaccompanied minor would comply 
with the requirements stipulated in article 37 (b), clause 2, of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, according to which detention can be used only as a measure of last resort. 
</p>
<p>61. Further guarantees include the fact that a maximum period of detention must be 
established by law and that upon expiry of this period the detainee must be automatically 
released. Detention must be ordered or approved by a judge and there should be automatic, 
regular and judicial, not only administrative, review of detention in each individual case. 
Review should extend to the lawfulness of detention and not merely to its reasonableness or 
other lower standards of review. The procedural guarantee of article 9 (4) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that migrant detainees enjoy 
the right to challenge the legality of their detention before a court. Established time limits 
for judicial review must be obtained in &#8220;emergency situations&#8221; when an exceptionally large 
number of undocumented immigrants enter the territory of a State. All detainees must be 
informed as to the reasons for their detention and their rights, including the right to 
challenge its legality, in a language they understand and must have access to lawyers. 
</p>
<p>62. These human rights and principles are not always guaranteed. The Working Group 
has visited countries on official mission where detention of migrants in an irregular 
situation is mandatory and automatic, without a necessity criteria being applied. It has 
observed that some national laws do not provide for detention to be ordered by a judge, or 
for judicial review of the detention order. Detainees often do not enjoy the right to 
challenge the legality of their detention. There is no maximum length of detention 
established by law, which leads to prolonged or, in the worst case, potentially indefinite 
detention in cases, for example, where the expulsion of a migrant cannot be carried out for 
legal or practical reasons. 
</p>
<p>63. This is a serious concern, as there are situations in which a removal order cannot be 
executed because, for example, the consular representation of the country of origin of the 
migrant does not cooperate or there is simply no means of transportation available to the 
home country. An example of a legal limitation for removal is the principle of non-
refoulement. In such cases, where the obstacle to the removal of the detained migrants does 
not lie within their sphere of responsibility, the detainee should be released to avoid 
potentially indefinite detention from occurring, which would be arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>64. The principle of proportionality requires that detention always has a legitimate aim, 
which would not exist if there were no longer a real and tangible prospect of removal. The 
Human Rights Committee has reasoned along very similar lines beginning with the case of 
<i>A. v. Australia</i>.30<b> </b>Opinion No. 45/200631 of the Working Group could serve as a reference 
for further details on the applicable legal concepts. 
</p>
<p>65. During country missions, the Working Group has sometimes witnessed unacceptable 
substandard conditions of detention in overcrowded facilities that affect the health, 
including the mental health, of irregular migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees, and 
increase the risk of a whole range of further violations of human rights, i.e. of economic, 
social and cultural rights. Alternatives to detention can take various forms: reporting at 
regular intervals to the authorities; release on bail; or stay in open centres or at a designated 
place. Such measures are already successfully applied in a number of countries. They must 
however not become alternatives to release.

<p><b> B. Military tribunals 
</b></p>
<p>66. It is not the first time that the Working Group observes that the right to justice is 
affected by military tribunals. It has already done so in its reports (E/CN.4/1994/27 (paras. 
29, 34 and 35); E/CN.4/1995/31 (para. 44); E/CN.4/1996/40 (para. 107); E/CN.4/1999/63 
(paras. 49, 79 and 80); E/CN.4/2001/14 (para. 36); E/CN.4/2004/3 (paras. 58, 59 and 67); 
A/HRC/4/40 (para. 6); and A/HRC/7/4 (paras. 63 to 66, 78 and 82)). In 2009, the Working 
Group once again found that the trial of civilians by military tribunals usually has an 
adverse effect on the enjoyment of the right to liberty of person, the right to a fair and, 
above all, prompt trial, the right to be brought before a judge without delay, to be released 
pending trial, to appeal against detention and to be tried in public by a legally established, 
independent, competent and impartial court, the right to a presumption of innocence, to 
equality of arms and to access to evidence, the right to a free and adequate defence, the 
right to be tried without delay, etc. 
</p>
<p>67. It is important to ensure that the terms of article 14 of the Covenant are not violated, 
either now or in the future. That the right to liberty of person embodied in article 9 of the 
Covenant is taken up together with the right to security of person is not a minor detail. The 
mere fact that a court which decides over a person&#8217;s liberty is in the hands of judicial 
authorities, one of whose most characteristic principles is obedience of superiors, clearly 
affects the right to security of person under article 9. 
</p>
<p>68. In the above-mentioned report contained in E/CN.4/1999/63, the Working Group 
was of the opinion that &#8220;if some form of military justice is to continue to exist, it should 
observe four rules: 
</p>
<p> (a) It should be incompetent to try civilians; 
 (b) It should be incompetent to try military personnel if the victims include 
civilians; 
</p>
<p> (c) It should be incompetent to try civilians and military personnel in the event 
of rebellion, sedition or any offence that jeopardizes or involves risk of jeopardizing a 
democratic regime; and 
</p>
<p> (d) It should be prohibited from imposing the death penalty under any 
circumstances.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>69. In general comments No. 13 on the administration of justice (para. 4) and No. 32 on 
the right to equality before courts and tribunals and to a fair trial (para. 22), the Human 
Rights Committee warned of the difficulties which military jurisdiction causes for the 
enjoyment of human rights and pointed out &#8220;that the trial of civilians in military or special 
courts may raise serious problems as far as the equitable, impartial and independent 
administration of justice is concerned. Therefore, it is important to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that such trials take place under conditions which genuinely afford the 
full guarantees stipulated in article 14. Trials of civilians by military or special courts 
should be exceptional, i.e. limited to cases where the State party can show that resorting to 
such trials is necessary and justified by objective and serious reasons, and where with 
regard to the specific class of individuals and offences at issue the regular civilian courts 
are unable to undertake the trials&#8221; (general comment No. 32, para. 22). 
</p><p>70. In general comment No. 8 on the right to liberty and security of persons, the Human 
Rights Committee describes a very frequent situation that is implicitly linked to detention 
ordered by military tribunals upon the entry into force of states of emergency: one of the 
common effects of states of emergency is that offences relating to public security are 
referred to military tribunals. Consequently, the Committee cautions that also if so-called 
preventive detention is used, for reasons of public security, it must be controlled by these </p>


<p><b>20</b> GE.10-10294 
</p>
<p>same provisions, i.e. it must not be arbitrary, and must be based on grounds and procedures 
established by law (para. 1), information of the reasons must be given (para. 2) and court 
control of the detention must be available (para. 4) as well as compensation in the case of a 
breach (para. 5). And if, in addition, criminal charges are brought in such cases, the full 
protection of article 9 (2) and (3), as well as article 14, must also be granted. 
</p><p>71. The former Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
sponsored an excellent study completed in 2005 with the report of the expert Emmanuel 
Decaux (E/CN.4/2006/58), which proposes 20 draft principles governing the administration 
of justice through military tribunals, of which No. 5 provides that &#8220;military courts should, 
in principle, have no jurisdiction to try civilians. In all circumstances, the State shall ensure 
that civilians accused of a criminal offence of any nature are tried by civilian courts&#8221;; 
Principle No. 8 adds that &#8220;the jurisdiction of military courts should be limited to offences of 
a strictly military nature committed by military personnel. Military courts may try persons 
treated as military personnel for infractions strictly related to their military status&#8221;; 
Principle No. 9 specifies that &#8220;in all circumstances, the jurisdiction of military courts should 
be set aside in favour of the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to conduct inquiries into 
serious human rights violations such as extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances 
and torture, and to prosecute and try persons accused of such crimes&#8221;; and No. 12 stresses 
that under the guarantee of habeas corpus, &#8220;in all circumstances, anyone who is deprived of 
his or her liberty shall be entitled to take proceedings, such as habeas corpus proceedings, 
before a court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his or 
her detention and order his or her release if the detention is not lawful. The right to petition 
for a writ of habeas corpus or other remedy should be considered as a personal right, the 
guarantee of which should, in all circumstances, fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
ordinary courts. In all circumstances, the judge must be able to have access to any place 
where the detainee may be held&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> C. States of emergency 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Working Group has found that whenever a State has declared a state of 
emergency arbitrarily or in a manner contrary to the provisions of article 4 of the Covenant, 
it has seriously affected the right to liberty of person and guarantees of a fair trial embodied 
in articles 7 to 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 2, paragraph 3, 
and articles 9, 10 and 14 of the Covenant. It has therefore informed the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council that the strengthening of public powers to the 
benefit of those who declare the state of emergency has negative repercussions. It has done 
so in its reports E/CN.4/1994/27 (paras. 60, 61 and 72); E/CN.4/1995/31 (paras. 38, 56 and 
57); E/CN.4/1996/40 (para. 124); A/HRC/4/40 (para. 6); and A/HRC/7/4 (paras. 40, 59, 61, 
63 to 69, 78 and 82). 
</p><p>73. The Working Group agrees with the Human Rights Committee that the restoration 
of a state of normalcy where full respect for the Covenant can again be secured must be the 
predominant objective of a State party derogating from the Covenant (general comment No. 
29 on derogations during a state of emergency, paragraph 1). It is the understanding of the 
Working Group that a declaration of a state of emergency (sometimes called state of siege, 
state of alert, martial law, etc.) must fulfil the following criteria: exceptional circumstances 
(it must not concern a structural situation, such as endemic poverty); legality (it must 
involve an emergency in a State based on the rule of law); duration (it may not be renewed 
indefinitely, as has been done in a number of cases which have come to the Group&#8217;s 
attention, in which it has been prolonged for 28 or even 46 consecutive years); seriousness 
(its sole purpose must be for dealing with an event which has placed the &#8220;life of the nation&#8221; 
at risk, and no other lesser circumstance); necessity (the situation which must be addressed 
cannot be corrected by other means); publicity (there are no de facto states of emergency, </p>


<p>GE.10-10294 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>because a formal declaration must be made to the population of the country and to all States 
parties through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, as required by article 40 of the 
Covenant); non-derogability of certain rights; non-discriminatory application; and 
compatibility with all the State party&#8217;s other international obligations, especially if acting to 
the contrary violates a norm of <i>jus cogens</i>. 
74. The Working Group points out that when States claim powers under a state of 
emergency as justification of a deprivation of liberty, they appear to be arbitrarily denying 
the right to judicial remedies set out in article 2, paragraph 3, and article 9, paragraph 4, of 
the Covenant. Although the right to judicial remedies is not formally mentioned in article 4 
as non-derogable, it must be considered to be &#8220;inherent in the Covenant as a whole&#8221;, as the 
Human Rights Committee maintains in general comment No. 29. 
</p>
<p>75. Based on the Working Group&#8217;s 17 years of practice, it can be concluded that there is 
a need for the Human Rights Council to monitor closely, through an early-warning system, 
the legality and above all the implementation of declarations of states of emergency, with 
regard to which recommendations will be formulated.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Administrative detention and habeas corpus 
</b></p>
<p>76. Habeas corpus is a legal procedure which is an undeniable right of all individuals 
and one of the most effective remedies against challenging arbitrary detention. Article 9 (4) 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights incorporates this right, namely 
the possibility to institute habeas corpus or similar proceedings, personally or on behalf of 
detained persons, challenging the lawfulness of detention before a court of law that is 
competent to order their release in the event that the detention is unlawful. 
</p>
<p>77. Administrative detention may be defined as arrest and detention of individuals by 
State authorities outside the criminal law context, for example for reasons of security, 
including terrorism, as a form of preventive detention, as well as to restrain irregular 
migrants. As is evident from communications sent to the Working Group and the missions 
conducted, a large number of States resort to administrative detention as a means to counter 
terrorism, control irregular migration or protect the ruling regime. The practice of 
administrative detention is informed by the belief that by detaining a person, a preventive 
action has been carried out thus securing society, community and State.  
</p>
<p>78. Since the inception of the Working Group it has recommended strengthening the 
institution of habeas corpus as a protective mechanism against arbitrary detention.32 The 
&#8220;Group regret[ted] that in many countries habeas corpus actions do not exist or have been 
suspended or are not readily available or relied on very little, since the sources very rarely 
indicate that this remedy has been applied for, although this step is required in the Working 
Group&#8217;s principles for the submission of cases.&#8221;33 It considered &#8220;&#8230; after three years&#8217; 
experience, that habeas corpus is one of the most effective means to combat the practice of 
arbitrary detention. As such, it should not be regarded as a mere element in the right to a 
fair trial but, in a country governed by the rule of law, as a personal right which cannot be 
derogated from even in a state of emergency.&#8221;34 
</p>
<p>79. Despite these exhortations regarding habeas corpus, the jurisprudence of the 
Working Group is full of Opinions where States have denied the right of habeas corpus, the

</p>
<p>detaining authorities have refused to obey a judicial release order, the proceedings are 
unduly delayed, the review is limited to mere technicalities, or States have suspended 
habeas corpus during periods of emergency.35 
</p>
<p>80. The Working Group notes that based on the communications received over the years 
as well as its missions, a weakened habeas corpus institution has led to a weaker challenge 
to the practice of arbitrary detention. Furthermore, administrative detention and a weak or 
non-existent habeas corpus facility appear to be correlated. States find it convenient to 
employ administrative detention as a means to control or manage migration within their 
territories. A robust challenge to this practice would be an increased use of the right of 
habeas corpus as required by article 9 (4) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Compliance and remedies 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Working Group promotes compliance with international human rights law and 
standards prohibiting and preventing arbitrary detention. It also promotes adequate redress 
when arbitrary detention has occurred, in terms of articles 2 (3) and 9 (4) and (5) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>82. Having established the arbitrariness of detention in its Opinion, the Working Group 
requests the Government to take the necessary steps to remedy the situation and to bring it 
into conformity with the standards and principles of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. When a case falls 
within category I and/or II of the categories applicable to the consideration of cases 
submitted to it, the necessary steps to be taken to remedy the situation is typically the 
immediate release of the detained person, and the Working Group in that case states this 
explicitly. Such remedy follows from the generally recognized principle of restitution <i>ad 
integrum</i>, requiring the immediate restoration of the physical liberty of the arbitrarily 
detained person. It is also reflected in article 9 (4) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, which requires that a court must be empowered to order the release of 
an unlawfully detained person.  
</p>
<p>83. For such remedy to be effective, as required by article 2 (3) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, detaining States are under an obligation to release 
the arbitrarily detained (foreign) detainee into their own territory even if they wish to deport 
the (foreign) detainee, but where deportation of the detainee otherwise liable for removal to 
the country of origin or to a third country accepting the detainee is not promptly possible. 
This could occur, e.g., if a removal would violate the principle of non-refoulement or if it is 
not possible for any other legal or factual reasons. Otherwise the international human rights 
obligation for immediate restoration of the liberty of the arbitrarily detained person would 
be undermined. 
</p>
<p>84. When the Working Group finds in its Opinion that the detention of the concerned 
individual exclusively falls within category III as gravely violating the right to fair trial, the 
appropriate remedy might take different forms to that of the immediate release of the 
arbitrarily detained person. For example, affording the detainee a retrial that meets all fair

<p>trial guarantees as contained in article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
articles 9 (3) and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. However, 
given the gravity of the violation of fair trial guarantees, which is a condition for the 
Working Group to declare the detention to be arbitrary, and the time that the individual 
concerned has already spent in (pretrial) detention, conditional release, release on bail, or 
other forms of release pending trial would also typically be the appropriate remedy. 
</p>
<p>85. In its Opinions, the Working Group encourages States which have not ratified the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to do so. When it may wish to restate 
or develop its jurisprudence on a matter of importance or on a point of law, or call on the 
States to amend their national legislation or to change their practices to bring them into 
conformity with its international human rights obligations, it may, under exceptional 
circumstances, render an Opinion even though the person has been released. In any given 
case, the Working Group may remind States of their obligation in terms of article 9 (5) of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to provide compensation to the 
released person. 
</p>
<p>86. The Working Group has begun to make more frequent and express references to its 
own jurisprudence, and to that of international, regional and national human rights bodies 
and courts. Conversely, the Working Group welcomes the fact that the findings and 
recommendations, contained in its reports and Opinions are increasingly made use of by 
other United Nations human rights bodies and national and regional human rights courts. 
When national courts are determining the extent of international law obligations which 
often have a direct or indirect effect on matters before them, the reports and Opinions of the 
Working Group may also be of assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b>87. <b>The Working Group, in the fulfilment of its mandate, welcomes the cooperation 
it has received from States concerning cases brought to their attention. </b> 
</p>
<p>88. <b>The Working Group considers that country and follow-up visits are of the 
utmost importance and requests the support of Member States in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The transmission of an urgent appeal does not exclude the transmission of the 
same case to the concerned State pursuant to the regular complaints procedure of the 
Working Group leading to the adoption of an Opinion, and it calls on States to 
provide it with separate replies to each of its communications. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Working Group has decided to devote particular attention in 2010 to the 
issues of video and audio surveillance in interrogation rooms, alternatives to 
detention, a revision of its methods of work, and the detention of drug users. It thanks 
States which have</b> <b>responded to its questionnaire on the detention of drug users and 
requests others to do so. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>With respect to the detention of migrants in an irregular situation, the Working 
Group again notes that their human rights are not always guaranteed. In some States 
detention of migrants in an irregular situation is mandatory and automatic without a 
necessity criteria being applied. National laws do not provide for detention to be 
ordered by a judge or for judicial review of the detention order. Detainees often do 
not enjoy the right to challenge the legality of their detention. There is no maximum 
length of detention established by law, which leads to prolonged or, in the worst case, 
potentially indefinite detention. In cases where the legal or practical obstacles for the 
removal of the detained migrants do not lie within their sphere of responsibility, the 
detainees should be released to avoid potentially indefinite detention from occurring, </b></p>


<p><b>24</b> GE.10-10294 
</p>
<p><b>which would be arbitrary. The principle of proportionality requires that detention has 
a legitimate aim, which would not exist if there were no longer a real and tangible 
prospect of removal. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The use of habeas corpus, the strengthening of which the Working Group has 
recommended since its inception, is, contrary to article 9 (4) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, still weak or non-existent in some States, 
particularly with respect to administrative detention. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The immediate release of a person arbitrarily detained is typically the 
appropriate remedy, not only if the detention is arbitrary in terms of categories I and 
II as being manifestly devoid of any legal basis or resulting from the exercise of 
certain human rights, but also in terms of category III, given the grave nature of 
violations of the right to fair trial established by the Working Group when applying 
category III. For such remedy to be effective as required by article 2 (3) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, release requires the release of 
the (foreign) detainees arbitrarily deprived of their liberty into the territory of the 
detaining State.  
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>To enable the Working Group to report more systematically and 
comprehensively it reiterates its proposal to the Human Rights Council to expand the 
mandate of the Working Group to include the examination of conditions of detention 
around the world and the monitoring of State compliance with their obligations 
concerning all human rights of detained and imprisoned persons.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>In view of an increase in information received on reprisals suffered by 
individuals subject to urgent appeals or Opinions, States are urged to cease any such 
practice. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>States should take into account the findings and principles contained in the 
present report regarding the detention of migrants in an irregular situation, 
administrative detention and habeas corpus, and compliance with international 
human rights norms and standards preventing and prohibiting arbitrary detention, as 
well as appropriate remedies. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Human Rights Council should consider the adoption of the draft principles 
on the administration of justice through military tribunals (E/CN.4/2006/58) prepared 
by the former Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. 
Such principles are essential to prevent the abuses which the Working Group has 
been denouncing for some time. Without prejudice to the above, the Working Group 
proposes that such principles should be supplemented by withdrawing the trial of 
civilians and soldiers from the competence of military courts in cases of rebellion, 
sedition or any other offence which endangers or might endanger the stability of a 
democratic system.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Working Group recommends that, as soon as it is informed of a 
declaration of a state of emergency or a State invokes an emergency situation, the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights should entrust 
one or more special procedures mandate holders to conduct an emergency mission to 
verify on the ground whether the state of emergency meets the criteria of exceptional 
circumstances, legality, duration, seriousness, necessity, publicity (or declaration), 
non-derogability, non-discriminatory application and compatibility with all the 
State&#8217;s other international obligations. </b></p>


<p>GE.10-10294 <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Working Group asks the Human Rights Council to study in depth the 
relation between the right to liberty of person and the right to security of person. The 
right to security of person is a human right of the greatest importance for which the 
requisite jurisprudence has not been developed.
