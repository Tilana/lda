Cenovus has strong second-quarter operational performance
Oil sands production increases, operating costs decline
Calgary,  Alberta  (July  28,  2016)  –  Cenovus  Energy  Inc.  (TSX:  CVE)  (NYSE:  CVE)  continued  to  deliver 
strong and reliable operating performance in the second quarter of 2016. The company remains on track with 
its plans to bring on two new oil sands expansion phases and achieve up to $500 million in capital, operating 
and general and administrative (G&A) cost reductions compared with its original 2016 budget. 
 
“We’ve achieved significant sustainable improvements in our cost structure over the last year and a half, and 
we’ll remain vigilant on costs to maximize our competitive position in this challenging and volatile commodity 
price environment,” said Brian Ferguson, Cenovus President & Chief Executive Officer. “Our reduced cost base 
and  strong  operational  performance,  coupled  with  an  improvement  in  benchmark  oil  and  natural  gas  prices 
from the lows reached earlier this year, contributed to a solid second quarter.”
Key developments 
  Decreased per-barrel oil sands operating costs by 24% and per-barrel conventional crude oil operating costs
by 9% compared with the second quarter of 2015
  Achieved production at Foster Creek of almost 69,000 barrels per day (bbls/d) net in June. Second-quarter

Overview
Cenovus’s  strong  operational  performance  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  included  a  9% 
increase  in  combined  oil  sands  production  and  a  24%  decrease  in  per-barrel  oil  sands 
operating  costs  compared  with  the  same  quarter  of  2015.  The  company’s  year-over-year 
financial  performance  was  negatively  impacted  by  the  significant  decline  in  crude  oil  and 
natural  gas  prices  from  the  previous  year’s  quarter.  However,  an  increase  in  crude  oil  and 
natural  gas  prices  from  the  multi-year  lows  reached  in  the  first  three  months  of  2016 
contributed to improved cash flow compared with the first quarter of this year. 
  
Oil production 
Production at Cenovus’s Foster Creek oil sands project averaged approximately 65,000 bbls/d 
net  in  the  second  quarter,  11%  higher  than  in  the  same  period  a  year  earlier  when  a 
precautionary shutdown due to nearby forest fire activity reduced volumes by approximately 
10,500 bbls/d net. Operations at Foster Creek have not been affected by forest fire activity in 
2016. June production averaged just under 69,000 bbls/d net as Cenovus continued to ramp 
up new sustaining well pads at Foster Creek and brought a number of wells that were down for 
servicing  back  online,  as  planned.  At  the  end  of  June,  the  company  had  commissioned  the 
majority  of  the  facilities  for  its  Foster  Creek  expansion  phase  G,  which  is  on  track  to  be 
completed and add incremental oil volumes in the third quarter, with ramp-up expected over 
an  18-month  period.  Cenovus  continues  to  anticipate  exiting  2016  with  Foster  Creek 
production above 70,000 bbls/d net.  
 
Production at Christina Lake averaged approximately 78,000 bbls/d net in the second quarter, 
an  8%  increase  from  the  same  period  a  year  earlier.  The  increase  was  largely  due  to  the 
completion of the Christina Lake optimization project in late 2015 and the reliable performance 
of  the  operation’s  facilities.  Christina  Lake  phase  F  remains  on  track  for  first  oil  in  the  third 
quarter  and  is  expected  to  ramp  up  over  a  12-month  period.  During  the  second  quarter, 
Cenovus  successfully  commissioned  its  100  megawatt  Christina  Lake  cogeneration  power 
plant,  with  full  ramp-up  expected  in  the  third  quarter.  The  company  is  spending  a  small 
amount  of  capital  to  complete  detailed  engineering  on  Christina  Lake  phase  G  and  is  in  the 
process of rebidding work on the project. Cenovus expects to provide more information at the 
time  of  its  2017  budget  announcement  in  December  about  the  potential  to  restart  phase  G, 
which was put on hold in late 2014 due to the decline in oil prices.  
 
“Given  the  strength  of  our  balance  sheet  and  financial  position  as  well  as  our  high  level  of 
confidence that the cost reductions we’ve achieved will be largely sustainable, I’m optimistic 
about the potential to resume construction on some of our deferred projects,” said Ferguson. 
“However,  we  still  need  additional  clarity  on  federal  fiscal  and  regulatory  policies  that  could 
impact our operating environment.”  
 
In the second quarter, Cenovus undertook precautionary staff evacuations at its Christina Lake 
and Pelican Lake operations due to nearby forest fire activity. While non-essential personnel at 
Christina  Lake  were  sent  home  for  several  days  in  May  due  to  heightened  forest  fire  risk, 
essential staff remained at site and safely continued full production. In June, a forest fire near 
Pelican  Lake  prompted  the  orderly  shutdown  and  precautionary  evacuation  of  all  personnel 
from site for two days. Operations and staffing were restored to normal levels in a safe and 
timely manner.
“I’m extremely pleased with the composure and professionalism our teams have displayed in 
carrying out these precautionary measures to protect our people and operations this wildfire 
season,” said Kieron McFadyen, Cenovus Executive Vice-President & President, Upstream Oil & 
Gas. “Fortunately, everyone has remained safe, and our infrastructure has not been impacted 
by forest fires. Our thoughts go out to everyone who was affected by the fire that devastated 
Fort McMurray this spring.”  
  
Cost reductions 
Cenovus remains on track with its target to reduce capital, operating and G&A costs by up to 
$500  million  this  year  compared  with  its  original  2016  budget.  The  company  expects  about 
two-thirds  of  its  realized  cost  reductions  achieved  since  the  end  of  2014  will  be  sustainable 
even in a higher commodity price environment.  
 
“I want to acknowledge the hard work of everyone at Cenovus in finding ways to reduce costs 
over the last year and a half,” said Ferguson. “This has made us stronger and more financially 
resilient, and we’ll continue to look for further efficiencies in the months ahead.” 
 
Per-barrel operating costs continued to decline in the second quarter, compared with the same 
period  in  2015,  including  a  24%  reduction  in  combined  oil  sands  operating  costs  to 
$8.06 per barrel (bbl). Oil sands non-fuel operating costs fell by 19% to $6.54/bbl primarily as 
a  result  of  higher  production  volumes,  better  prioritization  of  repairs  and  maintenance  and 
improved well pump performance. During the second quarter, Christina Lake recorded a larger 
credit under Alberta’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations than in the second quarter of last 
year, which also helped to reduce operating costs. 
 
As previously announced, Cenovus completed its planned workforce reduction program in the 
second  quarter,  bringing  total  staff  reductions  since  the  end  of  2014  to  31%.  In  the  second 
quarter,  Cenovus  recorded  severance  costs  of  approximately  $19  million  related  to  its  2016 
workforce reductions. 
 
Financial performance 
The year-over-year decline in West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Western Canadian Select (WCS) 
and  AECO  natural  gas  prices  of  21%,  30%  and  53%,  respectively,  as  well  as  a  decline  in 
average market crack spreads contributed to a decrease in second-quarter operating cash flow 
to  $541  million,  42%  lower  than  in  the  same  period  of  2015.  Upstream  operating  cash  flow 
was down 45% to $348 million.  
 
The  company’s  refining  and  marketing  business  had  strong  operating  performance  in  the 
second  quarter,  with  operating  cash  flow  of  $193  million.  This  represents  a  $216  million 
improvement from the first quarter of the year, primarily driven by a recovery in market crack 
spreads  and  better  utilization  rates.  Year  over  year,  operating  cash  flow  from  refining  and 
marketing  was  down  36%  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016,  primarily  due  to  lower  average 
market crack spreads driven by higher storage levels for refined product and a 75% narrowing 
of the Brent-WTI price differential.  
 
Cenovus ended the second quarter of 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately 
$3.8 billion. Including $4.0 billion in undrawn capacity under its committed credit facility, the
company  has  nearly  $8  billion  in  liquidity  available,  with  no  debt  maturing  until  the  fourth 
quarter  of  2019.  At  the  end  of  the  second  quarter,  the  company’s  net  debt  to  capitalization 
was  17%  compared  with  28%  at  the  end  of  the  second  quarter  of  2015.  Its  net  debt  to 
adjusted  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation  and  amortization  (EBITDA)  was 
1.9   times  on  a  trailing  12-month  basis,  compared  with  1.5  times  at  the  end  of  the  same 
period a year ago. 
 
Cenovus has an active hedging program and will evaluate additional hedging opportunities for 
2017 and 2018 to help maintain its financial resilience.  
 
Guidance update  
Cenovus  has  updated  its  2016  full-year  guidance  to  reflect  actual  results  for  the  first  six 
months  of  the  year  and  the  company’s  estimates  for  the  second  half  of  2016.  The  revisions 
primarily reflect expectations for continued improvement in company-wide operating costs and 
lower  anticipated  capital  spending  at  Cenovus’s  oil  sands  business.  Updated  guidance  is 
available at cenovus.com under “Investors.”
Second quarter details
Oil sands 
 
Foster Creek
  Production averaged 64,544 bbls/d net in the second quarter of 2016, an 11% increase
from the same period of 2015.
  Operating  costs  at  Foster  Creek  declined  24%  to  $10.15/bbl  in  the  quarter.  Non-fuel
operating costs were $8.51/bbl, a 19% drop from a year earlier.
  The steam to oil ratio (SOR), the amount of steam needed to produce one barrel of oil, 
was 2.9 for the second quarter compared with 2.3 in the same period of 2015. The SOR 
is expected to decrease as new well pads come online later this year.
  Netbacks,  including  realized  hedging  gains,  were  $13.46/bbl  for  the  quarter,  a  45%
decrease from the same quarter of 2015.
Christina Lake
  Production averaged 78,060 bbls/d net in the second quarter of 2016, an 8% increase
from the same period a year earlier.
  Operating  costs  were  $6.35/bbl  in  the  quarter,  a  decline  of  23%  from  a  year  earlier.
Non-fuel operating costs were $4.93/bbl, 18% lower than in the same period in 2015.
  The SOR was 1.8 during the second quarter compared with 1.7 a year earlier. 
  Netbacks, including realized hedging gains, were $18.74/bbl in the quarter, down 42%
from the same period in 2015.
Conventional oil
  Total conventional oil production decreased 20% to 55,476 bbls/d in the second quarter 
of 2016 compared with the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to natural reservoir 
declines  and  the  2015  sale  of  Cenovus’s  royalty  and  fee  land  business.  The  divested 
assets  contributed  an  average  of  4,300  bbls/d  of  production  in  the  second  quarter 
of 2015.
  Operating costs were $14.00/bbl in the quarter, 9% lower than in the second quarter of 
2015,  primarily  due  to  lower  repairs  and  maintenance,  chemical,  electricity  and 
workforce costs.
Natural gas
  Natural gas production averaged 399 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) in the second 
quarter  of  2016,  down  11%  from  the  same  period  a  year  earlier,  primarily  due  to 
expected  natural  declines  and  the  company’s  2015  sale  of  its  royalty  and  fee  land 
business.
  Operating costs fell 7% to $1.06 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in the quarter compared
with the same period a year earlier.
Downstream
  Cenovus’s Wood River Refinery in Illinois and Borger Refinery in Texas, which are jointly 
owned with the operator, Phillips 66, continued to have strong operational performance 
in the second quarter of 2016, including:
o  processing  a  combined  average  of  458,000  bbls/d  gross  of  crude  oil 
(100% utilization)  compared  with  441,000  bbls/d  gross  in  the  same  period  in 
2015 (96% utilization)
o  producing  a  combined  average  of  483,000  bbls/d  gross  of  refined  products
compared with 462,000 bbls/d gross a year earlier.
  Cenovus  had  operating  cash  flow  of  $193  million  from  refining  and  marketing  in  the 
quarter  compared  with  $300  million  in  the  second  quarter  of  2015.  The  company’s 
refining  operating  cash  flow  is  calculated  on  a  first-in,  first-out  (FIFO)  inventory 
accounting  basis. Using  the  last-in,  first-out  (LIFO)  accounting method  employed  by 
most  U.S.  refiners,  Cenovus’s  operating  cash  flow  from  refining  and  marketing  would 
have been $107 million lower in the second quarter of 2016. In the second quarter of 
2015,  operating  cash  flow  would  have  been  $101  million  lower  on  a  LIFO 
reporting basis.
Financial 
 
Corporate and financial information

  Operating cash flow was $541 million in the second quarter, down 42% from the same 
period a year earlier, largely due to lower oil and natural gas prices and sales volumes 
as  well  as  reduced  operating  cash  flow  from  refining  and  marketing,  primarily  due  to 
lower market crack spreads.   
In  the  second  quarter  of  2016,  Cenovus  had  capital  spending  of  approximately 
$236 million,  down  34%  from  a  year  earlier,  with  the  bulk  of  the  investment  going 
towards the company’s oil sands operations. Capital investment in Cenovus’s oil sands 
crude  oil  operations  was  $138  million,  47%  lower  than  in  the  same  period  of  2015. 
Investment in conventional oil was $32 million in the second quarter, 6% lower than in 
the same quarter in 2015, while refining and marketing investment was $53 million, a 
10% increase, due in part to the debottlenecking project at the Wood River Refinery. 
Capital investment in natural gas was $3 million in the second quarter, compared with 
$2 million in the year-earlier period.
  For the quarter, operating cash flow in excess of capital invested was $74 million from 
Cenovus’s  conventional  oil  business  and  $7  million  from  natural  gas.  Operating  cash
flow  from  refining  and  marketing  exceeded  capital  investment  by  $140  million,  while 
operating cash flow from the company’s oil sands crude oil operations exceeded capital 
spending by $94 million.
  After investing approximately $236 million during the second quarter, Cenovus had free 
cash  flow  of  $204  million  compared  with  free  cash  flow  of  $120  million  in  the  same 
period a year earlier.
  Net  loss  was  $267  million  in  the  second  quarter  compared  with  net  income  of 
$126 million  in  the  same  period  of  2015.  The  loss  was  primarily  due  to  a  decline  in 
operating  earnings,  unrealized  risk  management  losses  of  $284  million  in  the  second 
quarter of 2016 compared with unrealized losses of $151 million in the second quarter 
of 2015, and non-operating unrealized foreign exchange losses of $18 million compared 
with unrealized gains of $99 million in the year-earlier period.
  G&A expenses were $94 million in the quarter, 22% higher than in the same period of 
2015.  The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  recorded  severance  costs  of  approximately 
$19 million  and  a  non-cash  expense  of  $17  million  related  to  office  building  leases  in 
Calgary in excess of Cenovus’s current and near-term requirements.
  At June 30, 2016, the company’s net debt to capitalization was 17% and net debt to 
adjusted EBITDA was 1.9 times. The debt to capitalization ratio was 34% and debt to 
adjusted EBITDA was 4.8 times. Over the long term, Cenovus continues to target a debt 
to  capitalization  ratio  of  between  30%  and  40%  and  debt  to  adjusted  EBITDA  of 
between 1.0 and 2.0 times. The company expects these ratios may be outside of the 
target ranges at different points in the economic cycle.
  The  Board  of  Directors  has  declared  a  third-quarter  dividend  of  $0.05  per  share, 
payable  on  September  30,  2016  to  common  shareholders  of  record  as  of 
September 15, 2016.  Based  on  the  July  27,  2016  closing  share  price  on  the  Toronto 
Stock  Exchange  of  $17.50,  this  represents  an  annualized  yield  of  about  1.1%. 
Declaration  of  dividends  is  at  the  sole  discretion  of  the  Board  and  will  continue  to  be 
evaluated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Over  the  long  term,  Cenovus  intends  to  target  a 
meaningful dividend that is sustainable when prices are at the bottom of the commodity 
cycle.  Increases  in  the  dividend  would  be  considered  with  sustained  improvements  in 
the company’s margins and production base.
Commodity price hedging
  Since the release of its first quarter earnings statement on April 27, 2016, Cenovus has
added the following hedges for the period 2016 through 2018:
  As of today, the company has approximately 32% of its oil production hedged for the

remainder of 2016 at a volume-weighted average floor price of C$63.38/bbl. 
In  the  second  quarter  of  2016,  Cenovus  had  realized  after-tax  hedging  losses  of 
$5 million as the company’s contract prices trailed average benchmark prices. Cenovus 
had unrealized after-tax hedging losses of $207 million during the quarter.


Including  hedging,  market  access  commitments  and  downstream  integration  largely 
provided by the company’s two U.S. refineries, Cenovus has positioned itself to mitigate 
the  impact  of  swings  in  the  Canadian  light-heavy  oil  price  differential  for  more  than 
85% of its anticipated 2016 heavy oil production. Together, these mechanisms help to 
support Cenovus’s financial resilience during this challenging period for the industry.
Other developments
  Across  Cenovus’s  operations,  staff  successfully  demonstrated  their  commitment  to 
safety by achieving more than 50 days without a recordable injury during the second 
quarter, the first time the company reached this milestone. 
In  the  second  quarter,  Corporate  Knights  magazine  named  Cenovus  as  one  of  the 
50 Best  Corporate  Citizens  in  Canada  for  2015,  the  fourth  consecutive  year  the 
company has been included in the listing.

Crude  oil production from  our  Conventional  business segment  continues  to  generate dependable  near-term  cash 
flow.  This  production  provides  diversification  to  our  revenue  stream  and  enables  further  development  of  our  oil 
sands assets. Our natural gas production acts as an economic hedge for the natural gas required as a fuel source 
at both our oil sands and refining operations and provides cash flow to help fund our growth opportunities.

Refining and Marketing 
Our  operations  include  two  refineries  located  in  Illinois  and  Texas  that  are  jointly  owned  with  and  operated  by 
Phillips 66, an unrelated U.S. public company. The gross crude oil capacity of the Wood River and Borger refineries 
is approximately 314,000 barrels per day and 146,000 barrels per day, respectively. Our refining operations allow 
us to capture the value from crude oil production through to refined products, such as diesel, gasoline and jet fuel, 
to  partially  mitigate  volatility  associated  with  regional  North  American  light/heavy  crude  oil  price  differential 
fluctuations. This segment also includes our crude-by-rail terminal operations, located in Bruderheim, Alberta, and 
the  marketing  of  third-party  purchases  and  sales  of  product  undertaken  to  provide  operational  flexibility  for 
transportation commitments, product quality, delivery points and customer diversification.

QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS
In  the  second  quarter,  crude  oil  prices  continued  to  be  volatile  with  West  Texas  Intermediate  (“WTI”)  reaching 
US$50 per barrel for the first time in almost a year. While crude oil prices improved from the first quarter of 2016, 
our companywide netback in the first half of 2016 was $5.84 per BOE, before realized risk management activities, 
which remains significantly lower than in prior years. As a result, we continue to focus on maintaining our financial 
resilience and safe and reliable operations. We are on track to reduce our planned 2016 capital, operating, general 
and administrative spending by approximately $500 million, relative to our original budget released in December 
2015.  Our  ongoing  efforts  to  reduce  costs  have  helped  our  balance  sheet  remain  strong,  with  approximately 
$3.8 billion of cash on hand at June 30, 2016. 
Consistent  with  the  improvement  in  crude  oil  benchmark  prices,  our  average  realized  crude  oil  price  more  than 
doubled  from  the  first  quarter  of  2016  to  $33.87  per  barrel  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016.  However,  this  was 
32 percent lower than our average realized price in the second quarter of 2015.  
In the second quarter, we: 
  Decreased our total crude oil operating costs by 22 percent or $48 million, compared with 2015;  

Realized  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  netbacks,  before  risk  management  gains,  of  $15.48  per  barrel  (2015  – 
$28.76 per barrel) and $0.30 per Mcf (2015 – $1.53 per Mcf), respectively; 
Achieved  Cash  Flow  of  $440  million,  a  significant  increase  from  the  first  quarter  of  2016  primarily  due  to 
higher commodity prices; 
Incurred  Operating  Losses  of  $39  million  or  $1.65  per  barrel  of  crude  oil  equivalent  sold  compared  with 
Operating Earnings of $151 million or $6.11 per barrel of crude oil equivalent in the second quarter of 2015;  
Implemented  workforce  reductions  identified  in  the  first  quarter,  which  resulted  in  an  11  percent  reduction 
from our workforce at December 31, 2015; and 
Continued to progress our two oil sands expansion phases which is expected to add 80,000 gross barrels per 
day of production capacity.

OPERATING RESULTS
Total crude oil production declined in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as higher production from our 
Oil Sands segment was more than offset by lower production from our Conventional properties.

Production at Foster Creek was higher in the second quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to a nearby 
forest fire reducing production by approximately 10,500 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015. Production 
in the second quarter of 2016 benefited from new wells brought online in the second quarter. Production in the first 
half of the year was slightly lower than in 2015. Production in the first quarter of 2016 was impacted by a higher 
than  average  number  of  wells  down  for  servicing,  which  have  since  been  brought  back  online,  and  improved 
wellbore conformance during 2015 that accelerated production from more mature wells.  
Production from Christina Lake increased in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 due to additional wells 
and reliable performance of our facilities. 
We successfully drilled four extended-reach horizontal wells at Foster Creek. The wells had an average horizontal 
length  of  over  1,600  meters.  Longer  horizontal  wells  can  access  a  greater  portion  of  the  reservoir,  potentially 
reducing development costs.  
Thanks  to  the  continued  focus  and  safety  leadership  of  teams  working  at  our  upstream  and  downstream 
operations, we operated for over 50 days without a recordable injury. This is the first time Cenovus has reached 
this milestone, demonstrating the commitment of our staff to working safely.  
 
Our Conventional crude oil production decreased by 20 percent in the second quarter and 19 percent on a year-to-
date basis due to expected natural declines and the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business 
in July 2015. Divested assets contributed an average of 4,300 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015 and 
4,500 barrels per day on a year-to-date basis. In addition, production at Pelican Lake was shut-down for two days 
as a safety precaution due to a nearby forest fire; there was no damage to our facilities. Lost production has been 
estimated at approximately 650 barrels per day for the quarter.

The  crude  oil  price  and  transportation  and  blending  costs  exclude  the  cost  of  purchased  condensate  which  is  blended  with  the  heavy  oil.  On  a 
per-barrel  of  unblended  crude  oil  basis,  the  cost  of  condensate  was  $19.76  per  barrel  for  the  second  quarter  (2015  –  $22.58  per  barrel)  and 
$19.91 per barrel for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (2015 – $22.43 per barrel). 
Employee long-term incentive costs in prior periods were reclassified from operating expenses to general and administrative costs to conform to the 
presentation adopted for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
The netbacks do not reflect non-cash write-downs of product inventory.
Consistent with the decline in benchmark prices and widening heavy oil differentials, our average crude oil netback 
in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, excluding realized risk management gains and losses, decreased 
compared with 2015. Our realized bitumen price is influenced by the cost of condensate used in blending. As the 
cost  of  condensate  increases  relative  to  the  price  of  blended  crude  oil,  our  realized  bitumen  price  declines.  In 
addition, our cost for condensate is generally higher than benchmark due to transportation between market hubs 
and field locations, partially offset by the impact of inventory timing in a rising price environment. In the second 
quarter we experienced some of the benefit of using condensate purchased at a lower price earlier in the year.  
The weakening of the Canadian dollar on a year-to-date basis, compared with 2015, had a positive impact on our 
crude oil price of approximately $1.77 per barrel.  
In  2016,  our  average  natural  gas  netback,  excluding  realized  risk  management  gains  and  losses,  decreased 
primarily due to lower sales prices, consistent with the decline in the AECO benchmark price.
Refining  
In the second quarter, crude utilization increased due to consistent performance of both the Wood River and Borger 
refineries.  In  the  second  quarter  of  2015,  unplanned  outages  at  our  Borger  refinery  resulted  from  process  unit 
outages and a power interruption. 
On  a  year-to-date  basis,  crude  utilization  increased.  Consistent  performance  in  the  current  quarter  was  slightly 
offset by planned and unplanned maintenance at our Wood River and Borger refineries in the first quarter of 2016. 
In the first half of 2015, we experienced unplanned outages and completed a planned turnaround at the Borger 
refinery.

Operating  Cash  Flow  from  Refining  and  Marketing  in  the  three  and  six  months  ending  June  30,  2016  was 
$193 million and $170 million, respectively. Operating Cash Flow was lower compared with 2015 primarily due to 
lower  average  market  crack  spreads  and  higher  operating  costs,  partially  offset  by  higher  utilization  rates, 
improved margins on the sale of secondary products, weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar 
and widening heavy and medium crude oil differentials.

Crude Oil Benchmarks 
The  average  Brent,  WTI  and  WCS  benchmark  prices  improved  from  the  first  quarter  of  2016  due  to  significant 
supply  disruptions  and  strong  demand.  Although  benchmark  prices  strengthened,  crude  oil  prices  remained 
approximately 26 percent lower than in the second quarter of 2015 due to excessive inventories. High inventory 
levels  have  been  driven  by  the  decision  of  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (“OPEC”)  to 
discontinue its role as the swing supplier of crude oil in response to U.S. production growth.  
The global imbalance of crude oil supply and demand improved in the second quarter of 2016. Reductions in capital 
spending  resulted  in  lower  U.S.  production  compared  with  2015.  Prices  also  benefited  from  temporary  supply 
disruptions  in  Canada  and  Nigeria,  which  offset  strong  production  from  Saudi  Arabia  and  Iran.  Demand  growth 
remains  positive  due  to  higher  than  expected  increases  from  the  U.S.,  Europe  and  India.  However,  numerous 
concerns  may  limit  near-term  crude  oil  price  increases.  The  risk  of  instability  in  the  European  Union,  economic 
uncertainty in China, the resolution of supply outages or a resurgence in U.S. supply as producers quickly look to 
capitalize  on  any  price  rally,  in  combination  with  high  inventory  levels,  are  likely  to  discourage  higher  crude  oil 
prices. 
WTI is an important benchmark for Canadian crude oil since it reflects inland North American crude oil prices and 
its Canadian dollar equivalent is the basis for determining royalties for a number of our crude oil properties. The 
average Brent-WTI differential narrowed compared with the second quarter of 2015 and on a year-to-date basis as 
a result of declining U.S. supply and the lifting of the U.S. export ban.
WCS is blended heavy oil which consists of both conventional heavy oil and unconventional diluted bitumen. The 
average WTI-WCS differential was wider in the second quarter of 2016 and on a year-to-date basis compared with 
2015.  The  differential  widened  despite  the  steep  decline  in  WTI  compared  with  2015  as  U.S.  domestic  light  oil 
supply  declined  and  increased  imports of  global  medium  crude  into  the  U.S.  are  expected  to  compete  for  coker 
capacity, pressuring heavy oil prices. 
Blending condensate with bitumen and heavy oil enables our production to be transported through pipelines. Our 
blending  ratios  range  from  approximately  10  percent  to  33  percent.  The  WCS-Condensate  differential  is  an 
important benchmark as a narrower differential generally results in an increase in the recovery of condensate costs 
when selling a barrel of blended crude oil. Since the supply of condensate in Alberta does not meet the demand, 
Edmonton  condensate  prices  may  be  driven  by  U.S.  Gulf  Coast  condensate  prices  plus  the  cost  attributed  to 
transporting the condensate to Edmonton.  
Average condensate prices were weaker relative to the WTI benchmark price in the second quarter of 2016 due to 
the  Alberta forest  fires reducing  heavy  oil production  and the  associated  decline  in  diluent  demand. In  contrast, 
condensate was sold at par with WTI during the second quarter of 2015.
Refining Benchmarks 
The Chicago Regular Unleaded Gasoline (“RUL”) and Chicago Ultra-low Sulphur Diesel (“ULSD”) benchmark prices 
are  representative  of  inland  refined  product  prices  and  are  used  to  derive  the  Chicago  3-2-1  crack  spread.  The 
3-2-1 crack spread is an indicator of the refining margin generated by converting three barrels of crude oil into two 
barrels  of  regular  unleaded  gasoline  and  one  barrel  of  ultra-low  sulphur  diesel  using  current  month  WTI-based 
crude oil feedstock prices and valued on a last in, first out accounting basis. 
Average  Chicago  3-2-1  crack  spreads  and  Group  3  crack  spreads  decreased  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended 
June 30, 2016, compared with 2015 due to higher global refined product inventory and strengthening of the WTI 
benchmark price compared with Brent, as evidenced by narrowing of the Brent-WTI differential.  
Our realized crack spreads are affected by many other factors such as the variety of feedstock crude oil, refinery 
configuration and product output, the time lag between the purchase and delivery of crude oil feedstock, and the 
cost of feedstock, which is valued on a first in, first out (“FIFO”) accounting basis.
Natural Gas Benchmarks 
Average natural gas prices decreased in the second quarter of 2016 and on a year-to-date basis compared with 
2015  primarily  due  to  record-high  storage  levels  in  the  U.S.  and  Canada  resulting  from  a  warmer  than  normal 
winter and the resiliency of North American supply.
Foreign Exchange Benchmarks 
Revenues are subject to foreign exchange exposure as the sales prices of our crude oil, natural gas and refined 
products  are  determined  by  reference  to  U.S.  benchmark  prices. A  decrease  in  the  value  of  the  Canadian  dollar 
compared  with  the  U.S.  dollar  has  a  positive  impact  on  our  reported  results.  Likewise,  as  the  Canadian  dollar 
strengthens,  our  reported  results  are  lower.  In  addition  to  our  revenues  being  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars,  we 
have chosen to borrow U.S. dollar long-term debt. In periods of a weakening Canadian dollar, our U.S. dollar debt 
gives rise to unrealized foreign exchange losses when translated to Canadian dollars.
In the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, the Canadian dollar weakened relative to the U.S. dollar due to 
lower commodity prices and the expectation of higher U.S. interest rates. The weakening of the Canadian dollar in 
the  first  half  of  the  year,  compared  with  2015,  had  a  positive  impact  of  approximately  $374 million  on  our 
revenues. As at June 30, 2016, the Canadian dollar was stronger relative to the U.S. dollar on December 31, 2015, 
which resulted in $395 million of unrealized foreign exchange gains on the translation of our U.S. dollar debt.
FINANCIAL RESULTS

Revenues for the Periods Ended June 30, 2016 
 
Combined  Oil  Sands  and Conventional  revenues  declined 29 percent  in  the  second  quarter  and 33  percent  on  a 
year-to-date basis, compared with 2015, due to lower commodity prices and reduced sales volumes, partially offset 
by weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. The sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title 
lands business in 2015 also reduced revenues. These declines were partially offset by lower royalties. 
Revenues from our Refining and Marketing segment in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased 
13 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Refining revenues declined due to the decrease in refined product pricing, 
consistent  with  lower Chicago  RUL  and Chicago  ULSD benchmark prices.  The decrease  in  our  reported  revenues 
was  partially  offset  by  higher  refined  product  output  and  weakening  of  the  Canadian  dollar  relative  to  the  U.S. 
dollar.  Revenues  from  third-party  sales  undertaken  by  the  marketing  group  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016 
increased from 2015 as higher purchased crude oil and natural gas volumes were partially offset by lower sales 
prices.  On  a  year-to-date  basis,  marketing  revenues  decreased  compared  with  2015  due  to  lower  sales  prices, 
partially offset by higher purchased crude oil and natural gas volumes. 
Corporate and Eliminations revenues relate to sales and operating revenues between segments and are recorded at 
transfer prices based on current market prices. 
Further information regarding our revenues can be found in the Reportable Segments section of this MD&A.
Operating Cash Flow 
Operating  Cash  Flow  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  used  to  provide  a  consistent  measure  of  the  cash  generating 
performance of  our  assets  for  comparability  of  our  underlying  financial  performance  between  periods.  Operating 
Cash  Flow  is  defined  as  revenues  less  purchased  product,  transportation  and  blending,  operating  expenses  and 
production and mineral taxes plus realized gains less realized losses on risk management activities. Items within 
the Corporate and Eliminations segment are excluded from the calculation of Operating Cash Flow.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared With June 30, 2015
Operating Cash Flow declined 42 percent in the second quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to: 

A 32 percent decrease in our average crude oil sales price and a 46 percent decrease in our average natural 
gas sales price, consistent with lower associated benchmark prices; 
Lower Operating Cash Flow from Refining and Marketing as a result of lower average market crack spreads and 
higher operating costs, partially offset by higher utilization rates, improved margins on the sale of secondary 
products, weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and widening heavy and medium crude 
oil differentials; and 
A  two  percent  decline  in  our  crude  oil  sales  volumes  as  well  as  an  11  percent  decline  in  natural  gas  sales 
volumes.


These declines in Operating Cash Flow were partially offset by: 

A $58 million decrease in crude oil transportation and blending costs primarily due to lower condensate prices, 
partially offset by an increase in condensate volumes and transportation costs; and 
A  $48  million  decrease  in  crude  oil  operating  expenses  primarily  due  to  lower  fuel  costs,  repairs  and 
maintenance activities, chemicals, electricity, workforce reductions, and workover activities.

Operating Cash Flow Variance
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared With June 30, 2015
Operating Cash Flow declined 54 percent in the first six months of 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to: 

A 38 percent decrease in our average crude oil sales price and a 35 percent decrease in our average natural 
gas sales price, consistent with lower associated benchmark prices; 
Lower Operating Cash Flow from Refining and Marketing as a result of lower average market crack spreads and 
higher operating costs, partially offset by improved margins on the sale of secondary products, weakening of 
the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and higher utilization rates; and 
A  five  percent  decrease  in  our  crude  oil  sales  volume  and  a  12  percent  decline  in  our  natural  gas  sales 
volumes.


These declines to Operating Cash Flow were partially offset by: 

A  $133  million  decrease  in  crude  oil  transportation  and  blending  costs  primarily  due  to  lower  condensate 
prices, partially offset by an increase in condensate volumes and higher transportation costs;  
A $97 million decrease in crude oil operating expenses primarily due to workforce reductions, lower chemical 
costs, decreased repairs and maintenance costs, a reduction in fuel costs due to lower natural gas prices and a 
decline in workover activities; and 
A $21 million decline in royalties primarily due to a decrease in crude oil sales prices.

Cash Flow 
Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure commonly used in the oil and gas industry to assist in measuring a company’s 
ability  to  finance  its  capital  programs  and  meet  its  financial  obligations.  Cash  Flow  is  defined  as  cash  from 
operating activities excluding net change in other assets and liabilities and net change in non-cash working capital.

Operating Earnings (Loss) 
Operating Earnings (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure used to provide a consistent measure of the comparability of our 
underlying financial performance between periods by removing non-operating items. Operating Earnings (Loss) is 
defined as Earnings (Loss) Before Income Tax excluding gain (loss) on discontinuance, gain on bargain purchase, 
unrealized risk management gains (losses) on derivative instruments, unrealized foreign exchange gains (losses) 
on translation of U.S. dollar denominated notes issued from Canada, foreign exchange gains (losses) on settlement 
of  intercompany  transactions,  gains  (losses)  on  divestiture  of  assets,  less  income  taxes  on  Operating  Earnings 
(Loss) before tax, excluding the effect of changes in statutory income tax rates and the recognition of an increase 
in U.S. tax basis.

Operating Earnings declined in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to 
lower Cash Flow, as discussed above, the recognition of a non-cash expense of $17 million ($31 million on a year-
to-date  basis)  in  connection  with  certain  Calgary  office  space  in  excess  of  Cenovus’s  current  and  near-term 
requirements and a larger deferred income tax recovery in the prior periods, partially offset by lower depreciation,

Includes general and administrative, finance costs, interest income, realized foreign exchange (gains) losses, research costs, other (income) loss, 
net and Corporate and Eliminations revenues, purchased product, transportation and blending, and operating expenses.
Net Earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased primarily due to: 
 

A decline in Operating Earnings, as discussed above;  
Unrealized  risk  management  losses  of  $284  million  in  the  quarter  compared  with  unrealized  losses  of 
$151 million in the second quarter of 2015; and  
Non-operating unrealized foreign exchange  losses of $18 million related to the translation of our U.S. dollar 
denominated debt compared with unrealized gains of $99 million in 2015.

These decreases were partially offset by a higher deferred income tax recovery in 2016 primarily due to the impact 
of unrealized risk management losses.  
Net Earnings improved for the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to non-operating unrealized foreign 
exchange  gains  of  $395 million  compared  with  unrealized  losses  of  $415 million  in  2015  and  a  higher  deferred 
income tax recovery. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Operating Earnings, as discussed above, 
and unrealized risk management losses of $433 million on a year-to-date basis compared with unrealized losses of 
$296 million in 2015.

Includes expenditures on PP&E and E&E.
Capital  investment  in  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  declined  34  percent  and  37  percent 
respectively, compared with 2015, as we reduced our spending in light of the low commodity price environment.  
Oil Sands capital investment focused primarily on sustaining capital related to existing production, as well as work 
to complete the phase G expansion at Foster Creek and the Christina Lake expansion phase F. Conventional capital 
investment focused on maintenance capital and spending for our CO2 enhanced oil recovery project at Weyburn. 
Capital investment in the Refining and Marketing segment focused on the debottlenecking project at Wood River, in 
addition  to  capital  maintenance,  projects  to  improve  our  refinery  reliability  and  safety,  and  environmental 
initiatives. 
Further  information  regarding  our  capital  investment  can  be  found  in  the  Reportable  Segments  section  of  this 
MD&A.
First, to capital for our existing business operations; 
Second, to paying a dividend as part of providing strong total shareholder return; and  
Third, for growth or discretionary capital.
Capital Investment Decisions 
Our disciplined approach to capital allocation includes prioritizing our uses of cash flow in the following manner: 
 
 
 
 
Our  approach  to  capital  allocation  includes  evaluating  all  opportunities  using  specific  rigorous  criteria  within  the 
context of achieving our objectives of maintaining a prudent and flexible capital structure and strong balance sheet 
metrics, which position us to be financially resilient in times of lower cash flow. In addition, we continue to evaluate 
other  corporate  and  financial  opportunities,  including  generating  cash  from  our  existing  portfolio.  Refer  to  the

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Our reportable segments are as follows: 
Oil  Sands,  which  includes  the  development  and 
production of bitumen and natural gas in northeast 
Alberta.  Cenovus’s  bitumen  assets  include  Foster 
Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake as well as 
projects  in  the  early  stages  of  development,  such 
as  Grand  Rapids  and  Telephone  Lake.  Certain  of 
Cenovus’s  operated  oil  sands  properties,  notably 
Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake, are 
jointly owned with ConocoPhillips, an unrelated U.S. 
public company. 
Conventional,  which  includes  the  development 
and production of conventional crude oil, NGLs and 
natural gas in Alberta and Saskatchewan, including 
the  heavy  oil  assets  at  Pelican  Lake,  the  carbon 
dioxide  enhanced  oil  recovery  project  at  Weyburn 
and emerging tight oil opportunities.  
Refining  and  Marketing, which is responsible for 
transporting,  selling  and  refining  crude  oil  into 
petroleum  and  chemical  products.  Cenovus  jointly 
owns  two  refineries  in  the  U.S.  with  the  operator 
Phillips  66,  an  unrelated  U.S.  public  company.  In 
addition,  Cenovus  owns  and  operates  a  crude-by-
rail  terminal  in  Alberta.  This  segment  coordinates 
Cenovus’s  marketing  and  transportation  initiatives 
to  optimize  product  mix,  delivery  points, 
transportation 
customer 
diversification. 
 
Corporate and Eliminations, which primarily includes unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivative financial 
instruments,  gains  and  losses  on  divestiture  of  assets,  as  well  as  other  Cenovus-wide  costs  for  general  and 
administrative, financing activities and research costs. As financial instruments are settled, the realized gains and 
losses  are  recorded  in  the  operating  segment  to  which  the  derivative  instrument  relates.  Eliminations  relate  to 
sales  and  operating  revenues,  and  purchased  product  between  segments,  recorded  at  transfer  prices  based  on 
current market prices, and to unrealized intersegment profits in inventory.

OIL SANDS 
In  northeastern  Alberta,  we  are  a  50  percent  partner  in  the  Foster  Creek,  Christina  Lake  and  Narrows  Lake  oil 
sands  projects.  We  have  several  emerging  projects  in  the  early  stages  of  development,  including  our 
100 percent-owned  projects  at  Telephone  Lake  and  Grand  Rapids.  The  Oil  Sands  segment  also  includes  the 
Athabasca natural gas property, from which a portion of the natural gas production is used as fuel at the adjacent 
Foster Creek operations. 
Significant developments in our Oil Sands segment in the second quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 include: 

Crude oil netbacks, excluding realized risk management activities, of $14.43 per barrel, a 47 percent decrease 
from the second quarter of 2015;
  Decreasing our crude oil operating costs by $20 million or $2.51 per barrel to $8.06 per barrel;  
  Higher production at Foster Creek by 11 percent to an average of 64,544 barrels per day; and 

Reducing capital investment by $121 million.

In the second quarter, our average realized crude oil sales price was $30.59 per barrel. While our average price 
improved from the first quarter price of $10.13 per barrel, it was 33 percent lower than in the second quarter of 
2015. The decline in our realized crude oil price was consistent with the decrease in the WCS and Christina Dilbit 
Blend (“CDB”) benchmark prices. Weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and increased sales 
into the U.S. market, which generally secure a higher sales price, positively impacted our realized sales prices. 
Our  realized  bitumen  price  is  influenced  by  the  cost  of  condensate  used  in  blending.  As  the  cost  of  condensate 
increases relative to the price of blended crude oil, our realized bitumen price declines.  In addition, our cost for 
condensate  is  generally  higher  than  benchmark  due  to  transportation  between  market  hubs  and  field  locations, 
partially offset by the impact of inventory timing in a rising price environment. 
The WCS-CDB differential widened to a discount of US$2.64 per barrel (2015 – discount of US$2.00 per barrel). In 
the second quarter, 90 percent of our Christina Lake production was sold as CDB (2015 – 88 percent), with the 
remainder  sold  into  the  WCS  stream.  Christina  Lake production,  whether sold  as CDB or  blended with  WCS  and 
subject to a quality equalization charge, is priced at a discount to WCS.

Production at Foster Creek was higher compared with 2015 primarily due to an 11-day precautionary shut-down in 
the second quarter of 2015 due to a nearby forest fire, which reduced production by approximately 10,500 barrels 
per day. Production in the second quarter of 2016 benefited from new wells that were brought online in the second 
quarter. 
Production from Christina Lake  increased compared with the second quarter of 2015 due to additional wells and 
consistent performance of our facilities.
Condensate 
The bitumen currently produced by Cenovus must be blended with condensate to reduce its thickness in order to 
transport  it  to  market.  Revenues  represent  the  total  value  of  blended  crude  oil  sold  and  include  the  value  of 
condensate.  Consistent  with  the  widening  of  the  WCS-Condensate  differential  during  the  second  quarter,  the 
proportion of the cost of condensate recovered decreased.
Royalties  
Royalty calculations for our oil sands projects are based on government prescribed pre- and post-payout royalty 
rates which are determined on a sliding scale using the Canadian dollar equivalent WTI benchmark price. Royalty 
calculations differ between properties. 
Royalties at Foster Creek, a post-payout project, are based on an annualized calculation which uses the greater of: 
(1) the gross revenues multiplied by the applicable royalty rate (one to nine percent, based on the Canadian dollar 
equivalent WTI benchmark price); or (2) the net profits of the project multiplied by the applicable royalty rate (25 
to 40 percent, based on the Canadian dollar equivalent WTI benchmark price). Gross revenues are a function of 
sales  volumes  and  realized  sales  prices.  Net  profits  are  a  function  of  sales  volumes,  realized  sales  prices  and 
allowed  operating  and  capital  costs.  The  royalty  calculation  was  based  on  gross  revenues  as  compared  with  a 
calculation based on net profits for 2015.  
Royalties at Christina Lake, a pre-payout project, are based on a monthly calculation  that applies a royalty rate 
(ranging  from one  to  nine percent,  based  on  the Canadian  dollar  equivalent  WTI benchmark price)  to  the gross 
revenues from the project.

Royalties  decreased $13  million  in  the  second quarter relative  to  the  same  period  in  2015,  primarily  due  to  the 
decline in crude oil sales prices, partially offset by an increase in sales volumes.

Expenses
Transportation and Blending 
Transportation  and  blending  costs  decreased  $40  million  or  nine  percent.  Blending  costs  declined  primarily  as  a 
result  of  lower  condensate  prices  partially  offset  by  higher  condensate  volumes  from  increased  production.  Our 
condensate costs were higher than the average benchmark price in the second quarter due to the transportation 
expense associated with moving the condensate to our oil sands projects. However, we experienced some of the 
benefit of using condensate purchased at a lower price earlier in the year.  
Transportation  costs  increased  due  to  tariffs  from  additional  sales  to  the  U.S.  market,  which  generally  secure 
higher sales prices, and shipping higher volumes due to increased production. Additionally, costs increased due to 
charges  associated  with  capacity  commitments  in  excess  of  our  current  production.  Future  production  growth  is 
expected to reduce our per-barrel transportation costs.  
Transportation costs also increased as a result of moving higher volumes by rail in the current quarter compared 
with 2015. We transported an average of 10,810 gross barrels per day of crude oil by rail, consisting of  16 unit 
train shipments (2015 – 5,210 gross barrels per day, eight unit train shipments). The 16 unit trains were loaded at 
our crude-by-rail terminal, located in Bruderheim, Alberta.
Operating 
Primary drivers of our operating expenses for the second quarter were workforce, fuel, chemical costs, repairs and 
maintenance, and workovers. Total operating expenses decreased $20 million primarily as a result of lower natural 
gas prices that reduced fuel costs, lower repairs and maintenance activities, lower electrical costs and workforce 
reductions.

Pricing 
For  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  our  average  realized  crude  oil  sales  price  was  $20.28  per  barrel,  a 
43 percent decrease from 2015. The decline in our realized crude oil price was consistent with the decrease in the 
WCS and CDB benchmark prices, partially offset by weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and 
increased sales into the U.S. market, which generally secure a higher sales price.  
In the first half of 2016, 90 percent of our Christina Lake production was sold as CDB (2015 – 87 percent), with the 
remainder sold into the WCS stream.

Production at Foster Creek was slightly lower compared with 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, new wells were 
brought online and wells down for servicing early in 2016 were brought back online, partially offsetting the lower 
production in the first quarter. Production at Foster Creek in the first half of 2015 was reduced by approximately 
5,300 barrels per day, net, due to an 11-day shut-down as a safety precaution due to a nearby forest fire. 
Production from Christina Lake increased in the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to production from additional 
wells and improved performance of our facilities.

At Foster Creek, low crude oil sales prices and the true-up of the 2015 royalty calculation decreased the overall 
royalty rate in the first half of 2016. In addition, we received regulatory approval in 2015 to include certain capital 
costs incurred in previous years in our royalty calculation and recorded an associated credit, decreasing the overall 
royalty rate. Excluding the credit, the effective royalty rate in 2015 for Foster Creek would have been 5.0 percent.

Transportation and Blending 
Transportation and blending costs decreased $106 million or 12 percent. Blending costs declined primarily due to 
lower condensate prices, partially offset by an increase in condensate volumes consistent with higher production. 
Our  condensate  costs  exceeded  the  average  benchmark  price  in  2016  primarily  due  to  the  utilization  of  higher 
priced inventory and the transportation cost associated with moving the condensate to our oil sands projects.  
Transportation  costs  increased  primarily  due  to  tariffs  from  additional  sales  to  the  U.S.  market,  which  generally 
secure higher sales prices, and shipping higher volumes due to increased production. Additionally, costs increased 
due  to  charges  associated  with  capacity  commitments  in  excess  of  our  current  production.  Future  production 
growth is expected to reduce our per-barrel transportation costs.  
Lower volumes were moved by rail in the first half of 2016; however, rail costs increased slightly as we transported 
volumes across farther distances. We transported an average of 7,718 gross barrels per day of crude oil by rail, 
consisting of 23 unit train shipments (2015 – 8,522 gross barrels per day, 26 unit train shipments). The 23 unit 
trains were loaded at our crude-by-rail terminal, located in Bruderheim, Alberta.
Operating 
Primary drivers of our operating expenses in the first half of 2016 were workforce, fuel, workovers, chemicals, and  
repairs and maintenance. Total operating expenses decreased $37 million primarily as a result of lower natural gas 
prices that reduced fuel costs, a decline in repairs and maintenance, and reduced workforce.

Existing Projects 
Capital investment at Foster Creek and Christina Lake focused on sustaining capital related to existing production 
and drilling stratigraphic test wells in the first quarter to help identify well pad locations for sustaining wells and 
near-term expansion phases. Activity in the first half of the year also related to Foster Creek expansion phase G 
and Christina Lake expansion phase F, both of which remain on track.  Capital investment declined in the second 
quarter and on a year-to-date basis primarily due to spending reductions in response to the low commodity price 
environment. Lower capital investment at Christina Lake is also attributable to the completion of the optimization 
project in 2015. 
Capital  investment  at  Narrows  Lake  focused  on  detailed  engineering  during  the  first  half  of  2016.  Capital 
investment declined in 2016 compared with 2015 due to the suspension of construction at Narrows Lake.
Emerging Projects 
Telephone Lake capital investment declined in 2016 in response to the current low commodity price environment. 
In the first half of 2015, Telephone Lake capital investment focused on front-end engineering work for the central 
processing facility.  
Capital  investment  at  Grand Rapids  decreased during  the first  half  of 2016  as  spending  was  limited  to  the  wind 
down of the SAGD pilot. In the first half of 2015, a third pilot well pair was drilled at Grand Rapids.

Future Capital Investment  
We have adopted a more moderate and staged approach to future oil sands expansions due to the low commodity 
price environment.
Existing Projects 
Foster  Creek  is  currently  producing  from  phases  A  through  F,  with  some  initial  capacity  in  phase  G  becoming 
available  late  in  the  second  quarter.  Capital  investment  for  2016  is  forecast  to  be  between  $280  million  and 
$310 million. We plan to continue focusing on sustaining capital related to existing production as well as completing 
expansion phase G. We expect phase G to add initial design capacity of 30,000 gross barrels per day in the third 
quarter  of  2016,  with  ramp-up  to  design  capacity  expected  to  take  12  to  18  months.  Spending  related  to 
construction  work  on  phase  H  was  deferred  in  response  to  the  low  commodity  price  environment,  pushing  the 
expected  start-up  to  beyond  2017.  Phase  H  has  an  initial  design  capacity  of  30,000  gross  barrels  per  day.  In 
December 2014, we received regulatory approval for expansion phase J, a 50,000 gross barrels per day phase. 
Christina  Lake  is  producing  from  phases  A  through  E.  Capital  investment  for  2016  is  forecast  to  be  between 
$280 million and $310 million, focused on sustaining capital related to existing production and expansion phase F. 
We  anticipate  adding  gross  production  capacity  of  50,000  barrels  per  day  from  phase  F  in  the  third  quarter  of 
2016,  with  ramp-up  to  design  capacity  expected  to  take  12  to  18  months.  Construction  work  on  phase  G  was 
deferred in 2015 in response to the low commodity price environment, pushing the expected start-up to beyond 
2017. Phase G has an initial design capacity of 50,000 gross barrels per day. We received regulatory approval in 
December 2015 for the phase H expansion, a 50,000 gross barrels per day phase. 
Capital  investment  at  Narrows  Lake  in  2016  is  forecast  to  be  between  $10 million  and  $20  million,  focusing  on 
phase A detailed engineering.
Emerging Projects 
Capital investment for our new resource plays is forecast to be between $35 million and $45 million in 2016.
Depreciation, Depletion & Amortization  
We deplete crude oil and natural gas properties on a unit-of-production basis over proved reserves. The unit-of-
production rate takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with future development expenditures 
required  to  develop  those  proved  reserves.  This  rate,  calculated  at  an  area  level,  is  then  applied  to  our  sales 
volume to determine DD&A in a given period. We believe that this method of calculating DD&A charges each barrel 
of crude oil equivalent sold with its proportionate share of the cost of capital invested over the total estimated life 
of the related asset as represented by proved reserves. 
 
The  following  calculation  illustrates  how  the  implied  depletion  rate  for our  upstream  assets  could be determined 
using the reported consolidated data:
($ millions, unless otherwise indicated) 
 
Upstream Property, Plant and Equipment 
Estimated Future Development Capital 
Total Estimated Upstream Cost Base 
Total Proved Reserves (MMBOE) 
Implied Depletion Rate ($/BOE) 
 
While this illustrates the calculation of the implied depletion rate, our depletion rates are slightly higher and result 
in a total average rate ranging between $13.50 to $14.50 per BOE. Amounts related to assets under construction, 
which would be included in the total upstream cost base and would have proved reserves attributed to them, are 
not depleted. Property specific rates will exclude upstream assets that are depreciated on a straight-line basis. As

such, our actual depletion will differ from depletion calculated by applying the above implied depletion rate. Further 
information on our accounting policy for DD&A is included in our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30  2016,  Oil  Sands  DD&A  decreased  $2  million  and  $24  million, 
respectively, primarily due to lower DD&A rates partially offset by higher sales volumes. The average depletion rate 
for the first six months of 2016 was approximately $11.55 per barrel compared with $11.65 per barrel in 2015 as 
the  impact  of  proved  reserves  additions  offset  higher  PP&E  and  future  development  expenditures.  Future 
development costs, which compose approximately 60 percent of the depletable base, increased due to expansion of 
the development area at Christina Lake.
CONVENTIONAL 
Our  Conventional  operations include  dependable  cash  flow  producing  crude oil  and  natural  gas  assets  in  Alberta 
and Saskatchewan, including a CO2 enhanced oil recovery project in Weyburn, our heavy oil asset at Pelican Lake 
that uses polymer flood and waterflood technology and emerging tight oil assets in Alberta. The established assets 
in this segment are strategically important for their long-life reserves, stable operations and diversity of crude oil 
produced. The cash flow generated in our Conventional operations helps to fund future growth opportunities in our 
Oil Sands segment while our natural gas production acts as an economic hedge for the natural gas required as a 
fuel source at both our oil sands and refining operations. 
Significant developments that impacted our Conventional segment in the  second quarter of 2016 compared with 
2015 include: 

Crude  oil  and  natural  gas  netbacks,  excluding  realized  risk  management  activities,  of  $18.06  per  barrel 
(2015 – $31.69 per barrel) and $0.28 per Mcf (2015 – $1.59 per Mcf), respectively; 
Crude oil production averaging 55,476 barrels per day, decreasing 20 percent due to natural declines and the 
sale  of  our  royalty  interest  and  mineral  fee  title  lands  business.  Divested  assets  contributed  an  average  of 
4,300 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015; 
Reducing our crude oil operating costs by $28 million. Operating costs per barrel decreased nine percent due 
to  lower  repairs  and  maintenance  and  workover  activities,  chemical  consumption,  electricity  prices  and 
workforce reductions; and

Revenues
Pricing 
Our Conventional crude oil assets produce a diverse spectrum of crude oils, ranging from heavy oil, which secures 
a price based on the WCS benchmark, to light oil, which secures a price closer to the WTI benchmark. 
Our realized crude oil sales price averaged $42.03 per barrel in the second quarter, a 25 percent decrease from the 
second quarter of 2015, consistent with lower crude oil benchmark prices, net of applicable differentials. However, 
this is a 41 percent increase from the first quarter 2016 realized average price of $29.82 per barrel.

Crude oil production declined due to expected natural declines and the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee 
title lands business. Divested assets contributed an average of 4,300 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2015. 
Production at Pelican Lake was shut-down for two days as a safety precaution due to a nearby forest fire; there 
was no damage to our facilities. Lost production has been estimated at approximately 650 barrels per day, for the 
quarter.
Condensate 
The heavy oil currently produced by Cenovus must be blended with condensate to reduce its thickness in order to 
transport  it  to  market.  Revenues  represent  the  total  value  of  blended  crude  oil  sold  and  include  the  value  of 
condensate.  Consistent  with  the  widening  of  the  WCS-Condensate  differential  during  the  second  quarter,  the 
proportion of the cost of condensate recovered decreased.
Royalties 
Royalties  decreased  in  the  second  quarter  primarily  due  to  lower  realized  sales  prices  and  a  decrease  in  sales 
volumes  partially  offset  by  additional  royalty  burdens  at  Pelican  Lake,  Weyburn  and  other  conventional  assets 
resulting from the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business in 2015. In the second quarter, 
the effective crude oil royalty rate for our Conventional properties was 15.5 percent (2015 – 10.2 percent).  
Crown royalties at Pelican Lake are determined under oil sands royalty calculations. Pelican Lake is a post-payout 
project,  therefore  royalties  are  based  on  an  annualized  calculation  which  uses  the  greater  of:  (1)  the  gross 
revenues multiplied by the applicable royalty rate (one to nine percent, based on the Canadian dollar equivalent 
WTI  benchmark  price);  or  (2)  the  net  profits  of  the  project  multiplied  by  the  applicable  royalty  rate  (25  to  40 
percent, based on the Canadian dollar equivalent WTI benchmark price).  Gross revenues are a function of sales 
volumes  and  realized sales  prices.  Net  profits  are  a function  of sales  volumes,  realized  sales  prices  and  allowed 
operating and capital costs. The Pelican Lake crown royalty calculation is based on net profits. 
In  the  second  quarter  of  2016,  production  and  mineral  taxes  decreased  consistent  with  the  decline  in  crude  oil 
prices and due to the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business in 2015.
Expenses
Transportation and Blending 
Transportation and blending costs decreased $18 million. Blending costs declined due to lower condensate prices as 
well as a decrease in condensate volumes, consistent with lower production.  
Transportation charges were lower largely due to a decline in sales volumes and a reduction in the volumes moved 
by  rail,  partially  offset  by  additional  costs  due  to  pipeline  capacity  commitments  in  excess  of  our  current 
production. We did not transport any volumes by rail in the second quarter of 2016 (2015 – 822 barrels per day).
Operating 
Primary  drivers  of  our  operating  expenses  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  were  workforce,  workovers,  property 
taxes and lease costs, and electricity. Operating costs declined nine percent to $14.00 per barrel primarily due to: 

A  decline  in  repairs  and  maintenance  and  workover  costs  as  a  result  of  focusing  on  critical  activities  and 
achieving operational efficiencies;  
Lower chemical costs associated with reduced polymer consumption; 
Reduced electricity costs as a result of a decrease in consumption and a decline in prices; and
 
 
  Workforce reductions. 
These decreases were partially offset by lower production.

Production declined primarily due to expected natural declines and the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee 
title lands business. Divested assets contributed an average of 4,500 barrels per day in the first half of 2015.
Royalties 
Royalties decreased $7 million primarily due to lower realized sales prices and a decrease in sales volumes partially 
offset by additional royalty burdens at Pelican Lake, Weyburn and other conventional assets resulting from the sale 
of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business in 2015. In the first six months of 2016, the effective 
crude  oil  royalty  rate  for  our  Conventional  properties  was  14.3  percent  (2015 –  9.0 percent).  The  Pelican  Lake 
crown royalty calculation was based on net profits in both 2016 and 2015.  
Production and mineral taxes decreased on a year-to-date basis, consistent with lower crude oil prices in 2016, and 
due to the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business in 2015.
Expenses
Transportation and Blending 
Transportation and blending costs decreased $27 million. Blending costs declined primarily due to lower condensate 
prices as well as a decrease in condensate volumes, consistent with lower production.  
Transportation charges were lower largely due to a decline in sales volumes and a reduction in volumes moved by 
rail, partially offset by additional costs due to pipeline capacity commitments in excess of our current production. In 
the first half of 2016, we did not transport any volumes by rail (2015 – 1,204 barrels per day).
Operating 
Primary drivers of our operating expenses in the first six months of 2016 were workforce costs, workover activities, 
electricity,  property  taxes  and  lease  costs,  chemical  consumption,  and  repairs  and  maintenance.  Operating 
expenses declined $60 million or $1.49 per barrel.  
The per unit decline was primarily due to:  
 
 
  Workforce reductions; and 
 
 
These decreases were partially offset by lower production.
A decline in repairs and maintenance and workover costs due to a focus on critical operational activities;

Revenues
Pricing 
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, our average natural gas sales price decreased  46 percent to 
$1.52  per  Mcf  and  35  percent  to  $1.92  per  Mcf,  respectively.  This  is  consistent  with  the  decline  in  the  AECO 
benchmark price.
Production 
Production decreased by 11 percent to 381 MMcf per day in the second quarter and 386 MMcf per day on a year-to-
date basis due to expected natural declines and from the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee title lands 
business, which produced 14 MMcf and 17 MMcf per day, respectively, in the three and six months ended June 30, 
2015.
Royalties 
Royalties increased as a result of additional royalty burdens due to the sale of our royalty interest and mineral fee 
title lands business, partially offset by lower prices and production declines. The average royalty rate in the second 
quarter was 4.1 percent (2015 – 1.1 percent) and 4.3 percent (2015 – 1.4 percent) on a year-to-date basis.
Expenses
Transportation 
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, transportation costs were relatively consistent with 2015. Cost 
reductions  due  to  the  decline  in  sales  volumes  were  offset  by  additional  charges  from  a  true-up  of  2015 
transportation contracts.
Operating 
Primary drivers of our operating expenses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were property taxes 
and  lease  costs,  and  workforce.  Operating  expenses  decreased  by  $7  million  and  $12  million,  respectively, 
primarily due to lower workforce costs, electricity due to lower pricing, and repairs and maintenance.
Risk Management 
Risk management activities resulted in an impact of $nil in the second quarter and realized losses of $1 million on a 
year-to-date  basis  (2015  –  gains  of  $15 million  in  the  second  quarter  and  $25  million  on  a  year-to-date basis),

Future Capital Investment 
We  are  taking  a  more  moderate  approach  to developing our  conventional  crude  oil  opportunities  due  to  the  low 
commodity price environment. We plan to focus on drilling projects that are considered to be relatively low risk, 
with short production cycle times and strong expected returns. 
Our 2016 crude oil capital investment forecast is between $125 million and $150 million with spending plans mainly 
focused on maintaining and optimizing current production volumes.
DD&A  
We deplete crude oil and natural gas properties on a unit-of-production basis over proved reserves. The unit-of-
production rate takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with future development expenditures 
required  to  develop  those  proved  reserves.  This  rate,  calculated  at  an  area  level,  is  then  applied  to  our  sales 
volume to determine DD&A in a given period. We believe that this method of calculating DD&A charges each barrel 
of crude oil equivalent sold with its proportionate share of the cost of capital invested over the total estimated life 
of the related asset as represented by proved reserves.  
Conventional DD&A decreased $116 million in the second quarter of 2016 due to a decline in sales volumes and 
lower DD&A rates. The average depletion rate decreased approximately 20 percent in 2016 as the impact of lower 
proved  reserves  due  to  the  slowdown  of  our  development  plans  was  more  than  offset  by  lower  PP&E.  PP&E 
declined, in part, from an impairment charge of $184 million associated with our Northern Alberta CGU recorded at 
December 31,  2015  and  a  decrease  in  estimated  decommissioning  costs.  Future  development  costs,  which 
compose approximately 40 percent of the depletable base, declined from 2015 due to minimal capital investment 
planned at Pelican Lake in the near term.  
DD&A decreased  $56  million  on  a  year-to-date basis.  The  impact  of  lower  sales  volumes  and  lower  DD&A  rates 
were partially offset by a $170 million impairment charge associated with our Northern Alberta CGU recorded in the 
first quarter of 2016.
REFINING AND MARKETING 
We are a 50 percent partner in the Wood River and Borger refineries, which are located in the U.S. Our Refining 
and  Marketing  segment  positions  us  to  capture  the  value  from  crude  oil  production  through  to  refined  products 
such as diesel, gasoline and jet fuel. Our integrated approach provides a natural economic hedge against widening 
crude oil price differentials by providing lower feedstock prices to our refineries. 
This  segment  also  captures  our  marketing  and  transportation  initiatives  as  well  as  our  crude-by-rail  terminal 
operations located in Bruderheim, Alberta. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, 17 and 24 unit trains, 
respectively, were loaded at Bruderheim, including one unit train for a third party.

Represents 100 percent of the Wood River and Borger refinery operations. 
The official nameplate capacity, based on 95 percent of the highest average rate achieved over a continuous 30-day period.
On a 100-percent basis, our refineries have total processing capacity of approximately 460,000 gross barrels per 
day of crude oil, including processing capability of up to 255,000 gross barrels per day of blended heavy crude oil. 
We also have processing capacity of 45,000 gross barrels per day of NGLs. The ability to process a wide slate of 
crude oils allows us to economically integrate our heavy crude oil production. Processing less expensive crude oil 
creates a feedstock cost advantage, illustrated by the discount of WCS relative to WTI. The amount of heavy crude 
oil processed, such as WCS and CDB, is dependent on the quality and quantity of available crude oil with the total 
input  slate  being  optimized  at  each  refinery  to  maximize  economic  benefit.  Our  crude  utilization  represents  the 
percentage of total crude oil processed in our refineries relative to the total capacity. 
Crude oil runs increased in the second quarter of 2016 compared with 2015. Higher heavy crude oil volumes were 
processed due to the optimization of our total crude input slate, which reduces our feedstock costs. Refined product 
output  increased  due  to  consistent  performance  of  both  the  Wood  River  and  Borger  refineries.  In  the  second 
quarter  of  2015,  unplanned  outages  at  our  Borger  refinery  resulted  from  process  unit  outages  and  a  power 
interruption. 
On a year-to-date basis, crude oil runs and refined product output increased. Consistent performance in the current 
quarter was partially offset by planned and unplanned maintenance at our Wood River and Borger refineries in the 
first  quarter  of  2016.  In  the  first  half  of  2015,  we  experienced  unplanned  outages  and  completed  a  planned 
turnaround at the Borger refinery.

Gross Margin 
Our  realized  crack  spreads  are  affected  by  many  factors,  such  as  the  variety  of  feedstock  crude  oil,  refinery 
configuration  and  the  proportion  of  gasoline,  distillate  and  secondary  product  output;  the  time  lag  between  the 
purchase  of  crude  oil  feedstock  and  the  processing  of  that  crude  oil  through  our  refineries;  and  the  cost  of 
feedstock. Our feedstock costs are valued on a FIFO accounting basis. 
In  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  our  gross  margin  declined  primarily  due  to  lower  average 
market  crack  spreads  as  a  result  of  higher  global  refined  product  inventory  and  narrowing  of  the  Brent-WTI 
differential by 75 percent. This was partially offset by:  
 

An increase in refined product output; 
Improved  margins  on  the  sale  of  our  secondary  products,  such  as  coke,  asphalt  and  sulfur,  due  to  lower 
overall feedstock costs consistent with the decline in WTI;  
The weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakening of the Canadian dollar relative 
to  the  U.S.  dollar  in  the  second  quarter  and  on  a  year-to-date  basis,  compared  with  2015,  had  a  positive 
impact of approximately $18 million and $39 million, respectively, on our refining gross margin; and

  Widening heavy and medium crude oil differentials.
Our  refineries  do  not  blend  renewable  fuels  into  the  motor  fuel  products  we  produce.  Consequently,  we  are 
obligated  to  purchase  Renewable  Identification  Numbers  (“RINs”).  In  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30, 
2016, the cost of our RINs were $67 million and $129 million, respectively (2015 – $40 million and $93 million, 
respectively). The increase is consistent with the rise in the ethanol RINs benchmark price.  
Revenues  from  third-party  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  sales  undertaken  by  the  marketing  group  in  the  second 
quarter increased two percent from 2015. Higher purchased crude oil and natural gas volumes were partially offset 
by lower sales prices. On a year-to-date basis, revenues from third-party sales decreased eight percent compared 
with 2015 due to lower sales prices, partially offset by higher purchased crude oil and natural gas volumes.
Operating Expense 
Primary  drivers  of  operating  expenses  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016  and  on  a  year-to-date  basis  were  labour, 
maintenance  and  utilities.  Reported  operating  expenses  increased  in  the  second  quarter  and  on  a  year-to-date 
basis  compared  with  2015  primarily  due  to  weakening  of  the  Canadian  dollar  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  and 
additional maintenance activities, partially offset by a decline in utility costs resulting from lower natural gas prices.

Capital  expenditures  in  the  first  half  of  2016  focused  on  the  debottlenecking  project  at  Wood  River,  capital 
maintenance, projects to improve our refinery reliability and safety, and environmental initiatives. Start-up of the 
Wood River debottlenecking project is anticipated in the third quarter of 2016. 
In 2016, we expect to invest between $230 million and $280 million mainly related to the debottlenecking project 
at Wood River, in addition to maintenance, reliability and environmental initiatives.
DD&A 
Refining and the crude-by-rail terminal assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated service 
life of each component of the facilities, which range from three to 40 years. The service lives of these assets are 
reviewed  on  an  annual  basis.  Refining  and  Marketing  DD&A  increased  by  $5  million  in  the  second  quarter  and 
$14 million on a year-to-date basis, primarily due to the change in the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate.
CORPORATE AND ELIMINATIONS 
The Corporate and Eliminations segment includes intersegment eliminations relating to transactions that have been 
recorded at transfer prices based on current market prices, as well as unrealized intersegment profits in inventory. 
The  gains  and  losses  on  risk  management  represent  the  unrealized  mark-to-market  gains  and  losses  related  to 
derivative  financial  instruments  used  to  mitigate  fluctuations  in  commodity  prices,  and  the  unrealized 
mark-to-market gains and losses on the long-term power purchase contract and interest rate swaps. In the second 
quarter of 2016, our risk management activities resulted in $284 million of unrealized losses (2015 – $151 million 
of unrealized losses). On a year-to-date basis, we had $433 million of unrealized losses (2015 – $296 million of 
unrealized  losses).  The  Corporate  and  Eliminations  segment  also  includes  Cenovus-wide  costs  for  general  and 
administrative, financing and research costs.

Employee long-term incentive costs in prior periods were reclassified from operating expenses to general and administrative costs to conform to the 
presentation adopted for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Expenses
General and Administrative 
Primary  drivers of  our  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  2016  were  workforce, office  rent  and  information 
technology  costs.  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by  $17  million  in  the  second  quarter  and 
$6 million  on  a  year-to-date  basis.  Savings  from  workforce  reductions,  lower  information  technology  costs  and 
discretionary spending were offset by severance costs of approximately $19 million recorded in the second quarter 
related  to  the  workforce  reductions  implemented  in  April  2016.  Additionally,  a  non-cash  expense  of  $17  million 
($31  million  on  a  year-to-date  basis)  was  recorded  in  connection  with  certain  Calgary  office  space  in  excess  of 
Cenovus’s current and near-term requirements.
Finance Costs 
Finance costs include interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings as well as the unwinding 
of the discount on decommissioning liabilities. Finance costs increased $6 million and $9 million, respectively, in 
the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  as  weakening  of  the  Canadian  dollar  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar 
increased reported interest on our U.S. dollar denominated debt.  
The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was 
5.3 percent (2015 – 5.3 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively).

The  majority  of  unrealized  foreign  exchange  gains  resulted  from  the  translation  of  our  U.S.  dollar  denominated 
debt.  The  Canadian  dollar,  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar,  at  June  30,  2016  was  slightly  weaker  compared  with 
March 31, 2016, resulting in unrealized losses of $18 million in the second quarter. The Canadian dollar, relative to 
the U.S. dollar, strengthened by six percent from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016 resulting in year-to-date 
unrealized gains of $395 million.
DD&A 
Corporate and Eliminations DD&A includes provisions in respect of corporate assets, such as computer equipment, 
leasehold  improvements  and  office  furniture.  Costs  associated  with  corporate  assets  are  depreciated  on  a 
straight-line basis over the estimated service life of the assets, which range from three to 25 years. The service 
lives  of  these  assets  are  reviewed  on  an  annual  basis.  DD&A  in  the  second  quarter  was  $19  million  (2015  – 
$21 million) and $36 million on a year-to-date basis (2015 – $42 million).

Effective Tax Rate 
 
Tax  interpretations,  regulations  and  legislation  in  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  Cenovus  and  its  subsidiaries 
operate  are  subject  to  change.  We  believe  that  our  provision  for  income  taxes  is  adequate.  There  are  usually  a 
number of tax matters under review and as a result, income taxes are subject to measurement uncertainty. The 
timing  of  the  recognition  of  income  and  deductions  for  the  purpose  of  current  tax  expense  is  determined  by 
relevant tax legislation. 
In  the  three  and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  we  incurred  losses  for  income  tax  purposes,  which  will  be 
carried back to recover income taxes previously paid in Canada or recognized as a deferred tax recovery. In the 
second  quarter  of  2015,  the  current  tax  expense  included  an  acceleration  of  current  tax  payable  on  prior  year 
partnership earnings due to certain corporate restructuring transactions. 
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, a deferred tax recovery was recorded. The recovery was largely 
due  to  the  reversal  of  timing  differences  associated  with  the  recognition  of  partnership  income,  unrealized  risk 
management  losses,  the  recognition  of  a  benefit  from  capital  losses  not  previously  recognized  and  2015  losses, 
partially offset by a one-time charge of approximately $168 million from the revaluation of the deferred tax liability 
due to the increase in the Alberta corporate tax rate. The benefit of the capital losses was recognized as a result of 
the agreement to dispose of the royalty interest and mineral fee title lands business. 
Our effective tax rate is a function of the relationship between total tax expense and the amount of earnings before 
income  taxes.  The  effective  tax  rate  differs  from  the  statutory  tax  rate  as  it  reflects  higher  U.S.  tax  rates, 
permanent differences, adjustments for changes in tax rates and other tax legislation, variations in the estimate of 
reserves and differences between the provision and the actual amounts subsequently reported on the tax returns. 
 
Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to approximately $395 million of unrealized non-taxable 
foreign exchange gains.

Operating Activities 
Cash from operating activities decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 mainly due to lower 
Cash  Flow,  as  discussed  in  the  Financial  Results  section  of  this  MD&A.  Excluding  risk  management  assets  and 
liabilities,  working  capital  was  $4,141  million  at  June  30,  2016  compared  with  $4,337 million  at  December  31, 
2015.  
We anticipate that we will continue to meet our payment obligations as they come due.
Investing Activities 
Capital investment declined in the current quarter and on a year-to-date basis primarily due to spending reductions 
in response to the low commodity price environment.
Financing Activities 
Cash used in financing activities decreased in the second quarter of 2016 as we paid dividends of $0.05 per share 
or  $42  million  (2015  –  $0.2662  per  share  or  $223  million,  of  which  $125  million  was  paid  in  cash  with  the 
remainder reinvested in common shares issued from treasury through our dividend reinvestment plan).  
During the first half of 2016, we paid dividends of $0.10 per share or $83 million (2015  – $0.5324 per share or 
$445  million  of  which  $263  million  was  paid  in  cash).  In  the  first  half  of  2015,  cash  from  financing  activities 
included 67.5 million common shares issued at a price of $22.25 per share for net proceeds of $1.4 billion, which 
was partially offset by a net repayment of short-term borrowings.  
Our long-term debt at June 30, 2016 was $6,132 million (December 31, 2015 – $6,525 million) with no principal 
payments  due  until  October 2019  (US$1.3  billion).  The  principal  amount  of  long-term  debt  outstanding  in  U.S. 
dollars  has  remained  unchanged  since  August  2012.  The  $393  million  decrease  in  long-term  debt  is  due  to 
strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.  
As at June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our debt agreements.
Available Sources of Liquidity 
We  expect  cash  flow  from  our  crude  oil,  natural  gas  and  refining  operations  to  fund  a  portion  of  our  cash 
requirements.  Any  potential  shortfalls  may  be  required  to  be  funded  through  prudent  use  of  our  balance  sheet 
capacity, management of our asset portfolio and other corporate and financial opportunities that may be available 
to us.

Committed Credit Facility 
We  have  a  $4.0  billion  committed  credit  facility,  with  $1.0  billion  maturing  on  April  30,  2019  and  $3.0  billion 
maturing  on  November  30,  2019.  Effective  April  22,  2016,  we  extended  the  maturity  date  of  the  $1.0  billion 
tranche  of  the  committed  credit  facility  from  November  30,  2017  to  April  30,  2019.  As  at  June  30,  2016,  no 
amounts are drawn on our committed credit facilities.  
Under  the  committed  credit  facility,  Cenovus  is  required  to  maintain  a  debt  to  capitalization  ratio  not  to  exceed 
65 percent; we are well below this limit.
Base Shelf Prospectus 
Cenovus filed a base shelf prospectus in 2016. The base shelf prospectus allows us to offer, from time to time, up 
to  US$5.0  billion,  or  the  equivalent  in  other  currencies,  of  debt  securities,  common  shares,  preferred  shares, 
subscription  receipts,  warrants,  share  purchase  contracts  and  units  in  Canada,  the  U.S.  and  elsewhere  where 
permitted by law. The base shelf prospectus will expire in March 2018. 
As at June 30, 2016, there have been no issuances under the prospectus.
Financial Metrics 
We  monitor  our  capital  structure  and  financing  requirements  using,  among  other  things,  non-GAAP  financial 
metrics  consisting  of  Debt  to  Capitalization  and  Debt  to  Adjusted  EBITDA.  We  define  our  non-GAAP  measure  of 
Debt as short-term borrowings and the current and long-term portions of long-term debt. We define Capitalization 
as Debt plus Shareholders’ Equity. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before finance costs, interest income, 
income  tax  expense,  DD&A,  goodwill  and  asset  impairments,  unrealized  gains  (losses)  on  risk  management, 
foreign exchange gains (losses), gains (losses) on divestiture of assets and other income (loss), net, calculated on 
a trailing twelve-month basis. These metrics are used to steward our overall debt position and as measures of our 
overall financial strength. 
 
 
As at 
Net Debt to Capitalization (1) (2) 
Debt to Capitalization 
Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (1) 
Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
(1)  Net Debt is defined as Debt net of cash and cash equivalents. 
(2)  Net Debt to Capitalization is defined as Net Debt divided by Net Debt plus Shareholders’ Equity. 
 
Over the long-term, we target a Debt to Capitalization ratio of between 30 percent to 40 percent and a  Debt to 
Adjusted EBITDA of between 1.0 times to 2.0 times. At different points within the economic cycle, we expect these 
ratios may periodically be outside of the target range. 
Debt  to  Capitalization  remained  consistent  as  the  lower  long-term  debt  balance,  from  the  strengthening  of  the 
Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, was offset by the decrease in Shareholders’ Equity. Debt to Adjusted 
EBITDA  increased  as  a  result  of  lower  Adjusted  EBITDA,  primarily  due  to  a  decline  in  Cash  Flow  from  lower 
commodity prices, partially offset by the lower long-term debt balance. 
Additional  information  regarding  our  financial  metrics  and  capital  structure  can  be  found  in  the  notes  to  the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
We have entered into various commitments in the normal course of operations primarily related to demand charges 
on firm transportation agreements and operating leases on buildings. In addition, we have commitments related to 
our risk management program and an obligation to fund our defined benefit pension and other post-employment 
benefit plans. For further information, see the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  
During the first half of 2016, net transportation commitments decreased by approximately $1 billion primarily due 
to a net decrease in toll estimates. These agreements, some of which are subject to regulatory approval, are for 
terms up to 20 years subsequent to the date of commencement, and should help align our future transportation 
requirements with our anticipated production growth. As at June 30, 2016, total transportation commitments were 
$26 billion. 
As  at  June  30,  2016,  there  were  outstanding  letters  of  credit  aggregating  $246  million  issued  as  security  for 
performance under certain contracts (December 31, 2015 – $64 million).
Legal Proceedings 
We are involved in a limited number of legal claims associated with the normal course of operations and we believe 
we have made adequate provisions for such claims. There are no individually or collectively significant claims.
RISK MANAGEMENT
For a full understanding of the risks that impact Cenovus, the following discussion should be read in conjunction 
with the Risk Management section of each of our 2015 annual MD&A and first quarter 2016 MD&A. A description of 
the  risk  factors  and  uncertainties  affecting  Cenovus  can  be  found  in  the  Advisory  and  a  full  discussion  of  the 
material risk factors affecting Cenovus can be found in our AIF for  the year ended December 31, 2015, together 
with updates in our first quarter 2016 MD&A and the updates provided below in this MD&A.  
Cenovus is exposed to a number of risks through the pursuit of our strategic objectives. Some of these risks impact 
the  oil  and  gas  industry  as  a  whole  and  others  are  unique  to  our  operations.  Actively  managing  these  risks 
improves our ability to effectively execute our business strategy. We continue to be exposed to the risks identified 
in our 2015 annual MD&A and AIF. 
The  following  provides  an  update  on  our  risks  related  to  commodity  prices,  derivative  financial  instruments  and 
abandonment and reclamation costs.
Commodity Price Risk 
Fluctuations in commodity prices and refined product prices impacts our financial condition, results of operations, 
cash flows, growth, access to capital and cost of borrowing.  
We  partially  mitigate  our  exposure  to  commodity  price  risk  through  the  integration  of  our  business,  financial 
instruments,  physical  contracts  and  market  access  commitments.  Financial  instruments  undertaken  within  our 
refining  business  by  the  operator,  Phillips  66,  are  primarily  for  purchased  product.  For  details  of  our  financial 
instruments, including classification, assumptions made in the calculation of fair value and additional discussion on 
exposure of risks and the management of those risks, see Notes 17 and 18 to the interim Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

The power contracts were effectively terminated on March 7, 2016. Recent  litigation between third parties has caused some uncertainty regarding 
termination of the contracts. Any related liability or asset to Cenovus is not determinable at this time.

In the second quarter of 2016, we incurred realized losses on crude oil risk management activities, consistent with 
the average benchmark price exceeding our contract prices. In the first half of 2016, we recorded realized gains on 
crude oil risk management activities as our contract prices exceeded average benchmark prices. Unrealized losses 
were recorded on our crude oil financial instruments in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily 
due to the realization of settled positions and changes in market prices.  
Unrealized losses were recorded on our interest rate hedge positions due to decreases in benchmark interest rates.
Risks Associated With Derivative Financial Instruments  
Financial instruments expose Cenovus to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations. This 
risk  is  partially  mitigated  through  credit  exposure  limits,  frequent  assessment  of counterparty  credit  ratings  and 
netting arrangements, as outlined in our Credit Policy.
Financial  instruments  also  expose  Cenovus  to  the  risk  of  a  loss  from  adverse  changes  in  the  market  value  of 
financial  instruments  or  if  we  are  unable  to  fulfill  our  delivery  obligations  related  to  the  underlying  physical 
transaction. Financial instruments may limit the benefit to Cenovus of commodity price increases. These risks are 
minimized  through  hedging  limits  that  are  reviewed  annually  by  the  Board,  as  required  by  our  Market  Risk 
Mitigation Policy.
Abandonment and Reclamation Cost Risk 
The current oil and gas asset abandonment, reclamation and remediation (“A&R”) liability regime in Alberta limits 
each party’s liability to its proportionate ownership of an asset. In the case where one party becomes insolvent and 
is unable to fund the A&R activities, the solvent parties can claim the insolvent party’s share of the costs (orphaned 
asset)  against  the  Orphan  Well  Association  (the  “OWA”).  The  OWA  administers  orphaned  assets  and  is  funded 
through a levy imposed on licensees and approval holders, including Cenovus, based on each party’s proportionate 
share of the oil and gas industry’s deemed A&R liabilities for facilities, wells and unreclaimed sites.  
In May, 2016, the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench issued a decision in the case of Redwater Energy Corporation 
(“Redwater”)  that  trustees  and  receivers  of  insolvent  parties  may  disclaim  to  the  Alberta  Energy  Regulator  (the 
“AER”)  uneconomic  oil  and gas  assets before  starting  the  sales  process  for  the  insolvent  party’s  assets.  Prior  to 
Redwater, the sales process for the insolvent party’s assets would have typically included both the economic and 
uneconomic  assets,  and  only  in  instances  where  the  sales  process  failed  to  sell  all  of  the  assets,  would  the 
remaining assets be classified as orphaned assets  by the AER and disclaimed to the OWA. The changes brought 
about by the Redwater decision and subsequent actions by the AER in response to Redwater could expose licenses 
and approval holders, including Cenovus, to increased OWA levies and impact Cenovus’s ability to transfer licenses 
and approvals associated with any acquisition or divestiture activities. 
Based on the current economic environment, the number of orphaned wells in Alberta may increase significantly 
and accordingly, the aggregate value of the A&R liabilities assumed by the OWA may increase. It is unclear how 
these  liabilities  will  be  satisfied  by  the  OWA  and  the  manner,  if  any,  through  which  the  OWA  or  provincial 
regulators  may  seek  compensation  for  such  liabilities  from  industry  participants,  including  Cenovus.  While  the 
impact on Cenovus of any legislative, regulatory or policy decisions as a result of the Redwater decision cannot be 
reliably or accurately estimated, any cost recovery or other measures taken by applicable regulatory bodies may 
impact Cenovus and materially and adversely affect, among other things, Cenovus’s business, financial condition, 
results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, the AER released Bulletin 2016-16 on June 20, 2016 in response 
to  the  Redwater  decision,  implementing  important  changes  to  the  AER’s  procedures  relating  to  liability 
management ratings, license eligibility and transfers, which may impact Cenovus’s ability to transfer its licenses, 
approvals or permits, and which may further result in increased costs, delays and abandonment or restructuring of 
projects and transactions.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Management is required to make estimates and assumptions, and use judgment in the application of accounting 
policies that could have a significant impact on our financial results. Actual results may differ from estimates and 
those  differences  may  be  material.  The  estimates  and  assumptions  used  are  subject  to  updates  based  on 
experience  and  the  application  of  new  information.  Our  critical  accounting  policies  and  estimates  are  reviewed 
annually  by  the  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board.  Further  details  on  the  basis  of  preparation  and  our  significant 
accounting policies can be found in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and annual MD&A for the 
year ended December 31, 2015.
Critical Judgments in Applying Accounting Policies 
Critical judgments are those judgments made by Management in the process of applying accounting policies that 
have  the  most  significant  effect  on  the  amounts  recorded  in  our  annual  and  interim  Consolidated  Financial 
Statements. There have been no changes to our critical judgments used in applying accounting policies during the 
first six months of 2016. Further information can be found in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and annual MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty 
Critical  accounting  estimates  are  those  estimates  that  require  Management  to  make  particularly  subjective  or 
complex  judgments  about  matters  that  are  inherently  uncertain.  Estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis and any revisions to accounting estimates are recorded in the period in which the 
estimates are revised.
Changes in Accounting Policies 
There  were  no  new  or  amended  accounting  standards  or  interpretations  adopted  during  the  six  months  ended 
June 30, 2016.
Future Accounting Pronouncements  
A description of additional accounting standards and interpretations that will be adopted in future periods can be 
found in the notes to the annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.
CONTROL ENVIRONMENT
There have been no changes to internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) during the three months ended 
June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ICFR. 
Internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems 
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation 
and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the 
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
OUTLOOK
Although benchmark crude oil prices have strengthened in the second quarter of 2016, heavy oil differentials have 
remained relatively flat and our realized prices and netbacks remain below historical levels. Additional confidence in 
commodity  prices,  our  ability  to  sustain  cost  reductions  as  well  as  fiscal  and  regulatory  certainty  are  required 
before we will consider further expansion of existing projects or developing emerging opportunities. We will commit 
to project reactivation only if we believe it does not undermine the strength of our balance sheet. 
The following outlook commentary is focused on the next 12 months.
Commodity Prices Underlying our Financial Results 
Our crude oil pricing outlook is influenced by the following:  
  We expect the general outlook for crude oil prices will be 
tied primarily to the supply response to the current price 
environment,  the  impact  of  supply  disruptions  and  the 
pace of growth in global demand as influenced by macro-
economic  events.  Overall,  we  expect  crude  oil  price 
volatility and a modest price improvement in the second 
half  of  2016.  Anticipated  global  supply  declines, 
combined  with  annual  increases  in  demand  growth, 
should  support  prices  in  the  remainder  of  the  year, 
constrained by the need to draw down surplus crude oil 
inventories and re-entry of Iranian crude  oil supply into 
markets.
  We anticipate the Brent-WTI differential to remain narrow
now  that  the  U.S.  is  exporting  crude  oil  to  overseas  markets.  Overall,  the  differential  will  likely  be  set  by 
transportation costs; and
  We expect that the WTI-WCS differential will widen due to declining U.S. light tight oil supply and as a result of
additional Canadian supply as production outages caused by the Alberta forest fires are brought back online.

Refer to the foreign exchange rate sensitivities found within our current 
guidance available at cenovus.com.
U.S. refining crack spreads are expected to weaken in the second half of the year as high global refined product 
inventories  continue  to  weigh  on  product  prices  while  seasonal  U.S.  demand  weakens  during  fall  and  winter 
periods.
Further weakening of natural gas prices in the second quarter of 2016 reflects lower seasonal demand and record-
high  storage  levels.  Pricing  is  anticipated  to  improve  throughout  the  second  half  of  2016  due  to  lower  supply 
growth and stronger demand growth, although price escalation should be limited by the continued need for coal-to-
gas substitution in the power sector. 
We expect the Canadian dollar to continue to be tied with strengthening of crude oil prices, tempered by differing 
interest  rate  expectations  between  Canada  and  the  U.S.  Overall,  ignoring  the  decline  in  oil  price,  a  weaker 
Canadian dollar will have a positive impact on our revenues and Operating Cash Flow. 
Our exposure to the light/heavy price differentials is composed of both a global light/heavy component as well as a 
transportation cost component. While we expect to see volatility in crude oil prices, we mitigate our exposure to 
light/heavy price differentials through the following:  
  Integration  –  having  heavy  oil  refining  capacity 
capable of processing Canadian heavy oil. From a 
value perspective, our refining business positions 
us  to  capture  value  from  both  the  WTI-WCS 
differential for Canadian crude oil and the Brent-
WTI differential from the sale of refined products; 
  Financial hedge transactions – limiting the impact 
of  fluctuations  in  upstream  crude  oil  prices  by 
entering  into  financial  transactions  that  fix  the 
WTI-WCS differential;
Protection Against Canadian Congestion
  Marketing arrangements – limiting the impact of 
fluctuations  in  upstream  crude  oil  prices  by 
entering  into  physical  supply  transactions  with 
fixed price components directly with refiners; and  
  Transportation commitments and arrangements – 
supporting  transportation  projects  that  move 
crude oil from our production areas to consuming 
markets and also to tidewater markets.
(1)  Excludes  additional  18,000  bbls/d  heavy  oil  capacity  expected  as  a  result 
of the Wood River debottlenecking project (expected in the second half of
2016).

Key Priorities for 2016
Maintain Financial Resilience 
Maintaining our financial resilience, while maintaining safe operations, continues to be our top priority. At June 30, 
2016, we had $3.8 billion of cash on hand and $4.0 billion of undrawn capacity under our committed credit facility. 
Our  debt  has  a  weighted  average  maturity  of  approximately  15  years,  with  no  debt  maturing  until  the  fourth 
quarter of 2019. Although we have a strong balance sheet, we  have undertaken additional measures in 2016 to 
remain financially resilient, including reductions in capital, operating and general and administrative costs.
Attack Cost Structures 
We  will  continue  to  focus  on  reducing  our  cost  structure.  We  are  on  track  to  reduce  our  planned  2016  capital, 
operating,  general  and  administrative  spending  by  approximately  $500  million,  relative  to  our  original  budget 
released in December 2015. We must ensure that, over the long term, we maintain an efficient and sustainable 
cost structure, and maximize the strengths of our functional business model.
Operational Excellence  
We are focused on executing our work programs safely, responsibly and efficiently through standardized processes, 
procedures  and  controls.  We  use  a  manufacturing  approach  to  optimize  value,  manage  risk  and  improve 
performance. We are focused on reducing the environmental impact of our operations and engaging with people 
and communities who may be affected by our operations in a transparent, timely and respectful way.

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SEGMENTED DISCLOSURES 
 
Cenovus  Energy  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries,  (together  “Cenovus”  or  the  “Company”)  are  in  the  business  of 
developing,  producing  and  marketing  crude  oil,  natural  gas  liquids  (“NGLs”)  and  natural  gas  in  Canada  with 
marketing activities and refining operations in the United States (“U.S.”). 
Cenovus  is  incorporated  under  the  Canada  Business  Corporations  Act  and  its  shares  are  listed  on  the  Toronto 
(“TSX”)  and  New  York  (“NYSE”)  stock  exchanges.  The  executive  and  registered  office  is  located  at  2600, 
500 Centre Street S.E., Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2G 1A6. Information on the Company’s basis of preparation for 
these interim Consolidated Financial Statements is found in Note 2.  
Management has determined the operating segments based on information regularly reviewed for the purposes of 
decision making, allocating resources and assessing operational performance by Cenovus’s chief operating decision 
makers. The Company evaluates the financial performance of its operating segments primarily based on operating 
cash flow. The Company’s reportable segments are:
  Oil  Sands,  which  includes  the  development  and  production  of  bitumen  and  natural  gas  in  northeast 
Alberta.  Cenovus’s  bitumen  assets  include  Foster  Creek,  Christina  Lake  and  Narrows  Lake  as  well  as 
projects  in  the  early  stages  of  development,  such  as  Grand  Rapids  and  Telephone  Lake.  Certain  of  the 
Company’s  operated  oil  sands  properties,  notably  Foster  Creek,  Christina  Lake  and  Narrows  Lake,  are 
jointly owned with ConocoPhillips, an unrelated U.S. public company. 
Conventional,  which  includes  the  development  and  production  of  conventional  crude  oil,  NGLs  and 
natural  gas  in  Alberta  and  Saskatchewan,  including  the  heavy  oil  assets  at  Pelican  Lake,  the  carbon 
dioxide enhanced oil recovery project at Weyburn and emerging tight oil opportunities.


  Refining  and  Marketing,  which  is  responsible  for  transporting,  selling  and  refining  crude  oil  into 
petroleum  and  chemical  products.  Cenovus  jointly  owns  two  refineries  in  the  U.S.  with  the  operator 
Phillips  66,  an  unrelated  U.S.  public  company.  In  addition,  Cenovus  owns  and  operates  a  crude-by-rail 
terminal  in  Alberta.  This  segment  coordinates  Cenovus’s  marketing  and  transportation  initiatives  to 
optimize  product  mix,  delivery  points,  transportation  commitments  and  customer  diversification.  The 
marketing of crude oil and natural gas sourced from Canada, including physical product sales that settle in 
the U.S., is considered to be undertaken by a Canadian business. U.S. sourced crude oil and natural gas 
purchases and sales are attributed to the U.S. 
Corporate and Eliminations, which primarily includes unrealized gains and losses recorded on derivative 
financial instruments, gains and losses on divestiture of assets, as well as other  Cenovus-wide costs for 
general  and  administrative,  financing  activities  and  research  costs.  As  financial  instruments  are  settled, 
the realized gains and losses are recorded in the operating segment to which the derivative instrument 
relates. Eliminations relate to sales and operating revenues, and purchased product between segments, 
recorded  at  transfer  prices  based  on  current  market  prices,  and  to  unrealized  intersegment  profits  in 
inventory.  The  Corporate  and  Eliminations  segment  is  attributed  to  Canada,  with  the  exception  of 
unrealized  risk  management  gains  and  losses,  which  have  been  attributed  to  the  country  in  which  the 
transacting entity resides.
Employee  stock-based  compensation  costs  previously  included  in  operating  expense  have  been  reclassified  to 
general  and  administrative  expense 
the  year  ended 
December 31, 2015. As a result, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, an expense of $4 million and 
$3 million, respectively, were reclassified.  
The following tabular financial information presents the segmented information first by segment, then by product 
and geographic location.

5. DIVESTITURES 
 
In the first quarter of 2015, the Company divested an office building, recording a gain of $16 million.
6. IMPAIRMENTS 
 
A) Cash-Generating Unit (“CGU”) Impairments 
As at June 30, 2016, there were no indicators of impairment. 
 
2016 Impairments 
 
As at March 31, 2016, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the Northern Alberta CGU exceeded 
its recoverable amount, resulting in an impairment loss of $170 million. The impairment was recorded as additional 
depreciation,  depletion  and  amortization  (“DD&A”)  in  the  Conventional  segment.  The  Northern  Alberta  CGU 
includes  the  Pelican  Lake  and  Elk  Point  producing  assets  and  other  emerging  assets  in  the  exploration  and 
evaluation stage. Future cash flows for the Northern Alberta CGU declined due to lower forward crude oil prices. 
The  recoverable  amount  was  determined  using  fair  value  less  costs  of  disposal.  The  fair  value  for  producing 
properties was calculated based on discounted after-tax cash flows of proved and probable reserves using forward 
prices  and  cost  estimates, consistent  with  Cenovus’s  independent qualified reserves  evaluators  (Level  3). Future 
cash  flows  were  estimated  using  a  two  percent  inflation  rate  and  discounted  using  a  rate  of  10  percent.  As  at 
March 31,  2016,  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  Northern  Alberta  CGU  was  estimated  to  be  approximately 
$1.3 billion.  
For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  is  allocated  to  the  CGU  to  which  it  relates.  There  were  no 
impairments of goodwill for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  
 
Key Assumptions 
As at March 31, 2016, the recoverable amounts of Cenovus’s upstream CGUs were determined based on fair value 
less costs of disposal or an evaluation of comparable asset transactions. Key assumptions in the determination of 
future cash flows from reserves include crude oil and natural gas prices, costs to develop and the discount rate. All 
reserves have been evaluated as at December 31, 2015 by independent qualified reserves evaluators. 
 
Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices 
The  forward  prices  as  at  March  31,  2016,  used  to  determine  future  cash  flows  from  crude  oil  and  natural  gas 
reserves are:

Discount and Inflation Rates 
 
Evaluations  of  discounted  future  cash  flows  are  initiated  using  the  discount  rate  of  10  percent  and  inflation  is 
estimated  at  two  percent,  which  is  common  industry  practice  and  used  by  Cenovus’s  independent  qualified 
reserves evaluators in preparing their reserves reports. Based on the individual characteristics of the asset, other 
economic and operating factors are also considered, which may increase or decrease the implied discount rate.

Sensitivities 
As  at  March  31,  2016,  changes  to  the  assumed  discount  rate  or  forward  price  estimates  over  the  life  of  the 
reserves independently would have the following impact on the 2016 impairment of the Northern Alberta CGU:

B) Asset Impairments 
There were no asset impairments for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
For  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2015,  $21  million  of  previously  capitalized  E&E  costs  related  to  exploration 
assets within the Saskatchewan CGU were deemed not to be technically feasible and commercially viable, and were

On February 24, 2016, Cenovus filed a base shelf prospectus. The base shelf prospectus allows the Company to 
offer, from time to time, up  to US$5.0 billion, or the equivalent in other  currencies, of debt securities, common 
shares, preferred shares, subscription receipts, warrants, share purchase contracts and units in Canada, the U.S. 
and  elsewhere  where  permitted  by  law.  The  base  shelf  prospectus  will  expire  in  March  2018  and  replaced  the 
Company’s US$2.0 billion base debt shelf prospectus. In addition, the Company had a $1.5 billion Canadian base 
debt shelf prospectus that expired on July 25, 2016. As at June 30, 2016, there have been no securities issued 
under the US$5.0 billion base shelf prospectus. 
Effective  April  22,  2016,  the  Company  extended  the  maturity  date  of  the  $1.0  billion  tranche  of  the  committed 
credit facility from November 30, 2017 to April 30, 2019. As at June 30, 2016, Cenovus had $4.0 billion available 
on its committed credit facility. 
As at June 30, 2016, the Company is in compliance with all of the terms of its debt agreements.

16. CAPITAL STRUCTURE 
 
Cenovus’s  capital  structure  objectives  and  targets  have  remained  unchanged  from  previous  periods.  Cenovus’s 
capital  structure  consists  of  Shareholders’  Equity  plus  Debt.  Debt  is  defined  as  short-term  borrowings,  and  the 
current and long-term portions of long-term debt. Net debt includes the Company’s short-term borrowings, and the 
current  and  long-term portions  of  long-term debt,  net  of cash  and  cash  equivalents.  Cenovus’s  objectives  when 
managing  its  capital  structure  are  to  maintain  financial  flexibility,  preserve  access  to capital  markets,  ensure  its 
ability  to  finance  internally  generated  growth  and  to  fund  potential  acquisitions  while  maintaining  the  ability  to 
meet the Company’s financial obligations as they come due.  
Cenovus monitors its capital structure and financing requirements using, among other things, non-GAAP financial 
metrics  consisting  of  Debt  to  Capitalization  and  Debt  to  Adjusted  Earnings  Before  Interest,  Taxes  and  DD&A 
(“Adjusted EBITDA”). These metrics are used to steward Cenovus’s overall debt position as measures of Cenovus’s 
overall financial strength.  
Over the long term, Cenovus targets a Debt to Capitalization ratio of between 30 and 40 percent and a Debt to 
Adjusted  EBITDA  ratio  of  between  1.0  and  2.0  times.  At  different  points  within  the  economic  cycle,  Cenovus 
expects these ratios may periodically be outside of the target range.

Cenovus will maintain a  high level of capital discipline and manage its capital structure to  help ensure sufficient 
liquidity  through  all  stages  of  the  economic  cycle.  To  manage  its  capital  structure,  Cenovus  may,  among  other 
actions,  adjust  capital  and  operating  spending,  adjust  dividends  paid  to  shareholders,  purchase  shares  for 
cancellation  pursuant  to  normal  course  issuer  bids,  issue  new  shares,  issue  new  debt,  draw  down  on  its  credit 
facilities or repay existing debt.  
Effective  April  22,  2016,  the  Company  extended  the  maturity  date  of  the  $1.0  billion  tranche  of  the  committed 
credit facility from November 30, 2017 to April 30, 2019. As at June 30, 2016, Cenovus had $4.0 billion available 
on  its  committed  credit  facility.  In  addition,  Cenovus  has  in  place  a  US$5.0  billion  base  shelf  prospectus,  the 
availability of which is dependent on market conditions.  
Under the committed credit facility, the Company is required to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio not to exceed 
65 percent. The Company is well below this limit. 
As at June 30, 2016, Cenovus is in compliance with all of the terms of its debt agreements.

17. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
Cenovus’s  consolidated  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  consist  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts 
receivable and accrued revenues, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, risk management assets and liabilities, 
available  for  sale  financial  assets,  long-term  receivables,  short-term  borrowings  and  long-term  debt.  Risk 
management assets and liabilities arise from the use of derivative financial instruments. 
 
A) Fair Value of Non-Derivative Financial Instruments  
 
The  fair  values  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  receivable  and  accrued  revenues,  accounts  payable  and 
accrued liabilities, and short-term borrowings approximate their carrying amount due to the short-term maturity of 
these instruments. 
The  fair  values  of  long-term  receivables  approximate  their  carrying  amount  due  to  the  specific  non-tradeable 
nature of these instruments. 
Long-term  debt  is  carried  at  amortized  cost.  The  estimated  fair  values  of  long-term  borrowings  have  been 
determined based on period-end trading prices of long-term borrowings on the secondary market (Level 2). As at 
June 30, 2016, the carrying value of Cenovus’s long-term debt was $6,132 million and the fair value was $6,024 
million (December 31, 2015 carrying value – $6,525 million, fair value – $6,050 million). 
Available for sale financial assets comprise private equity investments. These assets are carried at fair value on the 
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  in  other  assets.  Fair  value  is  determined  based  on  recent  private  placement 
transactions (Level 3) when available. The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of 
available for sale financial assets:

As at June 30, 2016
(1)  Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale financial assets are recorded in other comprehensive income. 
 
B) Fair Value of Risk Management Assets and Liabilities  
 
The Company’s risk management assets and liabilities consist of crude oil, condensate, power purchase contracts, 
and  interest  rate  swaps.  Crude  oil,  condensate  and,  if  entered,  natural  gas  contracts,  are  recorded  at  their 
estimated fair value based on the difference between the contracted price and the period-end forward price for the 
same  commodity,  using  quoted  market  prices  or  the  period-end  forward  price  for  the  same  commodity 
extrapolated  to  the  end  of  the  term  of  the  contract  (Level  2).  The  fair  value  of  power  purchase  contracts  are 
calculated  internally  based  on  observable  and  unobservable  inputs  such  as  forward  power  prices  in  less  active 
markets (Level 3). The unobservable inputs are obtained from third parties whenever possible and reviewed by the 
Company for reasonableness. The fair value of interest rate swaps are calculated using external valuation models 
which incorporate observable market data, including quoted market prices and interest rate yield curves (Level 2).

18. RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
The  Company  is  exposed  to financial  risks,  including  market  risk  related  to  commodity  prices,  foreign  exchange 
rates, interest rates as well as credit risk and liquidity risk. A description of the nature and extent of risks arising

Sensitivities – Risk Management Positions  
 
The  following  table  summarizes  the  sensitivity  of  the  fair  value  of  Cenovus’s  risk  management  positions  to 
fluctuations in commodity prices or interest rates, with all other variables held constant. Management believes the 
price and interest rate fluctuations identified in the table below are a reasonable measure of volatility. The impact 
of fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates on the Company’s open risk management positions could have 
resulted in unrealized gains (losses) impacting earnings before income tax based on the risk management positions 
in place as follows:

For the period ended June 30, 2016 
 
 
19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
A) Commitments 
 
Cenovus  has  entered  into  various  commitments  in  the  normal  course  of  operations  primarily  related  to  demand 
charges  on  firm  transportation  agreements.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  commitments  related  to  its  risk 
management  program  and  an  obligation  to  fund  its  defined  benefit  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefit 
plans.  Additional  information  related  to  the  Company’s  commitments  can  be  found  in  the  notes  to  the  annual 
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company’s transportation commitments decreased approximately 
$1  billion  primarily  due  to  a  net  decrease  in  toll  estimates.  These  agreements,  some  of  which  are  subject  to 
regulatory approval, are for terms up to 20 years subsequent to the date of commencement. As at June 30, 2016, 
total transportation commitments were $26 billion. 
As  at  June  30,  2016,  there  were  outstanding  letters  of  credit  aggregating  $246  million  issued  as  security  for 
performance under certain contracts (December 31, 2015 – $64 million). 
 
B) Legal Proceedings 
 
Cenovus is involved in a limited number of legal claims associated with the normal course of operations. Cenovus 
believes it has made adequate provisions for such legal claims. There are no individually or collectively significant 
claims.

Operating Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as revenues less purchased product, transportation and blending, operating expenses and production and mineral taxes plus realized gains less realized losses on risk 
management activities. Items within the Corporate and Eliminations segment are excluded from the calculation of Operating Cash Flow.
Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash from operating activities excluding net change in other assets and liabilities and net change in non-cash working capital, both of which are defined on the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.
Operating Earnings (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure that is used to provide a consistent measure of the comparability of our underlying financial performance between periods by removing non-operating items. Operating
Earnings (Loss) is defined as Earnings (Loss) Before Income Tax excluding gain (loss) on discontinuance, gain on bargain purchase, unrealized risk management gains (losses) on derivative instruments, unrealized
foreign exchange gains (losses) on translation of U.S. dollar denominated notes issued from Canada, foreign exchange gains (losses) on settlement of intercompany transactions, gains (losses) on divestiture of assets,
less income taxes on Operating Earnings (Loss) before tax, excluding the effect of changes in statutory income tax rates and the recognition of an increase in U.S. tax basis.
The 2015 effective tax rate reflects an increase to the tax basis of Cenovus's U.S. assets, the two percent increase in the Alberta corporate income tax rate and the benefit from recognition of previously unrecognized
capital losses.
On June 29, 2015, the Alberta government enacted a two percent increase in the corporate income tax rate. The rate increase was effective July 1, 2015.

Liquids ($/bbl)
Natural Gas ($/Mcf)
Total (2) ($/BOE)
The netbacks do not reflect non-cash write-downs of product inventory.
(1)
(2) Natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) to one barrel (bbl). BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of
one bbl to six Mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current
price of crude oil compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency conversion ratio of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis is not an accurate reflection of value.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
Basis of Presentation Cenovus reports financial results in Canadian dollars and presents production volumes on a net to Cenovus 
before royalties basis, unless otherwise stated. Cenovus prepares its financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
 
Non-GAAP Measures  
This quarterly report contains references to non-GAAP measures as follows:
•
•  Operating  cash  flow  is  defined  as  revenues,  less  purchased  product,  transportation  and  blending,  operating  expenses, 
production and mineral taxes plus realized gains, less realized losses on risk management activities and is used to provide a 
consistent measure of the cash generating performance of the company’s assets for comparability of Cenovus’s underlying 
financial  performance  between  periods.  Items  within  the  Corporate  and  Eliminations  segment  are  excluded  from  the 
calculation of operating cash flow. 
Cash flow is defined as cash from operating activities excluding net change in other assets and liabilities and net change in 
non-cash working capital, both of which are defined on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in Cenovus’s interim and 
annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flow is a measure commonly used in the oil and gas industry to assist in 
measuring a company's ability to finance its capital programs and meet its financial obligations.  
Free cash flow is defined as cash flow less capital investment.
• 
•  Operating  earnings  is  used  to  provide  a  consistent  measure  of  the  comparability  of  the  company’s  underlying  financial 
performance between periods by removing non-operating items. Operating earnings is defined as earnings before income 
tax  excluding  gain  (loss)  on  discontinuance,  gain  on  bargain  purchase,  unrealized  risk  management  gains  (losses)  on 
derivative instruments, unrealized foreign exchange gains (losses) on translation of U.S. dollar denominated notes issued 
from Canada, foreign exchange gains (losses) on settlement of intercompany transactions, gains (losses) on divestiture of 
assets, less income taxes on operating earnings (loss) before tax, excluding the effect of changes in statutory income tax 
rates and the recognition of an increase in U.S. tax basis.
•  Debt to capitalization, net debt to capitalization, debt to adjusted EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBITDA are ratios that 
management uses to steward the company’s overall debt position as measures of the company’s overall financial strength. 
Debt is defined as short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the current portion. Net debt is defined as debt net 
of cash and cash equivalents. Capitalization is defined as debt plus shareholders’ equity. Net debt to capitalization is defined 
as  net  debt  divided  by  net  debt  plus  shareholders'  equity.  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  defined  as  earnings  before  finance  costs, 
interest income, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, goodwill and asset impairments, unrealized 
gains or losses on risk management, foreign exchange gains or losses, gains or losses on divestiture of assets and other 
income and loss, calculated on a trailing 12-month basis.
These  measures  do  not  have  a  standardized  meaning  as  prescribed  by  IFRS  and  therefore  are  considered  non-GAAP  measures. 
These measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These measures have been described and 
presented  in  this  quarterly  report  in  order  to  provide  shareholders  and  potential  investors  with  additional  information  regarding 
Cenovus’s liquidity and its ability to generate funds to finance its operations. This information should not be considered in isolation or 
as  a  substitute  for  measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  IFRS.  For  further  information,  refer  to  Cenovus’s  most  recent 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) available at cenovus.com. 
 
Netbacks reported in this quarterly report are calculated as set out in the Annual Information Form (AIF). Heavy oil prices and 
transportation and blending costs exclude the costs of purchased condensate, which is blended with heavy oil. For the second quarter 
of 2016,  the  cost of condensate  on  a per-barrel of  unblended  crude oil  basis was  as  follows:  Christina  Lake –  $26.24  and Foster 
Creek – $24.76.
