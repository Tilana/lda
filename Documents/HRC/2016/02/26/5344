<p><b>12/&#8230;  Elimination of discrimination against women 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>,  
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, its Purposes and Principles, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided also</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted in June 1993 by the 
World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), the Beijing Declaration and Platform 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>&#8727;  Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p>for Action, adopted in September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women 
(A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1, chap. I), and the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, 
adopted in September 2001 by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> the challenges still faced by all countries throughout the world to 
overcome inequality between men and women, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly entitled 
&#8220;Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century&#8221;, the 
declaration adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-ninth session and the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also </i>Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/13 of 17 April 2000, 
2001/34 of 23 April 2001 and 2003/22 of 22 April 2003, as well as Council resolution 6/30 
of 14 December 2007 on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United Nations 
system, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that international human rights treaties, including the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees to ensure equality of 
women and men, girls and boys, in the enjoyment of their civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights on a basis of equality, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that women face multiple forms of discrimination,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of life is 
essential for the full and complete economic and social development of a country, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful</i> of the fact that the elimination of discrimination against women requires the 
consideration of women&#8217;s specific socio-economic context, and recognizing that laws, policies, </p>

 <p></p>
<p>customs and traditions that restrict women&#8217;s equal access to participate fully in development 
processes and public and political life are discriminatory and may contribute to the feminization 
of poverty, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Council and 5/2 on the Code of 
Conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing 
that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with those resolutions and 
the annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Reaffirms</i> the obligation of States to take all appropriate measures to eliminate 
discrimination against women by any person, organization or enterprise; 
</p>
<p> 2<i>. Welcomes </i>the commitments made by the international community to fully implement 
the Millennium Development Goals and stressing, in that context, the resolve of Heads of State 
to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective ways to combat 
poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly sustainable; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also welcomes</i> the efforts made by States around the world to reform their legal 
systems in order to remove obstacles to women&#8217;s full and effective enjoyment of their human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses concern</i> at the fact that, despite the pledge made at the Beijing World 
Conference on Women and the review by the General Assembly at its twenty-third special 
session to modify or abolish remaining laws that discriminate against women and girls, many of 
these laws are still in force and continue to be applied, thereby preventing women and girls from 
enjoying the full realization of their human rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States to fulfil their international obligations and commitments to revoke 
any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the 
administration of justice, taking into account that those laws violate their human right to be 
protected against discrimination;</p>

 <p></p>
<p> 6<i>. Recognizes</i> that women&#8217;s inequality before the law has resulted in the lack of equal 
opportunities for women in education, access to health, economic participation, access to labour 
and disparities in salaries and compensation, public and political participation, access to 
decision-making processes, inheritance, ownership of land, financial services, including loans, 
and nationality and legal capacity, among others, as well as increased vulnerability to 
discrimination and violence, and that all countries face challenges in these areas; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Acknowledges </i>the work undertaken by the Commission on the Status of Women, the 
Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, the special 
rapporteurs of the Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and 
trafficking of persons, including women and children, contemporary forms of slavery and other 
relevant United Nations bodies, agencies and mechanisms to eliminate discrimination in law and 
practice throughout the world; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Welcomes</i> particularly the work undertaken by the Committee on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women on women&#8217;s equality before the law; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Recognizes</i> the important role played by the Council in addressing the issue of 
discrimination against women, in both law and practice; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Welcomes</i> the convening of a panel on equality before the law during the eleventh 
session of the Council; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Notes</i> that, although human rights treaty bodies and special procedures do, to some 
extent, address discrimination against women within their mandates, their attention to such 
discrimination is not systematic; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Takes</i> <i>note</i> of the report commissioned by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue of a mechanism to address laws that 
discriminate against women;</p>

 <p></p>
<p> 13. <i>Decides</i> to appoint, for a period of three years, an independent expert on women&#8217;s 
equality before the law, based on international obligations and commitments by States, whose 
tasks will be: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To develop a dialogue with States, relevant United Nations bodies and funds, 
national human rights institutions and civil society organizations, in order to identify, promote 
and exchange views on best practices related to women&#8217;s equality before the law and, in that 
regard, to prepare a compendium of best practices; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To advance the work by undertaking a study, in cooperation with and reflecting the 
views of Governments and relevant United Nations bodies, funds and mechanisms, national 
human rights institutions and civil society organizations on ways and means to cooperate with 
States in fulfilling their commitments to eliminate legalized discrimination against women;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To make recommendations on the improvement of laws that could contribute to the 
realization of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular of Goal 3 to promote gender 
equality and empower women, and to identify, in this regard, areas where technical assistance 
will be required by States and to identify which agencies can provide such assistance in a timely 
and effective manner; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To elaborate thematic reports on ways to overcome laws that discriminate against 
women with regard to their civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To work in close coordination with other special procedures and subsidiary organs of 
the Council, other relevant international bodies and the treaty bodies, in particular the 
Commission on the Status of Women, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and the composite United Nations gender entity, taking into account the views of 
other stakeholders, including relevant regional human rights mechanisms, national human rights 
institutions and civil society organizations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To report annually, including with conclusions and recommendations, to the Council 
in accordance with its programme of work, the first time no later than at its sixteenth session.
