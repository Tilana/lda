Planned Board and Management Changes
Vast Resources plc, the AIM listed mining company with operations in Romania and Zimbabwe,
announces  that  it  is  in  advanced  discussions  with  a  figure  based  in  the  City  of  London  with
significant mining experience with a view to his appointment as a non-executive director of the
Company.    At  the  time  of  this  new  appointment,  Graham  Briggs  would  step  down  as  a  non-
executive director of the Company and assume the position of Chief Executive of the Company's
Zimbabwe operations.
Pierre Joubert, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, who is based in South Africa, has
decided  that  he  will  relinquish  his  position  with  effect  from  30  September  2016  after  the
publication of the Annual Report and the holding of the Annual General Meeting.  The Company
will be seeking to appoint a UK-based Chief Financial Officer to replace him.
These changes will have the effect of rebalancing the board and management in light of of the
Company's increasing operations in Europe.
