</p>
<p>Human Rights submit to the Human Rights Council an annual report containing 
</p>
<p>information on relevant developments regarding the rights of persons belonging to national 
</p>
<p>or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities in the work of United Nations human rights

<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) at its headquarters and in the field. 
</p>
<p>During the reporting period, OHCHR continued to prioritize the protection of 
</p>
<p>minorities, as illustrated by the pronouncements to that effect made on several occasions by 
</p>
<p>the High Commissioner. The activities undertaken this year by OHCHR in line with the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guidance note of the Secretary-General on racial discrimination and protection of 
</p>
<p>minorities&#8221; demonstrate that progress has been achieved in providing support to 
</p>
<p>governments, and to minorities to claim their individual rights, but serious challenges 
</p>
<p>remain in terms of implementation of these rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolutions 13/12 of 2010 and 22/4 of 2013 
</p>
<p>concerning the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 
</p>
<p>minorities, requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) to present an annual report to the Council containing information on 
</p>
<p>relevant developments in the work of United Nations human rights bodies and mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>as well as on the activities undertaken by OHCHR at its headquarters and in the field, that 
</p>
<p>contribute to the promotion of, and respect for, the provisions of the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities 
</p>
<p>(&#8220;the Declaration&#8221;). The present report covers activities carried out by OHCHR in 2014. 
</p>
<p>2. During the reporting period, OHCHR provided support to member States in their 
</p>
<p>efforts to protect minority rights and engaged with regional and national actors, including 
</p>
<p>minority representatives, with a view to responding to their needs and improving their 
</p>
<p>capacity to prevent and address challenges to their rights. It also supported system-wide 
</p>
<p>efforts to advance minority rights, in particular by coordinating the work of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations network on racial discrimination and protection of minorities, which was 
</p>
<p>established in 2012 by the Secretary-General. The &#8220;Guidance note of the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>on racial discrimination and protection of minorities&#8221;, developed by the network, was 
</p>
<p>adopted by the Secretary-General in 2013, and OHCHR has engaged in various activities to 
</p>
<p>implement its 19 recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights at its headquarters and in the field 
</b></p>
<p>3. OHCHR strives to ensure that the principles of the Declaration and other relevant 
</p>
<p>human rights standards are used more effectively to support the participation of minorities 
</p>
<p>in decision-making and to strengthen human rights protection at the national level. OHCHR 
</p>
<p>is determined to combat exclusion, marginalization and abuse of people on the basis of their 
</p>
<p>perceived race, their indigenous, ethnic or religious background, their colour, gender, caste 
</p>
<p>status, disability, age, health status, or sexual orientation. As such, throughout the year, the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioners have stressed in public statements the importance of advancing non-
</p>
<p>discrimination and protection of minorities.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Work to strengthen advocacy and capacity 
</b></p>
<p>4. In 2014, OHCHR marked International Roma Day on 8 April by organizing an 
</p>
<p>expert panel discussion entitled &#8220;Exposed and excluded: addressing forced eviction and the 
</p>
<p>housing rights of Roma&#8221;, which illustrated how forced eviction of Roma from their homes, 
</p>
<p>destruction of their property and deportation result in violations of the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living. Forced evictions are 
</p>
<p>incompatible with the requirements of international human rights law and contribute 
</p>
<p>directly and indirectly to violations of a range of civil, political, economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights enshrined in international human rights treaties. The event served to raise the 
</p>
<p>profile and visibility of International Roma Day and offered an important opportunity for 
</p>
<p>sharing experiences, including with Roma advocates who pursue practical work related to 
</p>
<p>preventing evictions at the national level.  
</p>
<p>5. The expert panel discussion brought together Roma rights advocates, including from 
</p>
<p>the grass roots, whose work focused on combatting violations of Roma rights to housing. </p>


<p>They explored key challenges and the role of forced evictions as a major threat to the 
</p>
<p>obligations of States to recognize, respect, protect and fulfil human rights. During the 
</p>
<p>discussions, the situation of women and children was highlighted, as they were particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to tenure insecurity, and to other human rights violations resulting from forced 
</p>
<p>evictions. The vulnerability of Roma women to intersecting forms of discrimination that 
</p>
<p>were manifested, for example, in stigmatization, marginalization and sexual violence 
</p>
<p>increased when they fell victim to forced eviction. The participants pointed out that 
</p>
<p>ensuring women&#8217;s security of tenure was crucial, regardless of age or marital, civil or social 
</p>
<p>status, and independently of their relationships with male household or community 
</p>
<p>members. The experts identified good practices that could be relied upon to prevent forced 
</p>
<p>evictions and to secure the right to adequate housing.  
</p>
<p><b>  Minorities Fellowship Programme 
</b></p>
<p>6. The annual Minorities Fellowship Programme was held between 27 October and 
</p>
<p>28 November 2014. The fellowship enables individuals from minority groups to familiarize 
</p>
<p>themselves with the United Nations human rights machinery and to reinforce their 
</p>
<p>advocacy skills. Former OHCHR minority fellows have become leaders in minority rights 
</p>
<p>advocacy, as exemplified by Rita Izs&#225;k, the current Special Rapporteur on minority issues. 
</p>
<p>7. In 2014, the programme was strengthened, including through the introduction of a 
</p>
<p>practical training module that covered project design, effective fund-raising for human 
</p>
<p>rights, and documenting human rights violations. A Russian-language component was 
</p>
<p>added. The OHCHR Minorities Fellowship Programme benefits from interpretation into 
</p>
<p>Arabic, English and Russian. In 2014, the fellows came from Egypt, Estonia, Georgia, Iraq, 
</p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Mauritania, Nepal, Nicaragua, Pakistan, the Syrian Arab Republic 
</p>
<p>and Yemen. The Senior Minority Fellowship Programme brought to Geneva a minority 
</p>
<p>advocate from Lithuania who worked within the Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Section 
</p>
<p>of OHCHR in order to gain specialized knowledge that she could take back to her 
</p>
<p>community. In parallel, as part of the National Minority Fellowship, two minority fellows 
</p>
<p>continued their training by working with United Nations presences and human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions in Colombia and Nigeria. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional and country engagement activities: selected areas of focus 
</b></p>
<p>8. Many serious human rights violations targeting minorities were denounced by the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner during the reporting period. For example, the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>made several statements regarding gross violations by the <i>takfiri</i> group, the so-called 
</p>
<p>Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). On 25 September 2014, he expressed his &#8220;deep 
</p>
<p>dismay at the situation facing hundreds of captured Yezidi women and girls, as well as 
</p>
<p>some from other ethnic and religious groups, who have reportedly been sold into slavery, 
</p>
<p>forced into marriage and repeatedly raped by ISIL fighters since their home areas were 
</p>
<p>overrun in August.&#8221; The High Commissioner said, &#8220;these latest killings, and the ongoing 
</p>
<p>abductions and enslavement of women and children, illustrate the utterly poisonous nature 
</p>
<p>of this <i>takfiri</i> group, and demonstrate the similarities between it and other groups such as 
</p>
<p>Boko Haram in Nigeria, which is also treating large numbers of women and girls in an 
</p>
<p>abominable fashion. The fact that such groups try to attract more people to their cause by 
</p>
<p>asserting that their acts are supported by Islam is a further gross perversion.&#8221;1 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Statement to the Security Council, on Iraq, by Zeid Ra&#8217;ad Al Hussein, United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, 18 November 2014.<b> </b> </p>


<p>9. In cooperation with the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Alliance 
</p>
<p>of Iraqi Minorities, OHCHR organized the Conference on the Promotion and Protection of 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Iraq&#8217;s Diverse Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Communities. Held in 
</p>
<p>Baghdad from 26 to 28 March 2014, the conference was the first to bring together 
</p>
<p>representatives of all of Iraq&#8217;s ethnic, religious, linguistic and cultural communities. The 
</p>
<p>issues discussed at the conference included developing strategies to strengthen 
</p>
<p>(a) protection and security; (b) effective political and economic participation; (c) enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of social cultural rights, with a specific focus on education; and (d) representation of 
</p>
<p>various communities. The outcome of the conference was a declaration/statement of 
</p>
<p>principles on rights and protections for Iraq&#8217;s diverse ethnic, cultural, religious and 
</p>
<p>linguistic communities, and a road map to ensure the protection of members of minorities 
</p>
<p>from violence and to enhance their equal participation in public life. In addition, a 
</p>
<p>committee was established to follow up on the road map and to prepare an action plan for 
</p>
<p>its implementation.  
</p>
<p>10. In its August 2014 report, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic reported that members of ISIL had committed war crimes and 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity and posed a clear and present danger to civilians &#8212; and 
</p>
<p>particularly minorities &#8212; under its control in the Syrian Arab Republic and in the region. 
</p>
<p>11. In Libya, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2144 (2014), which defines 
</p>
<p>the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), including its 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Division, the OHCHR human rights component continued to engage with 
</p>
<p>minority groups and to monitor and report on violations against minorities within its 
</p>
<p>general monitoring mandate. UNSMIL held meetings with representatives from the 
</p>
<p>Amazigh Supreme Council, the National Tabu Gathering and the Tuareg Supreme Council, 
</p>
<p>as well as with human rights defenders and members of the Parliament.  
</p>
<p>12. In Yemen, with a view to ensuring that the Muhamasheen participated in the post-
</p>
<p>2015 development agenda consultations, OHCHR conducted a workshop for a group of 30 
</p>
<p>representatives from that community, so that they could voice their priority concerns and 
</p>
<p>their perspectives on future solutions. Muhamasheen representatives were invited to take 
</p>
<p>part in a consultation with OHCHR&#8217;s Yemen office during the preparation of the OHCHR 
</p>
<p>country office note, and in the technical meetings for the development of Yemen&#8217;s national 
</p>
<p>human rights strategy. They also took part in a number of capacity-building activities 
</p>
<p>organized by OHCHR that were focused on anti-discrimination and minority rights.  
</p>
<p>13. As part of the implementation of the guidance note, OHCHR organized a regional 
</p>
<p>consultation on minority rights in the Middle East and North Africa region, entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strengthening minority rights protection in the Middle East and North Africa region 
</p>
<p>through national implementation of recommendations from the United Nations human 
</p>
<p>rights machinery&#8221;. Held in Tunis on 2 and 3 December 2014, the consultation allowed 
</p>
<p>participants, who included representatives of national human rights institutions, non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, the media, and United Nations entities, to share strategies and 
</p>
<p>tools for national actors to translate recommendations into action. Participants also explored 
</p>
<p>the relationship between United Nations mechanisms and national frameworks and 
</p>
<p>institutions, and how they could interact to promote the rights of minorities at the national 
</p>
<p>and regional levels. 
</p>
<p>14. The conclusions of the consultation included (a) a review of the status of 
</p>
<p>implementation of minority rights recommendations specific to the region and emanating 
</p>
<p>from treaty bodies, the universal periodic review and special procedures; (b) requirements 
</p>
<p>for compliance with minority rights principles in the region: what works, especially 
</p>
<p>regarding the situation of minority women and girls; and (c) recommendations for future 
</p>
<p>work to strengthen the engagement of various stakeholders and of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>system as a whole. </p>


<p>15. OHCHR held a workshop for human rights defenders, including minority 
</p>
<p>representatives, in May 2014 in Turkey, which focused on how best to monitor and report 
</p>
<p>on alleged human rights violations in the Syrian Arab Republic. It covered issues related to 
</p>
<p>discrimination, sectarianism, and incitement to hatred against vulnerable communities. 
</p>
<p>16. In Central Asia, OHCHR provided support for national consultations on the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review in Bishkek and Osh in May 2014. These brought together State 
</p>
<p>authorities, civil society and national human rights institutions to discuss the limited 
</p>
<p>participation and representation of minorities in public and political life, language rights 
</p>
<p>and access to education for minorities, freedom of religion and belief, and other problems 
</p>
<p>related to discrimination against minorities.  
</p>
<p>17. In the Republic of Moldova, OHCHR&#8217;s activities with the United Nations country 
</p>
<p>team throughout the year included joint work with UN-Women and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Programme on the empowerment of Romani women and girls, including 
</p>
<p>providing support for the establishment of a civil society network for Romani women and 
</p>
<p>girls.  
</p>
<p>18. The Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, deployed in March 2014, reports 
</p>
<p>that while incidents of violent attacks against minorities remain isolated and rare, religious 
</p>
<p>minority representatives from Protestant, Greek Catholic and Muslim communities 
</p>
<p>continue to face persecution and intimidation in the eastern part of the country with armed 
</p>
<p>groups detaining clergy and parishioners and seizing church buildings. The Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has also reported about persistent acts of intimidation 
</p>
<p>targeting the Crimean Tatars in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. 
</p>
<p>19. OHCHR provided guidance to the United Nations country team in Myanmar on the 
</p>
<p>international standards applicable to non-discrimination and the principle of self-
</p>
<p>identification, in line with article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights and related jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee. 
</p>
<p>20. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, OHCHR continued to deliver technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to Afro-Bolivian organizations and the Ministry of Education. For example, 
</p>
<p>OHCHR provided technical assistance, in May and September 2014, to Afro-Bolivian 
</p>
<p>organizations in connection with their participation in the first regular session of the 
</p>
<p>National Committee against Racism and all Forms of Discrimination, in order to empower 
</p>
<p>those organizations to participate effectively in the discussions. For the first time, 
</p>
<p>23 September was commemorated as the national day of the Afro-Bolivian people, by both 
</p>
<p>the Government and Afro-Bolivian communities.  
</p>
<p>21. Pursuant to resolution 23/18 of the Human Rights Council, the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>deployed a fact-finding mission to the Central African Republic to collect information on 
</p>
<p>human rights violations committed in Bangui and other localities between 10 December 
</p>
<p>2012 and 11 July 2013. That mission was followed by an OHCHR monitoring mission. In 
</p>
<p>its report dated 28 January 2014, and in light of the violations committed on the basis of 
</p>
<p>religious affiliation, the mission recommended to the Transitional Government to &#8220;organize 
</p>
<p>free, fair, credible and transparent presidential and legislative elections following an 
</p>
<p>inclusive and transparent consultation process, without any discrimination based on 
</p>
<p>ethnicity, religion or political affiliation, and enhance the participation of women in the 
</p>
<p>electoral process and at the decision-making level&#8221;, and to &#8220;support initiatives fostering the 
</p>
<p>peaceful coexistence of communities, such as the platform for dialogue established by 
</p>
<p>Christian and Muslim religious leaders&#8221; (A/HRC/24/59). 
</p>
<p>22. In 2013, OHCHR completed three studies to improve the situation of minorities in 
</p>
<p>Central Asia. These include &#8220;Minorities and the media in Kazakhstan&#8221;, &#8220;Participation of 
</p>
<p>minorities in public life in Kyrgyzstan&#8221; and &#8220;Access of minorities to education in 
</p>
<p>Tajikistan&#8221;. In 2014, two-page fact sheets containing the main findings and </p>


<p>recommendations from those studies were prepared, which were translated into Russian, 
</p>
<p>Kyrgyz, Uzbek and Ukrainian, and were also made available in the various state, official 
</p>
<p>and minority languages as well as in English. The fact sheets seek to make the key findings 
</p>
<p>accessible to a broader audience and to strengthen advocacy at the regional level. 
</p>
<p>23. OHCHR issued two one-page fact sheets entitled &#8220;Addressing forced evictions of 
</p>
<p>Roma&#8221; and &#8220;The inclusion of religious minorities in consultative and decision-making 
</p>
<p>bodies&#8221;. These are distributed to civil society and to State authorities during consultations 
</p>
<p>and other events with a view to raising awareness on what can be done to strengthen 
</p>
<p>protection of minority rights in specific areas. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Strengthening the capacity of United Nations country teams 
</b></p>
<p>24. In line with the guidance note, OHCHR held a training course on minority rights for 
</p>
<p>the United Nations country team in Pakistan on 6 and 7 May 2014, which brought together 
</p>
<p>participants from several United Nations agencies and programmes. A briefing, on minority 
</p>
<p>rights and the guidance note, was organized for senior staff. In addition, a session was 
</p>
<p>added to the course for senior staff of UN-Women Pakistan, which focused on the role of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations system in ensuring that its strategies and actions take into consideration 
</p>
<p>the special situation of minority women, including in terms of criminal justice responses to 
</p>
<p>harmful traditional practices and violence against women. Participants stressed that 
</p>
<p>effective United Nations action required continuous dialogue with a diverse representation 
</p>
<p>of minority women, including with a view to ensuring their contributions to the design and 
</p>
<p>implementation of United Nations action. 
</p>
<p>25. On 1 December 2014, OHCHR convened a training session in Tunis on racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination and the protection of minorities. Organized pursuant to the guiding 
</p>
<p>principles and recommendations established under the guidance note, the training session 
</p>
<p>brought together participants from several United Nations agencies and programmes to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the capacity of the United Nations country team by looking at anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination and protection of minorities at the national and regional levels. 
</p>
<p>26. OHCHR provided programmatic and advisory services support to United Nations 
</p>
<p>field presences. For example, it conducted a human rights assessment fact-finding mission 
</p>
<p>to the Sand&#382;ak<b>/</b>Ra&#353;ka region in<b> </b>Serbia, and drafted for the United Nations country team a 
</p>
<p>human rights profile for one of the most remote and economically disadvantaged regions of 
</p>
<p>the country in which minorities reside compactly. The human rights assessment identified 
</p>
<p>implementation gaps and highlighted the role that national stakeholders, non-national 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and the United Nations system as a whole could play in filling the gaps in 
</p>
<p>addressing the rights of minority communities. It has also pointed to appropriate entry 
</p>
<p>points for programmatic interventions to help define strategies for better protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights and minority rights in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Forum on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Forum on Minority Issues, established by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 6/15, and renewed in resolution 19/23 of 23 March 2012, provides an annual 
</p>
<p>platform for dialogue and cooperation on issues pertaining to persons belonging to national 
</p>
<p>or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. The annual session of the Forum is prepared 
</p>
<p>under the guidance of the Special Rapporteur on minority issues. The Forum&#8217;s seventh 
</p>
<p>session was held on 25 and 26 November 2014; its topic was &#8220;Preventing and addressing 
</p>
<p>violence and atrocity crimes targeted against minorities&#8221;, and it aimed to increase 
</p>
<p>awareness of the obligations of States under international law to protect minorities against </p>


<p>violence by creating and/or strengthening institutional and policy frameworks for minority 
</p>
<p>rights protection.  
</p>
<p>28. On 24 November 2014, the day preceding the Forum session, OHCHR held a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dialogue on the role of the United Nations in preventing and addressing violence and 
</p>
<p>atrocity crimes against minorities&#8221;. The dialogue provided an opportunity to share 
</p>
<p>experiences and practices that are effective in strengthening prevention and protection 
</p>
<p>capacities in various contexts, such as: (a) addressing discrimination and securing effective 
</p>
<p>participation of minorities in times of peace; (b) preventing violence by facilitating national 
</p>
<p>engagement, including with human rights mechanisms, when identity-related tensions exist; 
</p>
<p>and (c) responding to violence in situations of widespread and systematic attacks against 
</p>
<p>minorities during conflict and post-conflict situations. The first panel looked at the global 
</p>
<p>perspective and the role of United Nations mechanisms, as regards preventing violence and 
</p>
<p>atrocity crimes against minorities. The second panel considered the role of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and lessons learned, with regard to the prevention of violence and atrocity crimes 
</p>
<p>against minorities at the country level. The discussions served to identify approaches that 
</p>
<p>work best, by examining United Nations action ranging from human rights advocacy work 
</p>
<p>at OHCHR headquarters and in the field, to humanitarian action involving peacebuilding 
</p>
<p>and peacekeeping during conflict and post-conflict situations and involving a variety of 
</p>
<p>United Nations actors. 
</p>
<p><b> III. United Nations network on racial discrimination 
and protection of minorities  
</b></p>
<p>29. In order to enhance the combined impact of the work of the United Nations system 
</p>
<p>in this area, the Secretary-General established, on 6 March 2012, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>network on racial discrimination and protection of minorities. The network is designed to 
</p>
<p>enhance dialogue and cooperation between relevant United Nations departments, agencies, 
</p>
<p>programmes and funds. 
</p>
<p>30. The network, in response to the recommendations of the guidance note, developed a 
</p>
<p>four-year action plan. As part of the plan, the network is tasked, inter alia, with facilitating 
</p>
<p>knowledge exchange opportunities, including through training on racial discrimination and 
</p>
<p>protection of minorities for United Nations country teams, while underscoring the gender 
</p>
<p>dimension of exclusion. One of the goals envisaged under the action plan is to ensure that 
</p>
<p>existing and future subregional United Nations system initiatives on racial discrimination 
</p>
<p>and protection of minorities draw on the guidance note and on existing good practices and 
</p>
<p>lessons learned.  
</p>
<p>31. The training courses organized by OHCHR in 2014 helped to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>capacity of United Nations presences to support national authorities to take urgent steps to 
</p>
<p>guarantee respect for minority rights, and to put into place protective measures against the 
</p>
<p>perpetration of violence against minorities and bring to justice the perpetrators of attacks 
</p>
<p>against members of religious minorities.  
</p>
<p>32. The network is currently working on a guidance tool, for the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p>on discrimination based on work and descent. The guidance tool responds to the specific 
</p>
<p>action point in the action plan about developing &#8220;guidance for the United Nations system 
</p>
<p>on key challenges, priorities and strategic approaches to combat discrimination based on 
</p>
<p>work and descent&#8221;. In accordance with the action plan, the tool will draw on &#8220;existing 
</p>
<p>United Nations tools and standards, including general recommendation No. 29 on &#8216;descent&#8217; 
</p>
<p>of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. Another example of the activities envisaged under the action plan relates to joint 
</p>
<p>advocacy strategies to follow up on recommendations from human rights mechanisms. </p>


<p>OHCHR, together with the network, organized an expert consultation for the Middle East 
</p>
<p>and North Africa region that focused on joint strategies to support follow-up on 
</p>
<p>recommendations from various human rights mechanisms regarding minority rights issues. 
</p>
<p>In order to facilitate awareness-raising about the content of the guidance note, the network 
</p>
<p>is publishing it in several United Nations official languages. 
</p>
<p>34. One of the action points calls for intensifying system-wide interaction with 
</p>
<p>mechanisms such as the Forum on Minority Issues. It is in this context that OHCHR made 
</p>
<p>its first-ever intervention on behalf of the network, at the Forum&#8217;s seventh session. The 
</p>
<p>relevance, to the United Nations system, of this year&#8217;s Forum theme is also reflected in the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General&#8217;s guidance note, which highlights the importance of taking enhanced 
</p>
<p>action to advance the rights of minorities by, inter alia, encouraging &#8220;constructive 
</p>
<p>management of diversity to address identity-based tensions, including culturally attuned 
</p>
<p>preventive measures focusing on the most important risk factors&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>35. Human rights treaty bodies have addressed minority issues throughout the reporting 
</p>
<p>period, as illustrated by the following examples.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Concluding observations 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Human Rights Committee, at its 110th session (10&#8211;28 March 2014) adopted 
</p>
<p>concluding observations<b> </b>on Kyrgyzstan, the United States of America, and Latvia. The 
</p>
<p>Committee noted Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s efforts to integrate minorities into political and public life, 
</p>
<p>but remained concerned about the low level of representation of minorities in political and 
</p>
<p>public institutions both at the national and the local level (CCPR/C/KGZ/CO/2). With 
</p>
<p>regard to the United States of America, the Committee remained concerned about the 
</p>
<p>practice of racial profiling, and about surveillance by law enforcement officials targeting 
</p>
<p>certain ethnic minorities, notably Muslims (CCPR/C/USA/CO/4). As regards the 
</p>
<p>concluding observations on Latvia, the Committee addressed questions of the status of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;non-citizen&#8221; residents and the situation of linguistic minorities in the country 
</p>
<p>(CCPR/C/LVA/CO/3). 
</p>
<p>37. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, at its 52nd session 
</p>
<p>(28 April&#8211;23 May 2014), adopted concluding observations on China, including Hong 
</p>
<p>Kong, China, and Macao, China. The Committee expressed concern that, despite the 
</p>
<p>measures adopted by Hong Kong, China to ensure equal access to 12-year free education, 
</p>
<p>children of ethnic minorities continued to face discrimination. The Committee 
</p>
<p>recommended that Hong Kong, China ensure, through legislative and other measures, that 
</p>
<p>all children, including ethnic minority children, have free access to compulsory education 
</p>
<p>on an equal basis with other children (E/C.12/CHN/CO/2). 
</p>
<p>38. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, at its 84th session (3&#8211;
</p>
<p>21 February 2014), reviewing the seventh, eighth and ninth periodic reports of Switzerland, 
</p>
<p>remained concerned that Traveller communities and Yenish, Manush, Sinti and Roma 
</p>
<p>continue to face obstacles in accessing education and in preserving their language and 
</p>
<p>lifestyle. The Committee recommends that the State party strengthen its efforts to promote 
</p>
<p>and protect the rights of national minorities, particularly with regard to access to education 
</p>
<p>and preservation of their language and lifestyle (CERD/C/CHE/CO/7-9).  
</p>
<p>39. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, at its 65th session (13&#8211;31 January 2014), 
</p>
<p>adopted concluding observations on Germany. It expressed concern about the rise of the 
</p>
<p>poverty rate and the at-risk-of-poverty rate among children, with children from single-</p>


<p>parent families, large families, and families from ethnic minority backgrounds being 
</p>
<p>particularly affected. The Committee regretted the fact that children from ethnic-minority 
</p>
<p>backgrounds had a significantly weaker record of school achievement, leaving school 
</p>
<p>without having graduated from it twice as often as pupils from non-ethnic-minority 
</p>
<p>backgrounds (CRC/C/DEU/CO/3-4).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Committee against Torture, at its 50th session (6&#8211;31 May 2013), in regard to the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands, expressed concern at the alleged incidents of illegal use of force, insults and 
</p>
<p>mistreatment at the Koraal Specht prison in Cura&#231;ao and in the cells at police stations on 
</p>
<p>the islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Sint Maarten, as well as at ethnic profiling by the police 
</p>
<p>and border guards that had been aimed in particular at foreigners and members of 
</p>
<p>minorities. It requested the State party to establish systems to obtain disaggregated data 
</p>
<p>about the composition of the detainee population to avoid disproportionate representation of 
</p>
<p>minorities (CAT/C/NLD/CO/5-6). At its 51st session (28 October&#8211;22 November 2013), 
</p>
<p>adopting concluding observations on Portugal, the Committee was concerned at reports of 
</p>
<p>discrimination and abuses against Roma and other minorities by the police. The Committee 
</p>
<p>added that the State party should take effective measures to ensure the protection of 
</p>
<p>members of the Roma community (CAT/C/PRT/CO/5-6). 
</p>
<p><b> B. General comments and general recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women adopted, in 
</p>
<p>November 2013, its general recommendation No. 30 on women in conflict prevention, 
</p>
<p>conflict and post-conflict situations, some provisions of which requested that States address 
</p>
<p>the needs of women belonging to minorities. It was noted in the general recommendation 
</p>
<p>that during and after conflict, specific groups of women and girls were at particular risk of 
</p>
<p>violence, especially sexual violence, for example women of diverse caste, ethnic, national 
</p>
<p>or religious identities, or of other minorities, who were often attacked as symbolic 
</p>
<p>representatives of their community. The general recommendation also considered the 
</p>
<p>specific risks and particular needs of different groups of internally displaced and refugee 
</p>
<p>women who were subjected to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including 
</p>
<p>women with disabilities, older women, girls, widows, women who headed households, 
</p>
<p>pregnant women, women living with HIV/AIDS, rural women, indigenous women, women 
</p>
<p>belonging to ethnic, national, sexual or religious minorities, and women human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, as well as stateless women and girls in times of conflict (CEDAW/C/GC/30).  
</p>
<p>42. A joint general recommendation/general comment No. 31 of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women and No. 18 of the Committee on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child on harmful practices was adopted in November 2014. The Committees 
</p>
<p>recommended to States parties to both Conventions to take all appropriate measures to 
</p>
<p>ensure that stigma and discrimination were not perpetuated against the victims of harmful 
</p>
<p>practices and/or against the practising immigrant or minority communities.  
</p>
<p>43. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted its general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 1 in April 2014, in which it was recalled that article 12 of the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities affirmed that all persons with disabilities had full 
</p>
<p>legal capacity. It was noted in general comment No. 1 that legal capacity had been 
</p>
<p>prejudicially denied to many groups throughout history, including women (particularly 
</p>
<p>upon marriage) and ethnic minorities (CRPD/C/GC/1). In its general comment No. 2, also 
</p>
<p>adopted in April 2014, the Committee added that States parties should take appropriate 
</p>
<p>measures to enable persons with disabilities to have the opportunity to develop and utilize 
</p>
<p>their creative, artistic and intellectual potential. The Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities, in article 30, paragraph 4, provides that persons with disabilities are </p>


<p>entitled, on an equal basis with others, to recognition and support of their specific cultural 
</p>
<p>and linguistic identity, which includes sign languages and deaf culture (CRPD/C/GC/2). 
</p>
<p><b> V. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Thematic reports 
</b></p>
<p>44. In her report to the Human Rights Council on her mission to Indonesia, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
</p>
<p>living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, Raquel Rolnik, raised her 
</p>
<p>concern with &#8220;reports received about forced relocation of religious minorities (particularly 
</p>
<p>Shia and Ahmadiyya communities) that has been instigated by mobs, and based on 
</p>
<p>religious incitement&#8221; (A/HRC/25/54/Add.1, para. 72). In a press release dated 2 June 2014, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Heiner Bielefeldt, expressed his 
</p>
<p>utmost concern at &#8220;the recent surge of violent attacks against Ahmadiyya Muslims by 
</p>
<p>militant extremists. Such violence is fuelled by existing blasphemy legislation in Pakistan 
</p>
<p>particularly targeting minorities.&#8221; Mr. Bielefeldt went on to urge Pakistan to &#8220;guarantee the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of religion or belief of members of minority religious communities&#8221;.2  
</p>
<p>45. In the report of the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</p>
<p>and of association, which was presented to the Human Rights Council at its 26th session, 
</p>
<p>held from 10 to 27 June 2014, the Special Rapporteur, Maina Kiai, documented the 
</p>
<p>challenges faced by marginalized groups, including minorities, in exercising and in seeking 
</p>
<p>to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur emphasized that &#8220;the process of registering an association may prove to be 
</p>
<p>cumbersome for marginalized groups and exclude groups such as minorities or persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities. For example, the language used to communicate could be inaccessible&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/26/29, para. 54). He also urged States to &#8220;take measures to protect and promote the 
</p>
<p>rights of minorities and their identity and take positive action to help minority cultures 
</p>
<p>flourish&#8221; (ibid., para. 18). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Press statements 
</b></p>
<p>46. Along with other United Nations experts, the Special Rapporteur on minority issues 
</p>
<p>reiterated her grave concern over the situation in Iraq in a press statement dated 12 August 
</p>
<p>2014: &#8220;All possible measures must be taken urgently to avoid a mass atrocity and potential 
</p>
<p>genocide within days or hours &#8212; civilians need to be protected on the ground and escorted 
</p>
<p>out of situations of extreme peril&#8230; The responsibility to protect populations at risk of 
</p>
<p>atrocity crimes falls both on the Iraqi Government and on the international community.&#8221;3 
</p>
<p>47. On 14 August 2014, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on minority issues expressed their grave concern at the situation of 
</p>
<p>Pakistani asylum seekers in Sri Lanka who were being detained and forcefully deported to 
</p>
<p>Pakistan without an adequate assessment of their asylum claims. &#8220;Most asylum seekers 
</p>
<p>from Pakistan belong to religious minorities, including Ahmadiyya Muslim, Christian and 
</p>
<p>Shia, groups that are often subjected to persecution, discrimination and violence in 
</p>
<p>Pakistan,&#8221; said the Special Rapporteur on minority issues. &#8220;Such violence is fuelled by

<p>existing blasphemy legislation particularly targeting minorities and a lack of protective 
</p>
<p>measures for them in Pakistan,&#8221; added the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief.4 
</p>
<p>48. On 2 August 2014, on the occasion of the Roma Holocaust seventieth anniversary 
</p>
<p>commemoration, the Special Rapporteur on minority issues, together with the Special 
</p>
<p>Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, called for stronger measures and 
</p>
<p>initiatives to keep the memory of the Roma Holocaust alive and to enable survivors, Roma 
</p>
<p>communities and others to mark it in a recognized and dignified manner.  
</p>
<p>49. On 25 July 2014, in a press statement and on the situation in Iraq, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on minority issues, and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, stated that ethnic and religious minorities were bearing 
</p>
<p>the brunt of the conflict and that if protection measures were not taken urgently, the impact 
</p>
<p>of the conflict on minorities would be &#8220;devastating and irreversible&#8221;. Ms. Izs&#225;k added that 
</p>
<p>she was gravely concerned about the physical safety of several minority groups in the 
</p>
<p>country, including Christians, Shia, Shabaks, Turkmen and Yazidis, who were &#8220;subjected to 
</p>
<p>abductions, killings or the confiscation of their property by extremist groups&#8221;, and some of 
</p>
<p>whom were given &#8220;an ultimatum that by 19 July, they should convert, pay a tax, leave the 
</p>
<p>city, or face execution&#8221;.5  
</p>
<p>50. On 23 July 2014, Ms. Izs&#225;k and Mr. Beyani explained that many of the individuals 
</p>
<p>displaced in Nigeria belonged to ethnic and religious minorities who had been victims of 
</p>
<p>violence.  
</p>
<p>51. On 2 July 2014<b>, </b>three United Nations special rapporteurs, on freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief, minority issues, and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, called on Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka to adopt urgent measures to stop the promotion of racial and faith-based hatred, and 
</p>
<p>violence against Muslim and Christian communities by Buddhist groups with extremist 
</p>
<p>views, and to bring the perpetrators of the violence to justice.6  
</p>
<p>52. In a news release on 2 June 2014, the Special Rapporteur on minority issues stressed 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;Pakistan must urgently put in place protective measures to ensure the personal 
</p>
<p>security of Ahmadiyya Muslims, as well as any other religious minorities living in the 
</p>
<p>country, under threat of hostility and violence by militant extremists.&#8221;7  
</p>
<p>53. In a statement delivered on 15 April 2014, at the end of her country visit to the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom that took place between 31 March and 15 April 2014, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, 
</p>
<p>noted that &#8220;considering their higher rates of victimization, the specific experiences and 
</p>
<p>needs of black and minority ethnic women and girls who have experienced violence need to 
</p>
<p>be acknowledged.&#8221; She stated that &#8220;the disproportionate effect that the legal aid cuts are 
</p>
<p>having on black and minority ethnic women was consistently shared with me during the 
</p>
<p>mission&#8221;. She asserted that &#8220;participation in public life is further impacted for people from 
</p>
<p>black and ethnic minority groups, who are much more likely to be in situations of poverty, 
</p>
<p>with an income of less than 60 per cent of the median household income. Finally, the

<p>Special Rapporteur emphasized that black and minority ethnic women were 
</p>
<p>&#8220;overrepresented within British prisons and immigration detention centres&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>54. Between 7 and 14 April 2014, the Special Rapporteur on minority issues conducted 
</p>
<p>a country visit to Ukraine. She released a statement on 16 April in which she reiterated that 
</p>
<p>a key pillar of minority rights is &#8220;full and equal participation in public life, including 
</p>
<p>political participation at national, regional and local levels&#8221;. She also stressed the 
</p>
<p>importance of enabling students to learn both about their own origins, cultures and 
</p>
<p>religions, and also about those of others, in a positive way that recognizes the contributions 
</p>
<p>of all groups. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>55. The universal periodic review is a key awareness-raising and advocacy mechanism 
</p>
<p>tool for the protection of human rights. It comprises three stages: (a) a review by United 
</p>
<p>Nations Member States; (b) the implementation of the recommendations received during 
</p>
<p>the review; and (c) an assessment of the implementation at the next review (four-and-a-half 
</p>
<p>years later). Regarding minority rights and the first stage, at its twenty-fifth session 
</p>
<p>(3-28 March 2014), twenty-sixth session (10&#8211;27 June 2014) and twenty-seventh session 
</p>
<p>(8-26 September 2014) the Human Rights Council adopted the reports of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on the Universal Periodic Review on numerous countries. 
</p>
<p>56. In the adopted reports, minority rights issues were discussed, and several States 
</p>
<p>made recommendations relating to: (a) legislative and practical measures to ensure the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of minority rights; (b) measures aimed at protecting minorities 
</p>
<p>against discrimination, particularly in employment, housing, health and education; 
</p>
<p>(c) enhanced efforts to promote the participation of minorities in politics; (d) the 
</p>
<p>implementation and enforcement of provisions on freedom of religion and belief; and 
</p>
<p>(e) measures to tackle prejudices and eradicate racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>57. Additional recommendations included: (a) promoting religious and ethnic tolerance, 
</p>
<p>including through awareness-raising campaigns; (b) ensuring the enjoyment of social, 
</p>
<p>cultural and economic rights, including by pursing efforts to lower the infant and maternal 
</p>
<p>mortality rates experienced by minority groups; (c) ensuring that a greater provision of 
</p>
<p>resources is directed towards regions inhabited by ethnic minorities; and (d) measures to 
</p>
<p>ensure the preservation of cultural identity, including cultural relics of significance to 
</p>
<p>minority groups. Furthermore, several States adopted a significantly higher number of 
</p>
<p>recommendations relating to minority rights than they had in their previous cycles. In doing 
</p>
<p>so, States highlighted their increased recognition of the importance of developing an 
</p>
<p>environment conducive to the flourishing of population diversity. 
</p>
<p>58. The second stage (the &#8220;implementation&#8221; or &#8220;follow-up&#8221; stage) is the most crucial, as 
</p>
<p>it demonstrates States&#8217; engagement and key actions that they have taken leading to the 
</p>
<p>realization of recommendations on the ground. The third stage requires information on 
</p>
<p>implementation. In this connection, each party concerned, ranging from States to civil 
</p>
<p>society to national human rights institutions, plays a very important role. While it is not 
</p>
<p>possible to report here the results of all of the recommendations accepted by States, earlier 
</p>
<p>adopted recommendations have been translated into actions in several countries. Examples 
</p>
<p>are: (a) the adoption of a national strategy for the integration of Roma communities, which 
</p>
<p>comprises several measures in different areas to improve the situation of Roma, with 
</p>
<p>different projected dates for complete implementation; (b) the establishment of an 
</p>
<p>intersectoral task force to formulate policy guidelines for educationally marginalized 
</p>
<p>children; (c) steps taken to ensure the inclusion of minority rights in constitution-writing 
</p>
<p>processes, amendments to the constitution, and the national human rights plan; and (d) the </p>


<p>adoption of an Equal Opportunities Act, and the project for an Equal Opportunities 
</p>
<p>Commission prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of colour, sex, ethnic 
</p>
<p>origin or race. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Discrimination against minorities, and their exclusion and marginalization, 
</b></p>
<p><b>undermine human rights and threaten the peace and stability of communities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries, and eventually regions. Currently, we are witnessing increased violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against ethnic and religious groups in a number of countries. In that context, women 
</b></p>
<p><b>and girls are being particularly targeted. We have to redouble our efforts to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen protection and end persistent discrimination and impunity, particularly in 
</b></p>
<p><b>those countries where violence against minorities is resurging</b>.  
</p>
<p>60. <b>While the primary legal obligation to protect minorities remains with States, 
</b></p>
<p><b>advancing human rights requires efforts that are concerted. OHCHR has continued to

<p><b>advance minority rights via concrete action at its headquarters and in the field, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation with States, minorities and other partners. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The work carried out by independent special procedures mandate holders, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the Special Rapporteur on minority issues, in combination with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal periodic review and the work of the treaty bodies, has continued to play an 
</b></p>
<p><b>important role in protecting minority rights, raising key thematic and country-specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerns and making recommendations that contribute to the full implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the 1992 Declaration on Minorities. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Constant strengthening of cooperation between international, regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>national actors is also crucial. Guidance and resource tools that provide hands-on 
</b></p>
<p><b>suggestions to the United Nations, to States and to other stakeholders for addressing 
</b></p>
<p><b>gaps in protection can facilitate such efforts. The </b>&#8220;Guidance note of the Secretary<b>-
</b></p>
<p>General on racial discrimination and protection of minorities&#8221;<b> is such a tool. It offers 
</b></p>
<p><b>an important point of reference in strengthening advocacy to prevent and counter 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority rights violations, and the United Nations network on racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>and protection of minorities is supporting the implementation of the guidance note 
</b></p>
<p><b>through a range of concrete initiatives in line with a new action plan.
