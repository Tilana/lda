<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report seeks to explore the relationship between the agreements concluded 
under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly the Agreement on 
Agriculture, and the obligation of the Members of the WTO to respect the human right to 
adequate food. It is based on the mission of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to the 
WTO. 
</p>
<p> In the report, the Special Rapporteur argues that, if trade is to work for development and to 
contribute to the realization of the right to adequate food, it needs to recognize the specificity of 
agricultural products, rather than to treat them as any other commodities, and to allow more 
flexibilities to developing countries, particularly in order to shield their agricultural producers 
from the competition from industrialized countries&#8217; farmers. The main impacts of the current 
multilateral trade regime on the right to food include: (a) increased dependency on international 
trade which may lead to loss of export revenues when the prices of export commodities go down, 
threats to local producers when low-priced imports arrive on the domestic markets, against 
which these producers are unable to compete, and balance of payments problems for the net 
food-importing countries when the prices of food commodities go up; (b) potential abuses of 
market power in increasingly concentrated global food supply chains and further dualization of 
the domestic farming sector; and (c) potential impacts on the environment and on human health 
and nutrition, impacts that are usually ignored in international trade discussions, despite their 
close relationship to the right to adequate food. 
</p>
<p> The report proposes ways to reconcile trade with the right to food, addressing the failure of 
global governance mechanisms to tackle the lack of coordination between human rights 
obligations and trade commitments - a failure which mechanisms ensuring a better coordination 
at the domestic level may not be able to compensate for. The report invites States to assess the 
impacts of trade agreements on the right to food and ensure they do not accept undertakings 
under the WTO framework which would be incompatible with their right-to-food obligations. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report<b>1</b> seeks to explore the relationship between the Agreements concluded under the 
framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the obligation of the WTO members to 
respect the human right to adequate food, as recognized under international law. Its objective is 
to assist States in the negotiation and implementation of their commitments under the 
multilateral trade framework, in order to ensure that their commitments under trade agreements 
will support, rather than undermine, their efforts to realize the right to food at domestic level. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with staff of the WTO Secretariat and its 
Director-General, Pascal Lamy, on 25 June 2008, and with a number of representatives of 
permanent delegations to the WTO between June and October 2008. Those consultations were 
preceded by an expert meeting, held at the Universit&#233; de Paris 1-Panth&#233;on-Sorbonne on 
16-17 June 2008, and were complemented by various consultations with stakeholders, including 
non-governmental organizations and farmers&#8217; organizations. The Special Rapporteur would like 
to express his deep appreciation to all those who generously made available their time, 
knowledge and expertise, and he would like to mention, in particular, the cooperative spirit in 
which the WTO Secretariat and its Director-General provided assistance to the mission. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur in this report recalls the normative framework under which the 
relationship between the obligation to respect the human right to adequate food and the 
undertakings under the WTO agreements should be analyzed (chap. II). He then describes 
the challenges that the full realization of the right to adequate food faces in the world today 
(chap. III). Only if we correctly understand those challenges can we evaluate the WTO 
agricultural trade liberalization framework (chap. IV) and its current and potential impacts on the 
enjoyment of the right to adequate food and on the ability of the members of the WTO to realize 
this right (chap. V). The report concludes by suggesting some of the solutions that may be found 
to reconcile the right to food with a workable trading system. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE NORMATIVE CONTENT OF THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE FOOD 
</b>4. The right to adequate food is recognized under article 25 of the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights and article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. Under these instruments, States must respect existing access to adequate food, by 
abstaining from adopting measures which may result in preventing such access; they must 
protect the right to food by adopting measures ensuring that enterprises or individuals do not 
deprive individuals of their access to adequate food; finally, they must fulfil the right to food, by 
pro-actively strengthening people&#8217;s access to food and utilization of resources and means to 
ensure their livelihood and, in certain cases, by providing food directly (E/C.12/1999/5, 
para. 15).

<p>  A/HRC/10/5/Add.2 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>5. The realization of the right to adequate food should guide the efforts aimed at the 
establishment of the multilateral trading system. Article 28 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights states that &#8220;everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the 
rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized&#8221;. The right to adequate 
food can only be fully realized by States within a multilateral trading system which enables them 
to pursue policies aimed at realizing the right to food. Such a system should not only refrain 
from imposing obligations which directly infringe upon the right to food. It should also ensure 
that all States have the policy space they require to take measures which contribute to the 
progressive realization of the right to food under their jurisdiction, a goal towards which States 
should move &#8220;as expeditiously as possible&#8221; (E/C.12/1999/5, para. 9). This obligation must be 
facilitated, not impeded, by the organization of the multilateral trade regime, as also implied by 
article 11, paragraph 2, of the Covenant which recognizes the need to ensure that the regulation 
of trade contributes to the enjoyment of the right to food. 
6. An approach to international trade based on the right to food shifts the perspective from 
aggregate values - from the benefits of trade for the country as a whole - to the impacts of trade 
on the most vulnerable and food-insecure. It emphasizes the dimensions of participation and 
accountability in the negotiation and implementation of trade agreements. And it takes into 
consideration, not only the need to ensure a sufficient intake of calories for each individual, but 
also the sustainable availability and accessibility of adequate food, i.e., containing the required 
nutrients for the physical and mental health of individuals and development of children, and 
culturally acceptable. All these dimensions are generally absent from discussions about the 
impact of trade on food security. This report seeks to bring them back in. 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE CURRENT CHALLENGES FACING THE REALIZATION 
OF THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE FOOD 
</b></p>
<p>7. The realization of the human right to adequate food currently faces two main threats. First, 
questions arise as to whether, in the future, agriculture will be able to feed the planet, and as to 
whether each country will be able to feed its population, through a combination of local 
production and food imports. Population growth, combined with the switch to more 
animal-protein-rich diets in a growing number of countries, and the diversion of food crops for 
the production of agrofuels, increases the pressure on the supply side of the global equation. 
Climate change threatens the ability of entire regions, particularly those relying on rain-fed 
agriculture, to maintain current levels of agricultural production. As noted by the International 
Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD),<b>2</b> the challenge 
is therefore to produce more food, but to do this in a way which preserves the environment, 
particularly by reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to global 
warming. 
</p>
<p>8. The second challenge is to ensure accessibility of food for the poor and the marginalized. 
Food insecurity exists even in countries where there is food in abundance, due to the lack of 
purchasing power of certain segments of the population. Trading more food will not help them if 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>they are excluded from production and have no means to buy the food which arrives on the 
markets. The majority of hungry people in the world are located in developing countries, live in 
rural areas, and depend on agriculture directly or indirectly for their livelihoods. They are hungry 
because they are poor: they are often net buyers of food,<b>3</b> and their incomes, which are on 
average significantly lower than those of the non-rural populations, are insufficient to buy the 
food which they do not produce themselves. Fifty per cent of the hungry are smallholders, living 
off 2 hectares of cropland or less; 20 per cent are landless labourers; 10 per cent are pastoralists, 
fisherfolk, and forest users; the remaining 20 per cent are the urban poor.<b>4</b> Any trade regime 
which does not benefit these categories or affects them negatively is likely to lead to further 
denial or violation of the right to food. These groups need to be protected. The idea that the 
positive impacts from trade liberalization would compensate for its negative impacts on these 
categories, by leading to net welfare gains which should benefit all categories following 
redistributive policies, does not correspond to a human rights perspective, which focuses on the 
most vulnerable; it has not always proven to be correct empirically; and it often overestimates 
the capacity of States, in the developing world, to operate such redistribution of gains. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  THE REFORM PROGRAMME IN AGRICULTURE 
</b></p>
<p>9. While other agreements concluded under the WTO framework, particularly the General 
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual 
Property Rights (TRIPs), may have an impact on the right to adequate food - since they affect 
access to productive resources by food producers - the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) 
constitutes the most important of the WTO agreements in the context of this report. The present 
report therefore focuses on this agreement.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The Agreement on Agriculture and the Doha Round 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Agreement on Agriculture rests on three pillars and essentially imposes three 
obligations on the members. First, they must increase market access for agricultural products. All 
quantitative restrictions or other non-tariff measures except those justified by health and safety 
reasons should be replaced by tariffs (art. 4.2), which the members are subsequently bound to 
reduce (art. 4.1). The process of &#8220;tariffication&#8221; and subsequent lowering of tariffs has not worked 
for the benefit of developing countries. Producers from developing countries have been facing 
important obstacles when seeking access to the high-value markets of industrialized countries. 
Many agricultural products are currently facing tariff peaks and tariff escalation (higher tariffs 
on processed products) which discourage diversification into higher value-added products,

</p>
<p>leading developing countries to an excessive dependence on an often limited number of primary 
commodities.<b>6</b> Developing countries have failed to benefit even from preferential schemes such 
as the African Growth and Opportunity Act or the Caribbean Basin Initiative of the United States 
of America, the &#8220;Everything But Arms&#8221; initiative adopted by the European Union in favor of 
least-developed countries (LDCs), or the Cotonou Agreement between the European Community 
and the Group of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP).<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>11. Second, the members must reduce the level of domestic support (calculated through the 
concept of &#8220;Aggregate Measure of Support&#8221; or AMS), although such subsidies are treated 
differently depending on how much they are considered trade-distorting. All Members may 
provide product specific support up to a <i>de minimis</i> threshold (5 per cent of the total value of 
production of the good concerned per year for developed countries; 10 per cent for developing 
countries), and non-specific support for the same percentage, for instance to provide seeds or 
fertilizers to producers. Few developing countries in fact have the financial means required to 
reach those levels of support. Beyond the <i>de minimis</i> threshold, Members must refrain from the 
introduction of new forms of support and reduce the existing domestic support they provide to 
their agricultural producers by 20 per cent from the base period of 1986-1988 for developed 
countries, and by 13.3 per cent for developing countries (LDCs are not under any obligation to 
reduce domestic support, although they are to bind support levels). Since these percentages are 
calculated on the basis of the Base Total Aggregate Measurement of Support in the base period, 
the arrangement is most beneficial to countries which already had high levels of support during 
the base period, since their advantage can be to a certain extent maintained. 
</p>
<p>12. Some measures do not fall under such reduction commitments, which concern the 
measures under the &#8220;amber box&#8221;. &#8220;Blue box&#8221; measures are direct payments made against 
production-reducing commitments and which, therefore, are considered to be less 
trade-distorting. They are exempted from reduction commitments under the AoA. Finally, &#8220;green 
box&#8221; measures are considered not to distort trade or to distort trade only minimally and they too 
are exempt. Domestic support measures may be placed in this category (a) if they are &#8220;provided 
through a publicly-funded government programme (including government revenue foregone) not 
involving transfers from consumers&#8221;; and (b) if they do not have the effect of providing price 
support to producers (annex 2, AoA, 1). Such measures include, for instance, investments in 
research, in marketing and promotion, or the provision of rural infrastructures (although the 
&#8220;subsidized provision of on-farm facilities other than for the reticulation of generally available 
public utilities&#8221; and &#8220;subsidies to inputs or operating costs&#8221; are explicitly excluded); but also 
public stockholding for food security purposes or domestic food aid, provided it is distributed 
&#8220;subject to clearly-defined criteria related to nutritional objectives&#8221;.

</p>
<p>13. Third, the members must reduce existing export subsidies, and cannot introduce new 
export subsidies that were not already in operation in the 1986-1990 base period. Since the 
introduction of any new export subsidies is prohibited, the system has in fact been advantageous 
to the developed States, which were the only category of States to have significant export 
subsidies in place prior to the entry into force of the AoA. Export subsidies are the most harmful 
form of subsidies for the developing countries, since they lead to subsidized products arriving on 
domestic markets and displacing local production. 
</p>
<p>14. A number of provisions seek to accommodate what the preamble of the AoA refers to as 
&#8220;non-trade concerns&#8221;, among which &#8220;food security and the need to protect the environment&#8221; are 
explicitly mentioned. In particular, measures adopted by developing countries which seek to 
encourage agricultural and rural development, investment subsidies in agriculture, and 
agricultural input subsidies, are exempted from domestic support reduction commitments that 
would otherwise be applicable to such measures (art. 6.2). A number of provisions aim at 
ensuring special and differential treatment for developing countries, in the form of longer 
implementation periods and reduced commitments (art. 15). Yet, overall, the obligations 
established under the AoA clearly fit under a programme of trade liberalization in agricultural 
products. While food security is recognized as a legitimate objective, it is to be achieved in 
principle not by retreating from the programme of trade liberalization in agriculture, but by 
supporting countries through the reform programme. However, whether the domestic policies 
required to accompany the reform programme can be implemented in the countries concerned, 
with a speed commensurate to the impact of trade liberalization itself, may be doubted. 
Developing countries face a series of constraints, which in many cases makes it difficult or 
impossible for them to implement policies at domestic level, particularly by fully using the 
flexibilities they are allowed, which would allow them to maximize the benefits from trade, 
while minimizing its negative impacts. 
</p>
<p>15. The expectation, when the Uruguay Round was completed, was that this programme would 
lead to increased prices for agricultural commodities. Article 16 of the Agreement on Agriculture 
therefore provides that, in order to counteract the negative impacts this might produce on net 
food-importing developing countries, developed country members shall take the measures 
provided for under the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible 
Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least-Developed and Net Food-importing 
Developing Countries (the &#8220;Marrakesh Decision&#8221;). This decision establishes four response 
mechanisms in order to ensure that the LDCs and net food-importing developing countries 
(NFIDCs) will be able to maintain an adequate level of imports of food commodities. But the 
Marrakesh Decision has not been adequately implemented. There is no mechanism within the 
WTO to monitor systematically the impact of the AoA reform process on the NFIDCs.<b>8</b> 
Furthermore, the notion of &#8220;adequate supplies&#8221; of basic foodstuffs - which NFIDCs should be

</p>
<p>able to obtain from external sources &#8220;on reasonable terms and conditions&#8221; throughout the reform 
process - remains undefined, although it is this notion which should trigger the mechanisms 
provided for under the decision. Finally, there are difficulties with each of the four mechanisms 
which the Marrakesh Decision establishes.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>16. In the Ministerial Doha Declaration of 14 November 2001, WTO members committed 
themselves to comprehensive negotiations aimed at: substantial improvements in market access; 
reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial 
reductions in trade-distorting domestic support. They also agreed to make special and differential 
treatment for developing countries &#8220;an integral part of all elements of the negotiations&#8221;.<b>10</b> At the 
Hong Kong WTO Ministerial Meeting of 2005, it was agreed that export subsidies would end 
by 2013; that developing countries could themselves designate some products as &#8220;special 
products&#8221; for which tariff reductions will not be very stringent; and that developing countries 
can retain their permissible <i>de minimis</i> level of domestic subsidy. At the time of writing, the 
Doha Round of trade negotiations still has not been concluded. It is stumbling, particularly on 
the discussions surrounding the trade-distorting impacts of various forms of domestic support 
provided by developed countries to their farmers, and on the special safeguard measure which a 
number of developing countries insist on including in the agreement. This report does not seek to 
offer any detailed commentary of these negotiations. Rather, it aims to identify whether this 
agricultural trade reform programme is compatible with the Members&#8217; obligations towards the 
right to food. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The illusory notion of a &#8220;level playing field&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>17. If trade is to work for development and to contribute to the realization of the right to 
adequate food, it needs to recognize the specificity of agricultural products, rather than to treat 
them as any other commodities and to allow more flexibilities to developing countries, 
particularly in order to shield their agricultural producers from the competition from 
industrialized countries&#8217; farmers. The reason for this is obvious, and it is at the heart of what 
justifies special and differential treatment for developing countries: even after the removal of 
existing trade-distorting measures, which currently are disproportionately benefiting developed 
countries, the productivity per active labourer in agriculture will remain much lower in 
developing countries, on average, than in developed countries. In 2006, agricultural labour 
productivity in LDCs was just 46 percent of the level in other developing countries and below 
1 per cent of the level in developed countries. In addition, these massive differences in 
productivity are increasing: labour productivity grew by only 18 per cent in LDCs between 1983 
and 2003, by 41 per cent in other developing countries and by 62 per cent in developed 
countries.<b>11</b>

</p>
<p>18. In this context, the idea of establishing a level playing field is meaningless. The deepening 
of the reform programme under the AoA will not result in agricultural producers in developing 
countries being able to compete on equal terms with producers in industrialized countries, unless 
wages in developing countries are repressed at very low levels to compensate for a much lower 
productivity per active laborer. Certain developing countries have a highly mechanized 
agricultural sector and, particularly since the wages in the agricultural sector remain 
comparatively low in comparison to those in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) countries, have a strong comparative advantage in agriculture and would 
clearly benefit from the removal, or at least the lowering, of the trade-distorting subsidies of the 
developed countries.<b>12</b> But in other developing countries, particularly LDCs, agriculture remains 
a fragile sector. Encouraging these countries to open up their agricultural sector to competition 
by binding themselves to low rates of import tariffs may therefore constitute a serious threat to 
the right to food, particularly if we take into account that food insecurity is mostly concentrated 
in the rural areas and that a large portion of the population in the countries which are most 
vulnerable depends on agriculture for their livelihoods: in 2000-2003, 70 per cent of the 
economically active population was engaged in agriculture in the LDCs, as against 52 per cent in 
other developing countries, and 3 per cent in the developed countries.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b>V. THE IMPACTS OF THE REFORM PROGRAMME 
IN AGRICULTURE ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD 
</b></p>
<p>19. The impacts of the removal of barriers to trade in agriculture on the right to food are 
examined at three levels. First, at the macro-economic level, it may increase the vulnerability of 
countries as a result of their dependency on international trade, and it may further fragilize the 
situation of agricultural producers in certain developing countries. Second, at the 
micro-economic level, it contributes to reshaping the global food supply chain in a way which 
favors transnational corporations, whose freedom to act is broadened at the same moment as the 
regulatory tools States may resort to are being limited. Finally, international trade in agricultural 
commodities also has impacts on the environment, and on nutrition and health, which States 
cannot ignore. 
</p>
<p><b>A. The macro-economic impacts of trade liberalization:  increased  
dependency on international trade 
</b></p>
<p>20. Trade liberalization encourages each country to specialize in the production in which it has 
a comparative advantage. However, whether a country has such a comparative advantage in the 
production of any particular commodity depends not only on its natural endowments, such as 
soil or climate, but also, increasingly, on specific public policies, or on the order in which the 
respective trading partners have achieved economies of scale in particular lines of production. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  This is the case, in particular, for countries in the Cairns Group (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, 
</p>
<p>Colombia, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand and Uruguay).

<p>  UNCTAD/LDC/2006, p. 137. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/5/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>The question therefore is which incentives emerge for States, in the construction of their 
comparative advantage, from the opening of international trade. On the one hand, States may 
seek to improve the ability of their producers to benefit from the opportunities of international 
trade, and particularly, for developing countries, from better access to the high-value markets of 
industrialized countries. On the other hand, States may find that certain imported goods, such as 
processed foods, may be cheaper than producing them locally, and they may therefore increase 
their dependence on imports for feeding their population. Specialization according to 
comparative advantage thus leads to two forms of dependency: first, for the acquisition of 
foreign currency, dependency on the value of exports; second, for the ability of countries to feed 
their population, dependency on the price of imports. In addition, the arrival of cheap imports on 
domestic markets may threaten the livelihoods of local producers, if they are unable to compete. 
</p>
<p>21. The example of sub-Saharan African countries is illustrative. Due in part to the highly 
penalizing structure of tariffs in OECD countries through tariff peaks and tariff escalation, and in 
part, to the presence on international markets of highly subsidized foods produced in industrial 
countries, sub-Saharan Africa has remained dependent on traditional non-fuel primary 
commodity exports such as coffee, cotton, cocoa, tobacco, tea and sugar, and was essentially 
unable to develop into an exporter of processed food: South Africa, the largest African exporter 
of processed food, had a global market share of only 1 per cent in the period 2000-2005.<b>14</b> At the 
same time, while many African countries were net food-exporting countries until the 1970s, they 
have become for the most part net food-importing countries since the 1980s, due partly to the 
lack of investment in agriculture, and partly to the agricultural subsidies in developed market 
economies, which in turn discouraged agricultural investment.<b>15 </b>The result is well known: it has 
led to increased vulnerability of these countries both to worsening terms of trade and to 
fluctuations in commodity prices - fluctuations which are particularly important in the 
agricultural sector due to its sensitivity to weather-related events and the low elasticity of both 
supply and demand. Such volatility makes the States that are most dependent on international 
trade the most vulnerable to shocks, such as overproduction or harvest failures in other States. 
This leads to brutal price increases or declines. 
</p>
<p>22. It is the dependency of countries on food imports for feeding their population which 
produces the most immediate impacts on the right to adequate food. First, import surges may 
threaten the ability of local producers in net food-importing countries to live from their crops and 
therefore the ability to feed themselves and their families, when such import surges lead to such 
low prices on the domestic markets that they are driven out of business. Agricultural producers 
from developing countries have been facing unfair competition from highly subsidized products 
exported by farmers from OECD countries. Government support to farmers in OECD countries 
has diminished in recent years, but it remains at very high levels, making it difficult for 
developing countries to compete. Import surges have been a frequent occurrence, both

</p>
<p>before and after the entry into force of the Agreement on Agriculture. A survey covering 
102 developing countries over the period 1980-2003 documented 12,000 cases of import surges. 
The countries most affected were India and Bangladesh in Asia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Nigeria, 
Ghana and Malawi in Africa, and Ecuador and Honduras in Latin America.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>23. These import surges are the result of the lowering of import tariffs to levels significantly 
below the tariffs bound under the Agreement on Agriculture, which these countries consented 
to as part of the structural adjustment programmes imposed on them as a conditionality to 
receive loans. Yet the provisions contained in the current version of the AoA are insufficient to 
allow countries to react to the disruptions caused by import surges. Under the AoA, members 
which resorted to tariffication of their non-tariff barriers may impose &#8220;special safeguard 
measures&#8221; (SSG) in the form of additional tariffs when confronted with import surges of certain 
products - i.e., imports exceeding a specified trigger level, or whose price falls below a specified 
trigger price (art. 5). However, since most developing countries did not use tariffication, they 
cannot rely on that clause; 39 WTO members, including 22 developing countries, have reserved 
the right to resort to the special safeguard option on hundreds of products. The SSG mechanism 
was triggered by only 10 members, including 6 developing countries, between 1995 and 2001; 
and between 1995 and 2004, developing countries triggered the SSG in only 1 per cent of the 
cases in which they could have applied it.<b>17</b> These figures may be compared with the number of 
import surges experienced by developing countries. As protection against such surges, the 
current SSG mechanism is ineffective. 
</p>
<p>24. A second impact on the ability of developing countries to protect the right to adequate food 
resulting from their dependency on food imports occurs when prices undergo increases on 
international markets. In such circumstances, net food-importing countries may undergo balance 
of payments problems: the difficulties these countries encountered through the period of 
2007-2008, when these prices rose significantly, provided a vivid illustration of this risk (see 
A/HRC/9/23, annex I, paras. 6-7). The Marrakesh Decision was intended to provide an answer to 
such situation. Yet, as noted above, it has not been adequately implemented and the different 
mechanisms it established face severe difficulties. 
</p>
<p><b>B. The micro-economic impacts of trade liberalization:  the shape of the  
global food supply chain and the dualization of the farming sector 
</b></p>
<p>25. Increased cross-border trade in agricultural products implies that, as the production of food 
is reoriented towards serving foreign markets rather than domestic markets, the role of 
transnational corporations - commodity traders, food processors, and global retailers - increases.

</p>
<p>This constitutes a source of dependency for the farmers who supply them. That dependency is 
further increased by the fact that, in order to comply with the standards of global retailers, 
farmers wishing to be included in global supply chains must use external inputs, including 
improved varieties of seeds, often supplied by companies which occupy an oligopolistic position 
on the market. As a result, the farming sector is increasingly divided between one segment which 
has access to high-value markets and therefore, to the best technologies, inputs, credit, public 
support and political influence, and another segment which is left to serve only the low-value, 
domestic markets, and is comparatively neglected and marginalized, particularly as new tastes 
are introduced through international trade which they cannot satisfy. 
</p>
<p>26. Concentration in the food system is significant. This results in widening the spread 
between world and domestic prices for commodities such as wheat, rice, and sugar, for instance, 
which more than doubled between 1974 and 1994; and, since most large commodity buyers are 
based in the OECD countries, this limits the portion of the value captured by developing 
countries. Thus, developing countries&#8217; claim on value added declined from about 60 per cent in 
1970-72 to about 28 per cent in 1998-2000.<b>18</b> In industrialized and developing countries alike, 
farmers need to go through commodity traders which a have a dominant position: two companies 
control 40 per cent of the grain exports from the United States.<b>19 </b>Similar trends towards 
increased concentration occurs in the retail sector,<b>20 </b>although the speed of concentration here 
seems to have decreased in recent years.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>27. Global sourcing increases the competition between suppliers, allowing buyers to adopt 
pricing policies which reduce the share of the final value of the product which goes to the 
producers - the farmgate price, as opposed to the retail price. Transnational corporations impose 
their prices on producers; they impose standards which many small-scale farmers are unable to 
meet. Particularly for crops like wheat or soybean, for which economies of scale represent 
important productivity gains, small-scale farmers are unable to compete and are relegated to the 
lower-value local markets, unless they end up working as badly paid agricultural labourers. 
</p>
<p>28. Certain strategies may avoid small-scale farmers being squeezed out by the development 
of global supply chains: these include cooperatives, outgrower schemes, public-private initiatives

<p>and regional initiatives.<b>22</b> However, these strategies are still underdeveloped and clearly not 
sufficient. This is particularly the case since large buyers seek to minimize transaction costs, 
which are high when they seek to source from small-scale farmers who are dispersed 
geographically and are far removed from centralized collection facilities. In addition, large 
agricultural producers are better equipped to adapt to shifting demand and to comply with 
volume and traceability requirements, as well as with environmental and food safety standards 
with which global retailers increasingly seek to monitor compliance.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C. The non-economic impacts of trade liberalization: 
environmental and health dimensions 
</b></p>
<p>29. Reliance on international trade in order to achieve food security cannot ignore its impact 
on the environment and on nutrition. Climate change constitutes the single most important threat 
to food security in the future. And international law recognizes the right to adequate food, 
requiring that the diet as a whole contains an adequate mix of all essential nutrients. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Environmental dimensions 
</b></p>
<p>30. Long production chains imply long distances in transport. Road transport and air transport 
represent respectively 74 per cent and 12 per cent of the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions 
produced by transport, which itself is responsible for 23 per cent of the world energy-related 
GHG emissions.<b>24</b> They are typically used for the transport of fresh food and have a serious 
impact on climate change. This impact is increasing as consumers are encouraged to expect all 
foods to be available at all times of the year, without regard for the seasons.<b>25 </b>Such modes of 
food consumption are not sustainable in the long term. 
</p>
<p>31. Most importantly, the various modes of agricultural production may have widely different 
impacts on global warming. If clearing forest to create farmland is included, agriculture is 
estimated to be responsible for about 30 per cent of total global man-made emissions of GHGs.<b>26</b>

</p>
<p>The conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land, the expansion of rice and livestock 
production (31 per cent) and the increased use of nitrogen fertilizers (38 per cent) have all been 
significant contributors to GHG emissions, in the form of methane and nitrous oxide. Intensive 
modes of agricultural production also lead to accelerated depletion of soils, pollution of 
groundwater, and adverse impacts on human and animal health. While the progressive switch to 
more intensive forms of agricultural production cannot be attributed directly to the increase of 
global trade in agricultural commodities, this is nevertheless a trend which is encouraged by the 
specialization of countries in cash crops for exports. Instead, as recommended by IAASTD, we 
should urgently encourage a switch towards more low-carbon modes of agricultural production, 
which better respect ecosystems. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Nutrition and health dimensions 
</b></p>
<p>32. Partly as a result of tariff escalation in developed countries, developing countries mostly 
export commodities, including fresh fruit and vegetables, and they import processed foods from 
developed countries. This has led to shifts in dietary habits in developing countries, whose 
populations increasingly consume &#8220;Western&#8221; diets rich in salt, sugar, and fat. Higher rates of 
obesity have resulted, as well as diseases such as heart disease and type-2 diabetes. Overweight 
is now &#8220;among the top five risk factors for loss of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in both 
developed countries and low-mortality developing countries (although underweight still ranks 
higher)&#8221;.<b>27</b> Urbanization and the otherwise welcome development of increased employment of 
women leads to heavier reliance on foods prepared outside the home, including foods available 
from supermarkets. Reliance on imported foods has also been a factor, which Governments 
should take into account in their trade policy decisions. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECONCILING TRADE WITH THE RIGHT TO FOOD 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The challenge of fragmentation 
</b></p>
<p>33. The human rights obligations of WTO members and the commitments they make through 
the conclusion of agreements under the WTO framework remain uncoordinated. At the 
international level, this lack of coordination is one example among others of the problem of 
fragmentation of international law into a number of self-contained regimes, each with their own 
norms and dispute-settlement mechanisms, and relatively autonomous vis-&#224;-vis both each other 
and general international law.<b>28</b> All too often, this failure of global governance mechanisms is

</p>
<p>replicated at domestic level: trade negotiators either are not aware of the human rights 
obligations of the Governments they represent, or they do not identify the implications for their 
position in trade negotiations.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>34. This approach thus leaves it to each State to ensure, in its domestic policies, a consistency 
which is not pursued in the international legal process. This is not satisfactory. It amounts to 
treating obligations incurred under trade agreements as equivalent in normative force to human 
rights obligations. This fails to recognize that, both as a result of Article 103 of the Charter of the 
United Nations and because human rights norms have the status of peremptory norms of 
international law, human rights should prevail over any other international commitments. It also 
creates the risk that, faced with situations of conflict, States will opt for compliance with their 
obligations under trade agreements: since these agreements are commonly backed by the threat 
of economic sanctions - as is the case within the WTO, under the Dispute Settlement 
Understanding - setting aside their human rights obligations will appear to Governments less 
costly economically and even, often, politically. 
</p>
<p>35. One safeguard does exist: commitments under the WTO framework must be interpreted, to 
the fullest extent possible, so as to be compatible with general international law, as well as with 
the rules of any treaty applicable in the relationships between the parties to the dispute giving 
rise to the question of interpretation, as such rules may develop, in particular, through 
adjudication.<b>30</b> In the system of the WTO, the requirement that the agreements be interpreted in 
accordance with the other international obligations of the members is further strengthened by the 
fact that the authoritative interpretation of the agreements lies in the hands of the members 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>29
</b>  Only rarely have WTO members referred to the right to food in the context of trade 
</p>
<p>negotiations within the WTO: this was done by Mauritius and Norway (Committee on 
Agriculture, Special Session, Note on Non-Trade Concerns, WTO Doc. G/AG/NG/W/36/Rev.1, 
9 November 2000, paras. 44 and 57; WTO Doc. G/AG/NG/W/101, 16 January 2001, 
paras. 6 ff.); and by Burkina Faso (WTO Doc. TN/AG/R/10 of 9 September 2003, para. 35).  
<b>30
</b></p>
<p>  The commitments under the WTO framework cannot be treated &#8220;in clinical isolation&#8221; from 
general international law (Appellate Body Report of 20 May 1996, <i>United States - Standards for 
Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline (United States v. Brazil and Venezuela)</i>, 
WT/DS2/AB/R). Article 3.2. of the Dispute Settlement Understanding confirms that WTO 
norms may be &#8220;clarified &#8230; in accordance with customary rules of interpretation of international 
law&#8221;, which includes article 31, para. 3 (c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 
stipulating that the interpretation of treaties must take into account &#8220;any relevant rules of 
international law applicable in the relations between the parties&#8221;. These rules may evolve, 
particularly, as a result of legal interpretation: see <i>Legal Consequences for States of the 
Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South-West Africa) notwithstanding 
Security Council Resolution 276 (1970)</i>, Advisory Opinion, <i>I.C.J. Reports 1971</i>, p. 16, para. 53; 
<i>Case concerning the Gab</i>&#269;<i>&#237;kovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia), I.C.J. Reports 1997</i>, 
pp. 76-80, paras. 132-147. On the need for an evolutionary interpretation, see Appellate Body 
Report, 12 October 1998, <i>United States - Import Prohibition of Certain Shrimp and Shrimp 
Products (United States v. India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand)</i>, WT/DS58/AB/R, para. 129. </p>

</p>
<p>themselves, within the Ministerial Conference or the General Council,<b>31</b> and the members cannot 
ignore their human rights obligations in providing such interpretations. Yet, this does not provide 
a satisfactory answer to situations of real conflict which no conform interpretation could avoid. 
And it is also insufficient because such a principle of integrity in the interpretation of WTO 
agreements does not address the &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; which the norms established in these 
agreements may cause, when the members do not know whether or not any particular measure 
they take, in order to comply with their human rights obligations, will be considered acceptable 
by the other members or instead expose them to retaliation. 
</p>
<p>36. Human rights obligations of WTO members must therefore be taken into consideration at 
the negotiation stage of trade agreements: later may be too late. On the basis of the findings 
made above, the following proposals seek to assist States in better taking into account their 
human rights obligations in the negotiation and implementation of their commitments under the 
framework of the WTO. A first set of proposals are procedural in nature: they seek to ensure that 
trade negotiations are conducted in conditions which facilitate taking into consideration the right 
to food. A second set of proposals are substantive: they explore solutions to the impacts 
identified in chapter V above. Together, these proposals should promote the right of peoples and 
States to democratically determine their own agricultural and food policies, without these 
choices being dictated by the international trade regime; and they should channel this regime 
towards one which contributes not only to increased production and allocative efficiency, but 
also to the realization of the right to food. 
</p>
<p><b>B. The procedural dimensions:  guiding trade negotiations towards  
the full realization of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Assessing the impact of trade agreements on the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>37. States should ensure that they will not accept undertakings under the WTO framework 
without ensuring that these commitments are fully compatible with their obligation to respect the 
right to food. This requires that they assess the impact on the right to food of these 
commitments.<b>32</b> It also requires that any commitments they make be limited in time, and 
re-evaluated subsequently, since the impacts of trade liberalization on the ability of States to 
respect the right to food may be difficult to predict in advance, and may become visible only 
after a number of years of implementation. For instance, whatever the results of the current 
round of negotiations launched in Doha in November 2001, these results should be explicitly 
treated as provisional, and a sunset clause should be appended to the outcome in order to allow 
for a renegotiation, following a period of a few years of implementation, on the basis of an 
independent review of the impact on the enjoyment of the right to adequate food.<b>33</b>

<p>  See art. 20 of the AoA, which partially fulfils this objective in the current agreement. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/5/Add.2

</p>
<p>38. Impact assessments are a useful tool in order to help a State understand the implications of 
the agreements it enters into. They have a powerful democratizing effect, since they should 
provide an opportunity for civil society to participate in the evaluation of trade policies (see 
E/CN.4/2005/41), and allow national parliaments and civil society organizations to rely on their 
results in their dialogue with Governments.<b>34</b> To the extent that impact assessments are based on 
the normative requirements of the human right to adequate food, and the corresponding 
indicators,<b>35 </b>they can strengthen the negotiating position of Governments in trade negotiations, 
particularly since reference to the right to food is an obligation imposed on all States under 
international law, which they cannot ignore in the context of trade negotiations (see 
E/C.12/1999/5, paras. 19 and 36).<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. International trade as a component of national strategies 
for the realization of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>39. Important as they are, impact assessments remain reactive in nature: they are tools to 
measure the consequences of the decisions which are taken, but they do not indicate, in and by 
themselves, which trade policies should be adopted in order to further the realization of the right 
to food. States should define their positions in trade negotiations in accordance with national 
strategies for the realization of the right to food. The adoption of such strategies is recommended 
by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/C.12/1999/5, para. 21), and 
their content is further clarified by the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive 
Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security adopted by 
the General Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on 
23 November 2004. Such strategies should also be seen as tools to guide trade negotiations: only 
by mapping food insecurity on its territory and identifying which actions should be taken to 
combat such food insecurity will it be possible for those negotiating trade agreements to ensure 
that the commitments they make in trade negotiations will facilitate, rather than impede, efforts 
towards the fulfilment of the right to food of their population. Indeed, the usefulness of adopting 
such national strategies, based on a reliable mapping of food insecurity and vulnerability, goes 
far beyond the assistance it would provide negotiators in the WTO context. These strategies also 
should support the position of Governments in their discussions with international financial 
institutions, with donors, or in bilateral trade negotiations. It is a particular source of concern 
that, in a large number of cases, States have been unable to use flexibilities allowed under the 
WTO agreements - or to apply certain tariffs remaining under their bound tariffs - because of

<p>prescriptions from such institutions or because of bilateral free trade agreements. Adopting a 
national strategy for the realization of the right to food would strengthen the position of States in 
their discussions with these partners, at the same time that it would improve the accountability of 
Governments to their constituencies. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Transparency and participation in trade negotiations 
</b></p>
<p>40. Right-to-food impact assessments and the adoption of national strategies for the realization 
of the right to food are tools which should support negotiators in ensuring that they will not 
adopt positions at international level which, at national level, would impede the realization of the 
right to food for all. In addition however, it is essential that national parliaments and civil society 
are provided opportunities to monitor the positions adopted by Governments in trade 
negotiations. They should not be presented, at the very final stage of the negotiation process - 
once agreement has been reached - with a set of commitments made by the Executive from 
which, at that stage, from which it would be politically very difficult or impossible to retreat. 
National parliaments should regularly hold hearings about the positions adopted by the 
Government in trade negotiations, and all groups concerned, including in particular farmers&#8217; 
organizations, should have an opportunity to take part. The democratizing potential of 
right-to-food impact assessments will only fully materialize if such procedures are put in place at 
domestic level, in order to avoid a disconnect between commitments made at the international 
level and efforts developed at the national level for the realization of the right to food. This is 
particularly important in the context of trade agreements relating to agriculture, given the risks of 
an increased dualization of the farming system as a result of policies geared towards the export 
sector. These are partly the result of disproportionate political influence being exercised in some 
countries by a relatively small number of very large agricultural producers - whereas small-scale 
farmers, in contrast, are poorly organized politically, and often unable to mobilize due to their 
geographical dispersion.<b>37</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C. The substantive dimensions:  taking into account the right to  
food in the multilateral trade regime 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Limiting the dependency on international trade 
</b></p>
<p>41. States should avoid excessive reliance on international trade in the pursuit of food security. 
Their short-term interest in procuring from international markets the food which they cannot 
produce locally at lower prices should not lead them to sacrifice their long-term interest in 
building their capacity to produce the food they need to meet their consumption needs. There are 
two reasons for this. First, while theories based on allocative efficiency and specialization 
according to comparative advantage emphasize the aggregate benefits, at country level, of trade 
liberalization, a perspective based on the right to food requires that we examine the impacts on 
the most vulnerable. Throughout the developing world, agriculture accounts for around 
9 per cent of GDP and over 50 per cent of total employment. In the countries where more 
than 34 per cent of the population are undernourished, agriculture represents 30 per cent of GDP 
</p>

</p>
<p>and 70 per cent of employment.<b>38</b> Across all countries, the incomes of agricultural workers are 
significantly lower than in non-rural areas.<b>39</b> Therefore, for the realization of the right to food, 
there is no alternative but to strengthen the agricultural sector, with an emphasis on small-scale 
farmers. 
</p>
<p>42. Second, by developing their capacity to feed their populations, States limit the 
vulnerability which results from the dependency on the volatility of prices on international 
markets. As noted by the World Bank, &#8220;managing grain price risk is a fundamental requirement 
in a world characterized by more volatile international grain prices and recurring supply shocks 
that will likely result from global warming&#8221;.<b>40</b> Consultations should be held on the need to 
re-establish commodity stabilizing agreements for tropical products, cereals and oilseeds, sugar 
and cotton, all of which are of particular importance to developing countries, and should ensure 
the stabilization of prices for exports of agricultural commodities at levels that are stable, 
equitable and remunerative.<b>41 </b>Measures should also be avoided in order to avoid the negative 
impacts of non-commercial speculation on those markets. The creation of a virtual global food 
reserve would constitute a first important step in this direction. For the moment however, we 
have to draw the consequences from the volatility of prices on international markets. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Maintaining flexibilities 
</b></p>
<p>43. At present, a relatively small proportion of all food produced, estimated at 15 per cent, is 
traded internationally.<b>42 </b>Yet, the prices fixed on international markets have an important impact 
on the ability of farmers in the world to make a decent living, since, as a result of trade 
liberalization, there is a tendency for domestic and world prices to converge, insofar as imported 
goods compete with domestically produced goods on local markets. States, particularly 
developing States, in accordance with the principle of special and differential treatment, must 
therefore retain the freedom to take measures which insulate domestic markets from the 
volatility of prices on international markets. Unless the trade agreements they conclude provide 
for the necessary flexibilities, States may find themselves bound by certain disciplines which 
will make them vulnerable to the variations of prices on international markets.

</p>
<p>44. One risk is that local producers will be driven out by import surges. It is this which the 
establishment of a special safeguard measure seeks to avoid. Indeed, the measures States may 
take in order to strengthen their agricultural sector, including the measures which fall under the 
&#8220;green box&#8221; of allowable forms of domestic support to agriculture, will remain ineffective in the 
absence of such flexibility. Measures such as supply-management schemes, which guarantee a 
certain price to producers, should also be possible, although this requires that States remain free 
to maintain import tariffs at levels which allow them to protect their agricultural sector from the 
impact of the arrival on domestic markets of low-priced products. It is particularly perplexing 
that certain supply-management schemes, which seek to adapt production to demand and shield 
both producers and consumers from sudden shifts in prices, while at the same time ensuring 
processors a reasonable profit margin, would be threatened by proposals to reduce over-quota 
tariffs, even for products designated as sensitive because they are the subject of such a 
management scheme. Such schemes are an insurance policy for both producers and consumers 
against the fluctuations of prices on international markets. Their removal would be a regressive 
step in the realization of the right to food. 
</p>
<p>45. Another risk is that the net food buyers are made vulnerable to increases in prices, 
particularly since many developing States have little of no safety nets to protect the poorest 
segments of the population from such impacts. The Marrakesh Decision should insure net 
food-importing developing countries against this risk, but the answer it provides remains partial. 
For this decision to be fully effective, it would need to include a mechanism to systematically 
monitor the impact of the AoA reform process on the NFIDCs; it would need to define the 
notion of &#8220;adequate supplies&#8221; of basic foodstuffs (which, under the decision, NFIDCs should be 
able to obtain from external sources &#8220;on reasonable terms and conditions&#8221; throughout the reform 
process) by reference to the need to ensure that each individual has access at all times to 
adequate food or to means for its procurement - i.e., that the increased prices which may result 
from the reform process shall not result in violations of the right to food; and it would need to be 
fully implemented. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Controlling market power in the global supply chains and counteracting  
the risk of increased dualization of the farming system 
</b></p>
<p>46. One major imbalance in the current multilateral trade regime is that, while discipline is 
imposed on States, transnational corporations whose freedom to act has been significantly 
increased as a result are not subject to any obligations as regards the exercise of their power on 
the market. This is an important gap in global governance. In the medium to long term, a 
multilateral framework may have to be established to ensure a more adequate control of these 
actors. In the short term, States should act in accordance with their responsibility to protect 
human rights by adequately regulating actors on which they may exercise an influence, including 
in situations where these actors operate outside the national territory of the States concerned.<b>43</b> 
While the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction constitutes one option in this regard, other 
initiatives could be taken by States, such as the imposition of transparency or reporting 
requirements, or the imposition of conditions for access to export credits, in order to ensure that 
commodity buyers, food processors, and global retailers, contribute to the realization of the right 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>43
</b>  See E/C.12/2000/4, para. 39; E/C.12/2002/11, para. 31; CERD/C/CAN/CO/18, para. 17. </p>

<p>to food and abstain from practices which might threaten its enjoyment. In cooperation with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises, the Special Rapporteur will organize inclusive 
consultations on this issue in order to identify which concrete measures could be recommended 
in this regard. Such measures could include rewarding or encouraging the best practices 
identified in the global food supply chain. Particular attention could be paid to the possibility of 
using competition law in order to protect, not only end consumers but also farmers selling their 
crops, from excessive concentration or abuse of dominant positions on the market. 
</p>
<p>47. Another risk which trade liberalization in agriculture entails is that the largest agricultural 
producers, which will benefit more easily from the opportunities resulting from improved market 
access, will crowd out smaller farms, for the reasons stated above. In many countries, small-scale 
farmers are among the most vulnerable segments of the population. States therefore owe them a 
special responsibility to counteract this tendency by supporting small-scale agriculture, in 
particular as regards access to land, water, and genetic resources, and access to credit; and by 
investing in, and improving their access to, rural infrastructure. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Towards socially and environmentally sustainable trade 
</b></p>
<p>48. The expansion of international trade in agricultural products may have hidden costs for the 
environment and for human health and nutrition. The future regulation of international trade in 
agricultural commodities should take into account the impact of various modes of agricultural 
production on climate change, in order to allow countries to provide incentives in favour of 
forms of production, such as organic farming or agro-ecological practices, which better respect 
the environment, while at the same time contributing to food security.<b>44 </b>Indeed, current 
agro-industrial forms of production represent a threat to agro-biodiversity, and are heavily 
dependent on cheap oil. Reversing the trend towards a generalization of these forms of 
production is important, considering the threat of climate change on our ability to maintain 
current levels of agricultural productivity in many regions. 
</p>
<p>49. Similarly, the experience of fair-trade schemes and other incentive-based initiatives should 
be studied, in order to examine whether they should be expanded and if so, how, in order to 
encourage socially and environmentally more sustainable trade. It may be asked, for example, 
whether inspiration could be sought from guidelines such as the Ethical Trading Initiative

the potential of organic agriculture in increasing agricultural productivity and raising incomes 
through reliance on low-cost, locally available technologies, without causing environmental 
damage, but also highlighting the need for an enabling policy and institutional support in order 
to scale-up organic agriculture and its associated positive side-effects. This study is only the 
latest in a series of studies whose conclusions converge on this point. See in particular 
Jules Pretty et al. (2006), &#8220;Resource conserving agriculture increases yields in developing 
countries&#8221;, <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i>, vol. 40, No. 4 (2006) reviewing 
286 agricultural projects in 57 countries and concluding that low external input agriculture 
improves food crop productivity by an average of 79 per cent. </p>

</p>
<p>smallholder guidelines, in order to promote sourcing practices which are more sustainable and 
which, instead of contributing to the dualization of the farming system, strengthen the capacities 
and increase the incomes of small-scale farmers. Finally, as they face increased international 
competition, large food producers employing salaried workers may be tempted to violate 
fundamental labor standards, as defined in particular in the core conventions of the International 
Labour Organization. This too may call for specific responses. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to explore this issue more in-depth in the future.
