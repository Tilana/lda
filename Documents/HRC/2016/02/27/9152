<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 51/77 and other 
subsequent resolutions of the Assembly on the rights of the child, including its most recent, 
resolution 62/141, in which the Assembly requested the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict to continue to submit an annual report to the 
Human Rights Council on the progress achieved and the remaining challenges on the children 
and armed conflict agenda. The present report should be read in the context of the report of the 
Special Representative to the Assembly (A/62/228), in which she provided a comprehensive 
account of activities undertaken by the Office of the Special Representative in 2007, and the 
seventh report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict (A/62/609-S/2007/757). 
The report, which included the findings of a strategic review of a study by Gra&#231;a Machel of 1996 
on the impact of armed conflict on children and the recommendations provided therein, should 
form the primary basis for discussion by the Human Rights Council of the work of the Special 
Representative in the period under review. 
</p>
<p>2. The Office of the Special Representative regards the Council as a crucial &#8220;destination for 
action&#8221; which addresses the protection of children affected by armed conflict within its mandate 
and responsibilities. The Council serves as an important component of and a critical partner in 
efforts to ensure the application and enforcement on the ground of international norms and 
standards to protect children&#8217;s rights and to end impunity of violating parties to conflict. 
</p>
<p>3. The Office of the Special Representative welcomes the adoption by the Council of 
its 7/29 resolution on the rights of the child and its decision that, in addition to its omnibus 
resolutions every four years, to focus on a specific theme on the rights of the children on a yearly 
basis in the intervening period. In this regard, the Office of the Special Representative hopes that 
the report on children and armed conflict submitted annually to the Council will constitute the 
basis for a review and further effective action by the Council through the adoption of a resolution 
specifically focusing on children and armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>4. The rights of children affected by armed conflict should be systematically mainstreamed 
throughout the work of the Council and examined in the submissions of its thematic and country 
mechanisms. The Council should ensure that the concluding observations and recommendations 
made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on reports submitted by States parties in 
compliance with article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict also form the basis of the recently launched 
universal periodic review. The Council should further act as a complementary follow-up 
mechanism to assess the implementation of these observations and recommendations, 
particularly with regard to the parties to conflict in all situations of concern addressed in the 
annual report of the Secretary-General (S/2007/757). 
</p>
<p>5. The Office of the Special Representative appreciates the Council&#8217;s support for the 
monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave violations against children affected by armed 
conflict, established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1612 (2005). In particular, the 
Special Representative is encouraged that the Human Rights Council has reaffirmed its essential 
role in the promotion and protection of the rights and welfare of children affected by armed 
conflict, and by its strong commitment to ending the recruitment and use of children and other 
violations committed against children, including killing and maiming, rape and other forms of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>sexual violence, abductions, attacks against schools and hospitals and the denial of humanitarian 
access to children, in accordance with Council resolution 7/29. The Special Representative calls 
on the Council and the wider human rights community to continue to make systematic use of 
information from the monitoring and reporting mechanism, as established by Security Council 
resolution 1612 (2005), for advocacy and in their activities. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ISSUES OF CONCERN AFFECTING CHILDREN IN 
SITUATIONS OF ARMED CONFLICT 
</b></p>
<p>6.<b> </b>The Special Representative reiterates the recommendation by the Secretary-General in his 
latest annual report on children and armed conflict (S/2007/757), namely that equal weight 
should be given to all categories of grave violations against children. It is also necessary to 
recognize that the range of violations and abuses committed against children in armed conflict 
goes beyond the six categories of violations being considered in the framework of the 
Security Council.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>7. In recent years, new developments in the field of children and armed conflict have given 
rise to several issues of concern. The changing nature of conflicts, the recruitment of children 
across borders, forced displacement, an increase in sexual violence and a greater number of 
children being held in detention have created new dilemmas for the protection of children. The 
Special Representative strongly urges security forces and armed groups to bring their behaviour 
into line with international humanitarian law during the conduct of hostilities, and encourages 
Member States to take all necessary measures, as a matter of priority, to mitigate the impact of 
conflict on children that inhibits their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>8. The blurring of the traditional line between armed conflict and criminal violence, often 
involving transnational crime, non-traditional warfare and trafficking, is being witnessed in 
several situations. In Haiti, although most groups are currently essentially criminal in nature, 
their character and motivations may shift between criminal and political, depending on the 
specific time and circumstances. These armed groups, however, are involved in the recruitment 
and use of children and in abductions, and are perpetrating rape and other sexual violence against 
girls and women extensively. Colombia has seen the emergence of several illegal armed groups 
over the past year. These groups, largely involved in criminal activities relating especially to 
drug trafficking, are considered criminal gangs by the Government of Colombia. There are 
increasing concerns about reported violations and abuses committed against children by these 
groups, including for recruitment and use in armed combat. 
</p>
<p>9. Terrorism and counter-terrorism measures pose their own special problems for the 
protection of children. Suicide bombing, an unacceptable tactic used by some parties to conflict, 
sometimes sees child victims at both ends; children are used as suicide bombers in certain 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  In its resolution 1612 (2005), the Security Council defined the six grave violations as the 
</p>
<p>recruitment and use of children; the killing and maiming of children; rape and other sexual 
violence; abductions of children; attacks against schools or hospitals; and the denial of 
humanitarian access to children. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>instances, and many children are killed in suicide bombings. The use of children in suicide 
attacks is a relatively new phenomenon in Afghanistan and Iraq. In Afghanistan, there have been 
reports that the Taliban have recruited and used children in suicide attacks; in Iraq, children have 
been used as decoys in suicide car bombings by insurgent group militias. On the other hand, 
counter-terrorism strategies also raise concern as large-scale military action and the use of 
disproportionate force result in collateral damage, which sometimes includes the killing and 
maiming of children. 
</p>
<p>10. The movement of armed groups across borders to recruit children from camps for 
internally displaced persons and refugees, such as those in the Great Lakes and Horn regions of 
Africa, is surging. Along the Sudan-Chad border, both Sudanese and Chadian armed groups are 
recruiting children from Sudanese refugee camps in eastern Chad, while Chadian refugee 
children are being recruited by Sudanese rebel groups in Darfur. In 2007, there was a surge in the 
recruitment and use of Congolese and Rwandan children in North Kivu Province of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo by communities in Rwanda on behalf of forces loyal to 
Laurent Nkunda. There are also reports of the recruitment and use of children by the Lord&#8217;s 
Resistance Army from South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 
Central African Republic. The act of transporting vulnerable children by Government and rebel 
groups across borders during armed conflict constitutes one of the worst forms of child 
trafficking and poses immense challenges for agencies working with these populations. 
</p>
<p>11. The perpetration of sexual and gender-based violence against girls, and sometimes boys, 
by both State and non-States parties to conflict is, in many cases, deliberate, targeted and a 
direct consequence of criminal intent. In the Great Lakes region, particularly in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, there are appalling levels of sexual violence 
perpetrated against girls, in most cases with total impunity. In Darfur, rape is a method of 
warfare used by certain armed groups to humiliate and to force the displacement of girls and 
their families. 
</p>
<p>12. In certain situations, children are being detained for alleged association with armed groups 
in violation of international standards. Many of the children are detained without charge or trial, 
usually not separated from adults, and are subjected to ill-treatment and forceful interrogation 
methods. They are denied family visits and, in some cases, deprived of food and education. In 
certain situations, some children have been used as guides and informers for Government 
military operations, usually under coercion. In Iraq and Israel, military administrative detention 
of children remains a serious concern. The children lack recourse to prompt and appropriate legal 
assistance. Their imprisonment only hardens attitudes and reinforces the cycle of violence. 
</p>
<p>13. The issue of forced displacement is another alarming manifestation of a humanitarian 
situation where children are often denied shelter, access to education and basic social services. 
The recruitment of children and internal displacement in Colombia, for example, are closely 
linked, as too often displacement becomes the only avenue left for families in certain areas to 
avoid the recruitment of their children by illegal armed groups. In the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, the most serious consequence of the barrier and its associated regime, and its 
damaging humanitarian ripple effect, is an increase in forced internal displacement, violations of 
associated rights and induced poverty, where the majority of affected persons are children. The 
Special Representative is pleased to note that the Council addressed the issue of forced 
displacement of children and their families in its resolution 7/29. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PROTECTION 
OF CHILDREN IN ARMED CONFLICT 
</b></p>
<p>14. The need to address impunity and bring to justice those responsible for violations of the 
rights of children in situations of armed conflict continues to be a preoccupation of the Office of 
the Special Representative. Since the Special Representative&#8217;s previous report (A/HRC/4/45), 
there have been several significant developments in the fight to end impunity through the 
application of international norms and standards for the protection of children. Trials have been 
held and convictions rendered before national courts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
and internationally by the International Criminal Court and Special Court for Sierra Leone for 
the crime of recruitment and use of child soldiers. Such actions are the result of international 
advocacy efforts by Member States, the United Nations and its partners to ensure that those who 
perpetrate grave crimes against children are brought to justice. One good example of 
collaboration is the Belgian-funded effort carried out by the United Nations Development 
Programme and Child Protection section of the United Nations Organization Mission in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo to support the military justice system of the Government of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to prosecute perpetrators of grave violations of children&#8217;s 
rights under national law. Other important examples include: 
</p>
<p> (a) The trial of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, President of the Union des patriotes congolais, 
before the International Criminal Court and that of former Liberian President Charles Taylor 
before the Special Court for Sierra Leone; 
</p>
<p> (b) The arrest of rebel leaders from the Ituri District of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo - Germain Katanga, commander of the Force de r&#233;sistance patriotique en Ituri, and 
Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, former leader of the National Integrationist Front and Colonel in the 
Congolese National Army - and their transfer to the International Criminal Court; 
</p>
<p> (c) The convictions and sentencing of Alex Tamba Brima, Brima Bazzy Kamara and 
Santigie Borbor Kanu of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council and Allieu Kondewa of the 
Civil Defence Forces militia by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p>15. The Office of the Special Representative however considers that pressure must be 
maintained on all 16 persistent and recalcitrant violators of child rights listed in the annexes to 
the last four annual reports of the Secretary-General.<b>2</b> In this regard, it is important to recall 
Security Council resolution 1612 (2005) and all previous resolutions on children and armed 
conflict, in which the Council stresses the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to 
prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other 
egregious crimes perpetrated against children. 
</p>
<p>16. The application of international norms to cases such as the ones above, combined with the 
political process in the context of Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), have considerably 
strengthened the work carried out by child protection advocates by opening up space for more 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>A/62/609-S/2007/757. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>meaningful dialogue on protection with parties to conflict. Such dialogue has begun to yield 
concrete commitments by parties to conflict, which are being translated into tangible protection 
for children on the ground. In her previous report to the Human Rights Council, the Special 
Representative outlined the steps taken by the parties to conflict in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, in 
collaboration with the United Nations and its child protection partners, to implement plans of 
action to end the association of children with their fighting forces. The momentum culminating 
from dialogue since 2003 brought about a significant achievement in 2007. The Forces de 
d&#233;fense et de s&#233;curit&#233; des Forces nouvelles and the four pro-Government armed militia groups 
have ceased recruitment and taken concerted measures to identify and release all remaining 
children from their ranks. As a result, all five parties have been removed from the annexes to 
the seventh annual report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly and the 
Security Council (A/62/609-S/2007/757), although their compliance with the plans of action will 
continue to be monitored. 
</p>
<p>17. There has also been progress on plans of action with armed forces and groups in the 
Central African Republic, Myanmar, the Sudan, Sri Lanka and Uganda. In Chad, the 
Government signed an agreement with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) to 
demobilize child soldiers from its armed forces. Further, it is important to report that the 
monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave child rights violations pursuant to 
Security Council resolution 1612 (2005) was established in all situations of armed conflict in the 
annexes to the sixth report of the Secretary-General to the Assembly and the Council 
(A/61/529-S/2006/826). The groundwork necessary to establish the monitoring and reporting 
mechanism in Afghanistan and the Central African Republic, which are &#8220;new&#8221; country situations 
in the annexes to the most recent annual report of the Secretary-General, is being conducted by 
the Office of the Special Representative, UNICEF and the relevant United Nations peacekeeping 
missions and country teams. It must be stressed that an effective monitoring, reporting and 
compliance regime depends largely on the collaboration of a number of critical stakeholders, 
particularly Member States, United Nations system partners, non-governmental organizations 
and local civil society. The United Nations human rights system is an important player in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>18. The country-specific reports on children and armed conflict<b>3</b> resulting from the monitoring 
and reporting mechanism have provided systematic, timely, accurate and objective information 
on the six grave violations against children in armed conflict, including the identification of 
offending parties for examination by the Working Group of the Security Council on Children 
and Armed Conflict. The strength of the information and designation of offending parties 
through these reports has proved to have a deterrent effect and has allowed the Working Group 
to maintain political pressure and take action on parties to conflict found to be persistent 
violators of child rights. In the same vein, relevant information contained in these 
country-specific reports, in addition to recommendations and conclusions by the Working Group, 
may be considered by the Committee on the Rights of the Child when reviewing reports by 
States parties under the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, as 
well as in the consideration of reports under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>

</p>
<p>S/2007/686 and S/2007/758. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. Apart from the sustained engagement and pressure placed on parties to conflict by the 
Working Group and other relevant bodies of the United Nations and its partners, country visits 
by the Special Representative have also provided the opportunity for high-level advocacy and 
opened doors for follow-up dialogue with military and political authorities by the United Nations 
country task forces on monitoring and reporting, and have elicited several key commitments by 
the parties to address the issues of recruitment and use of children and their protection from other 
grave violations during armed conflict. These visits also serve to highlight national efforts to 
advance child rights concerns in armed conflict. In 2007, the Special Representative made eight 
country visits, including to the Sudan (January), the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Burundi (March), Lebanon, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel (April), Myanmar 
(June) and C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (September). The visits to Burundi, the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo and C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire were primarily to follow up the recommendations of the Working 
Group. 
</p>
<p>20. The visits by the Special Representative to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israel and 
Lebanon followed the fact that grave violations against children in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory and Israel were recorded, as distinct situations of concern, in the 2005 and 2006 reports 
of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict (A/59/695-S/2005/72 and 
A/61/529-S/2006/826). In Lebanon, the conflict between Lebanon and Israel of July and 
August 2006, which witnessed the worst fighting since the end of the Lebanese civil war, was 
also recorded as a specific situation of concern in the report of the Secretary-General in 2006. 
The Special Representative had the express purpose of seeing for herself the impact of armed 
conflict on children in the region, and deemed it critical that the problem of the protection of 
children from the adverse effects of the conflict in those situations be addressed. In particular, 
the Special Representative engaged with parties, including Governments, United Nations and 
civil society, in order to garner commitments for the protection of children, as reflected in 
international humanitarian and human rights instruments applicable to children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>Commitments from Governments and other parties to conflict 
</b></p>
<p>21. Some of the key commitments elicited from Governments and other parties to conflict 
during her missions are summarized below, and are elaborated in more detail in the Special 
Representative&#8217;s report (A/62/228). A number of actions have been taken by parties concerned to 
meet their commitments. The critical challenge is to ensure timely follow-up and adherence to 
commitments made and for their practical implementation, in order to bring about concrete 
results for the protection of children on the ground. To this end, the Special Representative calls 
on the Human Rights Council and the broader human rights community to join in monitoring 
these undertakings and ensuring that parties to conflict honour their commitments to the 
protection of children. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Representative recommends that monitoring by national institutions for human 
rights be strengthened and invites the international community to continue to allocate adequate 
funding to strengthen further national institutional and societal capacities and mechanisms for 
monitoring, promoting and protecting human rights, including for those of children. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i>South Sudan 
</i></p>
<p>23. The Government of National Unity and the Government of Southern Sudan committed to 
allow the United Nations Mission in the Sudan and UNICEF access to the military barracks of 
the Sudan Armed Forces, the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army and allied armed forces and 
groups to monitor and verify compliance, adopt and implement national legislation to criminalize 
the recruitment of child soldiers, allocate adequate resources for the reintegration of children 
associated with the armed forces, establish a task force to address sexual violence against 
children and ensure the safety and protection of humanitarian personnel. According to the most 
recent information received, the Government of National Unity has undertaken a number of 
important initiatives at the national, regional and local levels, in partnership with the 
United Nations, to improve child protection and address abuses against children. They include 
revising applicable legislation with a view to prohibiting and criminalizing the recruitment and 
use of children by armed forces and groups; training its military and security personnel; creating 
dedicated mechanisms within the administration, the army, the police forces and the judiciary to 
deal with child protection and to address sexual and gender-based violence; and taking action 
through its ceasefire institutions, to address child recruitment by the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation 
Army, the Sudan Armed Forces and any armed group under their control and/or aligned with 
them, and to foster the release of children. 
</p>
<p><i>Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</i>24. The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed to take measures to 
tackle the issues of child recruitment and sexual violence against children and to fight impunity 
of armed groups, such as non-integrated brigades of the Forces Arm&#233;es de la R&#233;publique 
D&#233;mocratique du Congo loyal to Laurent Nkunda and the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du 
Rwanda (FDLR). According to recent information, the authorities of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo have carried out several arrests and conducted trials of perpetrators of recruitment and 
rape of children in its national courts. In conjunction with the progress made in the 
implementation of the national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme for 
children, thousands of children have been separated from armed forces and groups and 
reintegrated into their communities. However, there has been little or no progress with regard to 
the forces led by Laurent Nkunda and FDLR. Laurent Nkunda and troops loyal to him continue 
to recruit and re-recruit children.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>25. The President, Pierre Nkurunziza, and senior ministers of the Government of Burundi 
agreed to continue the Government&#8217;s efforts to address children&#8217;s rights and protection in the 
peace consolidation phase, particularly to ensure that the release and reintegration of all children 
associated with armed groups, whether those remaining in detention or in Palipehutu-Forces 
nationales de lib&#233;ration (FNL) ranks, are made a priority. The Government also committed to 
continue the fight against impunity for perpetrators of sexual violence, especially against 
children. According to the most recent information received, progress has been made with the 
release of children arrested for association with FNL in 2007. In April 2008, following requests 
by representatives of alleged dissidents of Palipehutu-FNL, government representatives 
mandated by President Nkurunziza identified and separated more than 200 children from the 
Randa and Buramata camps to the Gitega demobilization centre. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i>Middle East 
</i></p>
<p>26. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, on behalf of the Government of Lebanon, stated that 
Lebanon was committed to the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. Parliamentary deputy 
Mohammed Raad, on behalf of Hizbullah, committed not to use children for armed violence or 
political mobilization. 
</p>
<p>27. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Minister for Foreign Affairs Ziad Abu Amr 
agreed to revive the code of conduct among Palestinian groups not to involve children in 
political violence, and to engage with UNICEF to devise a plan of action to prevent the use of 
children in such violence. 
</p>
<p>28. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tzipi Livni, stated that the Government of Israel was 
committed to investigating and taking appropriate action on the case of renewed attacks by 
settlers on schoolchildren in al-Tuwani village. Further, the Coordinator of Government 
Activities in the Territories, Major-General Yosef Mishlev, was committed to investigating the 
routing of the barrier and its effect on the daily lives of the children of Azzun Atma and 
al-Nu&#8217;man villages, to investigating fully the cases of harassment and attacks on children in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory and the difficulties of access for health professionals and patients 
to East Jerusalem hospitals owing to the barrier and its associated restrictive permit system. 
</p>
<p><i>Myanmar 
</i></p>
<p>29. The Government of Myanmar agreed to cooperate in the establishment of a monitoring and 
reporting mechanism on child rights violations within the framework of Security Council 
resolution 1612 (2005) by appointing the Director-General of the Ministry of Social Welfare, 
Relief and Resettlement as the Government focal point on issues relating to the implementation 
of the mechanism; to provide details of action taken against army recruiters who recruited 
children and the list of children discharged for follow-up verification by the United Nations; and 
to engage in a plan of action with the United Nations, including to establish a subcommittee for 
the reintegration of former child soldiers, a transparent complaints procedure for incidents of 
recruitment of children, instituting disciplinary measures against parties responsible for aiding 
and abetting child recruitment, access to recruitment centres by the United Nations on a regular 
basis for verification, regular child protection training for officials of the armed forces, and a 
public campaign to create awareness of the rules, regulations and modalities of a complaints 
procedure to prevent recruitment. 
</p>
<p>30. The Government also committed to bringing its current plan of action on the prevention of 
the recruitment of children into its armed forces (Tatmadaw Kyi) into line with international 
standards and to facilitate plans of action with the United Wa State Army and other non-State 
actors. The Government has also recognized the need for the United Nations country task force 
in Myanmar to engage the Karen National Union and Karenni National Progressive Party in the 
development of plans of action and to monitor their compliance, in accordance with Security 
Council resolution 1612 (2005). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. In September 2007, the Government of Myanmar established a working group, chaired by 
the Director-General of the International Organizations and Economic Department of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the monitoring and reporting mechanism on the prevention of 
the military recruitment of under-age children. The Government has also collaborated with the 
United Nations country task force on monitoring and reporting by sharing information on the 
recruitment of children under the complaints mechanism established with the International 
Labour Organization. However, the question of United Nations access to areas of concern for 
monitoring and reporting and Government willingness to facilitate plans of action with the 
groups cited in the annual report of the Secretary-General have yet to be satisfactorily concluded. 
</p>
<p><i>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</i></p>
<p>32. The Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire committed itself to establishing an inter-ministerial 
structure to address the protection of children and to develop a national plan of action to end 
sexual violence against children, despite the fact that the Ouagadougou Political Agreement 
makes no explicit reference to children. 
</p>
<p><i>Uganda and Sri Lanka 
</i></p>
<p>33. Following the previous report of the Special Representative on her mission to Uganda and 
that of her Special Adviser, Ambassador Rock, to Sri Lanka, outlining the commitments made by 
parties to conflict in both countries, some progress has been made in the development of plans of 
action by the Government of Uganda and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Some positive 
measures have also been taken by the Government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil Makkal 
Viduthalai Pulighal in response to recommendations made by the Working Group of the Security 
Council on Children and Armed Conflict. 
</p>
<p>34. According to the latest information received, the Government of Uganda has reiterated its 
commitment to finalize its plan of action on children associated with armed forces and groups in 
Uganda, in order that the Uganda People&#8217;s Defence Forces and Local Defence Units may be 
removed from the annexes to the annual report of the Secretary-General on children and armed 
conflict. The plan is currently in its second draft and being discussed with the Government of 
Uganda. 
</p>
<p>35. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam signed a plan of action on 15 October 2007, 
committing them to raise the minimum age of recruitment to 18 years and to release anyone in its 
ranks under the age of 18 years by 31 December 2007. The plan also contained commitments to 
respect the neutrality and security of schools, hospitals and places of worship as &#8220;safe zones&#8221;, 
and to ensure open and safe access by humanitarian actors to affected areas so that supplies and 
services may reach vulnerable communities. The plan does not yet, however, meet minimum 
standards on several fronts, such as by allowing full access to the United Nations for verification, 
formalizing principles and time-bound measures for the safe release of children, accountability 
and prevention of re-recruitment. The Government of Sri Lanka has established an 
interdisciplinary committee to inquire into allegations of abductions and the recruitment of 
children for use in armed conflict and to respond to allegations of aiding and abetting the 
abductions of children by the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulighal. Encouraging developments 
were witnessed in April 2008, when approximately 40 children were released by the Tamil 
Makkal Viduthalai Pulighal. The Government played a role in securing these releases. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. REMAINING CHALLENGES INVOLVING 
CHILDREN IN ARMED CONFLICT 
</b></p>
<p>36. Despite the important developments mentioned above, many challenges persist that will 
require concerted action and continued global efforts to protect war-affected children. The 
Special Representative remains gravely concerned that the six grave violations are still being 
committed against children by parties to conflict, in blatant violation of international law. The 
Special Representative would like to bring to the attention of the Human Rights Council the 
parties who were included on the annexes to the latest report of the Secretary-General on 
children and armed conflict (S/2007/757) (see annexes I and II). The Special Representative calls 
on Member States, who bear a central and immediate political, legal and moral responsibility, to 
not only comply with international norms and standards for the protection of children within 
their territories, but also to work in cooperation with the international community to ensure 
children&#8217;s demobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Furthermore, the Special 
Representative strongly recommends that national justice processes ensure that the special needs 
and rights of children affected by conflict are considered. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Representative also encourages States parties to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child to strengthen national and international measures for the prevention of recruitment 
of children into armed forces or armed groups and their use in hostilities, in particular by signing 
and ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Involvement of Children in Armed 
Conflict and enacting legislation that explicitly prohibits and criminalizes the recruitment of 
children into armed forces or groups and their use in hostilities. They should also exercise 
extraterritorial jurisdiction in order to strengthen the international protection of children against 
recruitment. 
</p>
<p>38. In the light of the fact that the vast majority of parties to conflict listed in the annexes to 
the annual report of the Secretary-General are non-State actors, the Special Representative 
requests Member States to help facilitate dialogue between the United Nations country task 
forces on monitoring and reporting and these groups, for the purposes of developing plans of 
action to halt the recruitment and use of children, and to address all other grave violations 
committed against children.  
</p>
<p><b>V. WORKING WITH THE UNITED NATIONS 
HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p>39. Notwithstanding the important strides for the protection of children made since the 
previous report of the Special Representative, the overall situation of children affected by armed 
conflict remains grave, as parties continuing to defy even the most basic principles of 
international humanitarian law. It is therefore important, if not critical, that the United Nations 
human rights system continue to play a major role and actively uphold the need to protect the 
rights of conflict-affected children. 
</p>
<p>40. The Office of the Special Representative is working closely with the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to raise awareness of the rights 
of children affected by armed conflict. OHCHR is an active member of the Task Force on 
Children and Armed Conflict and its steering committee on monitoring and reporting at 
Headquarters in New York. The strengthening of the human rights monitoring capacity of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>OHCHR within peacekeeping operations and country missions has been noted. In particular, the 
key role played by OHCHR in Uganda and Nepal, as co-chairs of the country task force on 
monitoring and reporting, to monitor and report on child rights violations within the framework 
of Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), is commendable. Over the past year, the enhanced 
cooperation between the Office of the Special Representative and OHCHR has resulted in 
greater complementary efforts for the protection of children on the ground, and is a factor 
contributing to compliance by parties, including their engagement in plans of action to halt and 
prevent the recruitment and use of children. The Office of the Special Representative would like 
to continue to strengthen its strategic partnership with OHCHR by encouraging its further 
involvement in the protection of the rights of children in armed conflict, particularly in its 
dialogue and engagement with Member States, and by increasing its child rights expertise in 
peace operations, in a framework of coordination and cooperation with other child protection 
actors in such settings, as well as including a senior-level focal point for children and armed 
conflict in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>41. The Office of the Special Representative is encouraged by the practice of a number of 
special rapporteurs of including a section on children and armed conflict in their reports, and by 
their proactive advocacy for child rights protection. The Special Representative continues to 
encourage special rapporteurs to bring issues of concern to her attention. 
</p>
<p>42. The Office of the Special Representative will continue to share information on the status of 
the protection of children affected by armed conflict in specific country situations ahead of 
country reviews. The concluding observations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
the country reports on the implementation of the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of 
Children in Armed Conflict, as well as on those submitted in relation to the Convention itself 
which address the issue of children and armed conflict, will constitute a basis for continued 
advocacy by the Office. 
</p>
<p>43. The Office of the Special Representative will also continue to encourage Member States to 
sign and ratify the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and to 
promote further international collaboration to strengthen national capacities, including enactment 
of legislation consistent with the Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>44.<b> The Special Representative reiterates the recommendations already made in the 
present report. 
</b></p>
<p>45.<b> The Special Representative calls on the Human Rights Council and the wider 
human rights community to continue to make systematic use of Security Council 
resolution 1612 (2005) as an advocacy tool in their activities, in particular the monitoring 
and reporting mechanism on grave violations against children in armed conflict. She 
further calls on the Human Rights Council to make combating grave violations against 
children an integral part of its agenda, including by mainstreaming the issues concerned 
throughout the work of the Council and in the submissions of its thematic and country 
mechanisms, as well as in the universal periodic review. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46.<b> The Special Representative recommends that the Council ensure that concluding 
observations and recommendations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child on 
reports submitted by States parties under article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict 
form the basis of the universal periodic review, and that the Council act as a 
complementary follow-up mechanism to assess the implementation of those observations 
and recommendations, particularly with regard to the parties to conflict listed in the 
annexes to the annual report of the Secretary-General (S/2007/757). 
</b>47.<b> The Special Representative encourages States parties to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child to submit reports under the Optional Protocol to the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child; to take measures to support the recommendations of the Committee; to 
strengthen national and international measures for the prevention of the recruitment of 
children into armed forces or groups and their use in hostilities, in particular by signing 
and ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and by enacting legislation that explicitly 
prohibits the recruitment of children into armed forces or groups and their use in 
hostilities; and to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction to strengthen the international 
protection of children against recruitment. 
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> In the light of the fact that the vast majority of parties to conflict in the annexes to the 
annual report of the Secretary-General are non-State actors, the Special Representative 
requests Member States to help facilitate dialogue between the United Nations country task

of action to halt the recruitment and use of children, and to address all other grave 
violations committed against children pursuant to Security Council resolutions 1539 (2004) 
and 1612 (2005). 
</b>49.<b> The Special Representative calls on Member States to comply with international 
norms and standards for the protection of children in armed conflict, and to take all 
necessary measures, as a matter of priority, to mitigate the impact of conflict on children 
that inhibits their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</b>50.<b> The Special Representative recommends that national institutions for human rights 
monitoring be strengthened, and invites the international community to continue to 
allocate adequate funding to strengthen further national institutional and societal 
capacities and mechanisms for monitoring, promoting and protecting human rights, 
including those of children. </b></p>
