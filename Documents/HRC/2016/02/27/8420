<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur visited Mexico from 9 to 24 August 2010, at the 
Government&#8217;s invitation, on an official joint mission with the Special Rapporteur for 
Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), 
Ms. Catalina Botero. This was the first joint official visit made by the two Rapporteurs. The 
Special Rapporteur acknowledges the openness of the Mexican State in inviting them to 
visit the country and emphasizes its cooperation before, during and after their visit. In 
addition to the Federal District, the visit included the states of Chihuahua, Guerrero, 
Sinaloa and Mexico. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with governmental, legislative 
and judicial authorities at both federal and state level and with civil society organizations, 
journalists&#8217; organizations and other relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p> The report analyses the legal framework and the historical and political context of 
freedom of opinion and expression and access to information in Mexico. It describes the 
current situation of violence and impunity, exemplified by the fact that very few of the 66 
cases of murder of journalists that occurred between 2000 and December 2010 have been 
solved. Incomplete investigations in the vast majority of cases prevent an exact

<p>determination of the causes and perpetrators of these crimes. Between 2000 and December 
2010 alone, 12 journalists were disappeared. The report also refers to recent attacks on 
media outlets. In some areas, journalists are subject to intimidation and self-censorship. 
The report finds that freedom of expression in Mexico faces serious obstacles. The figures 
mentioned have made Mexico the most dangerous country in the Americas in which to 
practise journalism. 
</p>
<p> In response to this grave situation, the report refers to the need to create a national 
mechanism for the protection of journalists. It argues that the new mechanism must be 
implemented through a high-level official inter-institutional committee, be headed by a 
federal authority, be able to coordinate among the various authorities and levels of 
government, have sufficient resources of its own and guarantee the participation of 
journalists and civil society organizations in its design, operation and evaluation. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends strengthening both the Special Prosecutor&#8217;s Office for 
Crimes against Freedom of Expression in the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and local 
prosecutor&#8217;s offices. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> The report notes that, in Mexico, ownership and control of media to which broadcast 
frequencies have been assigned are highly concentrated. There are no clear, precise and 
equitable procedures for awarding operating frequencies to community radio stations. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends the adoption of a regulatory framework that offers legal 
certainty, reduces the concentration of ownership and control of radio and television and 
helps generate pluralist media that are accessible to all sectors of the population. He 
expresses concern at the closure of some community radio stations on the basis of a 
regulatory framework that does not conform to international standards. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> The report notes that public spending on government advertising is high and 
increasing. There are cases where official advertising has been used as a means to pressure, 
reward, punish or favour media according to their editorial angle. Objective, clear, 
transparent and non-discriminatory criteria should be established for the allocation of 
official advertising at all levels and in all areas of government. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> The report makes a detailed analysis of criminal law and freedom of expression and 
of civil actions brought in connection with its exercise. The federal Government 
decriminalized slander, defamation and libel in 2007 and 18 states have followed suit. 
However, the 1917 Print Offences Act, which provides for custodial sentences, remains in 
force. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office has brought criminal proceedings against journalists 
working for community radio stations that did not have the necessary permits. The Special 
Rapporteur considers that journalists and media workers interested in public affairs, 
particularly those who investigate cases of corruption or wrongdoing, must not be subject 
to judicial or other harassment in retaliation for their work. Differentiated standards must 
be established for evaluating subsequent civil liability, including the standard of actual 
malice, as well as strict proportionality and reasonability of any subsequent penalties.

<p><b>4</b> GE.11-13248  (EXT) 
</p>
<p><b>I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of the United Mexican States, the Special 
Rapporteur visited the country from 9 to 24 August 2010, on a joint official mission with 
Catalina Botero Marino, Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), to observe the situation of freedom of 
opinion and expression in Mexico.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Mexican Government for its invitation and 
emphasizes its cooperation and openness in ensuring all necessary conditions for the joint 
visit, the first of its kind to a country of the region. He likewise thanks all the federal and 
state government authorities, civil society organizations and journalists with whom he met 
during the course of his visit. He acknowledges the considerable efforts made by the staff 
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights in Mexico in providing support for the visit. 
</p>
<p>3. The visit included the Federal District and the states of Chihuahua, Guerrero, 
Sinaloa and Mexico. The Special Rapporteurs met with officials from over 40 federal and 
state public institutions belonging to the executive and legislative branches and the 
judiciary, as well as representatives from autonomous bodies. They held meetings with over 
100 journalists, relatives of murdered journalists, media representatives, publishers, 
reporters, representatives of civil society organizations and members of the international 
community based in Mexico. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Institutional and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>4. The right to freedom of expression is enshrined in articles 6 and 7 of the Political 
Constitution of the United Mexican States, as well as in article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and in fundamental international instruments to which 
Mexico is a party: article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
articles 13 and 14 of the American Convention on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>5. The Human Rights Committee of the United Nations has stated that restrictions on 
the exercise of the right to freedom of expression must be provided by law, be imposed 
only for specific purposes and be necessary.1 
</p>
<p>6. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has likewise stated that the right to 
freedom of expression is not an absolute right and may therefore be subject to restrictions. 
Restrictions on freedom of expression must be proportional to the interest invoked as 
justification and adhere closely to that objective.2 The Inter-American Court has also 
defined the dimensions of the right to freedom of expression: an individual dimension (the 
right to express one&#8217;s thoughts and to receive information) and a social dimension (the 
collective right to seek and receive information).3 Freedom of expression may also serve as 
a tool for the enforcement of other rights. 
</p>
<p>7. In Mexico, the Supreme Court of Justice has defined the content and limits of the 
right to freedom of expression in its case law, in addition to prohibiting prior censorship.

<p>Limitations on freedom of expression must be enforced by the attribution of liability. The 
Supreme Court has also highlighted the instrumental value of that right by emphasizing that 
it is indispensable for shaping public opinion.4 The full and safe exercise of freedom of 
expression is part of the public interest and creates a connection between individual rights 
and the political system. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Violence, impunity and self-censorship 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The challenging context of violence and insecurity 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Mexican State is facing a critical situation of violence and insecurity, in which 
the full enjoyment of freedom of expression and opinion has been seriously compromised. 
The grave and diverse obstacles with which Mexico has to contend include the murder of 
journalists and other very serious acts of violence against those who disseminate 
information, ideas and opinions, and the widespread impunity that prevail in these cases. 
The various sources consulted by the Special Rapporteur confirm that violence against 
journalists is on the rise in Mexico. 
</p>
<p>9. The State has the obligation not only to guarantee that its agents do not commit acts 
of violence against journalists but also to take reasonable steps to prevent attacks by private 
individuals. It also has the obligation to investigate, prosecute, try and, where applicable, 
punish the perpetrators of such violence. The fact that the Special Rapporteur makes 
reference to an act of violence does not necessarily mean that the act is directly attributable 
to the State. However, such acts do make clear the State&#8217;s obligation to prevent, protect 
against and, where necessary, punish such acts. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur is struck by the fact that the National Human Rights 
Commission (CNDH) is the only State institution that keeps a public, documented record of 
crimes against journalists. There is also a data-analysis unit in the Special Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office for Crimes against Freedom of Expression, which has taken various actions. 
According to CNDH, 66 journalists were murdered between 2000 and December 2010 and 
12 were disappeared between 2005 and 2010. There have also been 18 attacks on media 
outlets over the past five years.5 
</p>
<p>11. While the figures compiled by CNDH are useful for understanding the seriousness 
of the worsening situation faced by journalists, there is no institution entrusted with 
collecting, updating and documenting data on violence against members of the press or on 
administrative and criminal proceedings conducted in that regard. 
</p>
<p>12. Through his various meetings with journalists, the Special Rapporteur was able to 
observe that threats and harassment are a regular feature of the practice of journalism, 
particularly local journalism covering issues of corruption, organized crime, drug 
trafficking and public security. The vast majority of attacks on local or regional journalists 
are not reported because there is no confidence in the actions of the respective authorities 
and no faith in the outcome. 
</p>
<p>13. The figures reported and the additional information received confirm that since 
2000, Mexico has been the most dangerous country in the Americas in which to practise 
journalism.

</p>
<p>&#8226; Guillermo Alcaraz Trejo, shot dead on 10 July 2010 in Chihuahua 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Marco Aurelio Mart&#237;nez Tijerina, found dead on 10 July 2010 in Montemorelos, 
Nuevo Le&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>15. In addition to the above cases, there is the disappearance of Mar&#237;a Esther Aguilar 
Cansimbe, a reporter for <i>Cambio de Michoac&#225;n</i>, in November 2009. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>16. There is a climate of widespread impunity with regard to cases of violence against 
journalists, even when it comes to the most serious acts such as murders, disappearances 
and kidnappings. In the course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur did not receive specific 
or adequate information on criminal and administrative convictions in these cases. Impunity </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-13248  (EXT) <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>prevails, fostering the chronic repetition of human rights violations and the total 
defencelessness of victims and their relatives.6 
</p>
<p>17. Impunity promotes a climate of uncertainty and distrust and is one of the main 
obstacles to the exercise of freedom of expression in Mexico. Violence has become so 
widespread that in the first half of 2010, national media were intimidated and pressured by 
organized crime to publish or withhold certain information, a situation that had previously 
affected mainly state and local media. 
</p>
<p>18. The federal Government reacted to this situation of violence and impunity by 
creating a special prosecutor&#8217;s office within the Attorney General&#8217;s Office: the Special 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office for Crimes against Freedom of Expression (FEADLE). The Special 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has launched 143 investigations since 15 February 2010. However, 
since its creation in 2006, it has failed to convict a single perpetrator and has brought only 
four cases to trial.7 Its tendency to decline competence for cases referred to its jurisdiction 
also reveals a lack of political will that was corrected only in recent months when a new 
prosecutor was appointed. 
</p>
<p>19. The fact that FEADLE has achieved so little is attributable, in part, to the 
unwillingness of previous prosecutors to take on cases and implement an adequate work 
plan, but also to its lack of autonomy and resources and the failure to define its jurisdiction 
clearly. FEADLE maintains that it does not a priori prejudge the question of jurisdiction. 
For the first time, its current work plan reflects a seriousness consistent with the gravity and 
urgency of the situation it faces. The Special Rapporteur hopes that this work plan will 
translate into tangible results in the near future and he will remain attentive to its execution 
and development. 
</p>
<p>20. It is not enough, however, to strengthen the Special Prosecutor&#8217;s Office by giving it 
greater autonomy and its own budget and allowing the exercise of federal jurisdiction over 
crimes against freedom of expression. The judiciary must also be strengthened by giving it 
the necessary instruments to try crimes committed with the aim of preventing or impeding 
the exercise of freedom of expression. It is particularly important to promote the necessary 
reforms to enable federal judges to handle such crimes. 
</p>
<p>21. Individual states must also make an effort to give their criminal justice bodies and 
their judges greater and better operational guarantees, including greater autonomy, 
resources and technical expertise. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the adoption of 
a special investigation protocol for handling crimes committed against journalists in the 
Federal District. The Federal District also has a specialized agency for handling crimes 
committed against journalists in the exercise of their profession and a project providing safe 
houses for journalists, while the Special Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has a basic homicide 
investigation guide for murders committed against freedom of expression. All prosecutor&#8217;s 
offices should adopt special investigation protocols for handling crimes committed against 
journalists, which would have to include exhaustive investigation of the possibility that the 
crime was motivated by the victim&#8217;s professional activities. 
</p>
<p>22. In order to combat impunity, the State must continue to reinforce complementary 
oversight mechanisms. Of the 23 recommendations relating to freedom of expression made 
by the National Human Rights Commission since 2005, only six have been implemented 
fully by the responsible authorities. The Special Rapporteur believes that public human

</p>
<p>Prosecutor&#8217;s Office for Crimes against Freedom of Expression, 12 August 2010. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.11-13248  (EXT) 
</p>
<p>rights bodies&#8217; capacity for action must be strengthened. The adoption of constitutional 
amendments in the area of human rights is essential for this purpose. Prosecutor&#8217;s offices 
must also be more transparent and have greater autonomy and technical expertise. To 
achieve this, the State must pursue the overhaul of the criminal justice system. The special 
commission of the Chamber of Deputies that is responsible for monitoring attacks on 
journalists and media outlets has carried out a number of activities and should become a 
regular commission. The possibility could also be considered of creating an equivalent 
commission in the Senate of the Republic and in the legislative bodies of those states where 
violence against journalists is most severe. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The phenomenon of self-censorship 
</b></p>
<p>23. According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur, journalists in 
some parts of the country are subject to a climate of intimidation that causes them to self-
censor. It is extremely difficult in those areas to investigate and publish material on issues 
such as organized crime, corruption, lack of public security and similar matters, given the 
vulnerability and high risk to which journalists would be exposed. As a result, Mexican 
society as a whole is less and less aware of what is going on in those areas and the 
authorities and social organizations are being deprived of information that is very important 
to the public and also essential for combating some of the crimes faced by Mexican society. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Special Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has 
ordered police authorities to adopt 48 precautionary measures in favour of journalists, their 
families and media outlets. However, the fact that journalists are defenceless and receive no 
support from the authorities means that self-censorship is being used as a means of self-
protection. Increasingly, information is being withheld for fear of possible reprisals and 
investigations into possible acts of corruption are being abandoned. Fear of seeking and 
disseminating information is spreading because of the lack of protection and effective 
safeguards. In some states where there is a major presence of organized crime, such as 
Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Guerrero, Michoac&#225;n, Nuevo Le&#243;n, Sinaloa and 
Tamaulipas, self-censorship has reached such serious levels that the local press has been 
reduced to silence and does not report on extremely violent events occurring in the area. At 
best, such events will be reported in the national press.  
</p>
<p>25. According to the information received, in some particularly extreme cases drug 
trafficking groups have tried actively to influence what the media report. This serious trend, 
which previously affected local media in places where organized crime is very prevalent, is 
now beginning to affect national media. 
</p>
<p>26. Most of the worst attacks on journalists take place in states where there is a strong 
presence of organized crime, such as Chihuahua, Guerrero and Sinaloa, which the Special 
Rapporteur visited. In these states, organized crime is the biggest threat to the life and 
physical integrity of journalists, particularly those covering local news about corruption, 
organized crime, drug trafficking, public security and related issues. However, the 
authorities&#8217; failure to complete their investigations in the vast majority of cases prevents an 
exact determination of the causes and perpetrators of these crimes. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in some regions, armed groups with 
alleged links to political factions are responsible for violence and intimidation against 
journalists. In April 2010, a group of journalists were attacked on their way to San Juan 
Copola, in the state of Oaxaca, while travelling as part of a humanitarian convoy to report 
on the 2008 murder of community radio journalists Teresa Bautista Merino and Felicitas 
Mart&#237;nez S&#225;nchez. Two activists were killed and two journalists, one of them with a 
gunshot wound, remained trapped in the area for two days before they could be rescued. An 
illegal armed group operating in Oaxaca allegedly carried out the attack. </p>

<p>GE.11-13248  (EXT) <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Attacks committed by members of the forces of law and order 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur fully recognizes the efforts made by the Mexican State to 
combat crime and guarantee the safety of its inhabitants. However, he is deeply concerned 
at the information received about harassment and attacks allegedly committed by members 
of both the armed forces and the police against journalists who cover the security situation. 
In the lawful exercise of their profession, journalists have the right and the duty to cover the 
security situation without hindrance or undue pressure. 
</p>
<p>29. According to CNDH figures, the five authorities allegedly responsible for most of 
the reported offences against journalists are involved in security and law enforcement: the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of National 
Defence, the Oaxaca Attorney General&#8217;s Office and the Veracruz Attorney General&#8217;s 
Office. More worryingly, three of these authorities are actually responsible for the 
investigation and prosecution of crimes.8 
</p>
<p>30. As established by the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights,9 in no event may military courts judge cases of human 
rights violations committed against journalists. At the same time, both the armed forces and 
the police must cooperate fully with the investigations carried out by public human rights 
bodies and internal oversight bodies in order to determine the responsibilities of personnel 
who dishonour the institutions established to guarantee people&#8217;s safety. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur was informed that efforts are being made to bring article 57 
of the Code of Military Justice into line with international standards. He acknowledges the 
training efforts undertaken for police and soldiers with a view to preventing abuses. 
However, the absence of clear and transparent criteria for how the army and security forces 
should interact with journalists in the context of the operations they carry out undermines 
trust and encourages abuse. The press must be seen and viewed as an ally of the State and 
society in building democracy and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b> E. National mechanism for the protection of journalists 
</b></p>
<p>32. Various civil society organizations for the protection and defence of human rights 
and journalists&#8217; organizations have raised the need for the State to take comprehensive 
action to safeguard the work of journalists and human rights defenders. Given the absence 
of a protocol or clear mechanism for the implementation of precautionary measures or 
temporary measures of protection for journalists, a number of State bodies, in conjunction 
with journalists, members of the media, civil society organizations and international and 
national human rights organization, have embarked on a process aimed at creating a 
national mechanism for the protection of journalists and human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>33. Since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, progress has been made in guaranteeing the 
safety of journalists. At the state level, the state of Chihuahua adopted the implementation 
agreement for the comprehensive security system to protect journalists.10 At the federal 
level, in October 2010 the National Human Rights Commission adopted two guides for

</p>
<p>implementing precautionary measures for journalists and media workers and for human 
rights defenders. In November 2010, the Ministries of the Interior, Foreign Affairs and 
Public Security and CNDH signed a coordination agreement for the implementation of 
preventive and protective actions for journalists. Lastly, in late 2010, the Chamber of 
Deputies approved an allocation for the protection of journalists in the federal spending 
budget for the 2011 financial year.11 Further progress needs to be made, however, given the 
scale of the violence and insecurity confronting journalists in Mexico. 
</p>
<p>34. In addition to the Special Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, a special commission of the Chamber 
of Deputies is responsible for monitoring attacks on journalists and media outlets. CNDH 
also has a programme dealing with offences against journalists and human rights defenders 
and there are similar programmes in the Federal District and the states of Guerrero, Tabasco 
and Veracruz.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur considers it essential that a national mechanism for the 
protection of journalists, designed and implemented through a high-level official inter-
institutional committee, be created immediately. Such a mechanism should be headed by a 
federal authority, be able to coordinate among the various authorities and levels of 
government, have sufficient resources of its own and guarantee the participation of 
journalists and civil society organizations in its design, creation, operation and evaluation.  
</p>
<p>36. One simple but effective measure of protection would be for the highest State 
authorities to recognize constantly, clearly, publicly and firmly the legitimacy and value of 
the journalistic profession, even when the information disseminated may prove critical, 
inconvenient or inopportune for the Government&#8217;s interests. Similarly, it is essential that 
those authorities vigorously condemn attacks against journalists and media workers and 
encourage the competent authorities to act with due diligence and speed to investigate the 
facts and punish those responsible. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Freedom, pluralism and diversity in the democratic debate 
</b></p>
<p>37. Mindful that one of the basic requirements for the right to freedom of expression is 
that there should be a broad diversity of sources of information, the Special Rapporteur 
evaluated the degree of pluralism and diversity in radio broadcasting.12 The regulation of 
the broadcast spectrum, the situation of community radio stations and the regulation and 
allocation of government advertising are examined below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Allocation of broadcast frequencies 
</b></p>
<p>38. With regard to regulation of the broadcast frequency spectrum and the 
implementation of broadcasting laws, the Special Rapporteur was informed that in June 
2007, the Supreme Court ruled that a number of provisions of the Federal 
Telecommunications Act and the Federal Radio and Television Act were unconstitutional.13 
Its ruling invalidated various aspects of the procedures for acquiring radio broadcasting and

</b></p>
<p>telecommunications concessions and licences, which the Court deemed could jeopardize 
freedom of expression, legal certainty and the prohibition of monopolies.14 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur notes that, four years on, Congress and the federal executive 
branch have still not created the necessary regulatory framework to fill the gaps identified 
by the Supreme Court. This has given rise to a situation of legal uncertainty in the country 
with regard to the regulation of broadcasting. 
</p>
<p>40. Ownership and control of the media to which broadcast frequencies have been 
assigned remain highly concentrated in Mexico. The IACHR Declaration of Principles on 
Freedom of Expression states that: &#8220;Monopolies or oligopolies in the ownership and control 
of the communication media must be subject to anti-trust laws, as they conspire against 
democracy by limiting the plurality and diversity which ensure the full exercise of people&#8217;s 
exercise of the right to information&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur urges Congress and the 
federal executive branch to adopt legislation that meets with the requirements of the 
Supreme Court and international bodies for reducing concentration in the sector and 
contributes to creating pluralist media accessible to all sectors of the population. 
</p>
<p>41. The State must also ensure the existence of public media that are genuinely 
independent of the Government, in order to encourage diversity and guarantee society, inter 
alia, certain educational and cultural services. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Community radio broadcasting 
</b></p>
<p>42. Communication media such as community radio stations and channels play a 
fundamental role in democracy and in preserving and fostering peoples&#8217; cultures. Article 2 
of the Mexican Constitution and article 16 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples enshrine the right of indigenous peoples to establish their own 
media. However, indigenous communities have often been frustrated in their attempts to set 
up radio stations that contribute, among other things, to reflecting their ethnic and cultural 
diversity and to disseminating, preserving and promoting their culture and history. 
</p>
<p>43. In its ruling mentioned above, the Supreme Court declared that some parts of article 
20 of the Federal Radio and Television Act, on the procedure for awarding broadcasting 
licences to non-commercial media, were unconstitutional in that they gave government 
authorities discretionary powers in applying this procedure.15 Since then, according to the 
information received, clear, precise and equitable procedures by which community radio 
stations can apply for and obtain broadcasting frequencies have not been adopted. States 
must have a clear, pre-established, precise and reasonable legal framework that recognizes 
the special characteristics of community broadcasting and includes simple, accessible 
procedures for obtaining licences; a legal framework that does not impose excessive 
technological requirements, that allows community radio stations to use advertising as a 
means of financing and that does not impose discriminatory limits on their financing and 
reach.16 
</p>
<p>44. There is no reason why community radio stations have to be few, poor and have 
limited frequencies. Just because they are non-commercial does not mean that they should 
not generate resources to ensure their sustainability and modernization. Above all, they 
must have the necessary facilities to be able to operate legally. The lack of clear and simple

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.11-13248  (EXT) 
</p>
<p>procedures for obtaining frequencies means that applicant stations are uncertain about the 
procedure, the requirements and the time it will take for a decision to be reached on their 
application. The federal Government has closed down some community radio stations on 
the basis of a regulatory framework that does not conform to international standards. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned about the criminalization of unauthorized community 
radio stations. The use of an unauthorized frequency should constitute an administrative 
misdemeanour, not a crime, yet a warrant was issued for the arrest of radio presenter Jos&#233; 
Maza, of <i>Radio Comunitaria Radio Diversidad</i> of the Paso de Macho peasant community 
in Veracruz, in a criminal case brought against him for using a broadcast frequency without 
the corresponding permit. In one positive development, the Federal Telecommunications 
Commission (COFETEL) awarded six permits to community radio stations in January 
2010. 
</p>
<p>45. Legislation must be adopted that responds to the Supreme Court ruling and 
international standards, in order to provide a clear legal framework for the award of 
operating licences and the functioning of community radio stations.17 
</p>
<p><b> C. Government advertising 
</b></p>
<p>46. States have an obligation to adopt laws prohibiting discrimination in the allocation 
of political advertisements.18 Public spending on government advertising is high and 
increasing. In 2009, the federal Government spent 49 per cent more on official advertising 
than in 2008. Article 134 of the Constitution is not subject to regulation (except during 
electoral periods). There are no legally established criteria for allocating government 
advertising. Although the Ministry of the Interior issues public guidelines each year aimed 
at regulating media processes for that year, such guidelines do not establish objective, clear, 
open, transparent and non-discriminatory procedures and criteria for the award of 
government advertising contracts.19 They are binding only on the federal executive branch 
and do not apply to the other branches of government and autonomous bodies, or to 
individual states, where the allocation of government advertising is often even more 
arbitrary and less transparent. The lack of clear rules leaves excessive room for discretion 
and may lead to arbitrary conduct. 
</p>
<p>47. In the state of Veracruz, spending on social communication and government 
advertising is considered confidential information.20 Handling government advertising may 
have a deterrent effect, comparable in practical terms to that of censorship. There are cases 
where official advertising has allegedly been used as a means to pressure and punish, or 
reward and favour, communication media according to their editorial angle. CNDH found, 
for instance, that after <i>Contral&#237;nea</i> magazine published a series of articles critical of the 
State-owned company Petr&#243;leos Mexicanos (PEMEX), the company ended all contracts for 
official advertising in the magazine.21 CNDH also found that the Guanajuato state 
government cancelled and cut back on the government advertising previously placed in the 
<i>A.M.</i> and <i>Al D&#237;a </i>newspapers as an indirect way of limiting their freedom of expression.22 
<i>Proceso </i>magazine filed a complaint with CNDH after the federal Government allegedly

<p>ended its official advertising contract with the magazine, despite the fact that the magazine 
has a broad and recognized circulation. 
</p>
<p>48. Given the existence of a legal framework that appears to allow the discretionary 
allocation of government advertising, the Special Rapporteur considers it urgent to adopt 
clear, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory rules for contracting this service at both 
the federal and state levels. In this context, he was informed of the publication on 30 
December 2010, in the <i>Diario Oficial de la Federaci&#243;n</i>, of the agreement establishing 
general guidelines for directing, planning, authorizing, coordinating, supervising and 
evaluating the media strategies, programmes and campaigns of units and entities of the 
federal public administration for the 2011 financial year.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Legal actions relating to the exercise of freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Criminal law and freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>49. Freedom of expression is one of the fundamental values of democracy and is 
inherent in respect for other human rights. It is protected by articles 6 and 7 of the Mexican 
Constitution and by the international instruments to which Mexico is a party (International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 19, and Inter-American Convention on 
Human Rights, article 13, among others). The Mexican State has made significant progress 
in transforming its criminal law so that freedom of expression is no longer criminalized. 
The federal Government decriminalized slander, defamation and libel in April 2007 and the 
recent adoption of criminal law reforms in the states of Veracruz and Puebla brings to 18 
the number of states to have decriminalized them. In June 2009, the Supreme Court, ruling 
on a direct <i>amparo</i> application for review (application No. 2044/2008), declared articles 1 
and 30, Fr. II, of the Print Act of the state of Guanajuato, which criminalize invasion of 
privacy, to be incompatible with the Constitution in the case in question.23 
</p>
<p>50. However, the persistence of so-called press crimes and crimes against honour in 14 
states and the survival at federal level of the 1917 Print Offences Act, which provides for 
custodial sentences and remains in force even though it predates the Constitution, are an 
unacceptable obstacle to the full exercise of freedom of expression in Mexico. 
</p>
<p>51. In some cases, the abovementioned laws have allowed criminal proceedings to be 
brought against journalists for expressing opinions on matters of public interest. This is 
what happened to journalist Lydia Cacho, who was charged with defamation and slander 
for having published a book on child pornography in which she made allegations about, 
inter alia, a textile manufacturer and leading politicians.24 Although the case was settled in 
2007 in favour of Lydia Cacho, admission of the complaint initially resulted in her arrest in 
irregular circumstances.25 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur has also received information about criminal proceedings 
brought by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office against journalists working for community radio 
stations that did not have the necessary permits. One such case was that of Rosa Cruz, a 
member of the Pur&#233;pecha indigenous group in the state of Michoac&#225;n, who participated in 
the <i>U&#233;kakua de Ocumicho</i> community radio station. The radio station had three watts of

<p>power and was the only station in the Ocumicho community that transmitted in the 
Pur&#233;pucha language. A large number of Federal Investigation Agency agents burst into the 
radio station&#8217;s premises on 29 January 2009 and the Attorney General&#8217;s Office later 
instituted criminal proceedings against Ms. Cruz. 
</p>
<p>53. Arrest warrants have been issued for three staff members of <i>Radio Diversidad</i> 
community radio station in the municipality of Paso del Macho in the state of Veracruz. 
The Attorney General&#8217;s Office closed down the radio station in March 2009. On 26 March 
2010, a district judge issued a detention order against one of the three staff members for the 
alleged crime of using, benefiting from and exploiting property belonging to the nation 
without a State permit or licence.  
</p>
<p>54. In the state of Guerrero, other criminal law provisions are reportedly being used to 
limit the exercise of freedom of expression, especially with regard to views expressed in the 
context of social protests. On 29 September 2009, the editor of <i>El Sur</i> newspaper was 
arrested by six members of the Guerrero ministerial police because of an article published 
on 3 September in connection with the death of the President of the state Congress. At the 
Ayutla de los Libres prison in the state of Guerrero, the Special Rapporteur talked to Mr. 
Ra&#250;l Hern&#225;ndez, a human rights defender and indigenous leader of the Me&#8217;phaa Indigenous 
People&#8217;s Organization, who had been in pretrial detention for nearly two years even though, 
according to staff of the Guerrero state Commission for the Defence of Human Rights, 
there was insufficient evidence to charge him with the offence for which he had been 
imprisoned. Mr. Hern&#225;ndez was finally released weeks after the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit.  
</p>
<p>55. Social protest is important for the consolidation of democratic life. Such 
participation in public life, as a way of exercising freedom of expression, is of keen social 
interest. For that reason, States have very narrow margins for restricting that form of free 
expression.26 The Special Rapporteur therefore welcomes the recent decision by the First 
Chamber of the Supreme Court to release 12 persons detained in connection with the 
demonstrations that took place in Atenco, state of Mexico, in 2006. The Special Rapporteur 
concurs fully with the Supreme Court that the authorities should not act on the basis of a 
prejudice about the behaviour of a person who demands, by means of social protest, that his 
or her interests be taken into account, and that protest should not be stigmatized as violent 
and subversive.27 
</p>
<p><b> B. Civil actions 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also received information about civil actions brought against 
journalists and media outlets. In some cases, the alleged purpose of these actions was to 
harass critical journalists and media. For instance, the National Human Rights Commission 
characterized as &#8220;harassment&#8221; the civil actions against journalists from the magazines 
<i>Contral&#237;nea </i>and <i>Fortuna, Negocios y Finanzas</i> initiated by individuals and companies 
linked to the same business group, who filed at least five civil lawsuits against them in three 
different states.28 <i>Contral&#237;nea</i> published articles documenting alleged acts of corruption and 
conflicts of interest in the award of PEMEX contracts. Its editor was arrested in 
circumstances questioned by CNDH.29 Personnel of the Federal District&#8217;s Ministry of 
Public Security and several civilians claiming to represent the plaintiffs raided the

<p>magazine&#8217;s premises. These incidents would seem to indicate an attempt to use the criminal 
justice system to harass and silence journalists. 
</p>
<p>57. In Guerrero, a civil action for 10 million pesos was brought in 2007 against the 
editor and journalists of <i>El Sur</i> newspaper by the brother of the then state Governor, 
following the publication of information of public interest on the award of contracts by the 
state Ministry of Education. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur recalls that, as the Inter-American Court has pointed out, 
opinions cannot be considered true or false and, as such, cannot be the object of any 
sanction.30 There must be differentiated standards for evaluating the subsequent liability of 
those who disseminate information on matters of public interest or political criticism, 
including the standard of actual malice, as well as strict proportionality and reasonability of 
penalties.31 
</p>
<p>59. Media workers who investigate cases of corruption or wrongdoing should not be 
targeted for legal or other harassment in retaliation for their work.32 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Access to information 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur expresses his satisfaction at the considerable progress made 
by the State in recent years with regard to the right of access to information. The country&#8217;s 
performance in this area has been exemplary. The right of access to information is 
enshrined in Mexico&#8217;s Constitution. The Federal Act on Transparency and Access to 
Governmental Public Information created the Federal Institute for Access to Information 
and Protection of Data (IFAI), which has played a crucial role in protecting people&#8217;s right 
of access to information and in developing a culture of transparency in institutions of the 
federal public administration. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Supreme Court and the Federal Electoral 
Tribunal both for their case law guaranteeing the right of access to information and for their 
innovative policies on transparency. He calls on the country&#8217;s other courts, particularly 
state courts, to emulate these examples of transparency and public accessibility. 
</p>
<p>62. Despite the progress made, some challenges can still be observed with regard to the 
effective guarantee of this right. The institutional and legal framework guaranteeing the 
effective exercise of the right of access to information in relation to the federal executive 
branch does not always exist at state and municipal level. Many state and municipal 
authorities seem to be unaware of their obligations in this area and do not have specific 
established procedures for enabling the public genuinely and effectively to exercise this 
right. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur also observes that IFAI oversees compliance with the 
Federal Act on Transparency and Access to Governmental Public Information only in the 
federal public administration, while the legislative branch and the judiciary and other 
autonomous bodies do not have an independent oversight body.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.11-13248  (EXT) 
</p>
<p>64. Lawsuits have been filed that seek to dispute the definitive, unchallengeable nature 
of the decisions of IFAI and state transparency bodies. While, traditionally, the courts had 
rejected attempts by the public authorities to contest IFAI decisions judicially, the Special 
Rapporteur was told that the Federal Court of Fiscal and Administrative Justice (TFJFA) 
has recently begun to accept challenges to IFAI decisions.  
</p>
<p>65. The Supreme Court is currently reviewing an action of unconstitutionality against 
the Act on Transparency and Access to Public Information of the state of Campeche. The 
Act allows affected public entities to contest decisions of the state Commission on 
Transparency and Access to Public Information judicially. A decision has yet to be taken on 
the action of unconstitutionality. The Special Rapporteur believes that giving affected 
entities an opportunity to contest the decisions of IFAI and its state counterparts through 
ordinary judicial remedies effectively denies others the right to obtain the requested 
information by means of a simple, speedy and specialized process, thereby nullifying the 
right of access to information. 
</p>
<p>66. CNDH filed an action of unconstitutionality alleging the invalidity of article 16 of 
the Federal Code of Criminal Procedure, which regulates access to the case files of pretrial 
investigations. On the basis of this article, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office has refused to 
provide public versions of pretrial investigations that have been completed or have been 
inactive beyond a reasonable period of time, even when it comes to cases of grave human 
rights violations or crimes against humanity such as the investigations into the enforced 
disappearances of Rosendo Radilla Pacheco and others. 
</p>
<p>67. Like the National Human Rights Commission, IFAI has held that unjustified 
restrictions on access to already completed or totally inactive pretrial investigations violate 
the guarantees of access to public information contained in article 6 of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the need to maintain the confidentiality of 
ongoing pretrial investigations so as not to jeopardize the investigation and to protect 
sensitive information. However, providing a public version of information on investigations 
that have been completed or that have been inactive for years, subject to the protection of 
sensitive information and of elements which it has been proved must remain confidential in 
order to protect other legitimate interests, helps publicize the case and guarantee proper 
inter-institutional and public oversight of criminal justice institutions. This is precisely the 
purpose of the right of access to information. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur was informed that in some states such as Sinaloa and in the 
Federal District, sentencing grounds are kept secret from the public until all stages of the 
corresponding proceedings are complete. This practice affects the right of access to 
information and prevents public oversight of judicial sentences.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Based on the information gathered before, during and after the visit and in 
view of the situation of freedom of expression in the country, the Special Rapporteur 
draws the following conclusions: 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Although the current problem of violence in Mexico affects all sectors of the 
population, attacks on journalists and media workers have multiplier effects that 
affect other members of the profession, generate fear and self-censorship, deprive 
society in general of its fundamental right to information and discourage critical 
reporting, all of which increases impunity. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The impunity that characterizes crimes against journalists and media workers 
in Mexico has the perverse effect of encouraging further crimes of this nature. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.11-13248  (EXT) <b>17

<p>73. <b>Freedom of expression faces serious obstacles in Mexico, mainly because of the 
acts of intimidation and violence suffered by journalists. Over the past 10 years, 66 
journalists have been murdered and 12 have been disappeared, making Mexico the 
most dangerous place in the Americas in which to practise journalism. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Most murders, disappearances and kidnappings of journalists are concentrated 
in states where organized crime has a large presence, including Chihuahua, Coahuila, 
Durango, Guerrero, Michoac&#225;n, Nuevo Le&#243;n, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas. In some of 
these states, there are communities that have been completely silenced by the chilling 
effect of the climate of impunity and violence. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In these states, organized crime is the biggest threat to the lives and physical 
integrity of journalists, especially those who cover local news on administrative 
corruption, drug trafficking, organized crime, public security and related issues. 
Incomplete investigations in the vast majority of cases prevent an exact determination 
of the causes and perpetrators of these crimes. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Without a comprehensive public policy aimed at guaranteeing the freedom to 
seek, receive and disseminate information through any medium, it is impossible for 
Mexican society to contribute to the fight against organized crime, criminality and 
corruption and to exercise active and informed oversight of the State&#8217;s actions to deal 
with crime and protect the public. Protection of the right to freedom of expression 
must be a fundamental part of the public security agenda in Mexico. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur commends the existence of a Special 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the preliminary discussions on the creation of a mechanism 
for the protection of journalists both nationally and in some states. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The situation in Mexico is not conducive to diversity and pluralism. With 
regard to the regulation of the broadcast spectrum and the implementation of 
broadcasting laws, the Special Rapporteur observes that ownership and control of the 
media to which broadcast frequencies have been assigned are highly concentrated. 
The existing legal framework does not offer guarantees of certainty, pluralism and 
diversity and there is no independent regulatory body. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>With regard to community radio stations, there is no legal framework for their 
recognition and there are no clear, precise and equitable procedures for awarding 
them operating frequencies. The only legal mechanism is the permit for non-
commercial cultural stations. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Spending on government advertising is high and increasing. The absence of a 
regulatory framework has allowed official advertising contracts to be awarded on a 
discretionary basis, meaning that the allocation of government advertising can be used 
to pressure, reward, punish or favour communication media according to their 
editorial angle. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the progress made at the federal level 
and in most states in decriminalizing slander, defamation and libel. Nevertheless, 
there are still criminal law provisions that allow the exercise of freedom of expression 
to be criminalized. Criminal law provisions continue to be used against journalists 
who cover matters of public interest, individuals who work for community radio 
stations and social activists who engage in acts of social protest.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The use of direct or indirect pressure to silence journalists&#8217; news reporting is 
incompatible with freedom of expression as enshrined in article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. News coverage of complaints or the expression of opinions </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.11-13248  (EXT) 
</p>
<p><b>critical of public officials enjoy broad protection under international human rights 
law. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>According to the highest international standards in the area of freedom of 
expression, persons in public office have a duty to face a higher level of criticism and 
scrutiny than the rest of society because they have voluntarily assumed public 
responsibilities. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Civil actions continue to be brought against journalists and media outlets in a 
legal environment in which there are no differentiated standards for evaluating the 
subsequent liability of those who disseminate information on matters of public interest 
or political criticism. Civil lawsuits have allegedly been brought against journalists 
and media outlets as a means of harassing them and even silencing criticism. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>In recent years, Mexico has led the way in ensuring access to information. 
Nevertheless, the institutional and legal framework guaranteeing the effective exercise 
of the right of access to information with regard to the federal executive branch does 
not always exist at the state and municipal levels. State-level laws have been 
promulgated and judicial appeals lodged in an attempt to reverse the definitive, 
unchallengeable nature of the decisions of the Federal Institute for Access to 
Information and Protection of Data and of state transparency bodies. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Practices exist that limit transparency in the criminal justice system. Some state 
courts maintain the confidentiality of appealed lower court judgements until all stages 
of the corresponding proceedings are complete. Likewise, under a recent amendment 
to article 16 of the Federal Code of Criminal Procedure, pretrial investigations remain 
confidential for a period of time equal to that of the statute of limitations for the 
offences in question. The amendment is currently under review by the Supreme 
Court. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the fundamental importance of the work 
done by civil society organizations that monitor all aspects of the exercise of freedom 
of expression in Mexico, including attacks on journalists. 
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Based on the above conclusions, the Special Rapporteur makes the following 
recommendations, while reiterating that he is fully at the disposal of the Mexican 
State to work with it on their implementation:</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>The State party should expedite the adoption and entry into force of the 
constitutional amendments on human rights and <i>amparo</i> and issue the corresponding 
secondary legislation as soon as possible, in order fully to respect and guarantee the 
right to freedom of expression.</b> 
</p>

participation of journalists and civil society organizations in its design, operation and 
evaluation. The Special Rapporteur notes the signing on 3 November 2010, by the 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Federal Public Security and the Interior, the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office and the National Human Rights Commission, of the cooperation 
agreement for the implementation of preventive and protective actions for journalists;

</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Adopt a regulatory framework that offers legal certainty, reduces the 
concentration of television and radio ownership and control and helps create pluralist 
media that are accessible to all sectors of the population;

radio and television; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Establish objective, clear, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria 
for the allocation of official advertising at all levels and in all areas of government. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Legal actions relating to the exercise of freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Amend state criminal codes in order to remove offences that are used to 
criminalize freedom of expression and refrain from using other criminal law 
provisions to punish the lawful exercise of freedom of expression; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Repeal the 1917 Print Offences Act; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.11-13248  (EXT) 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Guarantee that journalists and media workers are not subjected to 
judicial or other harassment in retaliation for their work by establishing 
differentiated standards for the evaluation of subsequent civil liability, including the 
standard of actual malice, and strict proportionality and reasonability of any 
subsequent penalties; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Adopt legislation to regulate the right of reply in accordance with article 
6 of the Constitution and international standards;

<p><b>(c) Ensure that the authorities do not flout the decisions of transparency 
bodies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Give transparency bodies constitutional autonomy so that they can 
perform their promotion and oversight functions with respect to all those who are 
bound by the laws governing access to information; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Consider public interest entities, particularly political parties, and other 
publicly funded entities to be bound by the laws on access to information; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Increase transparency in the criminal justice system by guaranteeing

investigations that have been completed or that have been inactive beyond a 
reasonable period of time.

<p><b> E. Final recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on the owners of communication media to 
provide appropriate support to journalists, including safety protocols and appropriate 
training to reduce risk. Journalists and their family members should have social 
security coverage. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Mexican society and the international 
community to continue supporting the work and efforts of the civil society 
organizations that monitor the exercise of freedom of expression in Mexico. These 
organizations must be able to work in safety. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur makes a special appeal to journalists to continue and 
expand solidarity and mutual support initiatives.
