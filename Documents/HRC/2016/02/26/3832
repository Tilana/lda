<p><b>  Report of the International Commission of Inquiry 
on C&#244;te d'Ivoire</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> By its resolution 16/25, the Human Rights Council established an independent, 
international commission of inquiry to &#8220;investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding 
the allegations of serious abuses and violations of human rights committed in C&#244;te d'Ivoire 
following the presidential election of 28 November 2010, in order to identify those 
responsible for such acts and to bring them to justice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> The Commission is composed of Vitit Muntarbhorn (Chair), Reine Alapini-Gansou 
and Suliman Ali Baldo. 
</p>
<p> The Commission visited C&#244;te d'Ivoire from 4 to 28 May 2011. Besides Abidjan, it 
travelled to the western, northern and southern parts of the country, including the towns of 
Du&#233;kou&#233;, Guiglo, Korhogo, Odienn&#233; and San Pedro. It had meetings with the Ivorian 
authorities, including President Alassane Ouattara, Prime Minister Guillaume Soro, 
political figures, national institutions, international organizations and civil society 
organizations. Assisted by a technical team provided by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, it interviewed hundreds of victims and direct 
witnesses of human rights violations and took testimony from relatives of victims or other 
persons with indirect knowledge of certain violations. It also went to Liberia, where a large 
number of Ivorians have taken refuge and met there with governmental authorities and 
representatives of the United Nations Mission in Liberia. 
</p>
<p> The many victims in the western and south-western parts of the country and in 
Abidjan are paying a heavy price. 
</p>
<p> The Commission considers that every person killed is one victim too many and 
has chosen not to become involved in the debate about the number of victims. Owing 
to time and resource constraints, no estimate could be made of losses of human life during 
</p>

<p><b>2</b> GE.<footnote name="1">07. In the tense and threatening circumstances prevailing, human rights defenders could 
not do their work. In talks with members of civil society, it was learned that many had 
suffered violence and persecution and indeed received death threats from both camps. Two 
of them are still reported missing. The current climate of insecurity and uncertainty does 
not encourage them to carry on with their activities without misgivings, particularly those 
who openly supported the Gbagbo Government. </footnote>1-14375 (EXT) 
</p>
<p>the crisis. It is believed, however, on the basis of information gathered during the 
Commission's field visits and by cross-checking, that some 3,000 persons may have been 
killed. 
</p>
<p> The political crisis in C&#244;te d'Ivoire grew out of former President Laurent Gbagbo's 
refusal to accept the results of the election. In addition, the exploitation of the ethnic 
question, the manipulation by political figures of young Ivorians, turning them into 
instruments of violence, together with unresolved rural land issues, are among the 
underlying causes of the massive, serious violations of human rights. The elections served 
as a catalyst for the violence. 
</p>
<p> The Commission noted that most of the persons it met wished to see Ivorian 
communities continuing to live together. It also notes that the Government has indicated at 
the highest level that national reconciliation is a priority. The Commission wishes 
nevertheless to emphasize that there can be no lasting reconciliation without justice. 
</p>
<p> In this context, the Commission recommends, in particular, that the Government of 
C&#244;te d'Ivoire ensure that those responsible for violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law are brought to justice. In this context, the investigations that have been 
initiated must be conducted in an exhaustive, impartial and transparent fashion. 
</p>
<p> In order to ensure effective follow-up to its recommendations and assist the Ivorian 
authorities in combating impunity, the Commission recommends that the Human Rights 
Council establish an independent mechanism on the human rights situation in C&#244;te d'Ivoire 
and publish the report of the International Commission of Inquiry set up by the 
Commission on Human Rights in 2004 in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of 
the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p> It recommends that the international community support the governmental 
authorities, particularly at the financial level, in their efforts to combat impunity and 
promote the rule of law. Lastly, it recommends that the United Nations should undertake, at 
the earliest opportunity, an evaluation of the work carried out during the crisis, in particular 
by the United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d'Ivoire (ONUCI) and humanitarian agencies, in 
order to enhance its ability to prevent conflicts and protect the civilian population.

the west and in Abidjan. Children, sometimes of very young age, were briefly trained and 
armed and were used at roadblocks, in neighbourhood surveillance and/or in fighting. In 
other cases, children were used to cook and help armed groups in other ways. Thus, a 
young Ivorian who had taken refuge in Liberia recounted to the Commission how he had 
been captured in Doke by members of FRCI under the command of a man by the name of </footnote>1-14375 (EXT) <b>3

From the early days of the post-electoral crisis, children suffered from violations of 
their rights by all the parties to the conflict. Some of those violations concerned the civilian 
population as a whole (assassinations, whether targeted not, injuries, mutilations, 
abductions, sexual violence, etc.), while others were specific violations of the rights of the 
child (enforced or &#8220;voluntary&#8221; recruitment/use, attacks against schools and hospitals).

militiamen and Liberian mercenaries killed the imam and his 72-year-old tutor. The attacks 
are said to have ceased in the early afternoon with the taking of the city by FRCI. As they 
retreated, the militiamen reportedly plundered and set fire to numerous houses. On 29

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Establishment and legal basis of the Commission 
</b></p>
<p>1. The refusal of former President Gbagbo to give up power after being defeated in the 
presidential elections of 28 November 2010 plunged C&#244;te d'Ivoire into an unprecedented 
political crisis marked by grave and massive violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law. There were many reports of extrajudicial and summary executions, rape, 
acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, enforced disappearances, 
arbitrary arrests and detentions, attacks against religious buildings, and act of intimidation, 
harassment and extortion. 
</p>
<p>2. In view of the deteriorating human rights situation in C&#244;te d'Ivoire, a special session 
of the Human Rights Council (hereinafter referred to as the Council) was held on 23 
December 2010. On that occasion, the Council adopted resolution S-14/1, in which it 
strongly condemns the human rights violations committed and calls on all the relevant 
parties to immediately put an end to them. It also urges all actors, in particular defence and 
security forces, to refrain from all acts of violence, to respect all human rights and all 
fundamental freedoms and to assume their responsibilities for the protection of the civilian 
population. 
</p>
<p><b>  Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>3. At its sixteenth ordinary session, the Council adopted resolution 16/25 whereby it 
decided to establish an international commission of inquiry to &#8220;investigate the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the allegations of serious abuses and violations of human rights 
committed in C&#244;te d'Ivoire following the presidential election of 28 November 2010, in 
order to identify those responsible for such acts and to bring them to justice, and present its 
findings to the Council at its seventeenth session&#8221;. The High Commissioner for Human 
Rights was requested to provide the Commission with the support needed for it to carry out 
its mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>  Composition of the Commission 
</b></p>
<p>4. On 11 April 2011, the President of the Council appointed the three members of the 
Commission: Vitit Muntarbhorn of Thailand (Chair), Reine Alapini Gansou of Benin 
(member) and Suliman Baldo of Sudan (member). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>5. The members of the Commission held consultations in Geneva from 2 to 4 May and 
had meetings with representatives of the Permanent Mission of C&#244;te d'Ivoire in Geneva, the 
President of the Council, the High Commissioner, various diplomatic representatives, 
United Nations agencies and humanitarian organizations, as well as civil society 
organizations. The members of the Commission then went to C&#244;te d'Ivoire, where they 
stayed from 4 to 28 May 2011. 
</p>
<p>6. Besides Abidjan, they travelled to the northern, western and southern parts of the 
country. They also went to Liberia in order to understand better the cross-border aspects of 
the conflict. 
</p>
<p>7. On the ground, the Commission had meetings with the Ivorian authorities, including 
President Ouattara and Prime Minister Soro, political figures, national institutions, </p>


<p>GE.11-14375 (EXT) <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>international organizations, in particular UNOCI, and civil society organizations. Assisted 
by a team of investigators and a forensic pathologist, the Commission met with hundreds of 
victims and direct witnesses of human rights violations. It also took testimony from 
relatives of victims or persons with indirect knowledge of certain violations. The 
Commission also gathered collective testimony from human rights organizations and other 
associations, all of which helped to shed light on the sequence of events. The Commission 
went to various sites considered to have been particularly affected by violations, notably 
hospitals, clinics, places of summary execution and morgues, but also mass graves and 
cemeteries. Lastly, it visited places where persons were being held under house arrest, in 
particular Hotel Pergola in Abidjan and presidential villas in Korgoho and Odienn&#233;. 
</p>
<p>8. The Commission collected written documents, photos and video recordings from a 
variety of sources. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Constitution of C&#244;te d'Ivoire gives considerable importance to the protection of 
human rights and public freedoms. It recognizes the ethnic, cultural and religious diversity 
of the country and enshrines the principle of human equality. It stipulates that human rights 
are inviolable and that the public authorities have the obligation to ensure that those rights 
are respected, protected and promoted. In accordance with the provisions of article 87, 
international treaties or agreements prevail over laws. 
</p>
<p>10. C&#244;te d'Ivoire is a party to most international and regional instruments relating to 
human rights and international humanitarian law; those instruments are applicable to the 
events that occurred during the period under consideration. It has signed but not yet ratified 
the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. By declarations made successively by 
President Gbagbo in 2003 and President Ouattara in 2010, C&#244;te d'Ivoire has accepted the 
Court's jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The forces on the ground 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forces de d&#233;fense et de s&#233;curit&#233; 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Forces de d&#233;fense et de s&#233;curit&#233; (FDS) were placed under the command of 
President Gbagbo who, as provided for in the Constitution, is the Commander- in-Chief of 
the Armed Forces, until 17 March, when the Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d'Ivoire (FRCI) 
were created. However, Mr. Gbagbo continued to rely on the loyalty of the elite units of the 
FDS, which were the best equipped and whose members were handpicked to ensure the 
protection of his regime. The FDS had a total strength of 55,000 members led by the head 
of the armed forces of C&#244;te d'Ivoire (CEMA), General Philippe Mangou. In late March, 
after General Mangou had deserted his post to take refuge in the embassy of South Africa, 
General Dogbo Bl&#233; was appointed acting head of the armed forces. 
</p>
<p>12. Those components of the FDS1 that were most involved in the events after 28 
November are the Forces Arm&#233;es Nationales de C&#244;te d'Ivoire (FANCI), the national 
gendarmerie, the national police and the special/joint units. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The other components of the FDS are the military fire brigade, customs and immigration and the

<p>13. The FANCI, which come under the authority of the Minister of Defence, consist of 
three forces: the army, the air force and the navy. To the knowledge of the Commission, the 
air force played no role in the events that occurred after the second round of the presidential 
election. As for the navy, only the marine commando units (FUMACO) seem to have been 
active during the events. 
</p>
<p>14. In the case of the ground forces placed under the command of General Firmin Detho 
Letho, it appears that only special units were involved in the events. These special units 
comprise: the ground-to-air artillery battalion (BASA); the command and support battalion 
(BCS); the parachute commando battalion (BCP); and the rapid intervention mobile unit 
(DMIR). 
</p>
<p>15. The Republican Guard (GR) has a special status. Composed of some 1,500 soldiers, 
it is directly subject operationally to the office of the President of the Republic. This elite 
force, consisting of three infantry regiments quartered in Abidjan, was placed under the 
command of General Dogbo Bl&#233;, who has been under arrest since 15 April and is being 
held in Korhogo. 
</p>
<p>16. The national gendarmerie also comes under the Ministry of Defence and numbers 
some 12,000 men. It is headed by the commanding officer of the gendarmerie, General 
Edouard Tiap&#233; Kassarat&#233;. 
</p>
<p>17. The national police comes under the Ministry of the Interior. It is headed by the 
director-general of the national police, M&#180;Bia Br&#233;dou. During the crisis, there were a large 
number of defections within the police. 
</p>
<p>18. There are many different kinds of special or joint units. The Groupe de S&#233;curit&#233; de 
la Pr&#233;sidence de la R&#233;publique (GSPR) is responsible for the close protection of the 
President. It was under the command of Colonel Major Nathana&#235;l Ahouman Brouha, who 
was assassinated on 4 May 2011 in Grand Lahou while being transferred to Abidjan. 
Traditionally headed by an army or gendarmerie commander, it is under the direct authority 
of the office of the President. 
</p>
<p>19. The Security Operations Command Centre (CECOS)2 was headed by the brigadier 
general of the gendarmerie, Georges Guiai Bi Poin, who left his post on Thursday 
March 2011. Its head of operations was superintendent Joachim Robe Gogo, who was 
arrested and handed over to the military prosecutor on 29 April 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Forces arm&#233;es des forces nouvelles

<p>20. The Forces arm&#233;es des forces nouvelles (FAFN) were the army of the Forces 
nouvelles de C&#244;te d'Ivoire, whose secretary-general was the current Prime Minister and 
Minister of Defence Guillaume Soro. They were organized along the lines of the national 
army, with General Souma&#239;la Bakayoko as Chief of Staff. Their headquarters was in

<p><b> C. Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d'Ivoire 
</b></p>
<p>21. By Order No. 211-002 of 17 March 2011, President Ouattara established the Forces 
R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d'Ivoire (FRCI) by merging FDS and FAFN. This new force is 
placed under the authority of Defence Minister Guillaume Soto. Since being established, 
FRCI have supplanted FAFN in capturing towns under the control of allies of Mr. Gbagbo. 
A tactical staff unit under the command of General Bakayoko exercised authority over the 
national territory subdivided from that time into four sectors placed under the command of 
sector commanders.<footnote name="4">9. From 18 to 20 January, FDS (in particular, members of CECOS, the Compagnie 
R&#233;publicaine de S&#233;curit&#233; (CRS), agents of the anti-riot brigade and soldiers of the Marine) 
put down any demonstration of support for the civil disobedience operation launched 
throughout the country by RHDP on 18 January. 
</footnote> 
</p>
<p><b> D. Militias and mercenaries 
</b></p>
<p>22. Militiamen are civil combatants who are citizens of C&#244;te d'Ivoire recruited and 
armed to provide military support to an organized group, whether in the camp of Mr. 
Gbagbo or in that of Mr. Ouattara. 
</p>
<p><i>  Militias loyal to the Gbagbo camp 
</i></p>
<p>23. As a general rule, the nature and operation of militias are linked to the Jeunes 
patriotes (JP) or the &#8220;galaxie patriotique&#8221; with which they are intrinsically connected. 
</p>
<p>24. The JP are essentially a political group traditionally used by Mr. Gbagbo following 
his accession to power in 2000. They come from every social background and are organized 
into several federations and politicized associations such as the F&#233;d&#233;ration estudiantine et 
scolaire de C&#244;te d'Ivoire (FESCI), les parlements Agora, le Congr&#232;s Panafricain des jeunes 
et des patriotes (COJEP), les Femmes patriotes, and the Union pour la lib&#233;ration totale de la 
C&#244;te d'Ivoire (UPLTCI). In addition to these political groups, there exist paramilitary 
militias, which are more active in some periods than in others and who played a dominant 
role for Mr. Gbagbo during the crisis. 
</p>
<p>25. Two major groups can be distinguished around the Minister of Youth, Mr. Charles 
Bl&#233; Goud&#233;, and COJEP, on the one hand, and around Eugene Dju&#233; and ULPTCI, on the 
other, often regarded as the most radical group. JP serve as the political support and 
propaganda tool of the former president and, if necessary, his military arm. According to 
reports from credible sources, the special adviser of President Gbagbo, Kadet Bertin, and 
the director-general of Abidjan harbour, Marcel Gossio, helped to finance and arm the 
militias.

<p>26. In Abidjan, the most active militias in the post-electoral crisis were armed elements 
of FESCI and militias attached to the Front national pour la lib&#233;ration totale de la C&#244;te 
d'Ivoire (FNLTCI). 
</p>
<p>27. Notable pro-Gbagbo militias in the west were: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Le Front de lib&#233;ration du Grand Ouest (FLGO): With a membership 7,000 strong, it 
is directed by the leader and war chief Denis Glofi&#233;i Mohu, who commands all the 
western militias. He is close to Mr. Bl&#233; Goud&#233; and was seen at the beginning of the 
crisis with some men in the district of Yopougon in Abidjan; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; L&#180;Union des patriotes r&#233;sistants du Grand Ouest (UPRGO): With some 500 
members, it is directed by the leader and war chief Gabriel Banao, a retired general. 
At a meeting with the Commission, Mr. Banao acknowledged that UPRGO used 200 
Gu&#233;r&#233; combatants in C&#244;te d'Ivoire at the time of the ethnic clashes to gain control of 
Du&#233;kou&#233;. Moreover, the Commission was able to consult documents seized when 
FRCI took the city, including a letter signed by Mr. Banao and addressed to Mr. 
Gbagbo in which he requested medical assistance. Mr. Banao told the Commission 
that, as early as 2003, Mr. Gbagbo had given money to the chief of FLGO, General 
Maho, to finance other ethnic militias of the Grand Ouest region; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; L&#180;Alliance des patriotes W&#234; (AP-W&#234;) with under 1,000 men, nearly half of whom 
are Liberians. It is headed by Julien Mompeho &#8220;Colombo&#8221; and is active in Du&#233;kou&#233;, 
Bangolo, Guiglo, Blol&#233;uin and Toulepleu; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Le Mouvement Ivoirien pour la Lib&#233;ration de l&#180;Ouest de la C&#244;te d'Ivoire (MILOCI) 
is headed by Pastor Gammi. 
</p>
<p>28. All the western militias (AP-W&#234;, UPRGO, MILOCI, FLGO) are affiliated with the 
Front de R&#233;sistance du Grand Ouest (FRGO) headed by &#8220;General&#8221; Denis Maho Glofi&#233;i. 
Some militias are associated with Liberian militias. 
</p>
<p><i>  Militias loyal to the Ouattara camp 
</i></p>
<p>29. The Dozo, who are traditional hunters, are FAFN sympathizers. They are suspected 
of arms trafficking along the north-west border and of armed attacks in the areas of 
Bangolo, Du&#233;kou&#233; and Kouibly; they are also identified as the main perpetrators of the 
massacres carried out on 28 and 29 March in Du&#233;kou&#233;, although pro-Gbagbo mercenaries 
are said to be responsible for some of the killings. 
</p>
<p>30. The &#8220;Invisible Commando&#8221; had a membership some 5,000 strong at the end of the 
fighting. Its heartland and field of operations was in the PK-18 district of Abidjan, in 
particular the local school where the militiamen received their training. It was officially 
under the command of Ibrahim Coulibaly, known as &#8220;IB&#8221;, killed on 27 April during a 
standoff with the FRCI because of his refusal to disarm his men.

<p>32. In Liberia, the Commission met with a mercenary leader known by the name of Bob 
Marley and his deputy Prince Baroley. They operated side-by-side with the forces 
supporting Mr. Gbagbo in the region of Guiglo and are reported to have been responsible 
for an attack on the Blol&#233;quin Prefecture, which took the lives of some 50 people. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Impartial forces

<p>33. The United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d'Ivoire (UNOCI) is a peacekeeping 
operation set up under United Nations Security Council resolution 1528. With a strength of 
some 10,000 men, ONUCI has been deployed since 4 April 2004 and is tasked with 
monitoring the application of the 2003 and 2005 cease-fire and peace agreements and 
assisting the Ivorian authorities in the implementation of the various measures provided for 
in those agreements. France participates in ONUCI through Force Licorne, a third-tier 
quick-reaction force with a strength of 1,<footnote name="6">3. Following the curfew violation, on 23 February, FAFN launched a counteroffensive, 
attacking and conquering one after the other the western towns, including Zouan Hounien, 
Toulepleu, Dok&#233;, Blol&#233;quin, Du&#233;kou&#233; and Guiglo. In a number of cases, FDS in position in 
those towns fled before the arrival of FAFN and, later, FRCI. Nevertheless, between their 
departure and the taking of the city by FAFN or FRCI, groups of Jeunes patriotes and 
militiamen, sometimes with the support of mercenaries, committed numerous acts of 
violence against the civilian population. This was true in particular of Guiglou and Divo. In 
Du&#233;kou&#233;, on 28 March, FDS defended themselves for some 24 hours, receiving 
reinforcements from Guiglou.

<p><b> III. Facts and characterization of the facts 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Origin of the crisis: remote and immediate causes 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Remote causes 
</i></p>
<p>34. Following the death in 1993 of President Houphou&#235;t-Boigny, a fierce struggle to 
succeed him broke out among Ivorian political figures. The ensuing tension helped pave the 
way for the development of the concept of &#8220;ivoirit&#233;&#8221;, a political battle weapon created by 
Mr. Henri Konan B&#233;di&#233;, which he put into effect through rural land rights legislation that 
barred part of the Ivorian population from owning property.5 Xenophobia was rampant, 
targeting in particular Ivorian agricultural workers originating from Burkina Faso, Mali, 
Ghana, Togo and Benin or migrants from those neighbouring countries who in many cases 
had been living in C&#244;te d'Ivoire for several decades. 
</p>
<p>35. It became common for politicians and the media to speak of the inhabitants of C&#244;te 
d'Ivoire as being indigenous or non-indigenous or indigenous of non-indigenous descent; in 
time, ordinary people did the same. From that time on, there were increasing numbers of 
political incidents tainted by xenophobia until the accession to power of President Robert 
Gue&#239;, then Mr. Gbagbo in 2000, who remained in power until the 2010 presidential 
elections. 
</p>
<p><i>  Immediate causes of the crisis: the 2010 elections 
</i></p>
<p>36. The electoral campaign and the first round of the presidential election took place in a 
peaceful and free atmosphere, notwithstanding a few sporadic incidents6 between 
</p>
<p>  
 5 Under the 1998 Rural Land Act, only the State, public authorities and Ivorian natural persons are 
</p>
<p>allowed to own rural land. Because of the fears expressed by a large number of non-Ivorian 
landowners who had been cultivating the land for sometimes as long as several generations, and in 
particular the exclusion of their non-Ivorian heirs from land ownership, the 1998 Act was amended 
pursuant to the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. A law dated 14 August 2004 thus stipulated that rural 
land ownership rights acquired before 2004 are transmissible to heirs. Landowners to whom the 
exception applies are required to be included in a list drawn up by the Council of Ministers. 
</p>
<p> 6 There were some isolated minor clashes in Bouafl&#233;, Daloa, Guiglo, Katiola and Niabl&#233;, and election 
posters were destroyed in some regions. </p>

</p>
<p>supporters of the Front populaire ivoirien (FPI) and the Rassemblement des R&#233;publicains 
(RDR). Between the two ballots, the Rassemblement des Houphou&#233;tistes pour la 
D&#233;mocratie et la Paix (RHDP), which grouped together several political parties opposed to 
FPI and to La Majorit&#233; Pr&#233;sidentielle (LMP) of former President Gbagbo, called on the 
population, through the mouth of Mr. B&#233;di&#233; and his supporters, to vote for Mr. Ouattara in 
the second round. On 10 November, Mr. Ouattara publicly pledged to share power with the 
Parti D&#233;mocratique de la C&#244;te d'Ivoire (PDCI) if Mr. B&#233;di&#233; won. 
</p>
<p>37. On 27 November, the day before the second round, President Gbagbo decreed a 
curfew. The opposition political parties unanimously denounced that measure. The Forces 
Nouvelles announced that they did not wish to apply the measure in the northern part of the 
country. It was maintained nevertheless, despite the representations made by the Ivorian 
peace process facilitator, President Blaise Compaor&#233; of Burkina Faso. In the circumstances, 
the Gbagbo camp described Mr.Ouattara as the &#8220;father of the rebellion&#8221; while inciting 
Gbagbo supporters to acts of violence against the Dioula ethnic group to which Mr. 
Ouattara belongs. The slogans &#8220;win or win&#8221; or &#8220;My votes goes 100 per cent to the original&#8221; 
adopted by President Gbagbo merely stoked up the tension. 
</p>
<p>38. On 28 November, the day of the second round of the election, attempts to prevent 
members of the Dioula and Baoul&#233; ethnic communities from voting, particularly in Lakota, 
Issia and San Pedro, led to violent clashes between supporters of Mr. Gbagbo and those of 
Mr. Ouattara. In both camps, the obstacles put in the way by the opposing party in the area 
under its control were noted and condemned. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Description of the facts 
</b></p>
<p>39. The crisis can be said to have developed, broadly speaking, in four stages, as 
reflected in the sequence of events. 
</p>
<p>40. The first stage, running from 27 November to mid-December 2010, was 
characterized by protest demonstrations in Abidjan and other cities following the curfew 
decreed on the eve of the second ballot and, later, after the results had been proclaimed. 
</p>
<p>41. The second stage began with the crackdown on RHDP marches on 16 December 
2010 and continued until the end of January 2011. During that operation, the law 
enforcement services (police and gendarmerie) sought help from the military (FUMACO, 
BASA, BCS, BCP, DMIR, CECOS, Garde r&#233;publicaine) and thereafter ceased to intervene 
except at the request and under the command of the chief of the army general staff. The 
clashes of 16 December marked a turning point in the conflict, not only because they 
clearly pointed to mounting tension but also because it was then that the use of organic 
weapons and the maintenance of law and order by security forces gave way to the 
deployment of weapons of war.<footnote name="7">7. In the context of the elections, most observers noted the professionalism and civic 
sense of the Ivorian media in their coverage of the first round of the presidential elections. 
However, the media put a negative slant on their campaign coverage for the second round, 
taking partisan positions and reporting incendiary speech. On the pretext of defending 
national sovereignty, the State media gradually developed a campaign calling for patriotic 
resistance through virulent writings and reports tainted by xenophobia. RTI appears to have </footnote> Self-defence groups were then formed by local youths to 
protect the population, headed by FAFN commanders. They armed themselves by 
recovering weapons abandoned by FDS, as in San Pedro. 
</p>
<p>  
 7 The following weapons were found to have been used: RPG-7 rocket launcher, heavy military 
</p>
<p>weapons: mortar 82 (mine launcher), 120 mm. mortar, BM-21 multiple rocket launcher (or Stalin's 
organ), one of which was captured by FRCI in Toulepleu, T55 tanks, AML-90 (light armoured car), 
BTR-80 (armoured personnel carrier, seen in particular during the demonstration of 16 December 
2010), BMP-2 (armoured personnel carrier), 12.<footnote name="7">1. Many of the bodies seen by the Commission, directly or in photos, or as shown in 
the registers of the health-care units visited, had been wounded by firearms, including </footnote> machine-gun, 20 mm. cannon VLRA (light 
reconnaissance and support vehicle), ZSU-23-4 (anti-aircraft gun), ZSU 23-2, ERC-90 Sagaie (light 
armoured reconnaissance vehicle mounted with 90 mm. cannon), Mamba tank (vehicle with medium-
range ground-to-air missile defense system). </p>


<p>GE.11-14375 (EXT) <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>42. The third stage began with the FDS attack on the FAFN positions in Bounta 
(western region) and ended with the arrest of Mr. Gbagbo on 11 April 2011. FAFN, joined 
by FRCI from 17 March onwards, started to gain control of the towns and finally of 
Abidjan. The troops still loyal to Mr. Gbagbo sought the support of militias (FESCI and the 
Groupement des patriotes pour la paix (GPP) in Abidjan, AP-W&#234;, FLGO and UPRGO in 
the western part of the country) and mercenaries to make up for the defection of some 
elements of FDS, in order to hold out against the troops of the FAFN zone commanders 
with the added strength of their own militiamen (Invisible Commando in Abidjan, Dozo 
hunters in the western part of the country) along with FDS deserters. FDS that had 
remained loyal to Mr. Gbagbo seem, from that time, to have acted outside their usual, 
regular chain of command. In Abidjan, in the commune of Yopougan, forces favourable to 
either camp clashed in armed combat, while in the commune of Abobo and in the western 
part of the country, acts of violence were systematically committed by both camps against 
civilians targeted by reason of their supposed political affiliation. 
</p>
<p>43. The fourth stage, which extended from 11 April to 28 May 2011, was marked by the 
gradual establishment of calm and security in the capital and then in the rest of the country, 
except for some isolated fighting, when FRCI hunted down the last militiamen and 
mercenaries, thus committing in turn acts of violence in certain places against the civilian 
population (pillage, extortion, violence against persons, arbitrary arrests and detentions). 
On 27 April, Ibrahim Coulibaly, known as &#8220;IB&#8221;, leader of the Invisible Commando, was 
killed by FRCI in the northern part of Abidjan. 
</p>
<p><i>  Key events in Abidjan 
</i></p>
<p>44. During the pre-electoral period, acts of intimidation and violence were committed 
against certain campaign officials and against communities considered favourable to the 
candidate Ouattara. Several victims and witnesses stated that houses belonging to 
northerners and members of the Baoul&#233; ethnic group were marked with the letters &#8220;X&#8221; or 
&#8220;B&#8221; in several districts of Abidjan to make it easier to identify the occupants. 
</p>
<p>45. Between 27 and 29 November, RHDP youth demonstrations in Akobo, protesting 
against the curfew announced by former President Gbagbo, were severely crushed by FDS, 
leaving 12 persons dead. At the end of the second ballot, witnesses also reported the 
existence of blacklists of people to be eliminated, including RHDP representatives at 
polling stations. 
</p>
<p>46. On 16 December, during the RHDP march, at least 18 people were killed in the 
PK-18 district of Abobo and 14 FDS members were also reported to have died. 
</p>
<p>47. On 4 January, elements of FDS attacked the headquarters of the Parti D&#233;mocratique 
de la C&#244;te d'Ivoire (PDCI) in Cocody. One hundred and thirty-six RHDP supporters were 
arrested, including 19 women and a number of children. One person was killed and four 
were seriously wounded during the incident. 
</p>
<p>48. Between 11 and 12 January, FDS using vehicles of the anti-riot brigade (BAE) and 
the Security Operations Command Centre (CECOS) attacked the PK-18 district of Abobo 
killing at least nine people. 
</p>

<p><b>14</b> GE.11-14375 (EXT) 
</p>
<p>first time since the elections an armed group engaged in military action against FDS in the 
capital. On 22 February, there was a violent fighting between elements of FDS, including 
CECOS, and members of the Invisible Commando, in which several people were killed. 
</p>
<p>51. On 3 March, seven women and one young man were shot dead by FDS in the 
crackdown on the &#8220;March of women&#8221;, in which nearly 3000 women had gathered at 
Carrefour Anador (Abobo) to call for the departure of Mr. Gbagbo and protest against 
human rights violations perpetrated in their area. 
</p>
<p>52. Between 6 and 7 March, retaliatory action by the Invisible Commando against 
members of the Ebri&#233; group considered to be supporting Mr. Gbagbo in the village of 
Anonkoua-Kout&#233; in Abobo left 15 dead and forcibly displaced the entire Ebri&#233; population 
from the village. 
</p>
<p>53. Between 13 and 22 March, the use of heavy weapons by elements of FDS, including 
BAE, CECOS, the gendarmerie and the Republican Guard, against districts and populations 
accused of being favourable to the candidate Ouattara, particularly in Yopougon, 
Williamsville, Att&#233;coub&#233;, Adjam&#233; and Abobo, resulted in the deaths of at least 40 people, 
including women, children and older persons. Several hundred people were injured and the 
inhabitants of entire neighbourhoods fled the ensuing violence. 
</p>
<p>54. From April onwards, and particularly after the arrest of Mr.Gbagbo, the Yopougon 
district became a symbol of fighting between the two camps. On 11 April, the great 
majority of the militias and mercenaries retreated to this last pro-Gbagbo bastion. It was 
also during that time that a large number of mercenaries were involved in attacks against 
communities. For example, on 8 April 2011, the Dioula majority village of Locodjro 
sustained an attack by several small joint groups of militiamen and mercenaries in which 
seven people were killed by shooting or by fire. Between 11 and 22 April, at least 24 were 
killed in the district of Yopougon. 
</p>
<p>55. On 26 April, FRCI made a violent incursion into the villages of Abobo, PK-18 and 
Anyama to crush the rebellion led by Ibrahim Coulibaly, who had appointed himself leader 
of the Invisible Commando and who was seen as a threat to the new people in power. This 
attack by heavy weapons left several dead and many wounded, including children and older 
persons. 
</p>
<p>56. On 6 May, Commander Cherif Ousmane declared the city liberated and the fighting 
over. 
</p>
<p>57. Since 11 April, and more particularly since early May, the city of Abidjan has seen a 
violent crackdown by elements of FRCI in search of members of militias. This search has 
resulted in abuses being committed against the Ebri&#233; and Gu&#233;r&#233; populations. The 
Commission questioned witnesses and itself noted almost daily cases of arbitrary detention, 
torture and inhuman and degrading treatment suffered by individuals suspected of having 
been members of militias or informers.

<p>58. According to information obtained from a variety of concordant sources,8 the 
fighting began in that region with an FDS attack, on 23 February, of an FAFN position in 
Bounta, in breach of the curfew. FAFN then launched a counteroffensive, attacking and 
taking the western towns one after the other. 
</p>
<p>  
 8  The Commission took cognizance, in particular, of the UNOCI report on violations of human rights 
</p>
<p>and international law in the western part of C&#244;te d'Ivoire which, corroborating various information 
obtained on the ground, offers a detailed analysis of the events in that region. </p>


<p>GE.11-14375 (EXT) <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>59. Before the fighting, the human rights situation in that region was characterized by 
recurrent intercommunity violence connected with land disputes. Regular attacks against 
the non-native population were reported, particularly during roadblocks set up by young 
militiamen, often supported by FDS. Abuses committed included violations of the right to 
life and security of person and to freedom of movement. In San Pedro, for example, 
members of the United Nations peacekeeping force explained to the Commission that for 
several weeks the town had been under the control of the Jeunes patriotes and that they had 
been forced to negotiate with them whenever they wished to move from one place to 
another, even just to obtain fresh supplies. 
</p>
<p>60. After 28 November, the situation throughout the region grew considerably worse 
with a marked increase in violence against individuals seen as supporters of RHDP and 
originating from the north. In addition, inter-community tension was on the rise. Thus, in 
Du&#233;kou&#233;, on 28 November, the representative of RHDP who had supervised the conduct of 
the elections in the Carrefour district was kidnapped and physically abused by UPRGO and 
AP-W&#234; militiamen in that district. During the same period, the death of three persons at a 
roadblock led to outbreaks of fighting between the Gu&#233;r&#233; and Malinke communities. The 
Gu&#233;r&#233; were accused of looting and killing. Members of the Malinke community attacked 
the Gu&#233;r&#233; neighbourhoods and, in the Malinke neighbourhoods, Gu&#233;r&#233; were ill treated and 
driven from their homes. In retaliation, the Gu&#233;r&#233; then drove out Malinke living in what 
were traditionally Gu&#233;r&#233; neighbourhoods, setting fire to houses inhabited by or belonging to 
Malinke and other northern ethnic groups. These clashes were reported to have left in their 
wake dozens of dead people, over 100 wounded and at least 450 houses destroyed. 
</p>
<p>61. In Divo, a Divo RHDP demonstration held on 16 December 2010 was crushed by 
the CRS, established in the city some months before, under the command of Mr. Seka 
Yapo, who hurled tear gas grenades and fired weapons of war at the demonstrators. At least 
four people were said to have been killed and 27 wounded, including an eight-year-old girl. 
</p>
<p>62. In San Pedro, in the weeks following the second round of the elections, les Jeunes 
patriotes and other organizations of the &#8220;galaxie patriotique&#8221;, under the sometimes disputed 
leadership of Mr. Bl&#233; S&#233;p&#233; and Mr. Sylla Youssouf, such as the &#8220;Bl&#233; Goud&#233; generation&#8221; 
and the debating society &#8220;La Sorbonne&#8221; were active in the city with the full knowledge of 
the law enforcement services, publicly inciting violence against RHDP supporters and 
organizing unauthorized public demonstrations, as well as roadblocks and searches of 
vehicles and civilians. 
</p>

<p><b>16</b> GE.11-14375 (EXT) 
</p>
<p>group, and militiamen. According to concordant testimony from relatives of the victims, 
once FRCI had gained control of the neighbourhood, they ordered women and small 
children to go off to the Catholic mission chanting the word &#8220;guerrier&#8221; (warrior). After the 
fighting, elements of FRCI, accompanied by Dozo men and armed members of Malinke 
militias, carried out searches, arresting individuals believed to belong to FDS. Some were 
executed on the spot. 
</p>
<p>65. The Commission was informed that, on arriving in the towns, FRCI and their allies 
also committed numerous acts of violence against populations considered to be favourable 
to former President Gbagbo and that such acts continue even today. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Characterization of the facts 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>66. The events described above constitute serious violations of human rights under 
Ivorian positive law as well as under the international and regional human rights 
instruments to which C&#244;te d'Ivoire is a party. The Commission noted that, right up to the 
end of its mission in C&#244;te d'Ivoire, serious violations continued to be perpetrated every day. 
</p>
<p>67. According to information gathered by the Commission, the most serious incidents 
took place in Abidjan and in the west, particularly along the Du&#233;kou&#233;-Toulepleu road, in 
San Pedro, and in the Divo-Lakota-Gagnoa triangle. The violations were committed by 
members of all the different groups involved. The Commission also noted that, within the 
same regions, the identities of the victims and perpetrators of violations changed as the 
conflict unfolded. 
</p>
<p>68. Thus, in Abidjan, it can be broadly said that, just after the presidential elections, 
those groups considered to be pro-Ouattara, by virtue in particular of their ethnic 
background, their political allegiances or their religion, suffered at the hands of FDS or 
militiamen or did not feel sufficiently safe to remain in their homes. Subsequently, from 
March onwards, those groups traditionally considered to be Gbagbo supporters were the 
targets of reprisals, particularly from the Invisible Commando in Abidjan and FRCI, as and 
when the various towns were taken. 
</p>
<p><i>  Right to life 
</i></p>
<p>69. The Commission considers that every person killed is one victim too many and has 
chosen not to join the debate about numbers. The Commission does not have the time or the 
resources to do any more than give an estimate of the losses in human lives. It did not have 
the means to disinter bodies from mass graves, reconstitute skeletons or analyse ashes 
recovered from burned-down houses. Nevertheless, on the basis of information obtained 
during its field visits and by crosschecking, it can be reasonably estimated that at least 
some 3,000 people were killed. Many people were killed by barbaric methods, particularly 
the torture commonly known as &#8220;Article 125&#8221;, which denotes the price of the petrol (100 
CFAF) and matches (25 CFAF) needed to burn a person alive. In other cases, they were put 
into a container and died of suffocation. 
</p>
<p>70. In Du&#233;kou&#233;, for example, the Commission had access to five mass graves where 197 
bodies had been buried. At the IVOSEP morgue in Abidjan, 1300 bodies had been placed. 
Many graves and bones were found in the area, some burned and with large quantities of 
ashes nearby. 
</p>

<p>GE.11-14375 (EXT) <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>weapons of war such as heavy weapons and grenades. Marks of shooting, the shattering of 
projectiles and burns were visible on the bodies. 
</p>
<p>72. For instance, in P&#233;h&#233;, the presence was noted of a blue cord around what remained 
of the bones of the upper limbs of a body. Pieces of cord of the same kind were found in the 
Carrefour district in Du&#233;kou&#233;. In Abidjan, witnesses spoke again of people being burned 
alive, using petrol and tires. In the west there are reports of many people having had their 
throats slit. 
</p>
<p><i>  Right to physical integrity 
</i></p>
<p>73. The fact that there were many people injured demonstrates that the right to physical 
integrity was violated. Such was the case, for example, during the violent repression of non-
violent civil demonstrations, particularly in Abidjan and Divo on 16 December 2010 and in 
Du&#233;kou&#233; on 3 January 2011, when weapons of war, including heavy weapons, were used 
indiscriminately. Such was also the case in Blol&#233;quin, Dok&#233;, Guiglo, P&#233;h&#233;, San Pedro and 
Toulepleu. 
</p>
<p>74. Other cases of violations of this right were noted by the Commission in the towns 
and villages where it conducted investigations, including the beating of arrested or detained 
persons. The Commission learned from the information provided by health-care 
professionals that at least 1,740 persons who had been injured, most of them by firearms or 
knives, had received care. 
</p>
<p><i>  Violation of the right to freedom and security of person 
</i></p>
<p>75. Arbitrary arrests and detentions by FDS and FRCI, together with the absence of the 
effective possibility of taking proceedings before a court or any other competent judicial 
authority, constitute a violation of article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. In Dok&#233;, for example, Mr. X. and Mr. Z. were arrested by FDS. They were 
tied up and taken away on the pretext that they were RHDP activists. When the village 
chief explained that Mr. Z. belonged in fact to LMP, he was released. Mr. X. is still 
missing. The Commission also saw for itself, in Abidjan, a number of cases of detention 
exceeding the legal time limits in many police stations under the command of elements of 
FRCI. It is clear that, during the period under consideration and in the places visited by the 
Commission, due process was not ensured. 
</p>
<p><i>  Freedom of movement 
</i></p>
<p>76. The various roadblocks set up by organizations of the &#8220;galaxie patriotique&#8221; well 
before 28 of November and tolerated by law enforcement services, as well as those set up 
later by the FRCI, constitute violations of the right to freedom of movement. At these 
roadblocks, other violations were committed, in particular rape and racketeering. The 
roadblocks erected by the Jeunes patriotes and militia groups served as checkpoints for 
identifying persons considered to be pro-Ouattara and restricted the movement of such 
persons, confining them to particular areas for no reason. They also restricted the 
movement of United Nations civilian personnel and foreigners living in C&#244;te d'Ivoire. 
</p>
<p><i>  Freedom of expression and information and incitement of hate 
</i></p>

<p><b>18</b> GE.11-14375 (EXT) 
</p>
<p>played a particularly noteworthy role in this regard and to have been transformed into 
&#8220;nothing less than a machine of warfare and propaganda for LMP&#8221;, monopolizing the 
media and putting out provocative messages. For example, on 25 February 2011, it 
rebroadcast a call from Charles Bl&#233; Goud&#233; to the Jeunes patriotes: &#8220;You must contact 
neighbourhood leaders, you must (...) check people coming into and out of your 
neighbourhoods. And you must report any foreign person who comes into your 
neighbourhood&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>78. The Commission noted that during the crisis there had been considerably less 
respect for the rights to freedom of expression, opinion and information. Some opposition 
political parties and independent media outlets met with systematic difficulties in exercising 
those freedoms. 
</p>
<p>79. The Commission notes that newspapers and the media were divided into green 
newspapers supporting the Ouattara camp and blue newspapers supporting the Gbagbo 
camp, and that the former were treated harshly under Mr. Gbagbo's administration. When 
the city of Abidjan was taken, the premises of the blue newspapers were ransacked. Some 
of those newspapers were just beginning to reappear at the end of the Commission's visit to 
C&#244;te d'Ivoire. 
</p>
<p><i>  Right of demonstration and peaceful public assembly 
</i></p>
<p>80. The blanket prohibition of demonstrations that accompanied the curfew and the 
breaking up of demonstrations in Abidjan and Divo on 16 December 2010 and in Du&#233;kou&#233; 
on 3 January 2011 are a violation of article 21 of the Covenant. The Commission notes that, 
in this framework, all attempts by members of the opposition to organize demonstrations 
were severely crushed by the FDS, sometimes with heavy weapons and weapons of war 
</p>
<p><i>  Freedom of religion and desecration of places of worship 
</i></p>
<p>81. During its investigations and interviews, the Commission noted that churches and 
mosques had been attacked and illegally searched. For example, a Catholic church was 
destroyed in the Carrefour district of Du&#233;kou&#233; by pro-Gbagbo Gu&#233;r&#233; militias and the 
cathedral was desecrated by FRCI. 
</p>
<p>82. In Blol&#233;quin, the mosque was desecrated by Gu&#233;r&#233; militias and Liberian 
mercenaries. In Abidjan, a Pentecostalist church was attacked by members of FRCI looking 
for weapons. 
</p>
<p><i>  Economic, social and cultural rights 
</i></p>
<p>83. The State of C&#244;te d'Ivoire did not take the necessary measures to preserve and 
ensure the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. These violations were notably 
worse during the post-electoral crisis from 28 November 2010 until the taking of Abidjan, 
particularly in respect of education, health care and access to drinking water, sufficient food 
and proper housing. 
</p>
<p><i>  Right to education 
</i></p>
<p>84. The Commission noted that the post-electoral crisis nearly paralyzed the country's 
education system, consequently preventing hundreds and thousands of children for several 
months from enjoying the right to education. 
</p>
<p><i>Right to health</i> 
</p>

<p>GE.11-14375 (EXT) <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>difficulties in obtaining supplies, with grave consequences for the life and health of the 
people in those regions as well as for those in the west, where the situation was the same if 
not worse. 
</p>
<p><i>  Right to food, water and housing 
</i></p>
<p>86. The human rights crisis went hand in hand with a humanitarian crisis in which 
hundreds of thousands of displaced persons were living in extreme conditions. An 
indeterminate number sought refuge in the bush and are still living there. The malnutrition 
rate worsened during the crisis, particularly in the west, above all in centres for displaced 
persons. The fact that many farmers' seeds were burned together with their houses, 
especially in the west, is a great concern for coming months because of the risk of famine. 
Moreover, as fighters threw some bodies into wells, especially in the west, the water used 
by the local people has become polluted. There are also serious consequences arising from 
the fact that mass graves are located near rivers, creating a potential risk of ground 
pollution. With regard to the right to housing, the Commission visited the ruins of hundreds 
of burned down houses, which had led to the forced displacement of entire communities. 
</p>
<p><i>  Right of children not to be recruited by armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>87. On the basis of reports gathered and observations on the ground, the Commission 
noted that children were associated with armed groups throughout the conflict. The appeal 
made by the former Minister of Youth, Mr. Bl&#233; Goud&#233;, on 19 March 2011, led to thousands 
of young people, including schoolchildren and students, sometimes still minors, to enroll in 
militias. The presence of children was also noted at FRCI roadblocks, in particular in 
Guiglo, Toulepleu and Blol&#233;quin. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Violations of international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>88. The FDS attack on FAFN positions in Bounta on 23 February marked the beginning 
of the armed conflict not of an international character in C&#244;te d'Ivoire. The conflict which 
thus pitted FAFN against FDS, along with the various armed groups supporting them, 
meets the conditions of applicability of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and of 
the second Additional Protocol, to both of which C&#244;te d'Ivoire is a party. 
</p>
<p>89. The conflict which then set FRCI against FDS loyal to former President Gbagbo 
does not, in the Commission's view, constitute a separate conflict but should, rather, be seen 
as the continuation of an already ongoing conflict. It is to be noted that the conflict was not 
waged throughout the full expanse of the country, so that international humanitarian law 
applies solely to the area where an armed conflict not of an international character actually 
took place. 
</p>
<p>90. The parties to the conflict together with their auxiliary armed forces violated the 
provisions of statutory and customary international humanitarian law, in particular the right 
to life and to the physical integrity of protected persons; in some cases, the protected 
persons were raped and their property plundered. The Commission also noted, in Abidjan 
and in other towns in the western and south-western regions, cases of summary executions 
of civilians or non-combatants. In other cases, as in the Carrefour district of Du&#233;kou&#233;, or in 
heavy-weapon attacks against areas of Yopougon or Abobo, armed groups used blind force. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Violations of international criminal law 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Crimes against humanity 
</i></p>

<p><b>20</b> GE.11-14375 (EXT) 
</p>
<p>the period under consideration. Serious crimes such as murder or rape perpetrated during 
widespread and systematic attacks against populations targeted on the basis of their 
supposed political sympathies or their ethnicity might constitute crimes against humanity. 
In that connection, the Commission noted in particular attacks by FDS elements with 
militiamen and allied mercenaries against the inhabitants of the Abobo and Yopougon 
districts of Abidjan, in particular the PK-18 district and the Sikasso village in Abidjan; 
looting and killing by elements of the Invisible Commando in the Ebri&#233; village of 
Anonkoua-Kout&#233;; along the Du&#233;kou&#233;-Toulepleu axis, attacks and brutalities by FRCI and 
their allies against people of Gu&#233;r&#233; origin and the destruction of their property. Some of 
these events might constitute crimes against humanity. However, owing to lack of time, the 
Commission was not able to study the matter in sufficient depth for it to propose a 
definitive characterization of specific events. 
</p>
<p><i>  War crimes 
</i></p>
<p>92. Some of the acts described above are serious violations of common article 3 of the 
four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 within the meaning of article 8 of the Rome 
Statute. Those acts committed during the fighting in Abidjan and other towns since late 
March 2011 are attacks on life and corporal integrity, cruel treatment and torture, and 
humiliating and degrading treatment violating the dignity of persons who took no direct 
part in the hostilities. 
</p>
<p>93. Those acts may also be described as serious violations of laws and customs 
applicable to armed conflict not of an international character. These include attacks directed 
intentionally against the civilian population as such or against civilians not taking direct 
part in the hostilities, attacks directed intentionally against buildings, material, medical 
units and transport, attacks directed intentionally against personnel, installations, material, 
units or vehicles involved in a UNOCI peacekeeping mission, attacks directed intentionally 
against buildings dedicated to religion, education and hospitals, pillaging towns and 
villages, as well as rape and other forms of sexual violence. The Commission was unable to 
confirm that children under the age of 15 years had been conscripted or enlisted by parties 
to the conflict, but expresses serious concerns about the presence of juveniles in FDS and 
FRCI units. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Responses of the Government to the situation 
</b></p>
<p>94. The Commission notes that, on the ground, the legitimate Government has 
recognized the seriousness of the facts and has taken certain measures. The Government 
has initiated judicial and military procedures at national level against certain suspects. It has 
set up a Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission and has decided to refer to the 
International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Military procedures 
</b></p>
<p>95. On 12 May 2011, the Military Prosecutor submitted an application for the 
investigation of 52 military personnel belonging to FDS, essentially joint task forces, such 
as the Garde r&#233;publicaine, CECOS, BAE and special gendarmerie units which, according to 
the Military Prosecutor, were under the dual command of the chief of GR and the chief of 
CECOS. The investigation will be extended, according to the findings, to any person 
suspected of a crime, including FRCI. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Judicial procedures 
</b></p>

<p>GE.11-14375 (EXT) <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. An investigation was initiated 
on 13 May 2011 against Mr. Gbagbo and his entourage for corruption, destabilization, 
confiscation of power after the results of the elections and criminal abuse of office. The 
Government Prosecutor heard Mr. Gbagbo on 6 May and his wife, Simone Gbagbo, on 8 
May. In the west, the Commission met with the Daloa Prosecutor who informed it that 
preliminary investigations had begun into the events that had occurred in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission in C&#244;te d'Ivoire 
</b></p>
<p>97. At the beginning of May, President Ouattara appointed Mr. Charles Konan Banny, 
former Prime Minister, to chair a Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission tasked 
with restoring social peace and achieving reconciliation among Ivorians following the 
serious erosion of social cohesion in the country after a decade of political and armed 
crises. Mr. Banny explained to the independent, International Commission of Inquiry on 
C&#244;te d'Ivoire that he had already begun consultations with social and political groups in 
order to have their views on the mandate and composition of the Dialogue, Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission. He also said that the basic texts of the Commission were 
currently being drafted. According to him, the Commission would not have a &#8220;judicial&#8221; 
dimension; judicial matters would be settled through Ivorian judicial process. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Referral to the International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>98. President Outtara informed the Commission that he had referred the situation in 
C&#244;te d'Ivoire to the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The victims 
</b></p>
<p>99. Although violence is a recurrent phenomenon in the recent political history of C&#244;te 
d'Ivoire, most of the persons met by the Commission noted the unprecedented character of 
the violations committed on the occasion of the electoral crisis. 
</p>
<p>100. The Commission noted the varying degrees of importance attached by those 
responsible for violations to the ethnic, political or religious characteristics of the victims, 
according to the area where the violations had occurred and their perpetrators. The 
Commission noted, however, that it was generally felt that there was a close link between 
ethnic group and political allegiance. Accordingly, it was felt that persons from 
neighbouring countries and Ivorians belonging to the Malinke, Dioula and Senoufo ethnic 
groups supported Alassabe Ouattara&#180;s RDR and that those belonging to the Gu&#233;r&#233; and B&#233;t&#233; 
ethnic groups supported former President Gbagbo's LMP. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Children 
</b></p>

<p><b>22</b> GE.11-14375 (EXT) 
</p>
<p>Tape. They had the support of Liberians. Upon his refusal to take up arms, they had forced 
him to prepare their food. They had explained to him that they would not let him leave as 
they feared that he would give FDS information about their positions. He had finally been 
able to escape and had fled to Guiglo. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Older persons and persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>103. The Commission collected a great deal of testimony about older or disabled persons 
who had been killed or injured during the clashes. Because of their reduced mobility, such 
persons were often not able to flee and were hit by stray bullets, but sometimes they were 
victims of summary executions or violence. In a number of cases, older persons volunteered 
to attempt mediation with armed elements, in particular in P&#233;h&#233;. Lastly, older and/or sick 
persons also died through lack of care or food when their families were forced to flee. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Rape and sexual violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>104. The Commission heard several women and girls who testified to having been 
victims of sexual violence perpetrated by armed militiamen, uniformed men and men in 
traditional Dozo dress in the western region and by armed men accompanied by militiamen 
in Abidjan. Although many of them were held back by tradition and shame from recounting 
the suffering inflicted on them through sexual violence, the Commission was able to speak 
with a few courageous victims who described the brutal manner in which they had been 
raped. In Du&#233;kou&#233;, San Pedro and Abidjan, as well as in refugee camps, the Commission 
thus met with girls and women who had been victims of rape. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Displaced persons and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>105. Enforced population displacements were one of the major characteristics of the 
conflict. Although it is extremely difficult to evaluate their number, humanitarian 
organizations estimate that more than 700,000 persons fled their homes because of the 
fighting, the general climate of violence or the persecution that they had suffered. The 
Commission met with a large number of displaced persons, in particular in Abidjan and 
Du&#233;kou&#233;, but was also informed that an indeterminate number are still living in the bush in 
conditions of extreme hardship. At the time when the Commission was leaving C&#244;te 
d'Ivoire, population displacements were still continuing, particularly in the direction of 
Liberia. In all the places visited, the Commission saw the state of destitution in which many 
displaced persons were living. Many of them had been taken in by foster families, thus 
putting a further strain on already limited resources. 
</p>
<p>106. In displaced persons sites as in refugee camps in Liberia, the Commission noted the 
presence of former combatants, in particular militiamen, associated with the &#8220;galaxie 
patriotique&#8221;, giving concern for the security of refugees and internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>

<p>GE.11-14375 (EXT) <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Responsibilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Responsibility of the Ivorian State 
</b></p>
<p>108. The aforementioned serious human rights violations committed by military and 
security forces, alone or in association with the non-State actors identified above, create 
responsibilities and obligations for the Ivorian State with regard to the victims of those 
violations. These obligations derive from the conventions already referred to above and 
from international customary law. 
</p>
<p>109. The prime responsibility of the State is to protect the population against serious 
violations of human rights. The Ivorian forces, alone or with the added strength of non-
State combatants, showed not only that they had been incapable of protecting the 
population but also, in some cases, that they were directly responsible for certain violations. 
According to numerous reports, the following FDS units were concerned: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Garde r&#233;publicaine; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; CECOS; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; CRS; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; BAE; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; BASA; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; BCP; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; FUMACO. 
</p>
<p>110. Later, as they gradually gained control of the various towns, elements of the FRCI 
committed human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>111. Subsequently, the State has the responsibility to undertake prompt and effective 
investigations and to bring to justice those who committed the serious human rights 
violations identified. The Commission notes that steps have already been taken by the 
Ivorian Government. It nevertheless stresses that it has not as yet been informed of effective 
procedures against elements of FRCI accused of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>112. Although there is still some dispute about the content of the right to truth, it is 
nevertheless generally agreed that families have the right to know what happened to those 
of their members who have disappeared. The process set in motion to set up a Dialogue, 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission is a first step in this direction. 
</p>
<p>113. The State also has the obligation to guarantee that the violations committed will not 
recur. To that end, C&#244;te d'Ivoire should in particular, and as a matter of urgency, unify the 
chain of command of FRCI and reform the security services. 
</p>
<p>114. A further obligation that falls to the Ivorian Government following the post-electoral 
events concerns &#8220;adequate, effective and prompt reparation&#8221; for the harm suffered by the 
victims. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Responsibility of non-State actors and individual responsibilities 
</b></p>

<p>116. The Commission is well aware that the final determination of individual criminal 
responsibility must be made by a court in order to ensure the human rights of the persons 
concerned; nevertheless, the Human Rights Council is required by its mandate to identify 
those responsible. 
</p>
<p>117. Indeed, either through their actions or their positions, certain political figures can be 
held responsible. Thus, some political leaders, by refusing to recognize the results of the 
elections, calling for violence against particular individuals or groups and failing to 
condemn certain abuses committed by persons who claimed to be working for them, 
incurred responsibility. Of all the persons met, the Commission notes that former President 
Gbagbo and Chief of army staff Philippe Mangou are the only ones to have admitted to 
some form of responsibility in the events that occurred. The former stated that, as Head of 
State, he was also commander in chief of armies and, accordingly, was responsible for any 
acts that might have been committed by the Defence and Security Forces, while noting that, 
if there had been war crimes during a conflict, those who had committed such crimes 
should be questioned. The latter stated that, if incidents had occurred between the post-
electoral period and his departure for the South African Embassy, he would not shirk his 
responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>118. In the light of the information that it has gathered, the Commission concludes that 
there are reasonable grounds for presuming, in relation to the post-electoral events, the 
individual criminal responsibility of certain persons whose names appear on the 
confidential list annexed to this report, which may be transmitted to the competent 
authorities for the purposes of a judicial investigation. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The Commission concluded that during the period under consideration 
numerous violations of human rights and international humanitarian law were 
committed by different parties in C&#244;te d'Ivoire. The many victims, mainly in the 
western, south-western and Abidjan regions, are continuing to pay a heavy price. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>The political crisis and the armed conflict in C&#244;te d'Ivoire stemmed from 
former President Gbagbo's refusal to recognize the results of the elections. The 
Commission considers that the impunity prevailing in C&#244;te d'Ivoire is due notably to a 
failure to comply with the various recommendations made through the years within 
the framework of national and international initiatives to combat that scourge. In 
particular, the recommendations of the many international commissions of inquiry on 
C&#244;te d'Ivoire have not been implemented. C&#244;te d'Ivoire will know neither lasting 
peace nor stability unless it effectively brings to justice those who committed the 
crimes listed in this report. 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>The exploitation of ethnic identity, the manipulation of young Ivorians by 
political figures, turning them into instruments of violence, and unresolved rural land 
issues are among the underlying causes of the massive, serious violations of human 
rights in C&#244;te d'Ivoire. The elections served as a catalyst for the unleashing of 
violence. 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The Commission notes that, notwithstanding a normalization of the security 
situation in Abidjan and in several western towns, many violations continue to be 
committed. At the time of its visit to Liberia, Ivorian refugees continued to arrive, 
fleeing acts of violence by members of FRCI. The Commission is concerned about the 
presence in the streets of Abidjan and other towns or large number of young people 
carrying weapons, adding to the general sense of insecurity. The Commission is also </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>concerned about the impacts at the subregional level of cross-border movements of 
militiamen and mercenaries and the circulation of weapons. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>The Commission is concerned about the humanitarian crisis affecting the 
country, particularly the situation of thousands of displaced persons and refugees. A 
comprehensive response should consequently be developed as a matter of urgency that 
takes into account all aspects of the situation and is guided by the principles of non-
discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>The Commission takes note of the domestic initiatives taken by the new 
Government, in particular the reform of the Defence and Security Forces. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>The Commission noted that most of the persons it met expressed a wish to live 
together on good terms. It also notes that the Government has indicated at the highest 
level that the question of reconciliation is a priority. The Commission wishes 
nevertheless to point out that there can be no lasting reconciliation without justice. 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>The Commission noted that the United Nations played an important role 
during the crisis. Nevertheless, many of the persons met, including victims, consider 
that it did not make full use of the means available to it under its mandate to ensure 
the best possible protection for the population. 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>In this context, the Commission recommends: 
</b></p>
<p><b>That the Ivorian Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that those responsible for violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law are brought to justice; in this context, the 
investigations initiated must be conducted in an exhaustive, impartial and transparent 
fashion; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that the underlying causes of the crisis, in particular those 
relating to discrimination, are addressed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure the security of persons and property, in particular through the 
rapid disarmament of persons not belonging to the Defence and Security Forces; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) As part of the reform of its security institutions, ensure that the persons 
responsible for violations are not integrated into the national army or into any other 
security force and that a professional army that respects human rights is swiftly 
established; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure that the initiatives taken towards reconciliation, in particular the 
establishment and operation of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 
comply with established international principles and good practices, notably with 
regard to fair and equitable reparation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Provide appropriate assistance to victims, in particular women, children, 
older persons and persons with disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Take steps to develop lasting solutions for displaced persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Take as a matter of urgency all appropriate steps to ratify without delay 
the Rome Statute, the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, the 
Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of 
Women in Africa, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the 
African conventions on refugees, displaced persons and asylum-seekers and the 
Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa; </b></p>


<p><b>26</b> GE.11-14375 (EXT) 
</p>
<p><b>That the Human Rights Council: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Establish, with a view to effective follow-up on the Commission's 
recommendations and support for the Ivorian authorities in combating impunity, an 
independent mechanism to monitor the human rights situation in C&#244;te d'Ivoire, which 
will be required to report regularly to the Council; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Publish the report of the International Commission of Inquiry 
established by the Commission on Human Rights in 2004 in order to have a more 
comprehensive understanding of the human rights situation in C&#244;te d'Ivoire and help 
combat impunity in that country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>That the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: 
</b></p>
<p><b> Give technical assistance to the Ivorian authorities in all human rights 
initiatives, in particular for the establishment and operation of the Dialogue, Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission; 
</b></p>
<p><b>That the United Nations, humanitarian organizations and the international 
community in general: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Support the governmental authorities, particularly at the financial level, 
in their efforts to combat impunity and promote the rule of law in C&#244;te d'Ivoire; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that the United Nations makes, as early as possible, an evaluation 
of the work carried out during the crisis, including by UNOCI and the humanitarian 
agencies, in order to improve its ability to prevent conflict and protect the civilian 
population; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Strengthen coordination between the various parties involved so as to 
ensure an appropriate response to the humanitarian crisis.
