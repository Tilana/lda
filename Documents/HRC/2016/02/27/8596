</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, 
undertook an official visit to Kazakhstan from 6 to 13 September 2010. The purpose of the 
mission was to gather first-hand information on the status of the realization of the right to 
adequate housing and other related human rights in Kazakhstan. In particular, the Special 
Rapporteur focused on the adverse impact of the global economic and financial crises on 
the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing and on the large-scale evictions or 
displacement of individuals and communities living in or around the cities of Astana and 
Almaty. During her visit to Astana and Almaty, the Special Rapporteur met with a wide 
range of Government representatives and non-State actors, and received testimonies from 
several people alleging violations of their right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the significant progress that the State has made in 
the implementation of the right to adequate housing at the national level. Such measures 
include the inclusion of specific provisions on adequate housing in the Constitution, the 
adoption of a number of legislative and policy measures, such as the Housing Relations Act

<p>of 1997 and the State housing construction programme for the period 2008-2010, and the 
elaboration of a number of incentives, such as a system of housing loans, rental subsidies 
and land allotments for the construction of residential houses, to facilitate access to 
affordable housing for individuals and households belonging to low-income and 
disadvantaged groups. 
</p>
<p> Despite the progress made, a number of key concerns remain. The legal and policy 
framework in the field of housing, and in particular the national legislation on forced 
eviction, do not comply fully with existing international human rights standards, such as 
the general comments of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
basic principles on development-based evictions and displacement. National courts do not, 
in practice, apply norms of international treaties, nor do they refer to international human 
rights standards. There is a high rate of demolition of informal settlements and forced 
evictions without prior notification, any form of judicial control or review, or any provision 
of adequate compensation or alternative accommodation. Many individuals and households 
have been seriously affected by the financial and mortgage crisis. A large number of 
shareholders have been deceived by private construction companies who left the country 
with their savings without completing the construction of the buildings, while others have 
been evicted, or have been threatened with eviction, as a result of their inability to repay 
credits and mortgage loans. Despite the emergency measures taken by the Government to 
mitigate the negative repercussions of the financial crisis, 42,000 shareholders are still 
waiting to receive their apartments. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes with a series of recommendations aimed to assist 
the Government in its efforts to strengthen the effective enjoyment of the right to adequate 
housing.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, 
undertook an official visit to Kazakhstan from 6 to 13 September 2010.  
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to gather first-hand information on the status of the 
realization of the right to adequate housing and other related human rights in Kazakhstan. 
In particular, the Special Rapporteur decided to focus on:  
</p>
<p> (a) Large-scale evictions or displacement of individuals and communities living 
in or around the cities of Astana and Almaty without the provision of appropriate protection 
and compensation, and the measures taken by the Government to ensure the protection of 
affected individuals and communities against development-based evictions related to urban 
renewal programmes;  
</p>
<p> (b) The impact of the global economic and financial crises on the enjoyment of 
the right to adequate housing, and the measures taken by the Government to protect the 
most vulnerable individuals, households and communities within its jurisdiction from the 
adverse consequences of the crises. 
</p>
<p>3. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with several high-ranking officials of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the State Agency for Construction, Housing and Utilities; 
the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection; the local executive bodies (<i>akimat</i>) of Astana 
and Almaty; the Department of Interior Affairs of Astana and Almaty; the Supreme Court; 
the Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman); the Human Rights Commission under 
the President of Kazakhstan; and the National Commission for Family Affairs and Gender 
Policy under the President. She also received testimonies from people affected by alleged 
violations of their right to adequate housing and met with a large number of representatives 
of civil society, including social movements and non-governmental organizations, in and 
around Astana and Almaty.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to express her gratitude to the Government of 
Kazakhstan for its invitation and for the support provided to her throughout the visit. The 
standing invitation addressed to all special procedures mandate holders in July 2009 and the 
openness shown by the Government before and during the mission demonstrate its 
commitment to the promotion and protection of the right to adequate housing and its 
willingness to cooperate with the international community in the solution of the outstanding 
problems faced by the country in this field. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to thank the 
Regional Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 
Bishkek and the United Nations Development Programme in Kazakhstan for their valuable 
cooperation and assistance in arranging the agenda for the mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Housing situation 
</b></p>
<p>5. In recent years, Kazakhstan has become a major economic power in Central Asia, 
thanks to its significant reserves of oil and natural gas. Economic growth has also supported 
the development of other sectors, in particular construction and banking.  
</p>
<p>6. In 1995, the Government decided to shift the capital of the newly-independent State 
from Almaty to Astana. This decision was accompanied by the investment of a significant 
amount of the State budget for the creation of a modern, world-class capital city. In turn, 
the large-scale urban renewal and city beautification programmes attracted a large number 
of internal migrants, who moved to the new capital from other parts of the country in search </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>of employment opportunities in the construction sector and a higher standard of living. 
According to the census conducted in 2009, the population of Astana grew from 328,341 to 
613,006 in the period from 1999 to 2009. Almaty, with a population of 1,365,632, remains 
the largest city in Kazakhstan. Like Astana, Almaty has also attracted a significant number 
of migrant workers, who moved to the main economic hub of the country after the 
economic crisis that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to official 
estimates, the internal migration from rural to urban areas affects more than 300,000 people 
a year. 
</p>
<p>7. Owing to its economic performance, Kazakhstan has also become a major 
destination for migrant workers from other central Asian countries and from China. 
According to official estimates, Kazakhstan hosts between 500,000 and 1 million foreign 
workers, but other sources consider that the figure of two to three million migrants is more 
plausible. A considerable percentage of these migrant are employed in the construction 
sector. 
</p>
<p>8. This mass migration has put significant pressure on the availability of housing and 
urbanized land in the two main economic hubs in the country, leading to the construction of 
a number of informal settlements of dwellings on the outskirts of both cities. Owing to their 
informal nature, there are no reliable statistical data on the number of people living in these 
informal settlements. Such residential constructions are sometimes built in environmentally 
protected areas or in areas prone to floods or earthquakes.  
</p>
<p>9. Most of the above-mentioned informal dwellings lack basic amenities, such as 
kitchens, toilet facilities, electricity and running water, and occupants are constantly 
exposed to the threat of forced eviction by public authorities. The lack of a legal address de 
facto prevents informal settlers from obtaining registration at their place of residence, 
which is an essential legal requirement for access to a number of social services provided 
by the State, including social housing. 
</p>
<p>10. Since independence, the Government of Kazakhstan has dramatically changed its 
housing policies, moving from a State-driven housing policy to a new approach in which 
the State aims to facilitate access to home ownership by creating an enabling financial 
environment to attract foreign investments as well as banks and financial institutions. In 
order to stimulate housing construction, the State has made significant planning efforts to 
provide well-located urban land to private entrepreneurs and to promote access to 
mortgage-based credit, to allow citizens to build their own homes and apartments or 
purchase property in housing complexes built by private investors. 
</p>
<p>11. The total housing stock has increased from 252.7 million m2 in 2004 to 267.8 
million m2in 2008. In 2008, the urban housing stock amounted to 153.4 million m2 (57 per 
cent of the total). The bulk of new construction has been undertaken by private 
constructors. The State-owned housing stock decreased from 7.8 million m2 in 2004 to 6.4 
million m2 in 2008. In rural areas, only one per cent of rural housing stock (1.2 million m2 
</p>
<p>in 2008) belongs to the State.1 The available data on the composition of the country&#8217;s 
housing stock is not in itself sufficient to assess the housing deficit, i.e., the number of 
individuals and households who do not have a dwelling or live in a dwelling that does not 
meet minimum health and safety requirements.  
</p>
<p>12. The average total housing space available per capita has increased steadily over the 
past decade, passing from 16.6 m2 per person in 2002 to 18.1 m2 per person in 2008. 
However, the rate of growth in rural areas is 16 per cent lower than in urban areas (16.4 m2 
and 19.7 m2 per person, respectively).

</p>
<p>13. The percentage of households connected to water mains rose from 52.4 per cent in 
2002 to 58.9 per cent in 2008. Over the same period, the percentage of households with 
access to centralized sewage and treatment facilities rose from 43.1 to 47.4 per cent. 
However, disaggregated statistical data show significant inequalities between urban and 
rural areas, where standards of living are much lower than those of the urban population. 
</p>
<p>14. As at October 2010, 10,958 persons belonging to low-income and socially protected 
groups had access to social housing units constructed by the local administration or 
purchased from private developers pursuant to the State housing construction programme 
for the period 2005-2007. During the same period, 36,656 households belonging to the 
category of priority citizens have received housing units built with the support of the State 
housing credit system.  
</p>
<p>15. The State allocated 49.7 billion tenge (approximately 331.3 million United States 
dollars) in the period between 2005 and 2010 for the construction of social housing units. 
During the same period, 150.1 billion tenge (approximately $ 1 billion) have been allocated 
from the State budget to the construction of mortgage-based housing for priority target 
groups.  
</p>
<p>16. Like many other countries, Kazakhstan was seriously affected by the international 
financial crisis. Owing to the radical deregulation undertaken by the State, which allowed 
access to mortgage-based credits for high-risk households, the financial crisis led to a 
collapse of the entire banking system. According to the World Bank, the annual growth rate 
of almost 10 per cent that Kazakhstan enjoyed between 2000 and 2007 was reduced to 3.3 
per cent in 2008 and 1.2 per cent in 2009.  
</p>
<p>17. The construction sector was one of the first to experience the adverse effects of the 
global economic downturn. Many construction firms were forced to close, leaving 450 
construction projects unfinished. According to the Government, more than 62,000 
shareholders have been adversely affected by the financial crisis. Some 16,000 shareholders 
have been deceived by private construction companies that left the country with their 
savings without completing construction, while others have been evicted, or threatened with 
eviction, because of their inability to repay credits and mortgage loans. As a result of the 
large number of businesses that went bankrupt, the real estate crisis turned into a crisis 
affecting the whole economy. 
</p>
<p>18. The Government invested a total of 433,441 billion tenge (approximately $2.8 
billion) to help the victims of the financial crisis and facilitate the finalization of housing 
projects. In particular, it created a real estate fund, SamrukKazyna, to provide money to 
construction companies in order to terminate projects that had been slowed down or halted 
as a result of the financial crisis. Overall, $1.1 billion were allocated from the national fund, 
including $937 million to Astana and $500 million to Almaty.  
</p>
<p>19. As at October 2010, the construction of 37 housing projects was finalised thanks to 
the funds allocated by the Government for that purpose, and 8,265 shareholders managed to 
have access to their apartments/houses. As at November 2010, however, 87 buildings still 
remained to be completed, including 42 housing projects in Astana, 26 in Almaty and the 
remaining 17 in other regions. As a result, almost 20,000 shareholders are still waiting to 
receive their apartments. The Government plans to finalize the construction of 51 housing 
complexes (9,932 shareholders), including 35 projects in Astana and 7 in Almaty, by the 
end of 2010. </p>

<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>20. Kazakhstan is a party to seven core international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Pursuant to the treaties, 
the State has undertaken an obligation to adopt appropriate legislative, administrative, 
judicial and other measures, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to 
achieving progressively the full realization of the right to adequate housing. Such measures 
include the adoption of legislative and other measures to prevent and, if appropriate, 
punish, forced evictions carried out by State agents or private actors without appropriate 
safeguards, adequate compensation or alternative accommodation. 
</p>
<p>21. Kazakhstan has signed, though is still to ratify, the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, which includes provisions on the right of persons with disabilities 
to an adequate standard of living for themselves and their families, including housing, and 
on the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility, including in 
the field of housing.  
</p>
<p>22. Kazakhstan is not a party to the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which recognizes, inter 
alia, the right of migrant workers to have access to housing, including social housing 
schemes, on an equal basis with nationals of the State of employment. Kazakhstan has 
affirmed that it does not intend to ratify the Convention in the near future in view of the far-
reaching financial implications that would arise from its implementation.2 
</p>
<p>23. In accordance with article 4 (3) of the Constitution, international treaties ratified by 
Kazakhstan have precedence over national legislation, and can be directly applied in the 
domestic legal order except in cases where their application requires the promulgation of a 
law. On 10 July 2008, the Supreme Court adopted a regulatory decision on the direct 
applicability of international treaties in national courts and tribunals, which requires judges 
to be guided by the norms of international treaties to which Kazakhstan is a party.3  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legislative and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Constitution, adopted by national referendum on 30 August 1995, has supreme 
legal force and direct effect in the entire territory of the Republic. Articles 25 and 26 of the 
Constitution contain provisions relating to housing. According to these provisions, housing 
is inviolable, and citizens can only be deprived of their homes on the basis of a court order. 
In order to satisfy the housing needs of citizens, the Constitution states that citizens in need 
of housing should be provided with housing at an affordable price from State housing funds 
in accordance with relevant legislation. 
</p>
<p>25. The national human rights plan of action for the period 2009-2012 aims to 
strengthen the national system of promotion and protection of human rights and the 
education of the general public regarding human rights and the mechanisms for their 
protection. The plan identifies a set of concrete measures to eliminate gaps in national 
legislation and practice and to improve the coordination of governmental and non-
governmental institutions working in the field of human rights protection.  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>26. Kazakhstan has enacted a number of legislative and regulatory acts on housing 
issues. The Housing Relations Act (Law No. 94 of 16 April 1997) is the main statutory 
instrument in the field of housing. Other relevant laws include:  
</p>
<p> (a) The Housing Construction (Equity Participation) Act (Law No. 180 of 7 July 
2006), which aims to safeguard the rights of shareholders by increasing the responsibilities 
of private developers in the area of equity participation in housing construction;  
</p>
<p> (b) The Private Housing Construction Act (Law No. 213 of 3 November 1994), 
which aims to encourage the construction of residential dwellings by providing land plots to 
individual developers and to enhance engineering-communication infrastructure in the 
districts of housing development;  
</p>
<p> (c) The Housing Construction (Savings in the Republic of Kazakhstan) Act (Law 
No. 110 of 7 December 2000), which establishes a system of mortgage-based housing at 
preferential rates to facilitate access to affordable housing for individuals and households 
belonging to priority categories of citizens (for example, young families with children).  
</p>
<p>27. Only nationals may purchase housing or have access to social housing or housing 
benefits. According to article 67 of the Housing Relations Act, public housing or privately 
owned housing leased by the local authorities are to be provided to the following categories 
of households in need of housing:  
</p>
<p> (a) Persons with disabilities and participants in the Great Patriotic War (war 
veterans); 
</p>
<p> (b) Persons belonging to low-income and socially protected groups of the 
population, such as retired persons, orphans or children left without parental care, and large 
or single-parent families;  
</p>
<p> (c) Some categories of public officials, such as Government employees and 
military personnel. 
</p>
<p>28. Persons belonging to the above categories are eligible for public housing if:  
</p>
<p> (a) They do not own a house in the territory of the Republic;  
</p>
<p> (b) They have not already obtained a house through the State Housing Fund;  
</p>
<p> (c) They live in a dilapidated dwelling that does not meet sanitary and technical 
requirements;  
</p>
<p> (d) They share a dwelling with two or more families;  
</p>
<p> (e) They share the living space with a person suffering from a chronic disease.  
</p>
<p>29. According to State legislation, low-income households are those families whose 
aggregate monthly income per each family member is lower than the minimal cost of 
living, fixed at 14,952 tenge (approximately $99) per family member.  
</p>
<p>30. Eligible persons may only apply for social housing in the municipality where they 
reside. Municipalities keep separate lists for the following categories of eligible 
households: persons with disabilities and war veterans; low-income and socially protected 
households; certain categories of public officials; and persons living in dilapidated 
dwellings. Social housing units are allocated on the basis of the date of registration in the 
lists; however, persons with disabilities and war veterans have precedence over other 
categories of eligible households. Social housing units are to have a surface of between 15 
and 18 m2 per person, and comprise at least one bedroom.  
</p>
<p>31. In cases where house-related expenditure exceeds 10 to 15 per cent of the total 
family income, local authorities also provide housing allowances from the local budget to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>help low-income households to pay for rent or expenses for housing maintenance and utility 
services. 
</p>
<p>32. The State programme for housing construction for 2008-2010 aims to facilitate the 
expansion of the public housing stock for low-income and socially protected groups by 
creating enabling conditions, including tax incentives, to attract private investments in 
housing construction and to promote public-private partnerships. The programme provides 
that each region, including Astana and Almaty, should commission no fewer than 100 
apartments every year for low-income and socially protected groups.4 Such dwellings will 
then be allocated to eligible households in accordance with the Housing Relations Act. 
</p>
<p>33. The above-mentioned programme also aims at facilitating the implementation of the 
Housing Construction (Savings in the Republic of Kazakhstan) Act by establishing a 
system of housing credits to enable local authorities to build social housing units funded 
from the national budget. The housing credit system aims at facilitating access to adequate 
housing for medium-income people, who can buy housing at the market price. Under this 
system, eligible households have access to housing loans that are granted on a long-term 
basis at a rate not exceeding 4 per cent. In order to ensure that the procedures are 
transparent and that the housing units are distributed fairly, the law establishes the criteria 
for the selection of applicants and sets income thresholds. 
</p>
<p>34. The programme identifies the priority target groups below: 
</p>
<p>(a) Young families with children, in which both spouses have not reached the 
age of 29 years; 
</p>
<p>(b) Single-parent families, in which the divorced or widowed parent raising the 
children is under the age of 29 years; 
</p>
<p>(c) Civil servants; 
</p>
<p>(d) Certain categories of State employees who do not fall within the category of 
civil servants (e.g., employees of State enterprises). 
</p>
<p>35. Kazakhstan has also taken measures to provide rental accommodation at affordable 
price for low-income households. On the basis of the Development of the Rental Sector 
(Amendments and Additions to Legislation) Act of 7 July 2006, local authorities may rent 
accommodation from the private housing stock and make it available to low-income 
households in need of housing. The Act also provides specific tax incentives to builders and 
owners of rental buildings in order to reduce the cost of such leases.  
</p>
<p>36. Other incentives adopted by Kazakhstan to facilitate access to adequate housing 
include land allotments for the construction of residential houses and a system of housing 
construction savings to facilitate access to mortgage loans for the purchase of housing. The 
<i>akimat</i> also carries out programmes to relocate informal settlers or regularize their 
settlements by providing legal titles and access to social services. 
</p>
<p>37. In 1995, President Nazarabaev launched a programme to encourage <i>oralman 
</i>(foreign citizens or stateless persons of Kazakh ethnicity who permanently reside outside 
Kazakhstan) to return to their homeland. The Migration Act of 1997 sets out the legal 
framework of this policy, which provides for fixed quotas. Returnees enjoy a number of 
benefits, including access to land, assistance in finding an employment, access to education 
and the right to a pension, social insurance and social allowances, although those returning 
outside the quota system have more limited access to resettlement assistance.

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>38. Kazakhstan is a unitary state with a presidential form of government. 
Administratively, it consists of 14 provinces (<i>oblasts</i>) and two cities of republican status 
(Astana, the capital, and Almaty).  
</p>
<p>39. The President is the head of State. He determines the main directions of the domestic 
and foreign policy of the State, and represents Kazakhstan within the country and in 
international relations. He is the guarantor of the unity of the people, of the inviolability of 
the Constitution and of civil and individual rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p>40. The Parliament is the supreme representative body of the Republic, with legislative 
functions. It consists of two chambers: the Senate (Upper House) and the <i>Majilis</i> (Lower 
House).  
</p>
<p>41. The Government exercises executive power, heads the system of executive bodies 
and oversees their work. It is a collegial body, directly accountable to the President and, in 
cases stipulated by the Constitution, to Parliament. 
</p>
<p>42. The judiciary consists of local- and oblast- (regional) level courts, and a Supreme 
Court at the national level. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial organ in Kazakhstan. 
All judges, except for the members of the Supreme Court, are appointed by the President.  
</p>
<p>43. The Constitutional Council reviews laws and regulations to ensure their 
compatibility with the Constitution. It also issues official interpretations of the provisions 
of the Constitution. The Senate and the <i>Majilis</i> each appoint one member of the Council, 
and the remaining two members and the Chairman are appointed by the President. 
</p>
<p>44. The <i>akimat</i> is responsible for implementing State policies in its area. It elaborates 
economic and social development plans and local budgets, manages community property 
and exercises other powers set out in the Constitution and in legislation. The governor 
(<i>akim</i>) of the oblasts, cities of national significance and the capital are appointed by the 
President with the approval of the local representative body (<i>maslikhat</i>). 
</p>
<p>45. The State Agency for Construction, Housing and Utilities is the central executive 
body responsible for the planning and implementation of legislation and policies in the field 
of architecture, town-planning, construction, housing and utilities. It also oversees the 
development of a draft master plan on the organization of the territory of the Republic, and 
provides town-planning expertise for the elaboration and the implementation of the draft 
master plans of the capital, the cities of republican significance and the cities of regional 
significance with a population of over 100,000. 
</p>
<p>46. The <i>akimat</i> elaborates and implements the general plans for city development. In the 
implementation of the plans, the <i>akimat</i> identifies the parcels of land to be expropriated for 
State needs and make arrangements for the act of expropriation. The <i>akimat</i> also receives 
requests relating to social housing. It oversees the construction of public housing and 
privately owned buildings to be leased to low-income households in need of housing, and 
keeps and regularly reviews the lists of eligible citizens. The <i>akimat</i> also fosters access to 
adequate housing by promoting the regularization of informal settlements and the allocation 
of land for the construction of private housing. 
</p>
<p>47. Human rights and freedoms are defended by the legislature, the executive and the 
judiciary. The independence of the judiciary is proclaimed in article 77 of the Constitution. 
In addition to court protection, everyone has the right to file a complaint with two national 
institutions: the Human Rights Commissioner of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Ombudsman) </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>and the Human Rights Commission under the President. Neither of these institutions was 
established in conformity with the Paris Principles relating to the status of national 
institutions.5 
</p>
<p>48. The main task of the office of the Ombudsman, established in 2002, is to consider 
applications from individuals within the State&#8217;s jurisdiction concerning alleged human 
rights violations perpetrated by public officials and State institutions, and to recommend the 
adoption of appropriate measures to eliminate the consequences of such violations.6 
Concerned public officials or State institutions are required to duly consider the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s recommendations and report on, within a month, the measures taken to 
address them. In the period 2003-2009, the Ombudsman received a total of 11,879 written 
and oral complaints. 
</p>
<p>49. In 2009, the Ombudsman received 88 communications (5.3 per cent of the total) 
concerning alleged violations of the right to adequate housing. In the first part of 2010, the 
office considered 47 housing-related communications. Most complaints concerned alleged 
violations relating to participatory constructions and forced evictions for State needs. 
</p>
<p>50. The Human Rights Commission under the President is a consultative body 
established in 1994 to assist the Head of State in the exercise of his constitutional mandate 
to safeguard human rights and fundamental freedoms. In carrying out this function, the 
Commission can consider individual petitions addressed to the President concerning alleged 
human rights violations and may issue recommendations for State officials and public 
institutions on the measures to be taken to redress such violations. In 2009, the Commission 
consider 1,137 complaints. As in the case of the Ombudsman, most housing-related 
complaints were collective complaints from individuals who received mortgages and 
housing loans for the construction of buildings that have not been completed as a result of 
the financial crisis.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Positive developments 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that Kazakhstan has ratified or 
acceded to a number of international human rights treaties enshrining the right to adequate 
housing. She also welcomes the fact that, pursuant to the Constitution, such treaties have 
precedence over conflicting national legislation and can be directly invoked in national 
courts and tribunals. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the legislative and policy measures taken by the 
State to strengthen the implementation of the right to adequate housing at the national level, 
including: 
</p>
<p>(a) The State housing construction programme for 2008-2010; 
</p>
<p>(b) The national human rights plan of action for 2009-2012, which contains a 
number of recommendations to improve the protection of the housing rights of individuals 
belonging to vulnerable groups, such as persons with disabilities and returnees;  
</p>
<p>(c) The amendments to the Housing Relations Act, which recognize, in 
compliance with the recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child,7 the 
right of children without parental care to have access to social housing; 
</p>
<p>  
 5 General Assembly resolution 48/134, annex. 
 6 Presidential Decree No. 947 of 19 September 2002. 
 7 CRC/C/KAZ/CO/3, para. 56. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>(d) The system of housing loans, which aims at access to home ownership for 
middle-income young families with children and certain categories of civil servants; 
</p>
<p>(e) The elaboration of a draft programme of loans for housing construction, 
aimed at facilitating access to affordable housing for persons not belonging to the priority 
target groups identified by the existing legislation on housing loans; 
</p>
<p>(f) Measures to provide rental accommodation at affordable price to low-income 
households in need of housing;  
</p>
<p>(g) Measures aimed at facilitating access to land and adequate housing for 
returnees. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the work carried out by the Ombudsman and 
the Human Rights Commission under the President for the protection of individuals who 
claim to have been victims of violations of the right to adequate housing perpetrated by the 
action (or inaction) of public officials or State institutions. With regard to the Ombudsman, 
the Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that a draft law aiming to bring the status of the 
office of the Ombudsman into conformity with the Paris Principles has being added to the 
plan of legislative work of the Government for the last quarter of 2011. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur cannot but note with appreciation the willingness 
demonstrated by the Government and the efforts it has made to mitigate the repercussions 
of the financial crisis on the effective enjoyment of the right to adequate housing of 
aggrieved individuals and households. Such efforts include the adoption of a priority plan 
of action to ensure the stability of the mortgage market, the allocation of funds to refinance 
existing mortgage loans and the creation of a national fund to facilitate the completion of 
building projects.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur also notes with satisfaction the establishment of a unified 
coordination council as a consultative/advisory body to the Government. The mandate of 
the council is to solve the most problematic issues relating to equity construction, improve 
legislation in the area of equity construction and the protection of shareholders, and 
facilitate the compensation of shareholders who have been defrauded by unscrupulous 
developers.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that several households have managed to 
receive their apartments as a result of Government intervention. She also notes with 
satisfaction the legislative measures taken by Kazakhstan to ensure better protection of 
shareholders and to avoid possible abuse by unscrupulous construction companies, 
including the Act of 11 July 2010 on making amendments and addenda to certain 
legislative acts of Kazakhstan on issues of participatory construction, as well as statutory 
regulations implementing the Act.  
</p>
<p>57. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur would like to express her appreciation for the work of 
civil society, including social movements and non-governmental organizations, in the field 
of housing, particularly for its reliance on international human rights instruments as 
standards to hold Governments at all levels to account. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> V. Concerns relating to the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Housing legislation and policies 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur shares the concerns expressed by the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that the legal framework in the field of housing does 
not protect the right to adequate housing in line with international human rights standards.8 
In particular, she believes that, according to the Constitution and domestic legislation, the 
right to housing continues to be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense, as the right to 
have a roof over one&#8217;s head, while housing continues to be regarded as a commodity rather 
than as a human right.9 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur is aware that the right to adequate housing as set out in 
article 11 (<i>1</i>) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is 
directly applicable in Kazakhstan and takes precedence over conflicting national legislation, 
pursuant to article 4 (<i>3</i>) of the Constitution. Nevertheless, she notes with concern that, in 
practice, national courts do not apply norms of international treaties nor do they refer to 
international human rights standards, such as the general comments adopted by the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that, despite the measures taken by 
Kazakhstan to realize the right to adequate housing, the State has failed to demonstrate that, 
in aggregate, the measures are actually sufficient to realize the right for every individual in 
the shortest possible time in accordance with the maximum of available resources.10 Such a 
failure is demonstrated, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, by the large number of 
individuals and households who are homeless or inadequately housed, the decrease in the 
State-owned housing stock and the long period of time eligible households have to wait 
before receiving a house at an affordable price from the State Housing Fund.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur regrets the fact that the current national human rights plan of 
action does not contain any detailed analysis on the status of implementation of the right to 
adequate housing in the country, nor does it not identify concrete steps to strengthen its 
protection.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the low degree of awareness on the right 
to adequate housing, and more in general on economic, social and cultural rights, existing 
in the country. She also notes that the limited human, financial and technical resources 
available to the office of the Ombudsman and the Human Rights Commission under the 
President de facto hamper the efforts taken by these institutions to protect and promote the 
human rights of persons living within the jurisdiction of the State, including their right to 
adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that, despite the efforts taken by 
Kazakhstan to curb corruption, this phenomenon continues to be widespread in the country, 
including in the judiciary.

</p>
<p><b> C.  Forced eviction 
</b></p>
<p>64. According to article 26 (<i>3</i>) of the Constitution, no one can be deprived of his or her 
property unless otherwise stipulated by a court decision. Forcible alienation of property for 
State needs is only permissible in exceptional cases and in accordance with the procedures 
established by law, and only on condition of adequate compensation.  
</p>
<p>65. The exceptional cases in which forcible alienation of property for State needs is 
permissible are listed in article 84 of the Land Code, and include:  
</p>
<p>(a) International obligations; 
</p>
<p>(b) Supply land for the need of defence, the creation of natural reserves, resorts 
or recreational, historical and cultural areas, or the establishment and operation of special 
economic zones; 
</p>
<p>(c) Exploitation of deposits of natural resources; 
</p>
<p>(d) Construction of roads, electrical power lines, lines of communication, 
pipelines, engineering networks for public use in populated areas and other facilities of 
State significance; 
</p>
<p>(e) The demolition of derelict houses at risk of collapsing; 
</p>
<p>(f) The implementation of general plans of development with regard to the 
construction of facilities falling under the category of exceptional cases established by the 
present article, and the construction of facilities provided for by national and regional 
programmes and investment projects necessary to achieve State needs and accomplish 
public objectives. 
</p>
<p>66. Article 84 does not provide a precise definition of the national and regional 
programmes and investment projects that serve State interests and aim to achieve public 
objectives. In accordance with a regulatory resolution adopted by the Constitutional 
Council in 28 May 2007, the exact nature of the exceptional cases referred to in this 
provision should be identified in the light of fundamental constitutional principles, 
especially those enshrined in article 26 (<i>3</i>) of the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that national legislation on forced eviction 
does not comply with existing international human rights standards, such as general 
comment No. 7 on forced eviction, adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in 1997, and the basic principles and guidelines on development-based 
evictions and displacement elaborated by the former Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing.11 She notes in particular that the ambiguity of national legislation with regard to 
the definition of &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; and &#8220;State needs&#8221; makes room for arbitrary 
and broad interpretations of such concepts, thereby resulting in a great number of illegal 
forced evictions. 
</p>
<p>68. The power to make decisions on forcible alienation is deferred to the <i>akimat</i>, which 
is responsible for the implementation of general plans of development. The resolution of 
the <i>akimat</i> is carried out by means of a buyout (article 85 of the Land Code). The price of 
the land, the time frame and other terms of the buyout are determined by an agreement 
between the owner or land user and the <i>akimat</i>. The owner or land user has the right to 
choose between monetary compensation at market value and alternative accommodation. In 
cases where the owner or land user does not agree with the decision on a buyout, the

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>compensation offered or other conditions of the purchase, the local executive body may file 
a suit with the competent court.  
</p>
<p>69. As a result of legalization programmes carried out by the local executive bodies of 
Astana and Almaty, a number of informal settlers have managed to obtain security of 
tenure, which constitutes an essential precondition for the effective enjoyment of the right 
to adequate housing. However, a large number of people have not managed to have their 
dwellings legalized, and therefore remain vulnerable to forced eviction. On some occasions, 
households whose dwellings have been demolished for reasons of non-compliance with 
housing legislation have seen newcomers building houses on the same plot on the basis of 
titles allegedly provided by State authorities.    
</p>
<p>70. The law enforcement practice in the field of forced eviction is not consistent with 
human rights law. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the fact that the implementation of 
general plans of development cannot constitute a sufficient legal justification for forced 
eviction in the absence of one of the exceptional circumstances provided for by national 
legislation. She also notes that national courts tend to interpret the concepts of &#8220;State 
needs&#8221; and &#8220;investment projects&#8221; in a very broad manner, so as to include investment 
projects carried out by private construction companies and financed by private investments. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having been able to obtain updated statistical 
data on the number of forced evictions carried out in recent years in Almaty and Astana, on 
the number of affected households and the percentage of individuals who remained 
homeless as a result of the demolition of their dwellings. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that, in most cases, the monetary 
compensation provided to the owner or land user is not sufficient to allow evicted 
households to purchase an adequate house at market price in the same area. This is due to 
the fact that, after the buyout of plots for State needs, the <i>akimat</i> may change the zoning 
from agricultural to urban uses to allow private developers to implement investment 
projects included in the general plan of development. Furthermore, evicted families are, 
apparently, rarely offered alternative accommodation.    
</p>
<p>73. According to State legislation, unauthorized constructions on vacant parcels are 
subject to demolition by the persons responsible for erecting them or at their expense; no 
compensation or alternative housing is due for the demolition of informal settlements. After 
eviction, settlers often become homeless. In 2006, in Bakay, on the outskirts of Almaty, 
authorities destroyed hundred of houses, claiming that they had been built illegally. Court 
orders were presented for only 29 of the 350 to 400 houses demolished and residents were 
given little notice of the planned eviction. In July 2006, in Shanyrak district, a similar 
attempt to destroy houses was violently resisted.12  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned about the high rate of demolition of 
informal settlements and forced evictions carried out without prior notification, any form of 
judicial control or review, or the provision of adequate compensation or alternative 
accommodation. During the mission, she received reports and saw documentary evidence 
of demolitions conducted by public officials using force, in some cases during winter when 
the temperature was well below zero. She was dismayed to hear that a great number of 
vulnerable individuals, including pregnant women, children and persons with disabilities, 
had been made homeless as a result of such demolitions.

</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Financial and mortgage crisis 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that, despite the emergency measures 
taken by the Government to mitigate the impact of the financial crisis on the effective 
enjoyment of the right to adequate housing of aggrieved individuals and households and to 
ensure the completion of construction projects slowed or halted as a result of the crisis, 
20,000 shareholders are still waiting to receive their apartments. 
</p>
<p>76. One of the most controversial measures taken by the Government is the decision to 
provide shareholders with no more than one apartment within the housing complex, 
regardless of the number of apartments purchased, in order to ensure that all those who 
invested in shared construction receive at least one dwelling for themselves and their 
families.13 The legality of this measure, which has the aim of guaranteeing the stability of 
the mortgage market and protecting the rights of shareholders in housing constructions, was 
upheld by the Esilskiy District Court of Astana (decision No. 2-947/10 of 5 May 2010). 
However, most shareholders invested in more than one apartment in order to provide 
adequate accommodation to other family members (elderly parents, children getting 
married and relatives from the countryside). The Special Rapporteur heard many 
testimonies from people who had been adversely affected by this decision.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur is also gravely concerned about reported cases of forced 
eviction as a result of the inability of low-income households to repay their credits and 
mortgage loans. As a result of the extrajudicial sale of their property by banks or other 
financial institutions, a number of individuals and households have become homeless or 
been forced to move in to poor-quality housing.14  
</p>
<p><b> E.  Disparities between urban and rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the significant disparities between urban 
and rural areas with regard to the availability and quality of housing. She notes with 
concern that high unemployment rates, deteriorating standards in the quality of education 
and health care and limited access to essential services, such as safe drinking water and 
sanitation, in rural areas continue to force a large number of individuals and households to 
leave their villages to find employment opportunities and a better standard of living 
elsewhere, particularly in Astana and Almaty.   
</p>
<p>79. According to information provided to the Special Rapporteur, a high percentage of 
dwellings in rural areas are in a dilapidated condition. Wide disparities also exist with 
regard to access to essential social services, such as drinking water and improved sanitation. 
In 2008, 82.5 per cent of urban households were connected to the water supply system, 
whereas only 24.2 per cent of the rural population had access to water sources. The 
disparities are even greater in the field of sanitation: 73.5 per cent of people living in urban 
areas were connected to the central sewage system, compared to 8.9 per cent in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>80. Addressing the above-mentioned challenges is particularly difficult in rural areas. In 
spite of a number of programmes implemented by the Government to improve villages and 
develop the agricultural sector, the living standards of rural population continue to be much 
lower than those of the urban population. There are reasons for this, including the left-over

<p>funding applied to the rural social sector (especially true in times of economic downturn), 
underdeveloped infrastructure, primarily in transport and telecommunications networks.  
</p>
<p><b> F.  Social housing 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur notes with great concern that, under the Housing Relations 
Act, persons belonging to low-income or socially protected groups of the population are not 
given priority access to social housing. Certain vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, such 
as people living in disaster-prone areas, are not included in the list of eligible households 
contained in article 68 of the Act. It is not clear from the text of the Act whether homeless 
people who do not belong to any of the socially protected groups are eligible for social 
housing.  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that the categories of State 
employees identified in article 67 (<i>2</i>) of the Housing Relations Act have the right to obtain 
social housing on an equal basis with low-income or socially protected groups of the 
population, without any need to demonstrate their inability to provide for their own housing 
needs.   
</p>
<p>83. Long waiting periods for social housing continue to be a serious problem in 
Kazakhstan, as already noted in 2010 by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights in its concluding observations on Kazakhstan.15 In July 2010, 140,043 citizens were 
registered as eligible households in need of housing from the State Housing Fund, including 
1,432 persons with disabilities and war veterans and 79,536 persons belonging to low-
income and socially protected groups. In July 2010, 17,461 citizens in Astana and 8,439 in 
Almaty were on the waiting lists for public housing. According to information received, 
eligible households have to wait for up to 10 years to receive an apartment from the public 
housing stock. The State acknowledges that the average wait is between six and eight years. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>84. The current registration system, which is intended to allow the State to monitor and 
control the movement of internal and international migrants within the country, requires 
migrants to register at their place of residence within five days of their arrival.  Registration 
at one&#8217;s place of residence implies the existence of a valid address to register. Therefore, 
persons living in informal settlements without any legal address or occupying dwellings 
that do not meet existing health and safety standards are de facto prevented from obtaining 
registration, a prerequisite for access to a number of social services, including social 
housing. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Returnees 
</b></p>
<p>85. From 1991 to 2009, more than 188,000 returnee families, or approximately 740,000 
people, returned to Kazakhstan. Every year, Kazakhstan receives between 10,000 and 
15,000 families of ethnic Kazakhs. Most returnees come from Uzbekistan (almost 60 per 
cent of the total), Mongolia and China. Most returnees  come under the quota system.  
</p>
<p>86. According to the Land Code, returnees are allocated land for individual housing 
construction in the villages where they live, which becomes their property after they 
</p>
<p>  
 15 E/C.12/KAZ/CO/1, para. 30.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3

</p>
<p>acquire Kazakh citizenship. The Nurly Kosh (&#8220;bright resettlement&#8221;) programme for the 
period 2009-2011 aims to facilitate access to adequate housing through a preferential credit 
mechanism.16 The programme is designed to assist the demographic and socio-economic 
development of various regions of the country, and is also based on a quota system. In 
2009, 674 families were allocated housing units under the programme. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur received several reports according to which abandoned 
houses granted by the <i>akimat</i> to returnees within the framework of the resettlement 
programme were subsequently taken away when the former owners, who had abandoned 
their homes owing to the recession of the early 1990s, returned to claim their ownership in 
courts.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Refugees and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>88. As at July 2010, 597 people had been granted refugee status in Kazakhstan. The vast 
majority of refugees (588) came from Afghanistan. Asylum-seekers from Uzbekistan, the 
Russian Federation (Chechens) and China (Uighurs from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region) are regularly denied refugee status by the State. The Government maintains that 
citizens from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) by definition do not need 
refugee status because they enjoy freedom of movement under the CIS visa-free regime. 
They therefore have to apply to the national office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and, if their application is successful, wait for 
resettlement in a third country ready to accept them. As a result, they find themselves in a 
state of legal limbo, which makes them vulnerable to police harassment and forcible return. 
They also endure poor living conditions and economic hardship, and have few employment 
opportunities.  
</p>
<p>89. No statistical data are available on the housing situation of refugees and asylum-
seekers. According to information provided by UNHCR, most reside in rented houses or 
apartments, and have access to basic utilities (water, electricity and gas); however, the 
quality of their housing varies considerably from one family to another. Generally 
speaking, families who have been residing in Kazakhstan for a long time and have obtained 
refugee status reside in housing of a higher standard than those who have recently arrived. 
Those forced to live in less favourable economic conditions share their premises with 
individuals of the same national or ethnic group. Apparently, no refugees or asylum-seekers 
reside in State-owned apartments.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. The homeless 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur was unable to obtain reliable information concerning the 
extent of homelessness in Kazakhstan. The Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, the 
Government agency responsible for providing assistance and support to homeless people, 
does not have any statistical data concerning the number of people who, for whatever 
reason, do not have a registered address in the territory of the State. According to civil 
society organizations, the lack of appropriate information is due to the fact that no 
definition of homeless person exists in Kazakh law. 
</p>
<p>91. There are 21 social centres in the country for persons who do not have a fixed 
residence. The centres, which are financed by the budget of the <i>akimat</i>, provide assistance 
and support to homeless people. Depending on the specific situation of the individual, 
centres provide short-term accommodation, medical care and psychological support, 
assistance in finding employment or obtaining social security benefits. According to the

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>data provided by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, in the first half of 2010, 
these centres hosted almost 4,000 people. On average, people stay in the centres for less 
than six months before returning to their families, or being redirected to other institutions 
(for example, nursing homes or centres for persons with disabilities). 
</p>
<p>92. Homeless persons are de facto prevented from having access to a number of social 
services provided by the State, which are only available to those who have registered their 
place of residence. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Housing legislation and policies 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that Kazakhstan review and streamline 
its legislation and policies on housing in order to ensure their consistency with 
international human rights norms and standards on adequate housing. Kazakhstan 
should also review its approach centred solely on the market and mortgage-based 
home-ownership (a factor contributing to the real-estate crisis), and develop a 
comprehensive national housing policy. Such a policy should envisage different 
measures, inter alia, rental schemes and the upgrade of informal settlements to 
address the needs of different strata of society, including the most vulnerable groups, 
such as low-income households, large families, single mothers with young children, 
persons with disabilities, the elderly, internal migrant workers, returnees (<i>oralman</i>), 
refugees and asylum-seekers.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>All relevant stakeholders should be actively involved in the design and 
implementation of legislation, policies and strategies affecting them; to this end, the 
Government should engage in a constructive manner with civil society and advocacy 
groups. In particular, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to take all 
appropriate measures to ensure that individuals and households affected by the 
mortgage crisis participate actively in the development of solutions designed to 
counter the crisis. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Kazakhstan should take all appropriate measures to ensure the effective 
applicability of international treaties, and in particular of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in national courts.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Human rights education, particularly on economic, social and cultural rights, 
should be improved. The Special Rapporteur recommends that Kazakhstan organize, 
with the assistance of the OHCHR Regional Office in Bishkek, training opportunities 
and awareness-raising activities for judges, lawyers and public officials to familiarize 
them with economic, social and cultural rights. In the development and 
implementation of such human rights education programmes, appropriate attention 
should be paid to the content and implications of the right to adequate housing, as well 
as to the work carried out in the field of housing by the Special Rapporteur and the 
Committee on Economic, Social ad Cultural Rights.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to finalize adoption of the 
draft law designed to strengthen the independence of the office of the Commissioner 
for Human Rights and bring its status into conformity with the Paris Principles. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Adequate human, financial and technical resources should be allocated to the office to 
allow it to carry out its functions. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendation of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,</b>17<b> that Kazakhstan intensify its efforts to 
combat corruption. In this regard, it encourages the State to organize, with the 
assistance of relevant United Nations specialized agencies and programmes and the 
support of the donor community, awareness-raising programmes and capacity-
building for public officials, including law enforcement officers, prosecutors and 
judges, on the application of anti-corruption legislation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>A comprehensive approach needs to be adopted to address the issues of forced 
evictions, security of tenure, the legalization of informal settlements and slum 
upgrading, and to ensure open, participatory and meaningful consultation with 
affected residents and communities prior to implementing development and urban 
renewal projects. In particular, the Special Rapporteur urges Kazakhstan to adopt a 
specific law on eviction, which should be developed in accordance with existing human 
rights standards, such as general comment No. 7 of the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights</b> <b>and the guidelines on development-based evictions, and 
implemented in accordance with relevant principles and procedures of international 
human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The new law should ensure that forced evictions are carried out only in the 
exceptional circumstances provided for by national legislation, and only for the 
purpose of promoting general welfare. The circumstances under which an eviction can 
be justified should be defined, and interpreted by national courts, in a restrictive 
manner. Protection against forced eviction should apply to all vulnerable individuals 
and groups, irrespective of whether they hold title to a home and or property under 
domestic law. The implementation of general plans of city development should in no 
way be used as a justification for forced evictions. While the new law is developed, a 
total moratorium on forced evictions should be implemented.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>All persons evicted from their properties should be provided with adequate 
compensation and/or offered appropriate alternative housing. Affected individuals 
should also be granted the possibility of opting for alternative housing, when 
applicable, within the same neighbourhood. Relocation sites should be provided with 
basic services, including drinking water, electricity, washing facilities and sanitation, 
as well as adequate facilities including schools, health-care centres and transportation 
at the time of resettlement . 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Decisions on eviction should be delivered to affected households in written 
form, and should provide a detailed explanation of the exceptional circumstances 
justifying the forcible alienation of land for State needs. Decision by local executive 
bodies should also clearly indicate the personal data of affected individuals as well as 
the parcels subject to forced eviction.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The issue of informal settlements built on the outskirts of Astana and Almaty is 
a complex one, and requires a comprehensive approach covering education, health 
care, social benefits, employment and other issues. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to reaffirm that forced eviction can only be justified in the most 
</b></p>
<p>  
 17 E/C.12/KAZ/CO/1, para. 11. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>exceptional circumstances, and always in accordance with relevant principles and 
procedures established by international human rights law. In particular, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to reiterate that the State has the obligation to take all appropriate 
measures to ensure that no one is rendered homeless or vulnerable to the violation of 
other human rights as a result of an eviction, whether legal or not. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Mortgage crisis 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the lessons learned by the 
Government in its efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of the financial crisis on the 
effective enjoyment of the right to adequate housing should be used as the basis for an 
overall reconsideration of its housing strategies, policies and programmes. The 
financial crisis has shown that the creation of an enabling environment to attract 
foreign investment and support financial activities is not in itself sufficient to ensure 
access to adequate and affordable housing for all, and that effective regulation and 
close monitoring by the State of private sector activities, including financial and 
construction companies, is required. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The State should review its legislation and policies with regard to access to 
mortgage-based credit for low-income households in order to ensure that commercial 
banks and financial institutions take into account the limited repayment capacity of 
these households. Financial services for low-income groups must be developed in 
consultation with these groups, as they are best able to assess their repayment 
capacity and ensure the development of systems that meet their effective needs.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the State to continue its efforts to mitigate 
the impact of foreclosures and to facilitate the completion of housing projects that 
have been halted as a result of the crisis.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the State to amend its legislation to make the 
extrajudicial sale of a debtor&#8217;s only house illegal. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E.  Disparities between urban and rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the State party increase its efforts to 
address disparities between urban and rural areas and among regions with regard to 
the availability and quality of housing. She also calls on the Government to develop 
and implement, in close consultation with affected local communities, comprehensive 
programmes and strategies aimed at improving socio-economic conditions in rural 
areas, with a view to reducing migration from rural to urban areas and easing 
housing problems in Astana and Almaty. Priority actions should include the creation 
of new employment opportunities and the improvement of access to education, health 
care and essential services, such as safe drinking water and sanitation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F.  Social housing 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the State to consider reviewing the Housing 
Relations Act in such a way as to ensure that persons belonging to vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups receive priority consideration in the allocation of social housing 
units. She also recommends that the list contained in article 68 be reviewed, and that 
all groups in society that are vulnerable and disadvantaged with regard to housing be 
included in this list.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/42/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>110. <b>The Special Rapporteur reminds the State that, in its general comment No. 4, 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights declared that policies and 
legislation should not be designed to benefit already advantaged social groups at the 
expense of others (para. 11). Accordingly, she recommends that Kazakhstan consider 
amending its legislation on social housing in such a way as to ensure that access to 
social housing is granted only to individuals and households who are unable to 
provide for their own housing needs.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that State reconsider its housing strategy 
and policies with a view to improving access to adequate and affordable housing for 
individuals and households belonging to low-income and socially vulnerable groups. 
She recommends that the State increase the budget allocated for the construction of 
new social housing units, and that a combination of public and private sector 
measures be developed and implemented simultaneously in order to fulfil the right to 
adequate housing of vulnerable individuals and groups. 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that State consider reviewing the current 
registration system with a view to facilitating the registration of persons staying 
legally in its territory but who cannot complete the registration process owing to the 
lack of a legal address to register.  
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the State take all appropriate 
measures to ensure that persons belonging to vulnerable groups, such as non-
nationals, internal migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, have access to adequate 
housing on an equal basis with its citizens.
