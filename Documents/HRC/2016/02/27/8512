<p><i>Summary 
</i>The present report is the fifth submitted by the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights on the human rights situation and the activities of her Office in Nepal to 
the Human Rights Council. The report reflects some positive developments since the 
previous report (A/HRC/13/73), including practical steps to end impunity, such as in 
relation to discrimination cases. However, some elements of the peace process have stalled 
due to an extended period of political stalemate, including the establishment of transitional 
justice mechanisms crucial to progress in ending de facto impunity for serious human rights 
violations and abuses, and the finalization of a new constitution. While there has been some 
progress in undertaking the steps necessary to develop an inclusive society, widespread 
inequality and discrimination, which were root causes of the conflict, persist. With political 
willingness to implement practical and concerted human rights policies and action, the 
peace process in Nepal can continue and the prevailing culture of impunity can be 
overcome.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The continuing fragility of the peace process in Nepal was demonstrated through a 
year marked by political stalemate. The low point was the failure of the Constituent 
Assembly to meet the May 2010 deadline to finalize a new constitution. The mandate of the 
Assembly was thus extended by a further year, until May 2011. The prolonged impasse has 
meant that a new Prime Minister has not been elected by Parliament more than six months 
after Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal agreed to stand down, a situation which 
remained unresolved at the time of submission of the present report, and many important 
laws remain pending before the Parliament. 
</p>
<p>2. This has a direct impact on the human rights situation, in particular progress on two 
of the key long-standing human rights challenges facing Nepal: impunity and 
discrimination. The present report will examine the institutional, structural and legal 
challenges regarding both issues. The report also highlights developments which are more 
encouraging. In its different sections, the report summarizes the activities of the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Nepal (OHCHR-
Nepal) to support the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights and political situation 
</b></p>
<p>3. The past year has been one of continuing political uncertainty, with a sustained 
deadlock between the main parties, leading to ongoing tensions and sporadic instances of 
violence. Of greatest significance were the May 2010 nationwide protests and six-day 
<i>bandh1</i> by the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (UCPN-M). The protests were 
organized to demand the resignation of the Prime Minister and advocate for the 
establishment of a Government of national unity. They were timed to apply pressure on the 
Government&#8212;the deadline to confirm the new constitution was approaching, raising the 
possibility that the Constituent Assembly would lose its mandate. Although the initial days 
of the protests were relatively calm, incidents of violence increased as the <i>bandh</i> continued, 
and frustration with its effects grew, leading to significant counter-demonstrations, some of 
which led to violent clashes between rival demonstrators and with the police. UCPN-M 
called off the protests without having achieved immediate results; however, the Prime 
Minister tendered his resignation to the President the following month. While there have 
since been 17 unsuccessful attempts to elect a new Prime Minister, the recent Supreme 
Court intervention should facilitate the process and will hopefully end the political 
deadlock.  
</p>
<p>4. Failure to finalize the new constitution led to a last-minute political deal to extend 
the Constituent Assembly, and the deadline to draft the new constitution, by one year until 
May 2011. Although a high-level political task force was recently formed with the aim of 
resolving contentious issues, progress to date has been minimal. The political deadlock has 
further hindered the country&#8217;s progress on human rights issues central to the peace process: 
draft bills to establish transitional justice mechanisms remain pending since their 
submission to Parliament in early 2010, and proposed anti-discrimination laws and new 
penal and criminal procedure codes have undergone public consultation but have still not 
been finalized. However, some positive developments have been possible, notably the 
establishment of the Special Committee Secretariat and adoption of the specific directives 
in relation to the Maoist Army combatants. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A <i>bandh </i>is an imposed shutdown of all businesses, schools, transportation, etc. </p>


<p>5. Armed criminal groups, operating primarily in the southern Terai districts, continue 
to have a serious impact on the overall security situation. Attacks and abductions targeting 
members of the business community, local authorities, political parties and the public are 
frequent, and ransom payments are often demanded. The security forces have responded 
with methods that have also raised serious concerns, including numerous accounts of 
alleged unlawful arrests and extrajudicial killings of the members of such groups, 
notwithstanding the longstanding commitment Nepal has maintained against the death 
penalty. The Government emphasizes the importance of its code of conduct for security 
personnel as well as efforts to improve the situation through negotiation with armed groups 
and regular law enforcement. However, continued uncertainties surrounding the future 
constitution, particularly in relation to federalism, are likely to lead to continued tensions 
across Nepal in 2011, particularly in districts where issues related to possible federal 
structures are highly disputed between different ethnic and ethno-political groups. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights in Nepal  
</b></p>
<p>6. OHCHR-Nepal was established in 2005. The current mandate was renewed in June 
2010 for a further year. In addition to its formal mandate under the Agreement between the 
High Commissioner and the Government of Nepal, OHCHR-Nepal is mandated under the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement to monitor respect for the human rights provisions 
contained in the Agreement. 
</p>
<p>7. During the reporting period, OHCHR-Nepal continued to monitor the human rights 
situation in Nepal, regularly deploying monitoring teams across the country. For example, 
during the Maoist protests in May, OHCHR-Nepal deployed 21 teams nationwide to 
monitor developments. The office has further continued to increase its focus on the 
development of a national protection system, with an emphasis on building the capacity of 
national human rights institutions and civil society. In this regard OHCHR-Nepal is in the 
process of finalizing a toolkit for human rights defenders and has continued to closely 
cooperate with the National Human Rights Commission, National Women Commission and 
National Dalit Commission.  
</p>
<p>8. In September 2010, OHCHR-Nepal released a summary of concerns entitled 
&#8220;Investigating allegations of extra-judicial killings in the Terai&#8221; that documents 39 
incidents which resulted in the death of 57 persons between January 2008 and June 2010; in 
all cases there are credible allegations of the unlawful use of force by security forces.2 
OHCHR-Nepal has further engaged in ongoing advocacy regarding emblematic cases of 
human rights violations and abuses, committed both during and after the conflict, which 
highlight continuing impunity for such crimes. While little progress was made during the 
reporting period, the conduct of a successful exhumation in one case, following persistent 
efforts of the National Human Rights Commission and OHCHR-Nepal, is encouraging, 
although it remains to be seen whether this will lead to the successful prosecution of the 
perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>9. OHCHR-Nepal has continued its advocacy with and assistance to the Government 
regarding the improvement of several draft bills which are pending in Parliament. It is 
currently engaged in consultations with civil society organizations in order to submit 
recommendations regarding the human rights implications of the three draft bills for the 
</p>
<p>  
 2 OHCHR-Nepal has lately received detailed comments from the Government of Nepal on the 
</p>
<p>summary of concerns and many of the cases reported therein, and looks forward to further dialogue 
with the authorities on the issues and recommendations raised. </p>


<p>future Nepalese criminal law system. OHCHR-Nepal has further engaged in the 
implementation of projects supported by the United Nations Peace Fund for Nepal, 
including a project to support the future transitional justice mechanisms, a project focusing 
on reparations for victims of conflict-related crimes, and a project to monitor the 
compliance of the UCPN-M party with the proper demobilization of former child soldiers 
from the Maoist Army, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1612 (2005).  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Impunity and transitional justice  
</b></p>
<p><b> A General overview 
</b></p>
<p>10. Under the 2006 Comprehensive Peace Agreement the parties committed to 
establishing transitional justice mechanisms to address the crimes and human rights 
violations perpetrated during the armed conflict, to maintain the rule of law and to 
guarantee that impunity will not be encouraged. Nevertheless, four years later, not a single 
individual has been successfully prosecuted by civilian courts for a conflict-related case, 
despite a long and well-documented list of allegations of violations and abuses committed 
by the parties to the armed conflict. Furthermore, impunity remains prevalent with regard to 
human rights violations committed since the end of the armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional and structural challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Political factors 
</b></p>
<p>11. Since the end of the conflict, successive governments and key political actors have 
repeatedly made public commitments to end impunity and improve law and order. In 
practice, principles of accountability and justice have been subordinate to political 
imperatives. 
</p>
<p>12. Although the Government has stated that a number of Army and police personnel 
have faced departmental and other actions for violations of the Military and Police Acts, 
respectively,3 steps taken to bring to justice individuals against whom there are credible 
allegations of human rights and international humanitarian law violations and abuses have 
been inadequate. In fact, a number of such persons have been promoted, and several have 
been sent to United Nations peacekeeping missions or to trainings abroad. In October 2010, 
the Government extended the tenure of an Army officer allegedly responsible for acts of 
torture and enforced disappearance at Maharajgunj barracks in 2003 and 2004. 
Furthermore, one of the main suspected perpetrators of similar violations in Bardiya district 
was promoted to a key post in the Army. To date the Government has taken no steps to 
repeal such decisions or to suspend the implicated State officials pending credible 
investigations. 
</p>
<p>13. The Nepalese Army has repeatedly refused to cooperate fully with police 
investigations and with orders from judicial authorities, including the Supreme Court. A 
key example remains the case regarding the torture and killing of 15-year-old Maina 
Sunuwar by four Nepalese Army officers in 2004.The Government reports that the verdict 
and statements from an Army court martial were submitted to the Supreme Court. 
However, the Army not only failed to comply with a September 2009 district court order to 
</p>
<p>  
 3 In its comments on the present report, the Government of Nepal reports that 169 Army personnel, 
</p>
<p>including officers, have faced punishments for violations of human rights and currently more than 
100 cases are under investigation. OHCHR-Nepal is seeking further details of these cases. </p>


<p>suspend from duty one of the accused, it also deployed the officer concerned to the United 
Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad. Although the officer was 
repatriated to Nepal in December 2009, the Nepalese Army has refused to hand him over to 
the police despite the existence of an arrest warrant. Similarly, the Nepalese Army has 
failed to cooperate with police investigations into a March 2010 incident, when Army 
personnel used unnecessary and illegal force in Bardiya National Park, killing two women 
and a child. 
</p>
<p>14. Similarly, there has been no genuine cooperation by the UCPN-M party or its sister 
organizations with police investigations into conflict or post-conflict cases that implicate 
party cadres. In September 2010, rather than cooperate with the police investigation into the 
killing of a businessman in 2007, UCPN-M instead merely suspended one of its central 
committee members. The party has also offered no support to the police investigation into 
the 2007 killing of journalist Birendra Shah despite reports that the main persons accused 
are actively participating in activities of organizations affiliated with the party. 
Furthermore, in the case of the killing of civilian Arjun Lama during the conflict, a UCPN-
M Constituent Assembly member, one of the main accused, has allegedly threatened 
lawyers and human rights defenders working on the case. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Delays in transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>15. One of the key impediments to the rule of law in Nepal, and a justification given for 
the absence of action on conflict-related crimes, is the belief of many political actors that 
the transitional justice mechanisms contemplated by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
are to be the de jure institutions to deal with conflict-related crimes, and that prior to their 
establishment no criminal action should be taken against alleged perpetrators of human 
rights or humanitarian law violations and abuses, and that decisions on their promotions or 
other rewarding measures should not be impeded. However, a commitment to establish 
transitional justice mechanisms cannot constitute an excuse for not investigating and 
prosecuting cases in accordance with the law. The Supreme Court has reiterated this 
principle through several decisions requiring immediate investigation and prosecution of 
serious human rights violations committed during the conflict, including enforced 
disappearances and extrajudicial executions. 
</p>
<p>16. Bills for the establishment of the relevant mechanisms &#8211; a truth and reconciliation 
commission and a commission of inquiry on disappearances &#8211; were introduced in 
Parliament in early 2010 following extensive consultation with stakeholders but remain 
pending before its legislative committee, which is considering more than 80 amendment 
proposals. Furthermore, in their current form the bills do not provide for mechanisms with 
prosecutorial powers or for the direct handover to the criminal justice system of those cases 
that reveal crimes under national or international law, limiting their competence to 
addressing such matters to the Attorney General. In reality the criminal justice system is 
paralysed pending the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms that themselves may 
not have the powers to take appropriate action on conflict crimes if laws are adopted as 
currently drafted. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Weakening of rule of law institutions </b></p>
<p>17. The prevalence of impunity has a negative effect on the criminal justice system and 
the administration of justice. Although the Supreme Court plays a positive role through 
important judgments on human rights cases, the failure to hold persons to account for 
serious crimes erodes public faith in the ability of rule of law institutions to enforce the law 
fairly and without political bias. Concurrently, the lack of accountability emboldens those 
who engage in criminal activity and the use of violence. </p>


<p>18. During the reporting period the Nepal Police remained unwilling to proceed with 
criminal investigations involving the Army, the Armed Police Force, members of the 
Maoist army or its own members as alleged perpetrators. Police officers consistently refer 
to the need for policy decisions at the highest level, refusing to proceed with investigations 
despite a clear legal process to be followed. Similarly, public prosecutors, responsible for 
advising the police on investigations and presenting cases to the courts, frequently fail to 
properly utilize established procedures to promote the proper conduct of investigations. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Withdrawal of criminal cases, pardon and clemency 
</b></p>
<p>19. The fact that principles of accountability and justice are increasingly subordinated to 
political imperatives is further illustrated by the large number of criminal cases withdrawn 
by the Government in recent years under pressure from various political parties and ethnic 
groups. 
</p>
<p>20. This practice began in 2008 with the initial justification that withdrawing &#8220;politically 
motivated&#8221; cases was required by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. However, it has 
since expanded to cases occurring after the conflict, with political parties, armed groups and 
indigenous and ethnic groups demanding that criminal cases against their supporters be 
withdrawn. Successive governments have agreed to withdraw cases under such pressure, 
including some carrying serious charges such as murder and rape, and have made proactive 
offers of amnesties while conducting negotiations with armed groups in the Terai. The 
practice has continued despite a Supreme Court interim order in 2008 directing the 
suspension of further withdrawals. 
</p>
<p>21. The practice encourages political interference in the rule of law, demoralizing police 
officials, prosecutors and judges working on such cases, contributing to public insecurity by 
allowing alleged criminals to escape prosecution, and further eroding public confidence in 
law and order institutions and the Government. It is also of concern that the Constituent 
Assembly has proposed a provision for the new Constitution allowing the President to grant 
pardons without specifically excluding clemency for persons who have committed serious 
human rights violations. The Government reports that the new draft criminal procedure 
code contains a number of restrictions in relation to withdrawal of cases. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Lack of an effective oversight mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>22. In countries emerging from conflict, reforming national security institutions is an 
important step in the transition to lasting peace and democracy, and a vital element in this 
regard is the establishment of credible and effective oversight mechanisms. However, the 
existing oversight mechanisms and processes in Nepal do little to challenge impunity. 
</p>
<p>23. In its summary of concerns on alleged extrajudicial killings perpetrated by security 
forces (see para. 8 above), OHCHR-Nepal found that committees and special courts formed 
to inquire into allegations often appeared to serve as instruments to cover up incidents. For 
example in June 2009, following a fatal shooting by a police officer in Dhanusha district, 
rather than investigating the incident in application of criminal law procedures, the police 
established a special court which merely imposed a financial disciplinary penalty on the 
accused police official. 
</p>
<p>24. The Ministry of Home Affairs also regularly establishes commissions of inquiry to 
investigate important incidents involving police personnel. However, these commissions 
have proven to be flawed on a number of levels: their members are often from the same 
police forces as those under investigation, creating significant conflicts of interest; the work 
of such commissions is not transparent; and their terms of reference and final reports are 
generally not made public. Similarly, a provision in the Army Act provides for court 
martial procedures that in effect prevent the further prosecution of human rights violations. </p>


<p>For example, the Army has consistently maintained that the decision of its court martial 
proceedings in the Maina Sunuwar case, which sentenced the responsible officers to 
temporary suspensions, constituted appropriate punishment. 
</p>
<p>25. Finally, the failure of the Government to implement National Human Rights 
Commission recommendations is also a significant obstacle to addressing impunity. In the 
10 years since its establishment, such recommendations have been fully implemented by 
government bodies in less than 9 per cent of cases and only to the extent of providing 
financial compensation to victims rather than leading to actual prosecutions. The 
Government reports that it has established a follow-up mechanism to improve the 
implementation rate of National Human Rights Commission decisions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Criminalization of international crimes 
</b></p>
<p>26. The domestic legal framework for prosecution of serious human rights violations 
and abuses remains inadequate. Serious human rights violations, such as torture, enforced 
disappearances, and crimes against humanity, which should be prosecuted in accordance to 
the State&#8217;s international legal obligations, are still not criminalized under Nepalese law. 
Nevertheless, the Government is currently drafting a comprehensive penal code with 
provisions criminalizing torture, enforced disappearances and crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>27. There have been some positive developments in relation to the criminalization of 
enforced disappearances, with a draft enforced disappearances bill introduced in Parliament 
in early 2010. Nevertheless, the draft is not fully in accordance with international standards 
and has yet to progress through Parliament. Furthermore, existing legislation fails to 
criminalize acts of torture and ill-treatment despite a Supreme Court ruling of 2007 
requiring this. The Government announced a new draft bill criminalizing torture, but the 
document was not made public or tabled before Parliament and there was no consultation 
during the drafting process. 
</p>
<p>28. Despite numerous civil society initiatives and a Parliamentary resolution adopted in 
2006 directing the Government to accede to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court, a proposal for accession has yet to be presented. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Establishment of transitional justice mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>29. Despite constitutional requirements and other commitments the transitional justice 
mechanisms have yet to be established. The Government&#8217;s early 2010 submission to 
Parliament of draft bills for the establishment of the two commissions constituted a positive 
step, but no further progress has been made, with both bills pending at the Legislative 
Committee stage. 
</p>
<p>30. Before submission to Parliament, the draft truth and reconciliation commission bill 
was revised following a series of public consultations held by the Ministry of Peace and 
Reconstruction in cooperation with OHCHR-Nepal. While notable improvements to the 
draft resulted, further changes remain necessary to bring it into line with relevant human 
rights standards, including the addition of provisions to ensure a transparent process for the 
selection of commissioners and the commission&#8217;s independent ability to appoint staff. 
Furthermore, the current text includes amnesty provisions which could undermine State 
obligations under international law to investigate and prosecute serious crimes under 
national or international law. The emphasis on a reconciliation approach may undermine 
the rights of victims and the need for protection of witnesses and victims. </p>


<p>31. The draft enforced disappearances bill submitted in early 2010 has been 
strengthened compared to previous drafts, including by taking into account 
recommendations submitted by OHCHR-Nepal and other organizations. However, it 
continues to show serious weaknesses with regard to the criminalization of the offence and 
the legal framework to establish a commission of inquiry on enforced disappearance. These 
weaknesses include the shifting of the burden of proof to the accused; a definition of the 
offence inconsistent with international law; inadequate sanctions which do not reflect the 
severity of the offence; a restrictive statutory limitation for the filing of complaints; and the 
failure to declare enforced disappearance as a crime against humanity. Regarding the future 
commission, the draft similarly fails to set out a transparent process for the selection of 
commissioners. The passage of strong and appropriate legislation and the rapid formation 
of the two transitional justice commissions remains a critical element of the peace process 
and should be prioritized and expedited. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The draft constitution 
</b></p>
<p>32. The ongoing constitution-making process offers a historic opportunity to build 
strong foundations for a State built on respect for human rights and justice, paving the way 
for dealing with past human rights violations and abuses, and building in guarantees for 
preventing the repetition of such acts. The section on fundamental rights in the current draft 
has a number of important strengths that can contribute greatly to the effective promotion 
and protection of human rights in Nepal. However, a number of contentious areas will need 
to be addressed during future debates in order to promote accountability within the 
framework of the future constitution. For example, the draft contains a general prohibition 
of retroactive criminal laws but fails to recognize an exception for international crimes, as 
permitted under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>33. The future constitution should also address the impermissibility of any measure 
which provides for de facto or de jure amnesties for serious crimes under national and 
international law, including pardons and the withdrawal of criminal charges, to protect the 
right of victims to an effective remedy and reparations, and to confirm the supremacy of 
civilian courts over all offences except those of a purely military nature. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The draft National Human Rights Commission act  
</b></p>
<p>34. The National Human Rights Commission of Nepal has the potential to play an 
important role in the fight against impunity, as demonstrated this year with the Dhanusha 
exhumation (see paras. 36-37 below). However, the Government has not yet committed to 
creating an institution able to effectively protect and promote human rights, and Parliament 
has yet to pass the necessary legislation for an effective functioning Commission. 
</p>
<p>35. A new draft law was registered by the Government at the Parliament in August 2009 
but has yet to progress further. While the Government has stated its commitment to making 
the Commission strong and vibrant, OHCHR-Nepal and the National Human Rights 
Commission have identified a number of concerns regarding the extent to which the draft 
provides a strong legal basis for a competent, independent and credible National Human 
Rights Commission in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national 
institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). For 
instance, the draft does not expressly establish an &#8220;independent and autonomous&#8221; 
institution and does not provide sufficient operational independence for the Commission, 
including the ability to directly recruit and appoint its own staff. In addition, the foreseen 
procedure of appointment of Commissioners is dominated by the executive branch, with no 
inclusive mechanism to ensure pluralistic representation among the Commissioners. 
Furthermore, the bill foresees a weak, advisory function of the National Human Rights </p>


<p>Commission rather than stipulating its recommendations as binding and does not obligate 
Parliament to consult with the Commission on draft laws with human rights implications. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Encouraging developments  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Dhanusha exhumation  
</b></p>
<p>36. In October 2003, five male students were reportedly disappeared by members of the 
security forces; credible allegations suggested that they had been killed and their bodies 
buried at a site in Dhanusha district. Despite persistent and continued efforts by the 
students&#8217; relatives to obtain justice, the police continued to oppose the registration of a 
criminal complaint until September 2009, and did so only after being instructed by the 
Supreme Court. The police had delayed undertaking the investigation despite detailed 
directions from the relevant public prosecutor, including on conducting an exhumation. 
</p>
<p>37. However, on 4 September 2010, nearly seven years after the incident, and following 
sustained advocacy with the Government, the National Human Rights Commission initiated 
an exhumation at the alleged burial site together with the police and international and 
national forensic experts, which led to the recovery of the remains of four human bodies 
and other pieces of evidence. It is expected that forensic examinations will clarify the fate 
of the victims. 
</p>
<p>38. This successful operation demonstrates the important role that the National Human 
Rights Commission can play in tackling impunity, lobbying for the police to properly 
discharge its legal function. The exhumation also establishes the precedent that future 
transitional justice mechanisms do not replace regular legal processes, emphasizing police 
obligations to undertake investigations into all such pending cases. This progressive step 
must now be built upon and the police investigation closely monitored to ensure that public 
prosecutorial instructions are complied with and perpetrators brought to justice. It is also 
critical that the National Human Rights Commission, with the support of relevant partners, 
is further empowered to perform its important role, including by properly clarifying its 
mandate regarding exhumations and the central role of the police in the conduct of such 
processes. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Assistance to future transitional justice mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>39. As it will have only two years to complete its work, it is crucial that once established 
the truth and reconciliation commission be in a position to plan its work promptly and with 
reference to objective data. Recognizing both the historic importance and technical 
demands of such a task, OHCHR-Nepal is implementing a project under the United Nations 
Peace Fund for Nepal to conduct a data-gathering, compilation and analysis exercise 
designed to assist the strategic planning and work of the commissions. 
</p>
<p>40. Having consulted with the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and with civil 
society, in 2010 a team of Nepali and international experts developed a data set of 
approximately 7,000 incidents from the conflict period where there is a reasonable basis for 
suspecting that serious violations and abuses of human rights or international humanitarian 
law have been committed. The compilation of disaggregated data distilled from reports by 
credible organizations, including OHCHR-Nepal, will provide the commissions with a tool 
that can be immediately used for strategic planning and for referencing to support 
investigations. The team has further compiled a reference archive of over 25,000 
documents relating to the conflict which may provide the basis for a national archive of 
materials. The exercise will culminate in a report providing the commissions with key 
information and research, including guidance on the applicable international law; factual 
information on the chains of command of the parties to the conflict; and chapters providing </p>


<p>case-based research and analysis of patterns and international law relevant to unlawful 
killings, disappearances, torture and sexual violence. 
</p>
<p><b> V. The fight against discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General overview 
</b></p>
<p>41. There continue to be considerable gaps in the enforcement and implementation of 
anti-discrimination laws; marginalized groups, including the Dalit4 caste, and victims of 
gender-based violence face many obstacles to access justice. Caste-based and ethnicity-
based discrimination in Nepal is broadly recognized as one of the root causes of the 10-year 
conflict, and such practices persist throughout Nepali society, particularly in less developed 
and more remote areas. The Government reports that it has increased expenditure on social 
measures at the local government level and  implemented awareness-raising programmes in 
addition to enforcing legal safeguards. Nevertheless, Dalits are often denied access to vital 
resources, such as public water taps, and to temples and other public places. Occupational 
segregation impairs Dalits&#8217; access to employment, restricting them to traditionally assigned 
jobs and creating societal bars to alternative employment. Those who oppose the practices 
not only face the risk of being further ostracized, but are also subjected to acts of violence. 
OHCHR-Nepal has catalogued examples of physical assaults, arson, forced displacement, 
sexual violence and labour exploitation targeting individuals who have opposed such 
traditional discriminatory practices. 
</p>
<p>42. Sexual and gender-based violence also remain prevalent in Nepal. While the 
Government, civil society and other stakeholders are placing greater focus on these issues, a 
number of factors, including religious and cultural customs, discriminatory legal provisions 
and a patriarchal institutional approach to the status of women, inhibit access to justice. 
Consequently OHCHR-Nepal has found that many alleged cases of gender-based violence 
are not even reported to the authorities concerned, as victims, fearing rejection by their 
family and reprisals, are unwilling to register a complaint. 
</p>
<p>43. The lack of access to justice for victims of caste-based discrimination and sexual and 
gender-based violence is often a result of the failure by State authorities to treat criminal 
cases in the manner prescribed by law, and the propensity to resort to &#8220;mediation&#8221; 
processes outside the criminal justice system. Such an approach contributes to widespread 
impunity for the perpetrators of discriminatory acts. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional and structural challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Lack of access to justice: failure to treat offences as criminal acts 
</b></p>
<p>44. Under current laws, caste-based discrimination constitutes a criminal offence, 
subject to imprisonment or fines, as do offences related to violence against women, 
including rape and the victimization of persons accused of practicing &#8220;witchcraft&#8221;. 
However, while discriminatory practices remain widespread across Nepal on grounds of 
caste, gender and sexuality, the paucity of prosecutions of these offences demonstrates both 
the lack of access to justice for victims and the failure on the part of State authorities, 
particularly the police, to adequately deal with such offences as crimes. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 According to beliefs in Hindu culture, Dalits are considered to be &#8220;impure and polluting&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>stigmatized as &#8220;untouchable&#8221;. </p>


<p>45. When prima facie evidence that a crime has been committed exists, the police are 
obliged to register a case of caste-based discrimination ex officio, even when no formal 
complaint is registered by a victim. However, the police usually require victims to provide 
direct testimony before they will consider registering a case, and even when a victim does 
come forward, the proper registration of the case by the police remains a challenge. For 
example, in September 2010 in Kanchanpur district a &#8220;higher caste&#8221; man allegedly 
subjected a Dalit woman to a serious assault and later burned down her house, destroying 
most of her family&#8217;s possessions, all because she was Dalit. Rather than investigate the 
case, the police sent the victim to the local administration to acquire written confirmation of 
the property destruction. The police only registered the case following the return of the 
victim&#8217;s husband to the village from abroad, and then only on public offence charges and 
not the more serious criminal charges of discrimination, arson and attempted rape. In 
November 2010, the alleged perpetrator set fire to what remained of the victim&#8217;s property, 
leaving two of her family members injured. 
</p>
<p>46. With regard to gender-based violence, both sexual assault and violence against 
women accused of practicing witchcraft are also criminal offences that require the police to 
register a case ex officio<i>. </i>However, instances of the police taking proactive steps in this 
regard are rare, and even when a victim manages to report a crime to the police, there are 
frequent examples of the police delaying the registration process, including by insisting 
upon a medical report, even though this is not a legal requirement for the registration of a 
case. In February 2010 a 10-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped in Kailali district; 
although a relative submitted a complaint to the police two days later, the case was not 
registered by the police within the 35-day statute of limitations period, and no criminal 
action was taken against the alleged perpetrator. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Further shortcomings in the criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p>47. In the rare instances where investigations or prosecutions are undertaken in 
discrimination cases, progress through the criminal justice system tends to be slow and 
ineffective. In some instances the shortcomings may be of a technical nature: for example, 
the lack of police officers trained to properly assist victims of gender-based violence and 
deal with cases involving caste-based discrimination. The actions of law enforcement 
officials reveal a lack of gender sensitization and a failure to follow due process of law. In 
the Nepali context, where traditional discriminatory practices have been accepted as a 
normal aspect of societal life for centuries, clear and detailed instructions and procedures 
for handling the issue, whether or not complaints have been submitted, are essential if 
progress is to be made. 
</p>
<p>48. In the rare instances which have led to a court decision, the perpetrators have rarely 
actually served a custodial sentence. This is largely due to the failure of the police to 
circulate arrest warrants or to take proactive steps to locate the perpetrators. For example, in 
a landmark ruling in January 2009 in Baitadi district, a person was found guilty of 
practicing untouchability and was sentenced to two years&#8217; imprisonment and fined. 
However, at the time of writing, more than 15 months after the verdict was upheld on 
appeal, the perpetrator not only remained at large, with his fine unpaid, but was actually 
nominated by a Government ministry to a public position. Two years after the district court 
judgment, the district police office had still failed to circulate arrest warrants to the police 
in other districts. Another perpetrator found guilty by the Baitadi district court in a similar 
case in March 2010 also remained unpunished at the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>49. The existence of national human rights institutions with specific mandates to focus 
on such issues, including the National Dalit Commission and the National Women 
Commission, as well as the National Human Rights Commission, presents additional 
possibilities for action to be taken to address issues of discrimination. However, while 2010 </p>


<p>has seen some positive developments in this regard, including efforts by the Dalit and 
Women&#8217;s Commissions to engage and respond to issues at the local level, all three 
Commissions remain significantly under-resourced and the implementation rate of their 
recommendations remains low. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Resort to measures beyond the criminal justice system: &#8220;mediation&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>50. Rather than register cases as required by law and initiate a formal criminal 
investigation, it is far more common for the police to encourage the victims or complainants 
to seek informal settlements to criminal discrimination cases, normally through a 
&#8220;mediation&#8221;. Although such processes take place outside the criminal justice system, it is 
usually the police or local authority figures who encourage victims to seek a settlement 
with the alleged perpetrator, often under pressure from local political parties, particularly if 
a party affiliate is involved. For example, in relation to the February 2010 rape of a 10-
year-old girl mentioned above (para. 46), upon pressure by local politicians (due to the 
affiliations of the perpetrator&#8217;s family) the case was settled through the informal payment of 
compensation following a mediation brokered by the district police office. In the 
discrimination case of attempted rape and arson of a Dalit woman reported above 
(para. 45), the victim received 40,000 Nepalese rupees as &#8220;compensation&#8221;, following 
mediation by the district police. The lack of clear guidance on the procedures for such cases 
certainly contributes to this practice, as do misguided beliefs that this is necessary to 
maintain &#8220;social harmony&#8221; within the community. 
</p>
<p>51. While the use of mediation mechanisms can complement the law in specific 
circumstances, in cases of serious criminal offences such as caste-based discrimination and 
gender-based violence, they contravene the criminal law of Nepal and the victim&#8217;s right to 
an effective remedy under international human rights law. As such these practices 
perpetuate a cycle of discrimination, violence, indignity and impunity. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Socio-economic and cultural barriers to justice 
</b></p>
<p>52. In addition to the role played by the authorities, there are numerous socio-economic 
and cultural barriers to accessing justice. Long-standing social taboos, fear of being 
ostracized within the community, lack of information, geographic remoteness and financial 
challenges deter victims from filing complaints with the police and seeking legal redress. 
</p>
<p>53. Victims of caste and gender-based discrimination are often from the poorest strata of 
Nepali society. They generally lack access to information regarding their rights and face 
inherent difficulties, including language barriers, in gaining access to the police authorities 
to initiate a criminal case. Furthermore, Dalits also face perceived or actual threats to their 
security when considering or undertaking action or challenging the discriminatory 
practices; most are trapped in unequal power relationships and a dependency on neighbours 
from higher castes. The risks of initiating action include social ostracism, economic boycott 
and actual physical violence. For example, in May 2010 a Dalit woman sustained serious 
head injuries in an attack by a higher-caste man over shared use of a public water tap. 
Furthermore, despite a 2008 government directive &#8220;freeing&#8221; <i>Haliyas</i> from their bonded 
labour relationships with landowners, many remain in the same debt labour agreements 
perpetuated for generations, fearing economic destitution if they leave. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Criminalization of caste-based discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>54. Both the Interim Constitution and the Civil Code criminalize discrimination on the 
basis of caste, penalizing, with an imprisonment or fine, acts that perpetuate untouchability. </p>


<p>Earlier legislation, such as the 1963 General Code, attempted to end caste-based 
discrimination; however, the current legal framework has proved inadequate to effectively 
curb caste-based discriminatory practices or to hold perpetrators to account. Due to the 
vagueness of the provision in the Civil Code, government officials fail to view specific acts 
of discrimination as crimes and consequently do not take appropriate action. The prescribed 
penalties and 35-day statutory limitation are insufficient, and there is no provision for the 
payment of compensation, despite this being a constitutional requirement. Although the 
Legal Aid Act provides for free legal aid and immediate relief for victims with limited 
financial resources, the Act is poorly enforced and in most cases the victims are unaware of 
such support. 
</p>
<p>55. In this light the submission of the draft bill on the elimination and punishment of 
caste-based discrimination and untouchability crimes to Parliament in July 2009 is a 
positive development towards properly codifying offences and the steps that must be taken. 
The draft bill details acts which amount to discrimination and criminalizes incitement to 
commit such offences and the obstruction of investigations, and increases punishment for 
perpetrators who hold public office and the compensation of victims. That said, aspects of 
the bill require strengthening for the act to be fully effective. OHCHR-Nepal has identified 
a number of recommendations that will strengthen the draft bill in line with international 
human rights law and best practices.5 These include: incorporating a full classification of 
acts that amount to discrimination, indicating the seriousness of each offence and 
prescribing punishments accordingly; detailing the specific role and responsibilities of the 
police with regard to undertaking investigations; extending the statute of limitation to at 
least one year to take into account the challenges in filing a complaint; and setting out 
positive State obligations to actively enforce the act, including the requirement to educate 
State officials and the general public about the act and the illegality of caste-based 
discriminatory practices. 
</p>
<p>56. While the National Dalit Commission has been operational since 2002, it was 
established on the basis of a governmental proclamation rather than through enabling 
legislation. The absence of a full-fledged legislative basis remains an additional obstacle to 
the proper development and functioning of a national mechanism for addressing caste-
based discriminatory practices. A draft bill was registered with the Parliament in July 2009 
but no progress has been made towards its adoption. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Gender-based discrimination and violence 
</b></p>
<p>57. In relation to sexual offences, Nepalese law definitions focus on &#8220;consent&#8221; rather 
than on acts committed, and limit such acts to penetrative sexual intercourse. Furthermore, 
the statute of limitations in the Civil Code remains 35 days from the date of the commission 
of the crime, a wholly inadequate time frame considering the gravity of the offence, lack of 
access to the criminal process for many and the cultural barriers to reporting such cases. 
The Supreme Court issued a directive order in 2008 to the Government to extend the statute 
of limitations, and while the Government reports that it is drafting a bill, this has yet to be 
finalized. 
</p>
<p>58. Legislation pertaining to acts of violence against persons accused of practicing 
witchcraft also remains inadequate despite amendments to the Civil Code in September 
2006 which classified such acts as a criminal offence. The provision fails to differentiate 
between the gravity of offences and does not provide redress for injury or loss suffered by 
victims. In response, the National Women Commission drafted a bill to criminalize and 
</p>
<p>  
 5 In its comments to the present report, the Government announced that suggestions for improving the 
</p>
<p>bill will be incorporated as appropriate. </p>


<p>punish such acts and submitted it to the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare 
in August 2010. The draft penal code further includes provisions criminalizing witchcraft 
and other gender-discriminatory social practices. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Encouraging developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Positive decisions by district courts in the Far West region of Nepal 
</b></p>
<p>59. The registrations of caste-based discrimination cases by the police, and 
groundbreaking court decisions in the Far West region, where discriminatory practices 
remain prevalent, represent encouraging developments. Such developments follow 
concerted advocacy by a coalition of human rights organizations, with the support of 
OHCHR, which engaged in joint missions and initiatives, including press statements, with 
the National Dalit Commission and civil society. 
</p>
<p>60. The Baitadi district court sent a strong message on the illegality of &#8220;untouchability&#8221; 
practices by issuing two decisions on caste-based discrimination cases in 2009 and 2010, in 
which they notably cited relevant international instruments. In neighbouring Darchula 
district, the court issued its first verdict on caste-based discrimination charges in July 2010 
and in Kanchanpur district, also in the Far West region, court proceedings are ongoing in 
another case relating to a May 2010 assault of a Dalit woman over access to water. District 
court decisions have also been upheld at the appellate court level in the region, with 
custodial sentences for perpetrators confirmed. 
</p>
<p>61. These steps are to a certain extent exceptions; nevertheless, they demonstrate the 
potential role of the criminal justice system in the fight against discriminatory practices and 
in curbing impunity. While significant problems remain &#8211; for example, only one perpetrator 
has actually served a custodial sentence to date &#8211; the activities of particular judges to 
implement anti-discrimination laws in remote areas, in the face of significant traditional 
societal pressures, should be commended and supported. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action by civil society and national institutions to address discriminatory practices 
</b></p>
<p>62. The development of civil society networks that focus on tackling discriminatory 
practices, often through innovative campaigns and targeted activities, has contributed both 
to improved understanding of the issues and to reducing specific discriminatory activities. 
In Baitadi district a group of 23 civil society organizations, known collectively as the Caste-
Based Discrimination Elimination Network, have been working together for more than 
three years in the fight against discrimination. Since a series of violent incidents during the 
<i>Dashain</i> religious festival in 2007, in relation to traditional practices performed by Dalits, 
the network has run awareness-raising campaigns and organized workshops for key actors 
in the district. Incidents reduced significantly in 2008 and 2009, and in 2010 no incidents 
were recorded. 
</p>
<p>63. During 2010 the National Women Commission and the National Dalit Commission 
also extended their engagement at the local level. The Dalit Commission has increased 
collaboration with local-level networks and the Women&#8217;s Commission has established a 
national network for the monitoring of women&#8217;s rights and is present in 30 districts to date. 
OHCHR-Nepal is supporting both commissions in strengthening these networks and their 
overall capacity to monitor and investigate human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Progressive decisions of the Supreme Court 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Supreme Court has recently delivered several important decisions on 
discrimination and gender-based violence cases, which contain clear directive orders to the 
Government to amend legislation accordingly. For example, in February 2010 it delivered a </p>


<p>decision requiring the establishment of fast-track courts to review cases involving violence 
against women and children and ordering the authorities to undertake steps necessary for 
the creation of such courts.  The Government has stated that a task force has been formed to 
implement the directive order for establishing fast-track courts. 
</p>
<p>65. The Supreme Court has also taken positive steps regarding the alleged gang-rape of 
a female police officer by colleagues in Achham district in September 2009. Although the 
District Attorney&#8217;s Office had decided not to prosecute three of the six alleged perpetrators, 
on 1 December 2010 the Supreme Court ordered the District Attorney&#8217;s Office to bring 
charges against those three suspects. In its decision, the Court emphasized that the power to 
halt criminal proceedings is limited by the victim&#8217;s right to an effective remedy, a decision 
that is significant for future reform of the criminal justice system. While the progressive 
judgments of the Supreme Court should be commended, the lack of progress in 
implementing decisions minimizes their impact. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Potential role of the Government in combating gender-based violence  
</b></p>
<p>66. Although legislation to criminalize domestic violence was enacted in 2009, it did not 
come into force until September 2010 when the Government finally passed the necessary 
regulations. As a result persons accused of domestic violence can now be tried and 
punished in court, although it remains to be seen whether the law will be properly 
implemented. 
</p>
<p>67. During 2010 the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers made 
progress in the implementation of the National Plan of Action on the Year against Gender-
based Violence, including: the establishment of gender-based violence desks in most 
districts; the establishment of service centres and community centres for the protection and 
rehabilitation of victims; the inclusion of the topic of gender-based violence into the police 
training curriculum; and the development of standard procedures, supported by civil society 
and OHCHR-Nepal, for the prevention of and response to gender-based violence by State 
actors, defining respective roles and responsibilities. The Government has finalized the 
National Plan of Action on Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820, making Nepal the 
first country in South Asia to take such a step. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Despite the political stalemate, Nepal has managed to preserve the main 
achievements of the peace process. While the Constituent Assembly failed to 
promulgate the constitution by May 2010, an agreement to extend the mandate was 
reached and suggestions of presidential rule or a declaration of a state of emergency 
did not materialize. Through the adoption of more conciliatory approaches, the 
political parties of Nepal would have all the elements necessary for the Constituent 
Assembly to complete its work by May 2011. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The present report raises significant concerns regarding the prevailing 
impunity for human rights violations and highlights the effect the political situation is 
having on progress towards human rights commitments. However, OHCHR-Nepal 
notes some progress in these areas, and the fact that important draft bills dealing with 
issues to address impunity and strengthen the national human rights protection 
mechanism are currently pending before Parliament. Initiatives taken by national 
human rights institutions and important decisions by the Supreme Court and courts 
at the local level demonstrate the potential role of an effective national protection 
system in curbing human rights violations and impunity. Similarly, efforts undertaken </b></p>


<p><b>by the Government to implement the national plans of action on gender-related issues 
should be commended.</b> 
</p>
<p>70. <b>Ensuring proper accountability for human rights violations will remove 
substantial obstacles to the enjoyment of human rights, foster the rule of law and 
ultimately strengthen democracy. With the necessary political will to design and 
implement practical policies and undertake concerted actions, and with law 
enforcement agencies that have the capacity and determination to fully discharge 
their legal duties, Nepal will be in a position to overcome the problem of impunity that 
undermines its institutions and the stability of the peace process. 
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The High Commissioner for Human Rights urges the political parties in the 
Constituent Assembly to make concrete progress on drafting the new constitution and 
to adopt important pending draft legislation consistent with the Government&#8217;s 
commitments under international law. The adoption of a new constitution and the 
bills for establishing transitional justice mechanisms should not be contingent on the 
resolution of other contentious political issues. Further legislative and practical 
measures are encouraged, including the adoption of comprehensive legislation 
criminalizing untouchability and the extension of the statute of limitation for rape. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Acknowledging the fundamental role played by national law enforcement 
bodies for the protection of human rights, the High Commissioner calls on the 
Government to ensure that the relevant actors conduct prompt, thorough and 
independent investigations into human rights violations, regardless of the status of 
suspected perpetrators. Prosecutions and criminal investigations into serious conflict-
related crimes should be continued regardless of the future establishment of 
transitional justice mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The High Commissioner calls upon the Nepalese Army and the Unified 
Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist to respect the rule of law and undertake efforts 
towards promoting accountability for violations committed during the conflict, in 
particular by respecting the independence of the judiciary and implementing its 
decisions. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>As a consequence of the large number of allegations of abuse against members 
of the security forces, the High Commissioner recommends the expeditious 
establishment of an external civilian oversight mechanism for the security forces. 
Similarly, the Government should enforce appropriate sanctions in cases where 
security forces fail to complete or cooperate with criminal investigations, to implement 
court decisions, or to implement the recommendations of national human rights 
institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The High Commissioner calls upon the Government to undertake further 
efforts to increase the capacity of all State bodies which form the criminal justice 
system, particularly regarding the proper conduct of criminal investigations, and to 
improve the understanding of situations in which the resort to informal justice 
mechanisms constitutes a violation of international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Office of the Attorney General fully 
discharge its legal obligation to supervise criminal investigations by the police. At the 
same time the Government should pursue its commitment to the independent and 
effective functioning of that Office. </b></p>


<p>77.<b> The High Commissioner encourages the Government to revise the draft bill on 
the National Human Rights Commission to provide a strong legal basis for a 
competent, independent and credible national institution in accordance with the Paris 
Principles, and to improve the rate of implementation of National Human Rights 
Commission decisions. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the Government to strengthen the key 
provisions of the draft bill on the elimination and punishment of caste-based 
discrimination and untouchability crimes in line with international standards, and to 
ensure its prompt passage. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The High Commissioner further requests the Government to implement its 
commitments to strengthen protection for victims of caste-based discrimination and 
sexual and gender-based violence, including by strengthening the National Women 
Commission and the National Dalit Commission, proceeding with draft legislation to 
make the latter a statutory authority, and ensuring access to justice and protection for 
victims and witnesses.
