<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as 
</p>
<p>well as other relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolution 7/25 on the prevention of genocide, 
</p>
<p>adopted on 28 March 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and 
</p>
<p>Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted on 9 December 1948 and succeeded by the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the next day, provides an 
</p>
<p>important opportunity for the international community to draw the attention of all States to 
</p>
<p>the significance of the Convention and to invite them to redouble their efforts in the 
</p>
<p>prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the crime of genocide is recognized in the Convention as an 
</p>
<p>odious scourge that has inflicted great losses on humanity, and that further international 
</p>
<p>cooperation is required to facilitate the timely prevention and punishment of the crime of 
</p>
<p>genocide, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> about the occurrence in recent history of genocide, recognized as 
</p>
<p>such by the international community, on the basis of and as defined in the Convention, and 
</p>
<p>bearing in mind that massive, serious and systematic violations of human rights and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law might result in genocide,  
</p>
<p> <i>Taking into consideration </i>that States parties to the Convention on the Non-
</p>
<p>Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> &#61482; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of

</p>
<p>factor in their prevention,

<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the significant progress made by the international community in the 
</p>
<p>past sixty five years, including within the United Nations system, in developing relevant

<p>relevant international criminal tribunals in helping to increase accountability for the crime

</p>
<p>address situations of violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations,
