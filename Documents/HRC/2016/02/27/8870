<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>The present report is the second of a series of reports that the Special Rapporteur is 
presenting to the Human Rights Council to assess the status of implementation of 
recommendations elaborated by the previous Special Rapporteur in the framework of the country 
missions he conducted.  
</p>
<p>This report focuses on three countries to which missions were conducted in 2004 and 2005: 
Brazil, Cambodia and Kenya. For each country, the Special Rapporteur presents a summary of 
information received from the Government, United Nations entities and non-governmental 
organizations. At the end of each country section, the Special Rapporteur formulates some 
recommendations based on the analysis of the information received.  
</p>
<p>Recognising significant differences amongst the situations assessed, the Special 
Rapporteur concludes her report with general observations based on the trends she identified 
concerning the status of implementation of the recommendations formulated by her predecessor. 
Although a rights-based approach has been incorporated into new legislation and policies or 
programmes, practices in housing and urban policies sometimes fail to enforce those principles. 
The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages all those involved in housing, whether at national or 
international level, to seek the incorporation of a human rights approach into their policies and, 
particularly, the right to adequate housing into housing and urban policies. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1.  This report is presented in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 6/27. When 
taking her position, the current mandate holder, Ms. Raquel Rolnik, decided to build upon and 
continue the work of her predecessor, Mr. Miloon Kothari, by using the wealth of information 
and experience accumulated since the inception of the mandate. 
</p>
<p>2. In this context, the Special Rapporteur decided to assess the implementation of 
recommendations as a result of missions conducted by the mandate. This report represents the 
second of a series that will fulfil such a purpose and focuses on three countries in which missions 
were conducted in 2004 and 2005, Brazil, Cambodia and Kenya. The report draws on 
information and comments provided by a range of sources, including the concerned States, 
United Nations agencies and civil society. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her gratitude to the Governments of Brazil and 
Kenya as well as to all the actors in Brazil, Cambodia and Kenya that have contributed with 
information and comments to this report. She regrets having received no comments from the 
Government of Cambodia.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur hopes that this exercise will also serve the States, United Nations 
agencies and civil society to assess the progress that has been made in the field of the right to 
adequate housing in the concerned countries. The Special Rapporteur also hopes that these 
assessments, combined with the observations of treaty bodies and other review mechanisms such 
as the universal periodic review will provide useful indications on the implementation of human 
rights, including the right to adequate housing, and on issues that need to be further addressed. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  BRAZIL 
</b></p>
<p>5. The previous mandate holder, Mr. Miloon Kothari, visited Brazil from 29 May to 13 June 
</p><p>2004. He presented his mission report at the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights in 
2005, under document number E/CN.4/2005/48/Add.3. 
</p>
<p>6. The current Special Rapporteur, Ms. Raquel Rolnik, wishes to express her appreciation for 
the information that was provided to her by the Brazilian authorities and by organizations of civil 
society and other relevant actors.  
</p>
<p>7. Recommendation <b>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Office of the Public 
Defender be strengthened so that it can better attend to demands from the vulnerable for 
the protection of their rights. The Special Rapporteur also notes that according to the law 
the institution of the Public Defender should be established in all states, and he urges the 
three remaining states that have not complied with this provision to do so&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 55)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 5 
</p><p> 
9. Information provided by other sources states that, Constitutional Amendment No. 45 was 
adopted in December 2004, granting administrative, functional and financial autonomy to Public 
Defender Offices. In this regard, figures from the Ministry of Justice show that while 31.8 per 
cent of the Public Defender Offices had resources to fund the institution in 2003; such 
percentage rose to 56 per-cent in 2005.  
</p>
<p>10. However, the number of Judicial Districts in Brazil that are served by the Public Defender 
Office only amounts to 39.7 per cent. Installation of Public Defender Offices is still pending in 
the states of Paran&#225;, Santa Catarina and Goi&#225;s. In the case of the State of Goi&#225;s, a state law 
already exists providing for the creation of a Public Defender Office but it has not yet been 
implemented.  
</p>
<p>11. Law 11.448 adopted in January 2007, recognizes the Public Defender Office as a party 
entitled to bring a public-interest civil action before the judiciary. However, the National 
Association of the Public Attorney's Office has challenged this guarantee and has filled an 
unconstitutionality action, on the allegation that this faculty &quot;directly affects&quot; the attributions of 
the Public Attorney's Office.   
</p>
<p>12. Recommendation<b> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur would like to further recommend that the 
Government, in addressing the housing and living conditions of all Quilombola 
communities in Brazil, follow the human rights provisions of the Constitution and 
international human rights law, as well as the guidance offered by general recommendation 
XXIX on descent of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.&#8221; 
</b>(paragraph 78) 
</p>
<p>13. Information provided by the Government indicates that the registration of Quilombola 
territories and the recognition of ethnic rights is a duty of the State set out in the Constitution. In 
addition, Article 68 of the Ato das Disposi&#231;oes Constitucionais Transitorias of the Federal 
Constitution expressly recognizes the right of the Quilombola communities to ownership over 
the lands they traditionally occupied. Furthermore, Decrees No. 4877 and 4887 of 2003 govern 
the procedure for identification, recognition, delimitation, demarcation and titling of lands 
occupied by the Quilombola communities, and establishes jurisdiction over these activities to the 
Ministry of Agrarian Development, in particular to the National Institute of Colonization and 
Agrarian Reform (INCRA). Since September 2008, the Normative Instruction INCRA No. 49 of 
September 2008 regulates all procedures relating to the titling of Quilombola lands. 
</p>
<p>14. Currently, there are 851 administrative processes of land regularization in Quilombolas 
opened. In addition, 45 ordinances of recognition of Quilombola communities have been 
published, covering a total area of 225,821.41 hectares that benefit 4,015 families. Moreover, 38 
collective titles were issued on behalf of the associations that legally represent the Quilombola 
communities, covering a total area of 303,827.19 hectares and benefiting 3,334 families. Finally, 
the Coordena&#231;&#227;o General de Regulariza&#231;&#227;o de Territ&#243;rios Quilombola estimates that in 2009, 11 
titles will be issued, covering a total area of 19,959.79 hectares and benefiting 885 families. It 
also envisages the issuance of 38 expropriation decrees covering a total area of 453,447.06 
hectares and affecting 4,863 families.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 6 
</p><p> 
15. Information provided by other sources indicates that although the Brazilian Constitution 
and national legislation guarantee property rights of Quilombola communities over their 
ancestral territories and regulates the process for their demarcation and registration, these norms 
have not been properly implemented by the Government. These deficiencies appear to be the 
result of institutional, operational, technical and financial difficulties. The Special Rapporteur 
has been informed that Normative Instruction INCRA No. 49 highly increases the bureaucracy 
involved in the titling processes. She was also informed that Government officials regularly 
disregard judicial orders determining the demarcation and registration of Quilombola territories.  
</p>
<p>16. As a result of the institutional deficiencies, Quilombolas communities are routinely 
subjected to the threat of eviction from their lands, most particularly by land owners, mining 
companies and private developers. Consequently, Quilombolas communities continue to be 
deprived of their natural resources and the means for their economic subsistence. Their traditions 
and cultural identity are largely damaged, and they are subject to further impoverishment, social 
exclusion and human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>17. Recommendation<b> &#8220;In order to ensure a holistic implementation of the right to 
adequate housing, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive national housing policy 
encompassing both urban and rural considerations, and equally comprehensive national 
housing legislation binding together existing laws and programmes. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the development of the new National Housing Policy but reminds 
the Government that such an overarching instrument needs to incorporate relevant 
international human rights law and reflect relevant general comments and general 
recommendations issued by human rights treaty monitoring bodies. In this regard, the 
Government should consider elaborating a housing allowance scheme to provide for 
housing improvements for the poorest segments of society. The Special Rapporteur 
supports the use of the Workers Guarantee Fund to provide resources to the National 
Popular Housing Fund, and also recommends that the Ministry of Cities and the National 
Cities Council have the competence to determine the use of resources from the Fund&#8221;. 
</b>(paragraph 80)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>18. Information provided by the Government indicates that the 3rd National Plan for Human 
Rights was launched in October 2009 and included policies related to the right to adequate 
housing. Guideline 3 of chapter III of the National Plan includes as one of its strategic objectives 
the guarantee of access to land and housing for low-income populations and vulnerable social 
groups. It also sets out a number of programmatic actions with a view to its realization. 
</p>
<p>19. In 2005, an institutional structuring process to design a housing policy began in Brazil with 
the creation of the National Social Interest Housing System (NSIHS) and its complementary 
policies: the National Social Interest Housing Fund, the Managing Board for this fund, and the 
National Social Interest Housing Plan.  
</p>
<p>20. In June 2005, Federal Law 11,124 established the NSIHS to facilitate the access to land 
and adequate housing by the low-income population, in particular through the allocation of 
subsidies. The NSIHS creates an articulated housing system composed of an executive public 
authority, the Ministry of Cities, the Federal Savings Bank, the National City Council, the National 
Social Housing Fund, municipal and state housing councils, and housing cooperatives and 
community associations. The logic behind the NSIHS is one of decentralization and encompasses </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
the transfer of funds from the National Fund to states, federal districts and municipalities. To 
secure adhesion, the NSHIS requires states and municipalities to create local funds, councils and 
housing plans, in conformity with the National Housing Policy.  
</p>
<p>21. The National Social Interest Housing Fund (NSIHF) was also created in 2005, with an 
annual budget of approximately one billion dollars for urbanization and housing projects for low-
income populations. Apart form the NSIHF, some programmes were established for the 
construction, acquisition and improvement of housing: (a) the Social Interest Housing 
Programme that complements the financial capacity of individuals with monthly income of up to 
three minimum wages and benefited 175,000 families in the quadrennial 2003-2006 and 44,000 
families in 2006; (b) the Housing Lease Programme that offers residential leases with the option 
to purchase and supported the construction of 895 projects between 2003 and 2006, benefiting 
40,250 families in 2006; and (c) the Programmes for Individual and Collective Letters of Credit 
that use resources for housing projects from the Time of Service Guarantee Fund, and 
benefited 1.1 million families in the quadrennial 2003-2006 and 360,000 families in 2006.  
</p>
<p>22. With a view to assisting municipalities in the elaboration of plans for social interest 
housing, the NSIHS and the NSIHF also provide resources for capacity building programmes. 
According to official data, 1,545 local housing plans of municipalities and states are supported 
by these funds. 
</p>
<p>23. Information provided by the Government indicates that 5,095 municipalities have joined 
the NSIHS. Of this total, 2,058 federal entities have already established municipal housing funds 
and councils, and are fully entitled to access the resources of the NSIHF. Thus, the 
implementation of the NSIHS helped strengthening federal coordination, articulating 
programmes and resources among governmental spheres, aligning public action with a 
synchronized housing policy, and strengthening the institutional sector. However, some 
challenges have been identified by national authorities with regards to the NSIHS, such as the 
low institutional capacity in the housing sector of a significant part of the local entities and the 
limitations faced by many municipalities in the development and implementation of planning 
activities and housing assistance. Likewise, information provided by other sources indicates that 
the practice is far from the theory with regards to the NSIHS. As a consequence of a lack of 
compliance with the established regulations or as a result of the cumbersome bureaucracy 
involved in the transfer of funds from the federal government, many municipalities and states 
have found it difficult to access the resources of the funds. In addition, most programs using 
resources from the Workers Guarantee Funds, which is the main financial source for housing, 
bare no connection with the NSIHS and are managed outside of it. In 2009, less than 10 percent 
of the total funds related to housing were channelled through the NSIHS. 
</p>
<p>24. In 2007, the Brazilian authorities began the preparation of the National Social Interest 
Housing Plan, which was presented to the National Council of the Cities in December 2008. 
Also in 2007, the Government launched the Growth Acceleration Programme (GAP) which 
establishes a set of economic policies to accelerate economic growth in Brazil. Amongst other 
measures, the GAP encompasses the construction of adequate housing for the low-income 
populations as well as the urbanization of <i>favelas</i>.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 8 
</p><p> 
25. As a further stage in the implementation and consolidation of the National Housing Policy, 
in 2007 the Brazilian Government initiated the elaboration of a National Housing Plan 
(PlanHab). The PlanHab guides the planning of public and private actions in order to better 
target existing resources to cope with the housing needs of the country. It aims at articulating the 
government agencies to overcome the dispersion of actions and funds in the housing field. 
Accordingly, the PlanHab establishes some possible investment scenarios until 2023 and defines 
four strategic axes of action: the stimulus of the civil construction chain, the establishment of a 
new model for subsidies and funding, the strengthening of institutional development with a view 
to guaranteeing an efficient performance by NSIHS agents, and the strengthening of the urban 
and rural policy of municipalities. Governmental sources indicate that the PlanHab was 
elaborated following an intense participatory process. 
</p>
<p>26. In order to address the impact of the economic crisis of 2008, the My Home, My Life 
Programme was launched by the Brazilian Government aiming at the reduction of the housing 
deficit in the country by 14 per cent. Created in 2009, the programme envisages the construction, 
in partnership with states, municipalities and private companies, of 1 million homes for families 
with incomes of up to 10 minimum wages. The programme expands access to credit for low and 
middle income population and encourages the participation of the private sector in the low-
income housing market. It is intended as an anti-cyclical measure to combat the effects of the 
crisis in the Brazilian economy and tackle unemployment by boosting the civil construction 
market. Thus, the programme has a key role in job creation and improvement of socio-economic 
indicators. According to information provided by national authorities, the new programme has 
some substantive improvements, such as: (a) a large number of subsidies are available, specially 
for the lowest income families; (b) the establishment of procedures to simplify and expedite the 
regularization of land in urban settlements; (c) the establishment of the Guarantee Fund to cover 
expenses in case of default; and (d) the facilitation of the registry of properties on behalf of 
women. The programme also addresses land regularization and sets out the role of municipalities 
in the elaboration of a regularization project. Finally, the programme simplifies the bureaucratic 
procedures for the acquisition of houses and subsidizes its costs. 
</p>
<p>27. Information provided by other sources state that the programme establishes a direct 
relationship between the Government and private developers, and entrusts the local authorities 
with the duty of organizing the construction demand for the low-income populations. It is further 
reported that the My Home My Life Programme may prioritize an emergency and quantitative 
criteria above an urban, social and environmental criteria that is better suited for the 
implementation of a housing policy. Moreover, it is reported that there is no coordination 
between the My Home My Life Programme and the overall logic of the NSIHS. Since significant 
resources were allocated to this programme, without adopting an accountability mechanism, 
promoting a harmonization of subsidies, or implementing any other good practices of the 
NSIHS, concerns have been expressed that the tendency of municipalities and state governments 
has been to abandon institutional investments in the NSHIS in favour of the new programme. 
Moreover, the programme does not include a land and urban strategy. As a result, there is risk of 
directing the investments towards the demands of the civil construction sector rather than 
towards the demands of the most needed (i.e.: low-income populations, risk areas and informal 
settlements). Finally, although the National Plan for Housing (PLANHAB) was ready to be 
launched by the end of 2008, the program &#8220;My Home, My Life&#8221; did not take into account its 
recommendations and strategies. </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 9 
</p><p> 
28. With regards to urban development, a National Urban Development Policy has been 
developed by the Brazilian Government to guide public and private actions in the management 
of cities. Subsequently, the Ministry of Cities and state and municipal Councils of Cities were 
created to formulate and articulate urban development policies. Since July 2008, a bill is being 
drafted to create a National Urban Development System to articulate the National Urban 
Development Policy with state and municipal urban development policies, through 
decentralized, regional and participatory mechanisms. Finally, the Programme for the 
Strengthening of Urban Management has been established by the Ministry of Cities to improve 
the technical and institutional capacities of municipalities in the areas of planning, urban services 
and land administration. 
</p>
<p>29. Information provided by other sources indicates that the National Urban Development 
Policy is only a declaration of principles and intentions, and that the real process of investment 
allocation and decision did not change with the establishment of the National Council at the 
federal level. The information received also points out that although Brazil has developed a 
broad range of housing policies and norms that incorporate relevant international human rights 
standards in the right to adequate housing, these developments have not always resulted in more 
or better access to adequate housing and land by the low-income population. The dispersion of 
policies and norms related to housing, the diffusion of funds, as well as the institutional 
framework which have not changed with the establishment of the Ministry of Cities, have 
hindered the proper implementation of these measures and the actual realization of the right to 
adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>30. Recommendation<b> &#8220;The process of land and agrarian reform needs to be enhanced, 
including through the allocation of adequate resources for the Urbanization, 
Regularization and Integration of Precarious Settlements Programme created to help 
municipalities carry out their land regularization programmes. Legislation that deals with 
different forms of tenure and land title must be revised in a way that will harmonize and 
simplify the issuance of title deeds, including in informal urban and rural settlements, 
indigenous lands and Quilombola communities. The Special Rapporteur supports 
recommendations previously made by other actors, including the Special Rapporteur on 
the right to food (see E/CN.4/2004/Add.1), indicating that there is an urgent need to speed 
up agrarian reform and related processes for expropriation and the granting of land titles. 
The Special Rapporteur recommends that an inter-ministerial task force be established 
specifically to address the issues of redistribution of land and appropriation of large land 
holdings in accordance with constitutional provisions that guarantee the social function of 
land&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 80)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>31. Information provided by the Government indicates that a framework of actions was 
adopted by the Government itself with a view to promoting the advancement of land reform in 
the country. The Second National Plan for Land Reform was created in 2003 to promote a 
balanced occupation of the territory. The National Institute of Colonization and Land Reform is 
the federal agency responsible for land planning and for implementing land reform policies. In 
particular, it is responsible for the allotment of land and credit to workers and indigenous 
communities selected to join the National Plan for Land Reform.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 10 
</p><p> 
32. The activities of land regularization adopted by the government focus primarily on the 
occupants of the land with no titles or belonging to indigenous and Quilombolas communities. 
They aim at a proper allocation of land to its occupants and the provision of legal stability. In 
May 2007, the Federal Legislature approved Provisional Measure No. 335/06 (Federal Law No. 
11.481) that regulates the use, occupation and regularization of land belonging to the Federal 
Government. In addition, joint actions were undertaken between the Federal Government and 
state governments aimed at the geo-registration and titling of property in public areas of the 
states. These activities were undertaken in 10 states and more than 100 municipalities, generating 
more than 100,000 titles for the period 2008-2010. Furthermore, the Federal law 11,977, of July 
2009, facilitates the expropriation and settlement of idle lands for social interest housing, through 
urban demarcation and legitimating of ownership. Lastly, governmental sources indicate that the 
Ministry of Cities has adopted a range of measures to improve access to urban land, such as: the 
removal of legal bottlenecks in land regularization processes, the support to land regularization 
actions taken by public defenders and municipal or state officials, the designation of a Federal 
Real Estate for social housing purposes, the creation of the NSIHS and the NSIHF, and the 
investments made through the Growth Acceleration Programme. 
</p>
<p>33. With regards to the regularization, integration and prevention of precarious settlements, 
resources from the Growth Acceleration Programme are allocated to the upgrading and 
integration of slums. In addition, the following programmes are currently underway: (a) the 
Programme for the Urbanization, Land Regularization and Integration of Settlements, which 
seeks to improve housing conditions in settlements and have offered funding for home 
improvement to more than 100 thousand families between 2003-2006; (b) the Papel Passado 
Programme, which facilitated the regularization process in 26 states and 300 municipalities, 
benefiting an estimated of 1.3 million families living in 2,231 settlements; and (c) the Pro-
Housing Programme, which facilitates access to adequate housing for people with a monthly 
household income of up to R$ 1,050.  
</p>
<p>34. Information provided by other sources states that despite the efforts made by the 
Government with regards to land regularization and reform, there are major problems in the 
current process of distribution of public land and large numbers of people in the country still lack 
access to land. Moreover, the recent launching of a new Land Census indicates that properties 
are more concentrated today than they were ten years ago (Censo Agricola 2006). 
</p>
<p>35. Land concentration in Brazil remains extraordinary high. According to information 
received from different non-governmental sources, the total area correspondent to rural land 
private properties registered in INCRA is approximately 420 million hectare. A further 200 
million hectare are public rural areas, 102 million hectare are environmental reserves, and 128 
million hectare are declared indigenous lands. Out of the 4,2 million rural properties registered, 
2,4 million properties are smaller than 25 hectare (57,6 per cent) and take a whole extension of 
26,7 million hectare (6 per cent of total area). Properties over 1,000 hectare are less than 70,000 
(1,6 per cent of total rural properties) and take a land extension equivalent to 183 million hectare 
(43,5 per cent of total area registered).  
</p>
<p>36. In its Concluding Observations on Brazil (E/C.12/BRA/CO/2, 2009), the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressed its concern at &#8220;the slow progress in the land 
reform process notwithstanding the Constitutional rights to property and self-determination, as 
well as the enactment of legislation to facilitate the demarcation of land belonging to the </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
indigenous peoples, the State party&#8217;s adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples (2007) and its ratification of the ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and 
Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>37. Brazil&#8217;s Chamber of Deputies is in the process of approving a new national legislation 
(Law No. 3057/2000) on territorial responsibility. As the current legislation on the matter 
(Federal Law No. 6.766/1979) is out of date, the approval of the new bill is considered a 
fundamental step for regulating land parcelling, acquisition, regularization, administration and 
titling. It is important that the new law tackles the access to urban land for the low-income 
populations as part of the responsibilities of private developers in expanding and creating new 
urban spaces. 
</p>
<p>38. Recommendation<b> &#8220;Housing policies and programmes, including housing finance 
schemes, should strengthen their focus on the poor and vulnerable segments of the 
population. A reduction of the budgetary surplus target would release funds to ensure the 
progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights, including housing, for the 
very poor, while still respecting surplus conditions imposed by international financial 
institutions&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 80) 
</p>
<p>39. As indicated in paragraphs 18 to 28, a number of programmes and funds have been 
elaborated by the Brazilian government in response to the housing deficit in the country using 
budgetary surplus and increasing the number of available subsidies. Many of those programmes 
particularly addressed the housing situation of the poor and vulnerable segments of the 
population, such as: (a) the Growth Acceleration Programme, which encompasses the 
construction of adequate housing and the urbanization of <i>favelas</i>; (b) the National Social Interest 
Housing System (NSIHS), which facilitates the access to land and adequate housing by low 
income populations; (c) the National Social Interest Housing Fund (NSIHF), intended for the 
construction of housing for low-income populations; (d) the programmes for construction, 
acquisition and improvement of houses framed within the NSIHF -the Social Interest Housing 
Programme, the Housing Lease Programme and the Programmes of Collective and Individual 
Letter of Credits-; (e) the My Home My Life programme that targets populations with income 
ranges from 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 10 minimum wages; and (f) the programmes for the 
urbanization, regularization and integration of settlements -the Programme for the Urbanization, 
Land Regularization and Integration of Settlements, the Papel Passado Programme, and the Pro-
Housing Programme. 
</p>
<p>40. Information provided by other sources highlight the importance of these programmes but 
consider that there is no proper coordination amongst them, particularly between the My Home 
My Life programme and the other federal programmes composing the National Housing Policy. 
In addition, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the existing funds are often tied to 
contingencies and that there is no clear obligation on the part of the federal, state or municipal 
authorities to set aside funds for the production of housing for low-income populations. The land 
regularization programme, Papel Passado<i>,</i> has no budget allocation and was partly abandoned by 
the government, despite the fact that a great amount of subsidized resources were allocated to the 
urbanization of informal settlements. </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2

41. Recommendation<b> &#8220;Urgent attention must be given to those living in distressed housing 
and living conditions, including the homeless, slum dwellers, and families living in 
temporary rural camps (<i>acampamentos</i>) without basic amenities pending the allocation of 
land. The Government, in addition to programmes such as the National Programme to 
Support Sustainable Land Regularization and the Rural Housing Programme, may wish to 
elaborate a national policy on the regularization of land occupations&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 80)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>42. Information provided by the Government indicates the policies adopted by the Government 
to respond to the housing needs of people living in distressed housing and living conditions in 
Brazil. Indeed, there is currently a range of public policies addressing social housing, land 
regularization and slum upgrading, as noted above. Official information indicates that the 
housing deficit in Brazil decreased from 16.1 per cent to 14.9 per cent in the period 2000 to 
2005, and the proportion of urban households with appropriate conditions of housing grew from 
49 per cent in 1992 to 61.5 per cent in 2005.  
</p>
<p>43. However, information provided by other sources indicates that a significant segment of the 
Brazilian population still lives in substandard housing, including precarious settlements. The 
federal government estimates that 12.4 million people live in precarious conditions in 3.2 million 
houses, both in rural and urban areas. 
</p>
<p>44. With regards to forced evictions, the Special Rapporteur was informed that in 2006, the 
Ministry of Cities, in coordination with the National City Council, approved Administrative Rule 
No. 587 establishing a procedure within the Federal Government to process information on 
forced evictions. In addition, the National Secretariat of Urban Programmes will be responsible 
for articulating diverse institutional mechanisms in order to achieve a negotiated solution for 
land conflicts. National legislation has also been reformulated in order to provide legal 
instruments for the protection and compensation of people against forced evictions, such as the 
Procedural Civil Code and the City Statute. 
</p>
<p>45. Nevertheless, many concerns have been raised regarding the massive and violent forced 
evictions that continue to take place in Brazil. According to the information received from non-
governmental sources, numerous evictions are carried out without prior consultation or adequate 
notice with members of the affected communities. Evictions increased due to the augment of 
investments in infrastructure (as part of the Growth Acceleration Programme). The low-income 
population and peasants continue to be routinely subject to forced evictions, as well as easily 
convicted for occupying empty plots and unproductive rural land, or for being homeless. 
Furthermore, the right to adequate housing is not fully integrated in the agenda of infrastructure 
and urbanization projects, nor is it included in the informal settlements upgrading program, 
which sometimes includes, resettlements and relocations. 
</p>
<p>46. Non governmental sources also indicate that a practice of forced evictions has been 
solidifying in Sao Paulo, as a result of real estate investment and the implementation of 
development-based projects. Although the municipal master plan (Law No. 13.430 of 2002) 
assigned a few zones of special social interest for the construction of social housing and slum 
upgrading projects, many of them have been subject to legislative review because they are </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 13 
 
located in valuable central areas. Furthermore, compensations for these evictions do not reach all 
affected families. When they do, the compensation does not suffice to cover the costs of renting 
or purchasing property in the city of S&#227;o Paulo. As a result, affected families are forced to be 
resettled in irregular sites, such as <i>favelas</i> or areas of environmental preservation.  
</p>
<p>47. Urban reforms aimed at the beautification and renovation of down town areas, have also 
led to the resettlement in insalubrious peripheries of Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Boa Vista. 
Mass and violent forced evictions were denunciated in 2005 in the Sonho Real settlement, in 
Goiania, where 4,000 families were forcibly evicted, two people were shot dead, 100 people 
were injured, and 800 people were arrested. Likewise, 1,000 families (approximately 6,000 
persons) were evicted in the private urban area of Fazendinha (Curitiba) in 2008. In Manaus, 
slum upgrading projects funded by the Inter-American Development Bank resulted in the 
relocation of local families away from the city. 
</p>
<p>48. The living conditions of homeless persons in Sao Paulo have considerably deteriorated 
owing to the closure of shelters, particularly in the centre of town. Furthermore, homeless 
persons and people working recycling garbage are subject to discriminatory practices such as 
water flushing, amongst others.  
</p>
<p>49. Overall, the living and housing conditions of the poor and vulnerable segments of society 
in Brazil seems to be further deteriorating since 2004. In its 2009 report, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted with concern that &#8220;more than 6 million people in the 
State party live in precarious urban settlements, that there is a large number of homeless people 
and that significant migration inflows into urban areas have exacerbated the housing shortage&#8221;. 
The Committee expressed further concern about the absence of adequate measures to provide 
social housing for low-income families and vulnerable groups, while acknowledging the efforts 
of the State party in this regard. 
</p>
<p>50. Recommendation<b> &#8220;The Government should proceed with utmost caution regarding 
privatization of housing and essential services related to the enjoyment of the right to 
adequate housing, such as water, electricity and sanitation. Protective measures and 
guarantees must be established to ensure that the National Programme of Privatization 
does not compromise human rights, in particular those of minorities, women and the 
poor&#8221;.</b> (paragraph 80)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future.  
</p>
<p>52. With regards to the effect of privatizations in the sanitation sector, information provided by 
other sources indicates that the approval, in 2007, of Law No. 11445 constitutes a significant 
improvement in the field of sanitation. It establishes the general guidelines for basic sanitation 
services, and contains several provisions regarding regulation, transparency, social control and 
popular participation in the activities of public and private sanitation providers. However, the 
decree has not yet been enacted and its implementation is still pending. </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 14 
</p><p> 
53. A study on sanitation conducted by the Ministry of Cities points to a lack of transparency 
and low accountability levels in the revision of rates for sanitation services. It also indicates that 
in only 38 per cent of the cases, the application of social rates was identified for low-income 
users.  
</p>
<p>54. Furthermore, the study points to the possible occurrence of economic-based discrimination 
in the access to the connections. Only 62 per cent of the 450,000 indigenous in the country have 
access to enough and safe water and only 23 per cent have access to sewerage. An investigation 
conducted in 60 Quilombola communities showed that only 30 per cent of the dwellings were 
connected to a water supply system and 67 per cent of them were not in proper sanitation 
conditions, 46 per cent of which were in direct contact with open air sewerage. Furthermore, 
discrimination in the access to basic sanitation services strongly affects informal or precarious 
settlements, where the authority's refusal to perform the connection to water supplies and 
sewerage to families with no property title. In addition, the use of mechanisms such as prepaid 
meters further restricts the access of informal settlement dwellers to services. Finally, the 
percentage of unconnected households is far greater for households with income equal to or less 
than one minimum wage. Indeed, households with income equal to or less than one minimum 
wage amounted to 56.1 per cent of the water deficit and 51.2 per cent for sewerage, while only 
30.1 per cent of the new water connections and 27.8 per cent of sewerage benefitted these 
households.  
</p>
<p>55. The costs of electricity for low-income households are also a matter of concern, according 
to information received. Privatized electricity companies do not comply with the requirement of 
establishing a social fare for low-income families. Many families living in upgraded informal 
settlements can not afford their costs of living because no clear policy on affordable fares for the 
low-income populations is enforced.  
</p>
<p>56. Recommendation<b> &#8220;There is a need to strengthen interministerial cooperation to ensure 
that attention is focused on the human rights of indigenous peoples in Brazil. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to urge the Government to consider creating a special secretariat to 
allow for a comprehensive approach in matters relating to the human rights of indigenous 
peoples, including housing and land rights&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 80) 
</p>
<p>57. Information provided by the Government indicates that the public policies addressed to 
indigenous peoples in Brazil are centralized at the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), which 
was created in 1967 to replace the Office for the Protection of Indians (SPI) that had existed 
since 1910. The FUNAI aggregates all public policies related to the situation of indigenous 
populations and its objective is to ensure that they enjoy better conditions of life, preserve their 
identity, and realize their rights. The FUNAI possesses regional Executive Administrations 
spread across the Brazilian territory and 4,500 servers. With regards to the recommendation of 
establishing a special secretariat, the Brazilian Government has stated their believe that the 
FUNAI is the institution better equipped to address the protection of indigenous populations, 
given their infrastructure and the extensive experience accumulated in the last century. However, 
they stress that further measures need to be taken to improve the human and financial resources 
of the institution. Currently, FUNAI is being restructured and the budget has increased by more 
than 40 per cent. There are also plans to hire 3100 new servers, create a career on indigenous 
issues, and adopt a new international cooperation agreement for institutional strengthening. </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 15 
</p><p> 
58. With regards to land demarcation, governmental authorities informed that, the Direction of 
Land Affairs of the FUNAI is exclusively dedicated to the work of demarcation and protection of 
indigenous lands.  
</p>
<p>59. Information provided by other sources indicates that some progress on land demarcation 
took place with the demarcation of the Raposa Serra do Sol land, located in the state of Roraima. 
For 30 years the indigenous communities living in this area had been demanding the legal 
recognition of their territory. Finally, in 2005 a presidential decree ratified that the territory 
constitutes indigenous land. A decision of the Supreme Federal Tribunal confirmed the 
endorsement, in 2007. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that in 2005, an Inter-Ministerial Committee 
was created to address the long-standing problems among the Guarani-Kaiowa in Mato grosso 
do Sul and deal with the escalating social problems. An agreement was also signed to identify 36 
different Guarani-Kaiowa ancestral lands with a view to their demarcation. However, the process 
of identification has been allegedly stalled as a result of legal difficulties, discriminatory 
practices and lack of political will. Consequently, the affected communities continue to live in 
impoverished and overcrowded reservations, in encampments on the side of highways, with no 
access to water or energy, and subject to threat and assault.  
</p>
<p>61. Recommendation<b> &#8220;The Programme of Subsidies for Social-Interest Housing should be 
expanded to include more families&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 80)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>62. Information provided by the Government indicates that the National Social Interest 
Housing Fund (NSIHF) has an annual budget of R$1 billion, which are transferred to states and 
municipalities for projects related to social interest housing programmes. In 2007, an interim 
order was issued to allow the direct transfer of NSIHF resources to housing cooperatives and 
associations. Framed in the NSIHF, the Social Interest Housing Programme has invested R$ 
444.9 million in 2006; the Housing Lease Programme invested R$ 1.27 billion in 2006; and the 
Programmes of Collective and Individual Letters of Credit invested R$ 5.47 billion in 2006. 
</p>
<p>63. Brazilian authorities informed the Special Rapporteur that through the NSIHF, and other 
funding sources like the Time of Service Guarantee Fund, the Federal Government has 
progressively expanded its investment for social housing. Between 2003 and 2008 investments 
were made for R$ 94.8 billion, out of which R$ 53.2 billion federal funds and R$ 43.8 billion of 
mortgages were allocated to families of up to 5 minimum wages.  
</p>
<p>64. In addition to this, the My Home, My Life Programme envisages a total investment of R$ 
34 billion, with a contribution of $ 16 billion to subsidize families with incomes of up to 3 
minimum wages. The Pro-Housing Programme was allocated R$ 1 billion in 2007, and will 
continue to receive such amounts until 2010. 
</p>
<p>65. Finally, the National Housing Plan (PlanHab) envisages possible investment scenarios 
until 2023, such as: (a) the allocation of R$ 9 billion for social interest housing for the period 
2007-2010, and (b) the expansion to 2 per cent of the Union General Budget, to 1 per cent of the 
states, and to 1 per cent of the municipalities, in order to meet 70 per cent of the housing deficit 
and a 100 per cent of the precarious settlements.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 16 
</p><p> 
66. Information received by the Special Rapporteur also states that although the National 
Housing Plan was ready to be launched since the end of 2008, after two years of discussion with 
the National Council of Cities and all relevant stakeholders the plan has not yet been initiated.  
</p>
<p>67. Recommendation<b> &#8220;The international community should support the efforts of the 
Government of Brazil to de-link initiatives relevant to meeting the Millennium 
Development Goals from those aimed at debt repayment&#8221;.</b> (paragraph 80)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future.  
</p>
<p>69. Recommendation<b> &#8220;The Public Prosecutor should be given an explicit mandate to 
protect economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to adequate housing. 
Extensive training and awareness-building for the judiciary with respect to the right to 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living is 
imperative. In addition to agrarian courts, the Government is encouraged to create special 
courts to deal with land-related issues including adverse possession, land demarcation and 
regularization conflicts, disputes over judicial records of urban and rural land conflicts, 
and forced evictions and displacement&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 80)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>71. Information provided by other sources states that, at present, the Public Prosecutor does 
not ensure adequate protection for economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to 
housing. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the Law 6.766 of 1979, used by the 
Public Prosecutor in the inspection of the urban order, has a strong criminal law bias and does 
not relate to the provisions of the City Statute, the regulations on urban development, or the 
standards on the right to housing.  
</p>
<p>72. Further information indicates that a Technical Cooperation Agreement was adopted in 
2006 between the Ministry of Cities, the National Council of Prosecutors of the States and the 
Federal Government. The agreements seek to ensure the participation of the Public Prosecutor in 
the implementation of land regularization processes, in the discussions of the City Master Plans, 
and in the meetings of the Ministry of the Cities, with a view to improving their knowledge and 
participation on issues related to the right to adequate housing and urban development.  
</p>
<p>73. The National Agrarian Ombudsman Division (NAOD) was created by the Ministry of 
Agrarian Development, pursuant Decree 5.033 of 2004. The NAOD has attributions to resolve 
tensions and social conflicts on the land in collaboration with the Judiciary, the Public Prosecutor 
Department and the INCRA, and in liaison with state and municipal authorities, rural social 
movements and the civil society. It also has competence to ensure the human and social rights of 
people involved in land conflicts.  </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 17 
</p><p> 
74. In March 2009, the National Council of Justice published Administrative Rule n&#176; 491 
creating a National Forum for the monitoring and resolution of rural and urban land conflicts. 
Currently, within the scope of the Ministry of Cities and the Council of Cities, a bill is pending 
for the adoption of a Policy for Prevention and Mediation of Urban Land Conflicts.  
</p>
<p>75. <b>&#8220;There is need for education and training for civil servants and local government 
officials to ensure effective implementation of the Statute of the City. Master plans must 
reflect the territorial, economic and cultural realities of local communities&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 80) 
</p>
<p>76. Information provided by the Government indicates that the Ministry of Cities has 
established a nation-wide training network to facilitate the implementation of Master Plans and 
the principles of the Statute of the City. A range of training programmes, organized in 
partnership with local governments, universities, NGOs and private or public institutions, have 
been adopted to support state and municipal officials working on housing programmes.  
</p>
<p>77. Information provided by other sources indicates that a national campaign was launched in 
May 2005 titled &quot;Participatory Master Plan - a City for All&quot;. The campaign encompasses 
activities to support the preparation of the Master Plans in cities, create awareness and capacity 
building, monitor the preparation of the Plans, train public authorities and organizations of civil 
society, create an experience-database to record best practices, and establish a national network 
to disseminate ideas about the on-going processes. In addition, in 2007 the government adopted 
the &quot;Evaluation and Capacity Building Network for the Implementation of Participatory Master 
Plans&quot;, which creates a national network for evaluation and monitoring of Master Plans and 
trains government agents and civil society actors. 
</p>
<p>78. According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur, in 2006 and 2007 the 
Brazilian government conducted researches to check the progress in the preparation of the master 
plans. Of the 1,682 cities researched in 2006, 14.32 per cent (241) had completed their Master 
Plans, 73.92 per cent (1244) were in preparation process and 11.76 per cent (241) had no master 
plan. Of the 1,345 cities researched in 2007, more than 50 per cent included in their legislation 
the following City Statute Instruments provided for in the Master Plan: Special Social Interest 
Zones (72,2 per cent); Payment in Instalments, Compulsory building (62.4 per cent) and 
progressive IPTU (real estate tax) (68.9 per cent). 
</p>
<p><b>General Observations 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts made by the Government, 
international governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations to address 
issues related to the right to housing in Brazil. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the efforts that have been made by the national 
authorities to implement programmes aimed at improving the living conditions of 
vulnerable populations, such as the National Social Interest Housing System (NSIHS), the 
National Social Interest Housing Fund (NSIHF),</b> <b>the PlanHab, and the My House, My life 
Programme, amongst others. However, the Special Rapporteur encourages the government 
to improve the coordination amongst them and their integration in the National Housing 
Policy.</b> <b>She also encourages the government to concentrate the funds coming from different 
sources in the National Social Housing Fund, to ensure transparency and control by state </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2

<b>officials and other stakeholders. It is important that the government fully integrates human 
rights and the right to adequate housing in all housing related policies and legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends also the efforts made in Brazil to implement the 
Statute of the City and encourages the national government to fully integrate it within the 
housing production initiatives in order to address the key elements of housing as a human 
right. This includes not only the construction of houses but also suitable locations with 
access to equipment, infrastructure, employment and income opportunities. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporter takes notes of the efforts made by the government to 
strengthen the Office of the Public Defender. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur calls 
upon the Government to establish Offices of the Public Defenders in all states in order to 
ensure access of low-income communities to justice.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the Government to provide appropriate 
training on human rights and the right to adequate housing to members of the judiciary 
and the Public Prosecutors Office, as well as to all public officials involved in housing 
related activities. A National Urban Ombudsman division should also be created with a 
view to mitigating land conflicts in the urban areas. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur recalls her concern regarding the housing and living 
conditions of Quilombola and indigenous communities in Brazil. She recommends that the 
State party urgently complete the process of demarcation and allocation of indigenous land 
in accordance with the Constitution and existing laws. She wishes to emphasize the need to 
adopt all necessary measures and to allocate resources to guarantee the right to property, 
housing, and land of Quilombolas and indigenous communities, taking into consideration 
their cultural and collective identity, lands and ancestral practices. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes through the information received that the question of 
forced evictions and development based resettlements still deserves greater attention from 
government given the impact they represent in the realization of the right to adequate 
housing. In particular, the Rapporteur suggests that greater attention should be placed on 
the right to adequate housing in development-based evictions, such as urban and 
infrastructure projects. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur encourages the government to adopt additional 
measures to deal with the problem of homelessness, to ensure adequate access to housing 
for low-income families, disadvantaged and marginalised individuals and groups. </b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CAMBODIA 
</b></p>
<p>87. The former mandate holder, Mr. Miloon Kothari, visited Cambodia from 22 August to 3 
September 2005. He presented his mission report at the 62nd session of the Commission on 
Human Rights in 2006 (E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.3). </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 19 
</p><p> 
88. The current Special Rapporteur, Ms. Raquel Rolnik wishes to express her appreciation for 
the information provided to her by UN entities and by civil society organizations. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets not having received information from the government; she welcomes the 
continuation of the dialogue engaged in with the authorities and hopes that the authorities will 
provide her with further information in the near future. 
</p>
<p>89. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;There is an urgent need for a clear mapping of the housing needs 
of the country and interpretation of the data from a human rights perspective, aiming at 
the development of a comprehensive national housing policy&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 82) 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receiv any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>91. Information provided by other sources states that a clear mapping of housing needs has 
never been made in the country at either national or local level. A draft National Housing Policy 
was developed in 2003-2004 by the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and 
Construction through a consultative process. However, it has not been implemented and was 
subsequently abandoned. Propositions to draft a new Housing Policy or expand the current draft 
were expressed by the Ministry, however as of yet there have been no developments. More 
recently, a housing policy agreed as a &#8220;joint monitoring indicator&#8221; with the donors, has been 
scheduled for drafting in 2009-2010. With regards to land tenure, although there is no 
information of government action in the field, some efforts are being undertaken by civil society 
to centralize data regarding land disputes and evictions.  
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the interpretation of housing and land data from 
a human rights perspective remains a serious need. A regression in implementing such an 
approach is noticeable compared to the situation at the time of the mission of the previous 
Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>93. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;In connection with the previous recommendation, there is also a 
need for increasing transparency in the development of policies and openness in the 
assessment of priorities and results, with space for public monitoring and full participation 
of the affected population&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 82) 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>95. Information provided by other sources states that transparency in the development of 
policies and openness in the assessment of priorities and results remain unachieved, undermining 
the possibility of affected communities participating or challenging decisions affecting their 
housing situation.  
</p>
<p>96. Some laws, such as the draft Law on Expropriation, are not subject to any process of open 
consultations. In addition, affected populations do not receive adequate information regarding 
evictions and plans for resettlements, while many evictions are carried out without a court order 
or prior notice. Consultations generally take place at a very late stage. Similarly, no information </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 20 
 
is provided to affected people regarding the future use of the land from which they have been 
evicted. Despite the support given by donors to several ministries to set up procedures for open 
consultations, there is still no practice of early consultations with different stake holders and 
affected communities. Furthermore, it has been reported that on numerous occasions the 
Government has censored lists of participants planning to attend consultations.  
</p>
<p>97. Despite the requirements of the Sub-Decree on Economic Land Concessions for public 
consultation and participation, on several occasions were evictions linked to the granting of 
economic land concessions carried out without appropriate consultations. Similarly, it has been 
reported that consultations with affected communities are not a common practice when 
authorities and private actors identify relocation sites. In addition, reported corrupt practices in 
economic land concessions and commercial developments by private actors seem to further 
affect the efforts for transparency. Forced evictions in the context of development projects for 
public interest, appear to be undertaken in processes involving somewhat higher degrees of 
openness.   
</p>
<p>98. In its Concluding Observations on Cambodia of May 2009 (E/C.12/KHM/CO/1), the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted with concern the lack of effective 
consultation with, and legal redress for, persons affected by forced evictions. 
</p>
<p>99. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;Urgent attention must be given to those living in distressed 
housing and living conditions, including slum and relocation site dwellers, with the 
immediate provision of basic amenities&#8221;.</b> (paragraph 82) 
</p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>101. Information provided by other sources indicates that more than 40 resettlement sites exist 
in and around Phnom Penh were approximately 80,000 people had been relocated to. In 2009, 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressed its concern over reports that 
since the year 2000, over 100,000 people were evicted in Phnom Penh alone and that at least 
150,000 Cambodians continue to live under threat of forced eviction. Similarly, rural 
landlessness rose from 13 per cent in 1997 to between 20 and 25 per cent in 2007.  
</p>
<p>102. In most cases of forced evictions, adequate alternative housing or compensation for losses 
has not been provided. Evicted families often do not receive titles for their new location site. In 
rural areas, evicted families are deprived of shelter and farming land for livelihoods. In addition, 
evictions are usually carried out violently by the police, the military police or private armed 
forces.  
</p>
<p>103. While many affected families have been left homeless, many of those who accessed 
alternative housing were relocated to sites and houses considered inadequate in terms of 
habitability, infrastructure (proper housing, sanitation, potable water, sewage services), 
affordability, access to facilities (distance to hospitals, schools and other basic facilities) and 
location (access to employment opportunities, travelling costs, fertility of the land). In many 
cases the resettlement sites are empty lands with no available shelters or facilities, and located in </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 21 
 
even more deprived and marginalized areas. Overall, the majority of relocated families face 
further hardships and impoverishment after the eviction. Relocation practices thus appear to 
consistently violate the human rights of the affected populations. 
</p>
<p>104. In its report to the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights of 2008, the 
government identified four urban sites that were to be used as social land concessions: Dey 
Krahorm Area, Borei Keila Area, Train Station-A and Train Station-B. The plan was to improve 
the housing conditions in these areas through land-sharing projects that would provide on site 
upgrading and tenure security. However, it has been reported that three of these areas were given 
to private companies for commercial development and caused the forced eviction or resettlement 
of the local residents in peri-urban areas. Moreover, community leaders in Dey Krahorm Area, 
Train Station-A and Train Station-B have been criminally convicted for demanding fair 
compensation.  
</p>
<p>105. Out of the four land-sharing projects, only the initiative in Borei Keila has gone forward 
and was subject to some planning. However, no consultations with the affected families took 
place and corruption and discrimination have reportedly marred the process of assessing 
eligibility for housing in the new buildings. According to the information received, only one 
third of the residents have received apartments, while 21 families have been evicted and resettled 
in inadequate sites and 11 families are waiting for allocation of sites still under construction.  
</p>
<p>106. By the same token, it has been reported that the community of Boeng Kak Lake is 
currently under threat of eviction and that two villages of 160 families had to leave their homes 
under duress.  
</p>
<p>107. In May 2009, the Special Rapporteur expressed her grave concern over the possible 
imminent eviction of &quot;Group 78&quot;, who have been involved in a legal battle over their land since 
2004, as well as the forced eviction and threats of forced eviction in Sambok Chap in Tonle 
Bassac, Mittapheap in Sihanoukville, Boeung Kak Lake, Dey Krahorm and Borei Keila in 
Phnom Penh, among others. 
</p>
<p>108. In all cases of high-end development projects, compensation and relocation sites have been 
inadequate and affected populations have been subject to further impoverishing. Discrimination 
is also present in this context. Very few of the families living with HIV/AIDS have been 
allocated new houses and the majority have been evicted. At the municipal level, some efforts 
were undertaken to improve the situation of the urban poor but mainly with a charity approach 
rather than as a sustained policy. 
</p>
<p>109. Overall, the Special Rapporteur notes a lack of enforcement of the right to housing in the 
country, where land-grabbing and forced evictions are extended practices and insecurity of 
tenure and landlessness constitute a constantly growing problem. By the same token, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted with deep concern that the rate of 
large-scale forced evictions has increased over the last 10 years due to increased public works, 
city beautification projects, private urban development, land speculation, and the granting of 
concessions over vast tracks of land to private companies.  
</p>
<p>110. Concerns have also been expressed regarding the role of public authorities, who usually 
fail to protect families in vulnerable housing situations. It has been reported that on numerous </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 22 
 
occasions Government officials support or participate in illegal land-grabbing by private 
investors, issue dubious land titles or eviction orders, prevent victims from accessing the courts 
to protect their housing rights, and fail to enforce the applicable law. 
</p>
<p>111. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;The housing-related provisions of the 2001 Property Law should 
be immediately implemented, including those of the newly adopted sub-decrees. 
Regulations should be adopted that include provisions regarding the housing situation of 
families living in State property and clarify the legal situation of all land swaps that 
occurred between the 2001 Property Law and its own adoption. In addition, information 
concerning all land swaps under negotiation should be immediately disclosed. In the 
meanwhile, besides halting all swaps, full attention should be given to the families already 
affected to guarantee adequate housing conditions and security of tenure in their relocation 
sites. Whenever evictions are still pending, all efforts should be made to actually consider 
relocation as a last resort and ensure consultation with the affected community&#8221;.</b> 
(paragraph 82) 
</p>
<p>112. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>113. Information provided by other sources states that the implementation of the provisions of 
the 2001 Property Law (better known as the 2001 Land Law) and its sub-decrees has been 
insufficient and slow.  
</p>
<p>114. In line with the 2001 Land Law that recognizes possession rights after 5 years of inhabiting 
the land, a programme of land titling was launched in 2002 administered by the Ministry of Land 
Management and financed with donors funding. The aim of the programme was to transform 
possession rights into ownership rights and ensure security of tenure. The programme was 
mainly focused on rural areas and on lands with clear status, but it overlooked urban areas and 
informal settlements. As a consequence, urban residents and residents in informal settlements 
have received few titles and possess no tenure security. 
</p>
<p>115. On the other hand, the 2001 Land Law and the Cambodian Constitution require land 
expropriation in the public interest to be followed by fair and just compensation. In the case of 
evictions relating to private land dispute, the law requires the issuance of a court order. However, 
information from several sources indicates that numerous evictions are undertaken without court 
orders, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, and without verification of ownership by the 
party seeking the eviction. In addition, expropriations in the public interest are carried out 
without prior adequate planning. Moreover, alternatives to eviction are often unexplored and 
there are scant opportunities for those affected to participate in the decisions regarding their 
resettlement. As previously mentioned, consultations with affected communities are inadequate 
and information regarding options for relocation or compensation is not transparent. 
Consequently, the affected families are forced to accept inadequate relocation or compensation 
plans.  </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 23 
</p><p> 
116. In its concluding observations of 2009, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights has expressed grave concern over the inadequate measures to provide sufficient 
compensation or adequate relocation sites to families who have been forcibly removed from their 
properties. 
</p>
<p>117. Land swaps are similarly carried out without provision of fair or just compensations. 
However, it has been reported that the current general trend indicates that existing land swaps do 
not appear to be leading to the eviction and displacement of families. Exceptions occur though, 
as was the case of the swap and removal of 21 families living with HIV/AIDS in the &#8220;green 
shed&#8221; in Borei Keila. On the other hand, information regarding past swaps and swaps under 
negotiation continues to be undisclosed, maintaining the pattern observed by the former Special 
Rapporteur in 2006.  
</p>
<p>118. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;A national evictions act should be adopted in accordance with 
international human rights standards, especially CESCR&#8217;s general comments 4 and 7&#8221;. 
</b>(paragraph 82)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>119. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>120. Information provided by other sources indicates that no national evictions act has been 
adopted yet, leaving a vacuum regarding a rationale for evictions and ways to conduct them. 
Although the government is in the process of drafting regulations on expropriation and 
resettlement as a result of State public works, currently there are no guidelines addressed to both 
public and private developments underway.  
</p>
<p>121. With assistance of the Asian Development Bank, in 2004 the Ministry of Economics and 
Finance began drafting the Sub-Decree on Land and Property Acquisition and Addressing Socio-
Economic Impacts Caused by State Development Projects. Two drafts of the sub-decree have 
been released in May and September 2007, but it has been reported that the drafts fall short of 
international standards on the matter. Although some consultations with civil society were 
carried out in the process of elaborating the drafts, their participation has been hampered by 
inadequate schedules for the submission of their inputs. The release of a third draft is currently 
stalled and further consultations ruled out, while the Asian Development Bank has closed the 
project to support it.  
</p>
<p>122. Meanwhile, a new Law on Expropriation is being drafted by the Ministry of Economics 
and Finance, which reportedly contains no provisions protecting against forced evictions. 
</p>
<p>123. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;The judiciary and the Cadastral Commission have an important 
role in housing conflicts and their work should be strengthened through strict respect for 
the rule of law and due process, including the establishment of impartial investigative 
procedures to verify the authenticity of ownership claims and impartial review of court and 
administrative decision</b>s<b>. </b>(paragraph 82)<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 24 
</p><p> 
124. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>125. Information provided by other sources indicates that no real progress has been made in this 
area. The roles and jurisdiction of the three official institutions dealing with land disputes (the 
Cadastral Commissions, the legal system, and the National Authority for Land Dispute 
Resolution &#8211; NALDR) is unclear. Formally, the Cadastral Commission has jurisdiction over 
untitled land, the judiciary over titled land, and the NALDR over land beyond the jurisdiction of 
the Cadastral Commission. However, the jurisdictions of the NALDR and the Cadastral 
Commission often overlap. According to the information received, the work and impartiality of 
these three institutions needs to be improved.  
</p>
<p>126. The Cadastral Commission and the courts are reportedly considered to be inefficient, 
costly and slow, as well as lacking integrity and biased in favour of rich and well-connected 
disputants. The Cadastral Commission reportedly fails to adjudicate and register land and 
remains a weak institution. It also has difficulties resolving conflicts involving parties unwilling 
to reach a resolution, multi-parties cases, or cases where one party is powerful or rich. 
Meanwhile, the legal system is accused of corruption, lack of independence and unequal 
treatment. In addition, courts are reportedly accused of failing to enforce the applicable law, 
accepting coerced confessions and disregarding the presumption of innocence. On a different 
note, the courts have been increasingly used to constrain the action of affected communities and 
civil society organizations attempting to protect housing and land rights. 
</p>
<p>127. A the same time, the NALDR is a political entity without an established legal framework 
or procedures. Its work is often carried out on an ad hoc basis. Moreover, controversial and high 
profile cases are often referred to it, which usually result in decisions favouring the powerful 
parties and not the communities.  
</p>
<p>128. In general, the institutions dealing with land disputes appear to be subject to abuse of 
power and corruption. This institutional layout leaves affected populations exposed to 
intimidation and mistreatment, without access to the titling system, and with increased chances 
of land-loss and displacement. 
</p>
<p>129. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;Specific policies should be developed to address discrimination 
against women in relation to equal access to and ownership of housing and land. Such 
policies should address the disproportionately adverse impact that forced evictions, 
displacement and poor living conditions have on women&#8221;.</b> (paragraph 82) 
</p>
<p>130. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>131. Information provided by other sources indicates that efforts have been made by the 
Ministry of Land Management to mainstream gender and promote equality in the access to land 
titles. Accordingly, reports indicate that a large proportion of titles are given to female heads of 
households and that married couples receive joint titles. However, no policies have been 
implemented to assist women in situations of eviction or displacement.<b> </b></p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 25 
 
132. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;Measures aiming at the realization of the indigenous peoples&#8217; right 
to adequate housing should include respect for their traditional lands and elaboration of 
culturally sensitive land and housing policies. Until the adoption of the sub-decree on 
collective ownership of indigenous lands, a moratorium on land sales affecting indigenous 
peoples should be considered by relevant authorities&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 82) 
</p>
<p>133. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>134. Information provided by other sources states that the 2001 Land Law recognizes collective 
ownership rights of indigenous communities over their land. Articles 18 and 23 of the law grant 
temporary land tenure security and prevent the transfer of traditional lands belonging to 
indigenous communities. In addition, Article 23 refers to a law on communities to determine 
their legal status. Along with Article 23, Title VI refers to a process for land mapping and 
registration to determine the boundaries of indigenous land overtime. The Law also refers to a 
legal and policy framework for the titling of collective titles. Regrettably, none of these 
provisions have been enforced by the authorities as of yet.  
</p>
<p>135. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted with concern that the 
2001 Land Law providing for the titling of indigenous communities' communal lands has not 
been implemented effectively and that so far, no indigenous community has received any land 
title. 
</p>
<p>136. Similarly, although the 2001 Land Law envisages the disciplining of government officials 
involved in improper concession, confiscation or use of land, measures to comply with this 
provision have not been implemented. By the same token, the 2001 Land Law provides for the 
right of indigenous people to traditionally owned and used forests, while the 2002 Law on 
Forestry protects the rights of customary users in cases of forest protection or concessions. 
However, the access of indigenous communities to the forests they traditionally use remains 
obstructed.  
</p>
<p>137. After seven years, a draft Sub-Decree on Procedures to register Indigenous Communal 
Land has been adopted. However, it has been reported that the text does not adequately address 
indigenous collective land titling. In addition, civil society groups have not been consulted in the 
drafting of the Sub-Decree. According to the new norm, titling of communal land is subject to 
prior legal registration of the indigenous community with the Ministry of Interior through a 
cumbersome process in which the community must prove its existence. In practice, this process 
hampers the titling of communal land. Despite the recommendation of the previous Special 
Rapporteur, no moratorium on land sales affecting indigenous peoples has been granted prior to 
the adoption of the Sub-Decree. Although temporary protective measures were agreed between 
the Government and the donors to protect indigenous land, many of the interim measures were 
never developed or implemented. As a result, expropriation of indigenous land continued to be 
routinely carried out. </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 26 
</p><p> 
138. Other measures foreseen by the government to ensure the realization of indigenous rights 
include the Policy on Titling and Rights to use Land of Indigenous Communities approved by 
the Government in April 2009, as well as the regulations and mechanisms for collective land 
titling that are being discussed as part of the Government-Donors Joint Monitoring Indicators 
(JMI) since 2006. 
</p>
<p>139. Pressure on indigenous lands rich in resources has been increasing, in particular in 
connection to the activities of the extractive industries. Similarly, numerous cases of occupation 
of indigenous land by private companies or individuals have been reported. Clearing of 
traditionally owned land and natural resources continue to represent a serious threat to the rights 
of indigenous communities. For example, it has been reported that 21 per cent of the areas under 
environmental protection in Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri has been allocated to mining 
concessions, while 7 per cent has been allocated to Economic Land Concessions. In this context, 
the members of indigenous communities are subject to constant misinformation and pressured to 
sell their lands. They are also victims of intimidation, harassment and criminal prosecution for 
attempting to protect their rights. 
</p>
<p>140. In 2009, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that the rapid 
increase in economic land concessions in recent years has resulted in the displacement of 
indigenous peoples from their lands without just compensation and resettlement, and in the loss 
of livelihood for communities who depend on land and forest resources for their survival. The 
Committee also noted with concern, the adverse effects of the exploitation of natural resources, 
in particular mining operations and oil exploration that are being carried out in indigenous 
territories, contravening the right of indigenous peoples to their ancestral lands and natural 
resources. 
</p>
<p>141. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;Measures should be adopted to facilitate the work of human rights 
and development NGOs in the country, with full respect for the rights to freedom of 
association, expression and movement&#8221;.</b> (paragraph 82)<b> 
</b></p>
<p>142. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>143. Information provided by other sources states that affected communities, grass roots 
organizations and NGOs are increasingly subject to intimidation, assault and unlawful 
imprisonment in their daily work. Their freedom of movement, assembly and expression are also 
routinely restricted. In some provinces, workshops and meetings with communities require the 
granting of official permission. Intimidation of organizers and participants of such meetings also 
takes place on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p>144. Reports received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the criminal system is 
increasingly being used to intimidate and constrain the activities of civil society organizations, 
by pressing unwarranted criminal charges against members who attempt to protect housing and 
land rights. NGOs organizing workshops to inform affected communities about their legal rights, </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 27 
 
the ways to peacefully exercise them, and the available administrative and judicial recourses, are 
also often accused of &#8220;incitement&#8221;. According to information received, in 2008 approximately 
150 land activists were arrested and faced prosecution on spurious criminal charges. In June 
2009, 50 to 60 activists remained detained in relation to land disputes, often on bogus charges.  
</p>
<p>145. In September 2008, Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed his intention to establish a law on 
NGOs that has been widely perceived as a means to further restrict the activities of civil society 
organizations and curtail their freedom of association and expression. The law is expected to be 
applied to national organizations as much as international ones. In addition, a draft law on 
demonstrations restricting freedom of assembly and a new Penal Code with restrictive provisions 
on defamation are currently before Parliament.  
</p>
<p>146. The possibilities to oppose forced evictions and land grabbing in the country are becoming 
more restricted. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regretted the 
repression of human rights activists defending housing and land rights in Cambodia, and the use 
of the court system to legitimize forced evictions and falsely prosecute housing rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>147. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;The existing obstacles against the implementation of the right to 
adequate housing are of enormous proportions and facing the challenges will require joint 
efforts by not only the Government, but also national non-governmental actors and the 
international community alike&#8221;.</b> (paragraph 82) 
</p>
<p>148. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments on this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>149. Information provided by other sources indicates that the relationship between government 
and civil society is increasingly deteriorating. However, it is expected that the efforts made by 
the international community to collaborate with the government in this field will help bridge the 
existing gap.  
</p>
<p>150. The international community has clearly advocated for a moratorium on mass evictions in 
Cambodia. When evaluating their strategies in the country, donors are encouraged to take into 
consideration the recommendations on the subject made by the Special Rapporteur, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the UN Country Team. 
</p>
<p><b>General observations 
</b></p>
<p>151. <b>The Special Rapporteur regrets that no information has been received from the 
Government regarding the implementation of the recommendations and the status of the 
right to adequate housing. 
</b></p>
<p>152. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the efforts made by the Government, 
international governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations working to 
address issues related to the right to housing in Cambodia. However, much remains to be 
done by State authorities to adequately address in its policies, legislation and programmes 
the question of the right to adequate housing. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 28 
 
153. <b>The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the urgent need for a clear mapping of the 
housing needs in the country, as well as a need for greater transparency and openness in 
the adoption of policies and measures relating to housing.  
</b></p>
<p>154. <b>Particular efforts still need to be devoted to the situation of those living in distressed 
housing and living condition and often subject to large-scale forced evictions, insecurity of 
tenure, landlessness, and inadequate resettlement programmes and sites. It is essential that 
all measures related to housing be carried out in full respect of the human rights of the 
affected populations and that the role of public authorities in their protection be 
strengthened.  
</b></p>
<p>155. <b>Although the government is in the process of drafting regulations on expropriation 
and resettlement, no national evictions act has been adopted yet. Other norms and 
regulations relating to housing are currently under consideration. It is important that all 
efforts aiming at the improvement of legislation and policies, fully integrate human rights 
and the right to adequate housing, and be open to public discussion before being enacted. 
</b></p>
<p>156. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the lack of realization of indigenous 
people&#8217;s rights in Cambodia and the increasing pressure and intimidation to which they 
are subject. She has also expressed concern about the growing pattern of intimidation, 
assault and unlawful imprisonment of non governmental organizations and affected 
communities. It is important that the government adopts all necessary measures to protect 
the rights of indigenous populations and to enable organizations of the civil society to carry 
out their work. 
</b></p>
<p>157. <b>It is crucial that actors dealing with issues related to the right to adequate housing, 
including public officials and institutions, United Nations agencies and international 
organizations and donors, fully integrate a human rights-based approach into their work 
and take into consideration economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to 
adequate housing. The international community and its aid should not neglect ESCR issues 
and should not ignore the different dimensions of the right to adequate housing in their 
activities, planning and programmes. The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages all 
actors, whether national or international, involved in housing to receive adequate training 
on human rights and the right to adequate housing. 
</b></p>
<p>158. <b>Finally, in order to have a more accurate vision of adequate housing in the country, 
the Special Rapporteur hopes that she will receive further information from all concerned 
actors. 
</b></p>
<p><b>IV.  KENYA 
</b></p>
<p>159. The former mandate holder, Mr. Miloon Kothari, visited Kenya from 9 to 22 February 
</p><p>2004. He presented his mission report at the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights in 
2005 (E/CN.4/2005/48/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>160. The current Special Rapporteur, Ms. Raquel Rolnik, wishes to express her appreciation for 
the information that was provided to her by the Government of Kenya, civil society 
organizations and other relevant actors.  </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 29 
 
161. Recommendation<b>:</b> &#8220;The population in Huruma village is living in extreme poverty, and in 
such an emergency situation, <b>the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government 
establish an emergency assistance programme to ensure that immediate steps are taken to 
remedy this and similar situations&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 67) 
</p>
<p>162. Information provided by the Government indicates that an Inter-Ministerial Committee, 
chaired by the Head of Public Service, was formed. Permanent Secretaries from key ministries, 
including the Ministry of Housing, made up the committee. As a result of their discussions and 
recommendations, residents from Huruma village were resettled in Solio Ranch in Laikipia 
district. According to the information provided by the Government, people have been given 
residential plots, land for farming and farm inputs. In addition, infrastructural services, such as 
water, schools and security have been made available. 
</p>
<p>163. Information provided by other sources states that in March 2009 the Government 
purchased 15,000 acres of land at Solio Ranch. The sources state that while this is an attempt by 
the Government to provide secure tenure to the affected persons, the resettlement planning 
process and implementation has been faulted. Information received by the Special Rapporteur 
suggests that the process was not open and fair, and that a number of beneficiaries were 
excluded. In addition, the Government has allegedly not ensured provision to the Huruma 
community of basic services and amenities, such as water and sanitation, schools, roads and 
health facilities. 
</p>
<p>164. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;It is essential that there be full incorporation of the human rights 
perspective, including a clear commitment to non-discrimination and gender equality, at all 
levels of governance, policy-making and implementation. The integration of human rights 
perspectives in sectoral policies, housing and slum-upgrading programmes, and the 
constitutional and legal framework, and the application of human rights-sensitive 
indicators would be a first step towards the implementation of international human rights 
standards and the realization of the relevant Millennium Development Goals&#8221;. 
</b>(paragraph 82 (a))<b> 
</b></p>
<p>165. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;The Government must give particular attention to existing 
inequalities when elaborating policies and strategies in order to ensure that women&#8217;s rights 
are fully recognized. Although the Ministry of Gender has an essential role to play, the 
gender dimension is cross-cutting and all ministries need to become more involved and 
sensitized&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 82 (e)) 
</p>
<p>166. Information provided by the Government states that measures are being implemented in 
order to include a non-discriminatory and gender equal perspective in public policies. The 
current guiding policy document, Vision 2030, &#8220;aims at creating a cohesive equitable and just 
society based on democratic principles and issue based policies grounded on the rich but diverse 
culture and traditions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>167. The Vision&#8217;s specific pillar on gender equality and non-discrimination is the social pillar. 
This aims at establishing, inter alia: (a) gender mainstreaming in Government policies, plans, 
budget and programmes; (b) affirmative action to ensure 30 per cent representation of women at 
all decision-making levels; (c) the appointment and capacity building of gender officers in 
ministries and parastatals; (d) intervention for peace in the region, as well as the resolution of </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 30 
 
land issues to reduce both the influx of refugees from neighbouring countries and the number of 
internally displaced persons; (e) empowerment of people with special needs to make them self 
supporting; (f) re-drafting of the Matrimonial Property Bill to provide for equal rights of both 
spouses with respect to ownership, acquisition, management, administration, enjoyment and 
disposition of property; and (g) review of the Marriage Bill in order to consolidate marriage laws 
and assist people in understanding their marriage status, rights and liabilities. 
</p>
<p>168. A Sessional Paper on Gender and Equality Development (No. 2, 2006) also guides the 
Government in its activities. The paper highlights identified gender inequalities, identifies factors 
contributing to the unequal status of men and women, and emphasises the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to address gender concerns that stand in relation to international human rights 
instruments to which Kenya is a party. The Ministry of Housing integrates the above-mentioned 
policies in its own plans and projects, especially on slum upgrading projects. 
</p>
<p>169. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the Government has committed 
itself to adopting a human rights based approach. In 2007, in its publication &#8220;Water Sector 
Reform and the Human Right to Water in Kenya&#8221; the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) 
declared that human rights principles (namely, non-discrimination, inclusion of vulnerable and 
marginalised groups, access to information and participation, and transparency and 
accountability) together with the Millennium Development Goal orientation, shall guide the 
water sector reform process in Kenya. 
</p>
<p>170. Information provided by other sources states that the human rights provisions of the 
Proposed Constitution (2005) and the Bomas Draft Constitution (2004) have been held in 
abeyance. Indeed, constitutional review processes have been delayed and are to a great extent 
politicized. In addition, international human rights treaties have not been incorporated into 
domestic law, which makes it difficult to invoke human rights in Court. 
</p>
<p>171. Women&#8217;s inheritance rights are still not guaranteed under the current constitution which 
establishes exceptions to the general clause of non-discrimination with respect to personal law, 
regarding, among others, adoption, marriage, divorce, burial and devolution of property on 
death. It also establishes exceptions with respect to customary laws applicable in the case of 
members of a particular race or tribe (Constitution Article 82.4.b and c). In addition, the 
Marriage, Matrimonial Property and Gender Equality and Affirmative Action bills remain 
pending. 
</p>
<p>172. Concerning security of tenure in housing and land, non-governmental sources indicate that 
the system is discriminatory with respect to women. The system allows for women to acquire 
national identity cards in the name of either their fathers or husbands. This affects women in the 
context of providing evidence of transactions involving purchase of land or housing, and also 
affects transferable rights in case of divorce or death. It is further reported that access to housing 
of the majority of women depends on their husbands, fathers, sons or brothers. When those 
relationships deteriorate, women face disinheritance, as well as land and property grabbing. 
Moreover, laws on marriage and succession discriminate against women, in particular in areas of 
fair divorce settlement, maintenance and inheritance. For instance a woman&#8217;s right to 
matrimonial property under the Matrimonial Act is based on her contribution towards the 
purchase of the home. </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 31 
</p><p> 
173. Furthermore, a recent study shows that the lack of security of tenure on housing and land 
causes women to leave their rural homes to seek refuge in rental houses in nearby town centres. 
They also migrate to cities like Nairobi and Kisumu where they have no option but to live in 
highly inadequate housing conditions in urban informal settlements. In addition, unfair divorce 
or separation leaves women homeless and vulnerable to domestic violence and harassment, 
which forces a number of women to migrate to the cities and consequently into slums. 
</p>
<p>174. As concerns both the issue of representation of women in decision-making and the 
adoption of a gender perspective, information provided by other sources identifies a number of 
national documents that work towards this aim. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation, for 
example, addresses gender issues in the National Water Resources Management Strategy, as well 
as in the National Water Services Strategy. In Sessional Paper No. 1 of 2004, the Ministry of 
Gender, Sports and Culture calls for collaborative processes in promoting gender awareness and 
equity in all development efforts. Furthermore, a gender perspective can also be found in the 
Social Dimensions for Development Programme, the Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth 
and Employment Creation (2003-2007), the Kenya Demographic Health Survey and the Kenya 
Economic Surveys. 
</p>
<p>175. Despite these efforts, there is an evident need to improve overall and general coordination 
between all relevant and interlinked ministries and departments. The inclusion of gender 
perspectives in national policies and strategies requires certain finances. In this regard, 
coordination between key governmental actors would allow for financial allocations to be 
maximised. 
</p>
<p>176. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government 
further review existing programmes as well as policies and laws being developed, in order 
to orient them towards the poorest, vulnerable or marginalized segments of the population, 
such as indigenous peoples, persons living with HIV/AIDS, disabled persons, the Watta 
community, other formerly or currently destitute pastoralists, and forest dwellers. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government establish an emergency assistance 
programme for extreme cases of humanitarian crisis, such as the community in Huruma 
village in Kieni forest, who are being denied the right to adequate housing&#8221;. 
</b>(paragraph 82(b))<b> 
</b></p>
<p>177. Information provided by the Government indicates that it is fully committed to addressing 
the needs of all vulnerable groups. To this end, the Ministry of State for Special Programmes has 
been created. Its mandate is articulated as, but not limited to: (a) development and promulgation 
of Special Programmes policies; (b) coordination of the campaign against HIV/AIDS; (c) 
coordination of Disaster Risk Reduction programmes; (d) support of the National AIDS Control 
Council; (e) administration of the Humanitarian, Mitigation and Resettlement Fund; (f) food 
relief management; (g) management of the Strategic Grain Reserve; and (h) resettlement of 
Internally Displaced Persons. 
</p>
<p>178. National authorities further indicate that they have given priority attention to the rights of 
people living with HIV/AIDS, by establishing institutional structures and facilitating the 
necessary funding to curb the pandemic and its impact upon affected persons, as well as the 
larger population. Key actions in this area include the establishment of a National AIDS Control 
Council which coordinates HIV/AIDS activities nationally. AIDS Control Units have been </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 32 
 
established in all public agencies to coordinate matters related to HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, 
constituency HIV/AIDS Control Committees now coordinate HIV/AIDS control activities at the 
grassroots level, whilst widespread involvement of civil society organizations is encouraged. In 
addition, voluntary counselling and training centres have been established countrywide, which 
aim to be accessible to all, including the poor and vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>179. The Government&#8217;s commitment to facilitating a paradigm shift from condemnation to 
acceptance of persons living with HIV/AIDS is reflected in a policy that advocates for non-
discrimination, non-stigmatization, acceptance, treatment and support, and positive living with 
HIV/AIDS. Government ministries and institutions are expected to familiarise themselves with 
the policy. 
</p>
<p>180. Concerning the situation of the rights of disabled persons, the Government refers to the 
Persons with Disabilities Act, which was passed in 2003. This Act recognizes vulnerable and 
physically challenged citizens. It aims to empower them through the provision of specific rights 
and privileges that allow for their economic independence. Furthermore, the Act established the 
National Council for Persons with Disabilities, which is mandated to formulate and develop 
measures and policies designed to achieve equal opportunities for persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>181. Information received from the Government identifies a selection of policies, programmes, 
strategies and regulations that are in place to address the plight of poor and marginalised groups. 
In addition to the Vision 2030 document, the Government also has a National Housing Policy 
and the Kenya Slum Upgrading Programme. The economic pillar of Vision 2030 aims to achieve 
an economic growth rate of 10 percent per annum and to sustain this until 2030. 
</p>
<p>182. To help address emergency and humanitarian crises, the Government established a Disaster 
Prevention and Risk Management Policy. Many programmes have been developed over time 
under this policy, which do not distinguish between economical spheres and also include the 
poor. The Ministry of State for Special Programmes coordinates responses to emergencies and 
works together with the Kenyan Red Cross, as well as with other humanitarian related 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>183. Information received from other sources stresses that people living with HIV/AIDS in 
Kenya continue to experience conditions of extreme poverty that make it difficult for them to 
afford decent and adequate housing. As housing often plays a key role in prevention, treatment 
and care of HIV/AIDS, vulnerable victims need to be provided with economic empowerment, 
financial support or social housing. In this regard, it is unclear how and to what extent the issue 
of HIV/AIDS and housing is being considered in the Comprehensive Housing Policy currently 
being developed. 
</p>
<p>184. The existent governmental Housing Policy indicates that &#8220;escalating housing costs have 
tended to push prices steadily beyond the reach of the majority of urban dwellers in Kenya&#8221; and 
promises the &#8220;provision of housing for low-income earners who are the majority of urban 
dwellers&#8221;. However, information from non-governmental sources suggests that this commitment 
has not been put into practice. Available public housing, especially in Nairobi, greatly falls short 
of demand. Furthermore, the National Housing Corporation is said to almost exclusively 
concentrate on the middle- and high-income market due to better returns than would be the case 
for low-cost housing. </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 33 
</p><p> 
185. The inability of the Government to effectively respond to the unprecedented post-election 
violence of 2007-2008 suggests a lack of capacities to deal with humanitarian crises. 
Contingency plans were tested and fell short. As the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (CESCR) highlighted, financial assistance provided to internally displaced 
persons following the post-election violence, under the National Resettlement Fund, was 
inadequate. Many internally displaced persons benefited neither from assistance for resettlement 
nor assistance for their reintegration into society. In this regard, the Committee recommended 
that where resettlement or return to their homes was not possible, those affected should be 
provided adequate access to housing and employment. 
</p>
<p>186. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;A comprehensive approach needs to be adopted to address the 
issues of forced evictions, security of tenure, legalization of informal settlements and slum 
upgrading, and to ensure close consultation with those affected at the planning stage and 
with respect for the right to participation in decision-making in these areas. With respect to 
evictions, the Government should immediately put into practice the procedure called for 
under general comment No. 7 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
There is need for a clear evictions policy and specific legislation in this regard, such as a 
National Act on Evictions. In the meantime, an absolute moratorium on forced evictions 
should be implemented. United Nations agencies and programmes, as well as the donor 
community, are encouraged to play a more active role in ensuring that international 
human rights law is respected in slum-upgrading schemes and other development 
programmes, including processes that may lead to forced evictions&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 82(c)) 
</p>
<p>187. Information provided by the Government suggests that issues related to the right to 
adequate housing must primarily be considered in relation to slums and informal settlements in 
urban areas. Many of these problems come as a result of rapid urbanization unmatched in pace 
by the production of affordable housing and related infrastructure and services. According to 
information received from other sources, the lack of legal security of tenure constitutes a key 
obstacle to the realisation of the right to adequate housing, as slum dwellers are not protected 
from arbitrary rent increases, unreasonable restrictions on the use of their homes and land, and 
dispossession. The Government has informed that it aims, in a first instance, to improve the 
situation and eventually to solve it entirely. To this end, it has instituted certain policies and 
legislative steps, as outlined in the following paragraphs. 
</p>
<p>188. Long term housing strategies are guided by the National Housing Policy Sessional Paper 
No. 3 of 2004. Information provided by the Government outlines the strategies contained within 
this policy as follows: a) streamlining the acquisition of land for housing the poor, adoption of 
appropriate tenure systems, planning standards and prevention of unwarranted destruction of 
existing housing stock and displacement of the residents; b) facilitation of slum upgrading 
through an integrated institutional framework that accommodates participatory approaches 
involving relevant stakeholders while enhancing coordination at the national level; and c) supply 
of minimally developed but upgradeable low income housing to prevent proliferation of slums. 
</p>
<p>189. To alleviate the serious problems that slum settlements present, the Government initiated 
the Kenya Slum Upgrading (KENSUP) Programme in 2000, in collaboration with stakeholders 
such as UN-HABITAT. The programme seeks to improve the lives of 5.4 million people living 
and working in slums and informal settlements in urban centres nationwide. KENSUP provides a 
coordination framework in order to deliver effective slum upgrading, which includes the </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 34 
 
provision of basic urban infrastructure, social amenities and affordable housing with minimal or 
no forced evictions of residents. Since 2004, the Government has consistently given slum 
upgrading budget priority as a core poverty eradication programme. KENSUP is guided by the 
Implementation and Financing Strategy 2005-2020 document. This document identifies, inter 
alia, a need for (a) community mobilisation; (b) city/town development strategies; (c) provision 
of secure tenure, social infrastructure and physical infrastructure; (d) shelter improvement; and 
(e) prevention of slum proliferation. 
</p>
<p>190. Despite the existence of the KENSUP programme, information from other sources 
indicates that Kenya does not have a clearly defined or codified slum upgrading policy or 
legislative framework in place. As a result, despite meticulous attention to project formulation, 
experience with slum upgrading projects has shown great room for improvement. Upgraded 
properties in former slums are likely to be allocated to well connected and middle class people, 
rather than the slum dwellers for which they are intended. If this happens, it could mean forced 
displacement and homelessness for the former slum residents. The Kibera-Soweto pilot project 
launched in 2004 threatens to have this unfortunate outcome. Similarly, slum upgrades could 
miss their target by attracting sub-letting and encouraging landlordism. Additional challenges 
still needing to be overcome include the informal but locally accepted commercialisation of basic 
services such as water and refuse collection, which fails to secure adequate standards. 
</p>
<p>191. Information provided by the Government states that eviction procedures are guided by the 
Evictions Policy Guidelines and that both the interests of citizens and of the environment are 
considered. According to the Government, the core purpose of an eviction is to safeguard the 
security, dignity, and social welfare of citizens, and to ensure the good of the country. A concept 
paper on evictions is being drafted and will be considered by civil society stakeholders for 
enrichment. 
</p>
<p>192. Information provided by other sources recalls the Government&#8217;s commitment made before 
the UN Human Rights Commission in 2004 to halt evictions in all informal settlements until 
compliance with established international human rights standards could be guaranteed. Despite 
this commitment, there are still reports of widespread forced evictions. One recent example is the 
eviction of over 2,000 families from Embobut forest by government agencies, in May 2009. As 
was the case with other evictions, the Embobut evictions lacked legal basis and the victims have 
yet to be compensated. Although official sources stated that such forest evictions need to be 
carried out to protect and conserve water catchment areas and forest cover, they were reportedly 
characterised by violence, lack of consultation and inadequate resettlement plans. A lack of 
adequate warning and compensation also characterised forced evictions justified by either public 
infrastructure demands, such as road bypasses and power lines, or private developers claiming 
ownership of land on which settlements stood. 
</p>
<p>193. According to national authorities, a Housing Bill has been drafted aimed at providing for 
effective coordination, facilitation, capacity building and mentoring of issues related to the 
housing sector. The draft Housing Bill proposes to establish a Housing Fund and an authority for 
the provision of housing. However, non-governmental sources pointed out that the draft fails to 
address the issues of forced evictions and slum upgrading. </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 35 
</p><p> 
194. The Government has also drafted a National Land Policy, which was recently approved by 
the Cabinet. It provides an overall framework and defines the key measures required to address 
issues such as land administration, access to land, land use planning, restitution of historical 
injustices, environmental degradation and informal urban settlements. Assessments from other 
sources state that, in its present form, the National Land Policy would provide for increased 
transparency and accountability. However, it is unclear when and if the policy will be adopted 
and in what form. 
</p>
<p>195. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;Human rights education, particularly on economic, social and 
cultural rights, should be improved. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the 
establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, and recommends that its 
capacity to undertake training and awareness-raising activities to this end be strengthened. 
A particularly useful model which could be considered for cities and provinces of Kenya is 
the &#8220;Human Rights Cities&#8221; initiative developed by the People&#8217;s Movement for Human 
Rights Education (PDHRE) which is currently being coordinated jointly by PDHRE and 
UNDP&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 82(d)) 
</p>
<p>196. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments in relation to this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>197. Information provided by other sources states that the Kenya National Commission on 
Human Rights (KNCHR) is strategically positioned to independently monitor the 
implementation of the right to adequate housing. This is due to a current absence of justiciable 
rights to housing, which is hoped to be overcome. However, while the KNCHR enjoys a great 
deal of operational independence, it does not have financial independence. Budgetary constraints 
help to explain why, despite successful efforts to train civil servants and sensitize the general 
public on human rights, a substantial gap in human rights education and training remains. The 
KNHCR on its own, or together with civil society actors, is unable to fill this gap. Hence, a need 
for stronger commitments from the government in relation to policies, programmes and 
resources dedicated to human rights education seems evident. 
</p>
<p>198. Observations provided by other sources also suggest that the Government has increased its 
efforts to ensure stakeholder participation in policy and strategy development. Nevertheless, a 
disproportionate reliance on newspapers for sharing information suggests room for improvement. 
Not only might newspapers not be readily accessible for the most vulnerable and marginalised 
groups, but low literacy rates and language barriers may also prevent information from reaching 
many target groups. An illustrative example is the fact that whilst women constitute over 50 
percent of Kenya&#8217;s population, they own just 5 percent of the land and remain largely unaware of 
their property rights, often due to illiteracy.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>199. Recommendation<b>: &#8220;The Government should consider the establishment of a tribunal 
on informal human settlements as a quasi-judicial body. The tribunal could be instituted 
under a relevant statute, such as the Government Lands Act, to provide remedies to the 
intractable problem of allocation of public land by the administration and authorities 
through illegal and irregular practices, including land speculation and land-grabbing. Such 
a tribunal should be empowered to investigate and determine the validity and merit of 
claims to property rights by settlers, and be guided by the principles of equality and non-</b></p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
page 36 
 
<b>discrimination. It should stipulate conditions for granting security of tenure over public 
land to deserving settlers and ensure that public land remains a common use resource&#8221;. 
</b>(paragraph 82 (f)) 
</p>
<p>200. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments in relation to this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>201. Information received from other sources indicates widespread support for the former 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation that a tribunal on informal human settlements be 
established. This is primarily because existing legislation, such as the Rent Restriction Act, does 
not explicitly extend to residents of informal settlements. A Commission of Inquiry into Illegal 
and Irregular Allocation of Public Land exists. It is mandated to investigate land allocation, to 
gather information relating to unlawful and irregular allocation, to compile lists of lands affected 
and actors involved, and to provide advice on issues of land recovery and taxes. In June 2004, 
the Commission released a report, which recommends the establishment of a Land Title Tribunal 
in order to embark upon the process of revocation and rectification of titles in Kenya. In its 
annex, the report included a draft Bill for the establishment of such a tribunal. Despite this 
promising step, a tribunal of this kind has yet to be created. 
</p>
<p>202. <b>&#8220;The Government could approach the OHCHR Technical Cooperation Programme 
and other institutions for assistance in the development and implementation of human 
rights programmes and action plans&#8221;. </b>(paragraph 82(g)) 
</p>
<p>203. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments in relation to this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>204. Information received from other sources suggests that the Government has approached 
international institutions for assistance where it has deemed cooperation to be desirable and 
feasible. 
</p>
<p>205. <b>&#8220;The authorities should enhance their cooperation with United Nations agencies and 
international institutions, in particular UN-Habitat and OHCHR, to adopt and integrate 
human rights in developing indicators and benchmarks for implementing and monitoring 
the Millennium Development Goals. The Government is also encouraged to work in 
partnership with NGOs and other civil society organizations proposing alternative 
development plans&#8221; </b>(paragraph 82 (h)) 
</p>
<p>206. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she did not receive any comments in relation to this 
recommendation from the Government and hopes that information will be provided in the near 
future. 
</p>
<p>207. Previous sections of this report have indicated cooperation with UN agencies and 
international institutions on projects that aim to contribute to the implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals. This is especially the case for the follow up section to the 
recommendations contained within paragraph 82 (c) of E/CN.4/2005/48/Add.2, which directly 
relates to the achievement of Millennium Development Goal 7, Target 11, to significantly </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/20/Add.2 
  page 37 
 
improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers by 2020. The fact that the Millennium 
Development Goals have yet to be fully achieved, suggests that there remains room for 
improvement in relation to cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b>General observations 
</b></p>
<p>208. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the efforts that have been made by governmental 
authorities, UN bodies and non-governmental organisations in working to address issues 
linked to the right to adequate housing. However, much still remains to be done, 
particularly in relation to matters on which the Government did not provide information to 
the Special Rapporteur. 
</b></p>
<p>209. <b>When taking measures to improve the situation of people living in extreme poverty 
and emergency situations, such as the former population of Huruma village, greater 
emphasis needs to be placed not only on the end result but also on the process. Relocations 
in Kenya are frequently marked by flawed implementation processes in which basic human 
rights of those affected are compromised. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
to take action to improve this record. 
</b></p>
<p>210. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the Government to expedite the delayed 
constitutional review. It is widely accepted that numerous current constitutional norms are 
discriminatory, inter alia, with respect to the rights of women and other vulnerable and 
marginalised groups, as well as the rights of people living in temporary accommodation. In 
finalising existent reform drafts, it is important to ensure that all economic, social and 
cultural rights, including the right to adequate housing and transparent eviction 
procedures, are entrenched. 
</b></p>
<p>211. <b>Despite initial efforts, great room for improvement remains in relation to the 
introduction and improvement of legislation addressing the issues of forced evictions, 
security of tenure, legalisation of informal settlements and slum upgrading. The draft 
National Land Policy needs to be adopted by Parliament in order to come into force. At the 
same time, the draft Housing Bill must be revised to address the issues of forced evictions 
and slum upgrading, and thereby fully recognise the right to adequate housing. It is 
important that the Government honours its commitment made in 2004 to halt evictions in 
informal settlements until compliance with international human rights standards can be 
guaranteed, that is, until appropriate policies have been drafted and introduced as national 
legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>212. <b>Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur sees a need for stronger governmental 
commitments aimed at the improvement of human rights education. 
</b></p>
<p>213. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate her predecessor&#8217;s calls for the 
establishment of a tribunal on informal human settlements, similar to the Land Title 
Tribunal proposed by the Commission of Inquiry into Illegal and Irregular Allocation of 
Public Land in 2004. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/13/20/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>214. <b>In addition to the observations included at the end of each section in regard to the 
States concerned, an analysis of the recommendations included in the present report reveal 
some key issues that the Human Rights Council should consider. 
</b></p>
<p>215. <b>A rights-based approach has been incorporated by States into new legislation. 
However, their implementation and practices in housing and urban policies and 
programmes sometimes fail to enforce those principles. The Special Rapporteur believes 
that actors dealing with issues related to the right to adequate housing, including public 
officials and institutions, United Nations agencies and international organizations and 
donors, too often continue to work without applying a rights-based approach and ignoring 
the different dimension of the right to adequate housing in their activities, planning and 
programmes. This lack of integration of a human rights perspective contributes to mixed 
results of programmes and initiatives. The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages all 
actors involved in housing issues, whether national or international, to receive adequate 
training on human rights, particularly on the right to adequate housing. 
</b></p>
<p>216. <b>Apart from the assessment of progress through the Universal Periodic Review and by 
Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures, the Special Rapporteur believes that it is important 
for States to internally review the progress made in human rights by organizing periodic 
national consultations with the active participation of civil society and all relevant actors.
