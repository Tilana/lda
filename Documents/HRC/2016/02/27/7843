<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
16/22 and decision 17/119, in which the Council requested the secretariat to provide an 
annual written update on the operations of the Voluntary Fund for Participation in the 
Universal Periodic Review and on the resources available to it. The present report provides 
an overview of contributions and expenditures as at 31 December 2012, together with a 
description of activities funded since the previous update (A/HRC/20/39). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Background 
</b></p>
<p>2. In the annex to its resolution 5/1, the Human Rights Council called for the 
establishment of a voluntary trust fund to facilitate the participation of developing 
countries, particularly least developed countries, in the universal periodic review 
mechanism. In its resolution 6/17, the Council requested the Secretary-General to establish, 
inter alia, such a fund, and requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) to take the necessary measures with a view to expeditiously 
operationalizing the mechanism. Member States, observers and other stakeholders of the 
Council were urged to support the operationalization of the Fund. In the annex to its 
resolution 16/21, the Council stated that the fund should be strengthened and 
operationalized in order to encourage a significant participation of developing countries, 
particularly least developed countries and small island developing States, in their review. 
</p>
<p>3. The Voluntary Fund for Participation in the Universal Periodic Review was 
established as a voluntary trust fund administered by the Secretary-General through 
OHCHR. An oversight through a board of trustees was considered unnecessary given the 
nature of the activities that the Fund was designed to support. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Mandate of the Fund  
</b></p>
<p>4. States and other stakeholders, such as intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations, private institutions and individuals, may make voluntary contributions to the 
Fund. All developing countries, including countries with economies in transition, are 
entitled to request financial assistance through the Fund. Particular attention when 
allocating financial support should be given to least developed countries. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Travel to meetings 
</b></p>
<p>5. Under the terms of reference of the Fund, financial support for travel to meetings is 
made available for official government representatives from developing countries, in 
particular least developed countries, to travel to Geneva in order to participate: 
</p>
<p> (a) In sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review during 
which their country is considered;  
</p>
<p>(b)  In plenary sessions of the Human Rights Council during which the outcome 
of their review is adopted. </p>


<p>6. Moreover, the Fund also provides for travel of official representatives of developing 
countries, in particular least developed countries, that are Members of the Human Rights 
Council and do not have a permanent mission in Geneva, to act as rapporteurs (namely, 
members of the &#8220;troika&#8221;).  
</p><p>7. Travel assistance consisting of a retroactive reimbursement of travel expenses is 
provided at the request of the State concerned. In accordance with United Nations rules and 
regulations, the Fund covers round-trip economy class travel for representatives not 
residing in Geneva, as well as daily subsistence allowance (DSA) at the rate applicable to 
Geneva at the time of travel. Upon receipt of a request, confirmation of approval is issued 
indicating the maximum reimbursable amount for ticket costs and DSA. 
</p>
<p>8. Following completion of travel and upon receipt of a travel claim with supporting 
documentation, reimbursement is made directly to the Government concerned, either 
through its Permanent Mission in Geneva or New York, or deposited directly to the bank 
account of a relevant ministry or government agency. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Pre-session briefings 
</b></p>
<p>9. Under the terms of reference of the Fund, briefings are organized prior to the 
sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review to assist countries in 
preparing for the review. The briefings consist of plenary segments and break-out group 
discussions during which the policies, procedures and modalities of the universal periodic 
review are examined, information is exchanged, and good practices and lessons learned are 
discussed concerning the organization of national consultations, the setting up of 
interministerial coordination mechanisms, the drafting of national reports and participation 
in the interactive dialogues held by the Working Group and the Human Rights Council in 
plenary session. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Financial situation of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>10. Table 1 shows the detailed financial situation of the Fund as at 31 December 2012 
(statement of income and expenditure).

 Includes disbursements and obligations ($5,434) 
</p>
<p>11. Since the establishment of the Fund, a total of 15 countries have made financial 
contributions. Table 2 below provides an overview of all contributions received. 
</p>
<p>12. While most of the contributions come from a small group of countries, 2012 
witnessed an expansion of the donor base. Given the universal nature of the mechanism, all 
Member States, including developing countries, are encouraged to contribute from within 
their means. 
</p>
<p>13. Since the Fund has not enjoyed a predictable pattern of income, substantial resources 
have been kept as a reserve for future activities. This accounts for the conservative 
disbursement pattern, which is intended to, inter alia, ensure that enough funding is 
available at all material times for travel of delegations requesting financial assistance.

<p><b> IV. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Travel to meetings 
</b></p>
<p>14. Only three States reviewed in 2012 requested financial assistance for travel to the 
sessions of the Working Group at which they were reviewed. Of these, one was a least 
developed country. One State requested financial assistance for travel to attend the session 
of the Human Rights Council for the adoption of the outcome of its review. 
</p>
<p>15. Table 3 below shows the breakdown of financial assistance by region and annual 
expenditures, complete with the amount authorized, status of reimbursement and total 
commitments to date with regard to the financial assistance provided for the travel of 
government delegates to Geneva.

</p>
<p><b>Total 70 188 189 103 388
Grand total  291 577</b></p>


<p>16. To date, all States elected to the Human Rights Council have a permanent mission in 
Geneva. Consequently, there have been no requests for financial assistance to participate in 
a session as a rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>17. A number of Member States have reported that the current reimbursement procedure 
is cumbersome, as it requires their national administrations and Permanent Missions to 
engage in a number of complicated administrative and auditing procedures in order to 
receive and justify the refunds. Moreover, this procedure is very slow, as reimbursements 
are only effected after the United Nations administration has received and processed the 
travel claims accompanied by original ticket receipts and detailed bank account 
information. Further restrictions have recently been imposed as a result of a United Nations 
advance purchase policy, which came into force on 1 June 2011 under the mandate of the 
Secretary-General to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The policy requires that all 
official travel requests, including for prepaid travel arranged directly by Member States, be 
received and ticketed at least 14 calendar days prior to departure. 
</p>
<p>18. In the light of the above, the secretariat has proposed a revision of the terms of 
reference of the Fund to allow for the advance purchase of tickets directly by OHCHR. The 
secretariat expects that the number of countries requesting travel assistance would increase 
significantly if an advance purchase mechanism were established. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Training 
</b></p>
<p>19. Briefings organized by the secretariat bring together both developing and developed 
countries. Only the participation of the former is covered by the Fund in the form of 
reimbursement of travel expenses and DSA. Briefings are usually initiated by the 
secretariat, but may also be organized at the request of States, other United Nations entities 
or intergovernmental organizations. They draw extensively on the experience of other 
States that have already been reviewed, as well as on the expertise of OHCHR regional 
offices, the secretariat and other intergovernmental or regional organizations. These forums 
for the exchange of information are aimed at helping States to organize a broad and 
participatory process of national consultation, to prepare a comprehensive and balanced 
national report and to become acquainted with the rules of procedure of the Working Group 
on the Universal Periodic Review and the plenary session of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>20. In early 2012, OHCHR management initiated an internal review aimed at assessing 
the feasibility of merging the Voluntary Fund for Participation in the Universal Periodic 
Review with the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the 
Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review, both of which were established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 6/17. The rationale for the proposed 
merger was the common thematic coverage, despite the operational and functional 
difference of the two funds. The review was also conducted bearing in mind the priorities 
described in resolution 16/21, which clearly differentiated between the two trust funds. The 
briefing activities carried out up to that point under the Voluntary Fund for Participation in 
the Universal Periodic Review were suspended in 2012 to allow the internal review to 
proceed.  
</p>
<p>21. At the initiative of Mauritius, which has been advocating increased assistance and 
support for least developed countries and small island developing States within the 
framework of the Human Rights Council, a preparatory briefing similar to the ones 
described in section II B above has been scheduled for July 2013, thus reinitiating the 
briefing activities briefly put on hold in 2012. The format of the Mauritius briefing has been 
slightly adjusted to focus on the specific needs of least developed countries and small island 
developing States in their engagement with the universal periodic review mechanism and, </p>


<p>more generally, the Council. The secretariat will thereafter resume its pre-session briefing 
activities on a regular basis in forthcoming years.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>22.<b> The Voluntary Fund for Participation in the Universal Periodic Review has 
been used to finance the participation of developing countries, and in particular least 
developed countries and small island developing States, in the sessions of the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review at which they are considered. Assistance has 
also been provided to those same Member States to enable them to participate in the 
adoption of their outcome document by the Human Rights Council at its plenary 
sessions. The Fund is also intended for the organization of field-based preparatory 
briefings to facilitate the participation of Member States in the universal periodic 
review. 
</b></p>
<p>23.<b> With regard to travel arrangements, while the parameters for financing the 
participation of developing country Member States in the sessions of the universal 
periodic review are consistent with established practice for the General Assembly, the 
post facto reimbursement procedure has proven unsatisfactory. Although some 
progress has been made since the previous report, further improvements are required. 
As of the second cycle of the universal periodic review, OHCHR has begun to fund 
two members of delegations of least developed countries and small island developing 
States travelling to Geneva for the review of their countries, instead of only one, as 
was previously the case. Efficiency would be greatly improved and simplification 
achieved, however, if OHCHR were authorized to make travel arrangements for 
Member States requesting such assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>24.<b> Pre-session briefings organized by the secretariat were briefly placed on hold in 
2012 owing to an internal management review aimed at assessing the feasibility of 
merging the two trust funds established in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/17. In July 2013, a preparatory briefing will be held in Mauritius, with a 
focus on the specific needs of least developed countries and small island developing 
States and their engagement with the Council, in particular the universal periodic 
review. The secretariat is planning to resume a regular calendar of preparatory 
briefings.
