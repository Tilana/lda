<p><i>Summary 
</i> Pursuant to the mandate contained in Human Rights Council resolution 24/3 and at 
the invitation of the Government of Kazakhstan, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, conducted a follow-up mission to 
Kazakhstan from 25 to 27 March 2014. In the present report, she assesses the new 
developments since her first visit in September 2012 and the initiatives taken by the 
Government to combat forced and bonded labour, as well as the worst forms of child 
labour, and provides an overview of the normative action taken and the system of labour 
inspections. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the swift action taken in response to some 
of her recommendations, but found that some challenges remained and required further 
action.  
</p>
<p> Kazakhstan is experiencing a growing demand for workers in a variety of sectors in 
which contemporary forms of slavery, and forced and bonded labour, persist, in particular 
in the tobacco, cotton and construction industries. In accordance with the recommendations 
formulated by the Special Rapporteur at the end of her initial visit, the Government has 
simplified the process involved in the issuance of work permits in order to facilitate the 
regularization of migrant and seasonal workers. The Special Rapporteur found that the

<p>process nevertheless remains cumbersome and that some new requirements that have been 
introduced may inadvertently have an adverse impact, in that they make it more difficult for 
migrant workers to secure regular employment status and thus make them more vulnerable 
to abuse. The amendments to the anti-trafficking legislation adopted in 2013 now make 
specific reference to forced labour; the new Criminal Code, however, which was under 
preparation at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, does not include criminal liability 
for forced labour. It is essential in the fight against contemporary forms of slavery that 
slavery and slavery-like practices, including domestic servitude, forced and bonded labour 
and forced early marriage are clearly designated as crimes in the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p> Some advances have been made to eliminate the worst forms of child labour. In 
2012, the Ministry of Education issued order No. 398, which allows children of migrant 
workers, including seasonal workers, to attend schools with the same rights as Kazakh 
children. It does not, however, address barriers to access to education, such as identification 
requirements for children of undocumented seasonal workers. Similarly, access to health-
care services for migrant workers and their families, beyond emergency cases, must be 
ensured, irrespective of migration status. 
</p>
<p> The system of labour inspections, which are key factors in identifying slavery and 
slavery-like practices, needs to be further strengthened and provide for regular and 
unplanned visits of trained inspectors. The Special Rapporteur was moreover concerned at 
the recent introduction of a moratorium of labour inspections until January 2015.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences conducted an official visit to Kazakhstan from 25 to 27 March 2014, to 
follow up on the mission she conducted in 2012,1 to assess new developments and the 
initiatives taken by the Government in response to her recommendations. In particular, she 
sought to discuss the measures taken and their impact with regard to the eradication of 
slavery and slavery-like practices, such as forced and bonded labour. To that end, she also 
sought information on contemporary forms of slavery in the country, to review legislation 
relating to contemporary forms of slavery and to address the causes and consequences of 
this practice. During her mission the Special Rapporteur engaged with various government 
authorities, law enforcement agencies, international and non-governmental organizations, 
trade unions, community members, business companies and others working in the area of 
combating all forms of slavery. She also had extensive consultations with the Minister for 
Internal Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Labour and Social 
Welfare, representatives of the Ministry of Justice and the General Prosecutor and other 
senior government representatives, and with civil society actors, trade unions, private 
business (Philip Morris Kazakhstan) and the United Nations country team.  
</p><p>2. The Special Rapporteur expresses her thanks to the Government of Kazakhstan for 
its invitation, and the assistance and cooperation provided prior to and during her mission. 
She sincerely appreciated all contributions and expresses her gratitude for the continuation 
of this anti-slavery dialogue, in a spirit of cooperation to work towards the eradication of 
contemporary forms of slavery, in particular forced labour, bonded labour and the worst 
forms of child labour, in Kazakhstan. She also greatly appreciated the assistance provided 
by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the cooperation of the United Nations country team 
and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 
facilitating the visit.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur shared her preliminary findings with the Government at 
the conclusion of her mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b>4. The economy of Kazakhstan is considered to be the largest in Central Asia, mainly 
owing to its natural resources, in particular oil and natural gas, and its agricultural assets 
(vegetable, tobacco and cotton plantations).Economic growth has supported the 
development of other sectors as well, in particular the construction industry and domestic 
work, thereby creating a demand for labour that exceeds the national workforce. In the light 
of this economic success and the employment opportunities it offers, Kazakhstan became a 
major destination for migrant and seasonal workers, in particular from neighbouring 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, as well as from China.  
5. Although no reliable data or statistics are currently available, it has been estimated 
that Kazakhstan hosts between 2 million and 3 million migrants. Given that most of the 
workforce is employed in plantations and construction, workers from neighbouring 
countries mostly come to work in sectors in which they are particularly exposed to 
contemporary forms of slavery.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See A/HRC/24/43/Add.1. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>6. The existing migration policy and its system of management is inchoate, 
administratively overburdened and still conceived and regulated according to parameters of 
safety and security, thereby severely limiting opportunities for authorized and lawful 
employment. Legal employment would be the best protection for seasonal and migrant 
workers from contemporary forms of slavery.  
</p>
<p>7. Government authorities referred to the fact that, in their efforts to regularize and 
formalize the informal economy, regulations required that migration be managed by 
reducing the quota for migrant workers considerably (by nearly half) combined with an 
explicit policy of national preference in employment. Under the quota system, individual 
work permits are granted to employers rather than to migrants, which makes them 
dependent on employers and unable to legalize their situation by themselves or to seek work 
elsewhere in the event of abuse. Despite the visa-free regime that Kazakhstan enjoys with 
neighbouring members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, migrants still have to 
register with the migration police to live legally in the country, and permanent registration is 
a condition of access to economic and social rights.  
</p>
<p>8. In order to obtain regular status, migrant workers need a migration card in order to 
register their residency officially and to receive a work permit. Their employer must also 
have an official licence to hire foreign citizens. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Status of anti-slavery action 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forced and bonded labour and the worst forms of child labour  
</b></p>
<p>9. The complexity of the legal framework has led to illegal labour migration, which 
constitutes a serious problem in Kazakhstan, given that illegally working migrants are 
particularly vulnerable to forced and bonded labour.  
</p>
<p>10. Kazakhstan has a growing demand for workers in a variety of sectors in which 
contemporary forms of slavery exist; in particular, forced and bonded labour persists in the 
tobacco, cotton and construction industry. A majority of the migrants come for 
approximately six months to harvest tobacco and cotton.  
</p>
<p>11. Child labour persists among children of migrant workers and Kazakh children 
alike. In tobacco and cotton plantations, children account for more than half of the total 
workforce.2 
</p>
<p>12. Progress has been made in the fight against the worst forms of child labour and 
forced and bonded labour in tobacco plantations. Poor working conditions in tobacco 
farming, however, persist: these include long working hours with little rest, and limited 
access to accommodation, water, nutrition, sanitation and hygiene. Workers in the tobacco 
industry are moreover exposed to high temperatures in the summer period, as well as to 
pesticides and the risk of contracting green tobacco sickness, which is caused by the 
absorption of nicotine when the skin comes into contact with wet tobacco leaves. Children 
who work in the cotton and tobacco industry are particularly vulnerable to the hazardous 
conditions, which have a negative impact on their developing bodies. The health hazards 
associated with tobacco and cotton farming are of particular concern regarding migrant 
workers without regular status owing to the fact that, since the introduction of the individual

</p>
<p>identification number, they and their family members only have access to emergency health 
care.  
</p>
<p>13. The confiscation of identity documents, though prohibited by Kazakh law, and the 
frequent delays in payment at the end of the season, a common practice in tobacco 
cultivation, also contribute to making migrant workers heavily dependent on their 
employers, given that, if they decide to leave the farm before the end of the harvest, they are 
forced to forfeit their earnings for the work already done.  
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that, despite the commitment and 
support of the tobacco industry and the steps taken to increase protection for migrant 
tobacco workers, the risk of debt bondage and cases of hazardous child labour persist on 
some farms.  
</p>
<p>15. In following up on her previous visit, the Special Rapporteur met with Philip 
Morris Kazakhstan (PMK) to continue the dialogue started with the company in 2012. 
PMK, a subsidiary of Philip Morris International, one of the world&#8217;s largest tobacco 
companies, is the sole purchaser of tobacco in the Enbekshikazakh district of Almaty 
province, the main tobacco farming area of Kazakhstan, and as such bears a special 
responsibility to ensure that there is no use of child labour, or forced or bonded labour, in 
tobacco plantations.  
</p>
<p>16. PMK pointed out that the visit by the Special Rapporteur in 2012 had helped to 
keep the issue of forced labour on the State&#8217;s agenda, and had strengthened efforts to 
eradicate this form of slavery in the tobacco industry, the result of the joint action of several 
stakeholders, including the Government, PMK and non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>17. PMK stressed its commitment to the fight against child labour, and bonded and 
forced labour, and described a number of measures taken in that regard. It added that there 
were certain issues that PMK could not address on its own. 
</p>
<p>18. PMK uses standard written contracts between PMK farmers and employees to 
ensure compliance with Kazakh legislation and to avoid the worst forms of child labour, 
forced labour and involuntary retention of workers&#8217; identity documents. The contracts 
included minimum wages and other labour standards.  
</p>
<p>19. Other PMK initiatives included the funding of child labour prevention programmes 
in the form of summer camps for children of migrant and non-migrant tobacco farmers, a 
kindergarten and a community centre with playgrounds in remote farming areas, and 
vocational training for children over the age of 15.  
</p>
<p>20. PMK highlighted its &#8220;best farmer&#8221; award, which is attributed annually to promote 
best practices among farmers in terms of quantity and quality, as well as in labour 
conditions. No child labour or written employment contracts are included in the selection 
criteria.  
</p>
<p>21. Another means to tackle the problems in the tobacco industry was the national 
round table, which is co-sponsored by PMK and the Ministry of Labour, and includes 
participants from the Ministry of Education, non-governmental organizations, farmers and 
international agencies. 
</p>
<p>22. In spite of the above-mentioned efforts, PMK acknowledged that cases of child 
labour were still reported on tobacco plantations, even though their number had decreased. 
PMK promised to provide the Special Rapporteur with detailed figures and data for her 
information, although she has yet to receive anything to date. PMK explained that, in proven 
cases of child labour, the land cultivated by the PMK farmer concerned would be reduced 
by 10 per cent in the coming year as a penalty. Moreover, non-governmental organizations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>had a critical role to play, not only in preventing the occurrence of child labour, bonded or 
forced labour but also in reacting to alleged cases.  
</p>
<p>23. Notably, the Local Community Foundation, a non-governmental organization 
network, is the &#8220;ears and eyes&#8221; of non-governmental organizations, monitoring the situation 
on the ground on the basis of a peer-to-peer approach. The Foundation also mediates 
between workers and employers and offers a hotline, which was set up in March 2012, for 
all migrant workers in the tobacco and vegetable crops industry. It also has a mobile team 
that addresses complaints received by conducting follow-up visits on the ground.  
</p>
<p>24. PMK moreover employed field forces and agronomists, who receive training on 
child labour, passport retention, living conditions and access to education for children, and 
also monitor tobacco quality and labour standards. They carry out inspections or 
unannounced visits on tobacco farms. They also check wage records to ensure that workers 
are not in bonded labour. PMK recognized, however, that labour inspections were 
insufficient, and that the time constraints faced during inspections left a margin for error.  
</p>
<p>25. Given the lack of awareness by migrant workers of the necessary legal documents 
and the programmes available to them if they require assistance, PMK had also undertaken 
awareness-raising activities and published pamphlets on slavery conventions and inform 
migrant workers about their rights.  
</p>
<p>26. Only some 10 per cent of the projects under the plan of action for the period 2012-
2014 had been implemented to date. As a donor, PMK could not select its implementing 
partners, but had to follow a complicated State bidding process to select the least expensive 
tender. 
</p>
<p>27. Some advances had been made in eliminating the worst forms of child labour since 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous visit. In 2012, the Ministry of Education issued Order No. 
398, which allows children of migrant workers, including seasonal workers, to attend 
schools with the same rights as Kazakh children.3  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that Order No. 398 still does not address 
barriers to access to education, such as identification requirements for children of 
undocumented seasonal workers. National legislation should be brought into line with the 
State&#8217;s international obligations with regard to the universal and unimpeded right to 
education.  
</p>
<p>29. In 2012, the National Coordinating Council on Child Labour approved a joint plan 
of action and joint work plan for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour and the 
implementation of the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) in Kazakhstan for the period 2012-2014. The 
Council also finalized the mapping of legislation and policies in Kazakhstan, such as plans 
of action and State and national programmes on child labour and youth employment, to 
facilitate future collaboration between the Government and its partners on these issues. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that, in 2013, child labour monitoring 
systems had been piloted in five villages, and that direct services had been provided for 
children at risk of, or involved in, the worst forms of child labour. 
</p>
<p>31. The Government had also conducted a public awareness-raising campaign on 
hazardous child labour in the Almaty and South Kazakhstan regions.  
</p>
<p>32. In May 2013, a regional workshop was held on improving the regulation of 
migration policies at the local level. The event was co-organized by the Administration of

</p>
<p>the Southern Kazakhstan Region, the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and 
the Empowerment of Women. In November 2013, the first Regional Migration Forum was 
held in Almaty with a view to strengthening regional cooperation and partnership with 
Kyrgyzstan in the implementation of bilateral agreements on labour migration. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiatives taken by the Government of 
Kazakhstan to address the demand side of forced labour and slavery-like working conditions 
at the regional level. Regional cooperation, dialogue and the sharing of best practices are 
crucial elements to curb the exploitation of migrants. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Normative action  
</b></p>
<p>34. There are two broad categories of migrants: ethnic Kazakhs abroad who have 
repatriated to their historical homeland (<i>oralman</i>); and unskilled and semi-skilled migrant 
workers, essentially from neighbouring countries. The latter category is commonly referred 
to as <i>gastarbeitery</i> (&#8220;guest workers&#8221;), the Russified plural form of the German <i>Gastarbeiter</i>. 
Unlike in the German context, however, the <i>gastarbeitery</i> do not have any legal status or 
social protection.4 
</p>
<p>35. There are currently no data to reflecting the actual number of migrant workers in 
Kazakhstan owing to methodological shortcomings in the documentation of migrants. The 
Ministry of Internal Affairs calculates the number of migrants on the basis of entries and 
exits on the migration card, and makes no distinction between those transiting through the 
country and those who stay. Moreover, the fact that migrants are mobile and whose status 
fluctuates between documented and undocumented, sometimes without their knowledge, 
further complicates the collection of data on migrants. There is a need for sound 
methodology and reliable data and statistics.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that her recommendation on the need 
to change the complex and lengthy process of issuance of work permits, which significantly 
constrained the opportunities for legal employment and hence increased the vulnerability of 
migrants, had been accepted by the Government. She welcomes the Government&#8217;s initiative 
to amend the legislation on migration. As she pointed out in her previous report, the 
simplification of the work permit issuance process is essential to allow for the legalization 
of migrant workers.  
</p>
<p>37. In 2009, changes in government policy rendered migrant tobacco workers 
especially vulnerable to abuse because they were no longer able to secure regular 
employment status. Moreover, many employers did not declare workers because of the 
amount of bureaucracy involved, besides being unwilling to pay the taxes associated with 
hiring labourers.  
</p>
<p>38. In 2013, a new law on amendments and additions to certain legislative acts 
concerning labour migration, which was prepared by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 The term <i>Gastarbeiter</i> has in Germany a very specific connotation and cannot be transposed to the 
</p>
<p>juridical and sociocultural context of Kazakhstan. The <i>Gastarbeiter</i> were legal workers actively 
brought to Germany in the 1950s to work as contract labourers and who enjoyed legal and social 
protection. See also Institute of Developing Countries/Japan External Trade Organization, &#8220;Exploring 
Informal Networks in Kazakhstan: A Multidimensional Approach&#8221;, 2013 (available from 
www.ide.go.jp/Japanese/Publish/Download/Report/2012/pdf/C24_contents.pdf), chap. II. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>order to regulate the activities of migration workers, was adopted. The proposed law made 
changes to the Labour Code, the Code on taxes and other obligatory payments, and the law 
on migration.  
</p>
<p>39. A work permit is issued to a migrant worker, who is citizen of a State with which 
there are agreements on visa-free entrance and stay, for a period of up to three months, with 
the possibility of extension up to one year. According to the amendments made to the law 
on migration, it is now possible for up to five migrant and seasonal workers to be hired at 
the same time, without having to go through the whole administrative process each time. 
While this measure is intended to facilitate the regularization of migrant workers, there are 
concerns that the limitation to five migrant workers may contribute inadvertently to corrupt 
practices.  
</p>
<p>40. The amendments also made changes to the taxation of migrant workers, whose 
income is no longer taxable at the source of income. It in fact introduced the requirement of 
advance payment of income tax, equivalent to twice the monthly calculation index, in order 
to obtain a work permit. The amendment could have the effect of increasing the number of 
undocumented workers and making them more vulnerable to bonded labour.  
</p>
<p>41. With the exception of the right to apply for an extension of a work permit, only the 
obligations of migrant workers, including seasonal workers, are laid down in the law. The 
law should also specify, in accordance with international human rights standards, the right 
to enjoy just and favourable work conditions,5 including fair wages and remuneration, safe 
and healthy working conditions, equal promotion opportunities and rest, reasonable working 
hours and leave. The right to establish and join trade unions should also be included in the 
law. 
</p>
<p>42. Article 128 of the Criminal Code of 1997<b> </b>punishes all forms of trafficking of 
persons for the purpose of sexual or other exploitation. This is the only general <i>corpus 
delicti</i> of exploitation, with no specific definition of the different contemporary forms of 
slavery and slavery-like practices. Forced marriage, forced continuation of marital 
cohabitation and obstructing the entry of a woman into a marriage of her choice are not 
punishable acts under the Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>43. In 2013, Kazakhstan amended its trafficking legislation. The law on the 
introduction of amendments and addenda to some legislative acts of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan on issues related to the fight against trafficking in human beings spells out what 
is construed as &#8220;exploitation&#8221; in articles 126, 128 and 133, and includes forced labour, 
which it defines as &#8220;forced labour that is understood as any work or service demanded from 
a person by means of the use of force or threat thereof and for the performance of which the 
person has not offered their services voluntarily, with the exception of cases stipulated by 
the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>44. The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that trafficking victims could not be prosecuted 
for crimes committed as a result of being trafficked. In practice, however, the response of 
law enforcement authorities is often inadequate; investigations remain incomplete, while 
trafficking victims are ignored and discounted, or even treated like criminals and either 
prosecuted for immigration violations and/or deported. A lack of enforcement hampers any 
attempt to enact effective rules and regulations. 
</p>
<p>45. Labour inspectors do not identify victims of trafficking, as they believe that 
trafficking is a criminal activity that should be addressed by the Migrant Police and 
therefore does not fall within their remit.

</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the General Prosecutor that a new 
Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code were under preparation. According to non-
governmental sources, no explicit criminal liability for forced labour is provided for under 
the new code. In the fight against contemporary forms of slavery, it is essential that slavery 
and slavery-like practices, including domestic servitude, forced and bonded labour and 
forced early marriage, are clearly designated as crimes in the Criminal Code. On 9 April 
2014, the Lower House of Parliament adopted the new Criminal Code and Criminal 
Procedure Code, which will come into force in January 2015. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Labour inspections  
</b></p>
<p>47. Labour inspectors in Kazakhstan monitor compliance with labour legislation and 
inform employers of breaches of law. They are also mandated to identify the reasons for 
such violations and to make recommendations on how to remedy them. 
</p>
<p>48. Labour inspectors do not have the authority to visit enterprises on their own 
initiative; they may only carry out inspections on the basis of planned visits or in response to 
complaints from individuals, legal entities or State authorities concerning violations of 
labour legislation, or in cases of threats posed to the life or health of employees. 
Anonymous complaints are not considered grounds for an unplanned visit. Moreover, it is 
rare that labour inspectors conduct follow-up visits to verify compliance. 
</p>
<p>49. The Labour Code limits the number of inspection visits that companies can 
receive. Large enterprises can only be inspected once a year, while small- and medium-sized 
enterprises may be inspected only once every three years. In 2008 and the first half of 2009, 
a moratorium was declared on planned inspection visits (including those conducted by other 
bodies). 
</p><p>50. Planned visits for the following year are determined on the basis of a &#8220;black list&#8221; of 
enterprises published by the State Labour Inspectorate. Companies may be removed from 
the list if they are able to show that conditions have improved (this was reportedly the case 
for PMK). 
51. A decree of The President of Kazakhstan declared a new moratorium on 
inspections of small- and medium-sized businesses from 2 April 2014 until 1 January 2015. 
The justification provided to the Special Rapporteur for the measure was that inspections 
slow down economic development and that the moratorium will improve the conditions for 
doing business in Kazakhstan. The Special Rapporteur disagrees with this rationale. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of Kazakhstan for its 
cooperative commitment and efforts to fight all forms of slavery and slavery-like 
practices. She hopes that the Government will continue along this path of cooperation. 
The Special Rapporteur is also pleased that the Government has not only 
acknowledged but also accepted and implemented some of her recommendations in the 
short time since her first mission to the country, in September 2012. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The Government should adopt a comprehensive and systemic legal and policy 
approach to the eradication of contemporary forms of slavery. A holistic, sustainable 
and efficient approach should be taken, involving a review and analysis of all current 
relevant laws, policies, programmes and practices to ensure subsequent streamlined 
action. The Special Rapporteur also stresses the need for a substantive survey and for 
the collection of disaggregated data and statistics by means of a methodology that </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b>captures the complexity of all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices to the extent 
possible, while protecting personal information and the right to privacy. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Recommendations for the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislation, policies and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates her view that existing slavery legislation 
should be revised to bring it into line with international standards, with a clear and 
delineated corpus of all forms of slavery, inter alia, forced and bonded labour, and the 
worst forms of child labour and domestic servitude. Provisions for punishment should 
be commensurate with the crime committed, while strong human rights protection 
mechanisms should be provided for the victims of slavery, including the rights to 
compensation and reintegration. It is also important that protection, compensation and 
reintegration schemes be enshrined in law. The Special Rapporteur also underlines the 
need to urgently put in place enforcement and monitoring mechanisms to implement 
fully laws and policies aimed at eliminating all forms of slavery in the country. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>With regard to the protection and rehabilitation of trafficked persons, the 
Government should invest in support services and protection mechanisms, and provide 
financial support to help victims to recover from the experience of trafficking and to 
rebuild their lives. The enforcement of anti-slavery legislation should take a victim-
centred approach, focusing not only on the investigation and prosecution of traffickers 
but also support for victims. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>There is a lack of certainty and predictability with regard to the legal 
framework in Kazakhstan. Article 2 of the new law on migration, for instance, refers 
to &#8220;other laws&#8221; dealing with migration issues, but does not specify which ones. Such 
lack of clarity leads to difficulties in the implementation and enforcement of laws. It is 
therefore essential that this be rectified and that laws, when referring to &#8220;other laws&#8221; 
regulating migration-related matters, list them by specifying the name of the law and, 
when applicable, the concrete provision. Legal provisions need to be predictable, 
defined and conform to the principle of legal certainty. There is furthermore a need to 
clarify in the laws the concrete circumstances in which other legislation may take 
precedence. Limitations of the scope of primary legislation should constitute an 
exception, and take precedence over related provisions in other laws.</b> <b>The Special 
Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the Government recognized the need to revise 
existing legislation in order to provide for a systematized protection mechanism, and 
notes that it expressed the desire for expertise in the law-making process in this 
regard.  
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Although the law on amendments and additions to certain legislative acts 
concerning labour migration has simplified the issuance of work permits, it remains 
cumbersome and should be revised further. The list of documents required is still very 
long. The amendments also provide for the possibility of hiring five migrant workers 
without having to repeat the whole administrative process each time. Migrant workers 
hired under this arrangement will enjoy regular status. The Special Rapporteur is, 
however, concerned that the limitation of hiring up to five workers may contribute 
inadvertently to corrupt practices. Moreover, the amendments introduce the 
requirement of advance payment of income tax in order to obtain a work permit, 
which could force migrant workers to stay with an employer against their will. If 
payment is made by the employer, it could create an impression of worker ownership, 
which should be avoided.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>58. <b>The new law on migration should specify the rights of migrant workers and 
seasonal workers in accordance with international human rights standards, the right 
to enjoy just and favourable work conditions, including fair wages and remuneration, 
safe and healthy working conditions, equal promotion opportunities and rest, 
reasonable working hours and leave. The right to establish and join trade unions 
should also be included in the law. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned at the moratorium on 
inspections of small- and medium-sized businesses until 1 January 2015. 
</b>60. <b>The Government should strengthen the labour inspection system, in 
particular the mandate of the Committee for Control and Social Protection of the 
Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, and sufficient human, financial and 
technical resources should be allocated to ensure regular visits of labour inspectors 
and systematic investigation of allegations of forced labour. Tools should be developed 
to receive urgent individual complaints and to provide appropriate responses. The 
number and scope of impromptu labour inspections of agricultural, construction and 
services sites should be increased and conducted regularly as an essential element in 
the fight against slavery and slavery-like practices, in particular forced labour and the 
worst forms of child labour. Such inspections should not be scheduled in advance, nor 
should the businesses concerned be informed of inspections beforehand. Inspections 
should be carried out by adequately trained inspectors and without prior notification, 
in accordance with the State&#8217;s international obligations. In order to tackle hazardous 
child labour, labour inspectors should follow the relevant ILO instruments relating to 
international labour standards and guiding principles on labour administration and 
labour inspections, and provide information on hazardous child labour to employers 
and workers, including advice on how to eliminate it. Follow-up visits to monitor 
progress and compliance are also necessary. Moreover, as part of awareness-raising 
efforts, information on the activities of labour inspectors in the area of slavery and the 
rights of local workers and migrants should be developed and distributed on a regular 
basis. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Forced and bonded labour persists in the tobacco, cotton and construction 
industry. Some progress has been made in the tobacco industry as a result of the 
commitment and support of the tobacco industry and the steps taken to increase 
protection for migrant tobacco workers. The Government should extend its efforts to 
other sectors, in particular the cotton and the construction industries. The Special 
Rapporteur also wishes to remind the Government and companies of the need to 
implement the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the issuance of an order to guarantee 
access to school for all children living in Kazakhstan, thus allowing children of 
seasonal workers to attend school. She notes, however, that the order has not been 
fully implemented given that it does not address barriers to access to education, such 
as identification requirements for children of undocumented seasonal workers. 
Similarly, access to health-care services for migrant workers and their families, 
beyond emergency cases, needs to be ensured irrespective of migration status. National 
legislation should be brought into line with the State&#8217;s international obligations with 
regard to the universal and unimpeded right to education and to guarantee equal 
health for all within its borders, in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Government should ratify the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and relevant ILO 
conventions on migrants, namely, the Migration for Employment Convention 
(Revised), 1949 (No. 97) and the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention, 1975 (No. 143) (1975). The Government should also re-consider its stance 
and ratify the ILO Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189). 
</b>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates her view that an effective system of direct 
complaints for migrant workers and all who are subject to violations of their labour 
rights should be established and applications rigorously addressed. Information about 
the complaint mechanism should be disseminated throughout the country and 
specifically in the regions with a larger proportion of migrant workers; it should also 
be provided in the languages understood by them. The National Ombudsman&#8217;s office 
should provide support for victims of slavery when they seek redress. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>It is necessary to establish a dedicated compensation facility, including a 
special fund, for victims of contemporary forms of slavery. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Awareness-raising and training 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of educating the general 
public and relevant government officials about what constitutes slavery and other 
slavery-like practices and the protection mechanisms that are in place for victims.</b> 
<b>Anti-slavery laws should be popularized and made publicly available, and slavery 
conventions should be published in the official gazette.</b> <b>Awareness-raising needs to be 
complemented by special training for judges, investigators, prosecutors, the police 
force and labour inspectors, including on human rights education, to build the 
knowledge required to identify slavery and slavery-like practices. The Special 
Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the Government recognized this need and 
expressed its desire for assistance in this regard.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B. Recommendations for the business community 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the prevalence of forced 
and bonded labour, as well as the worst forms of child labour, in the tobacco, cotton 
and construction industry, and calls upon business enterprises to adhere to 
international standards preventing the use of child labour and forced labour, as well as 
to the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Businesses should include 
human rights principles, including provisions on the prevention of and protection 
against slavery and slavery-like practices, in all contracts with famers, suppliers and 
subcontractors. 
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  Recommendations for the international community 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur noted the positive and substantial role of the 
international community in working with all stakeholders in Kazakhstan to combat 
slavery and slavery-like practices. She calls upon the international community to 
continue to support its work and that of civil society in Kazakhstan. She also urges the 
international community to assist Kazakhstan in bridging the knowledge gap by 
assisting it in information analysis on contemporary forms of slavery and slavery-like 
practices. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the international community to respond 
positively to the Government&#8217;s requests for assistance, particularly with regard to 
training and law-making assistance, as well as to rights-based normative action.
