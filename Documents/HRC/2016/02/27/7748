</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of China indicated that it established an inter-agency task force 
composed of nearly 30 national legislative, administrative and judiciary departments to 
prepare the report and held consultations with more than 20 representative NGOs and 
academic institutions, and solicited public opinion through a website. 
</p>
<p>6. The recommendations accepted four years ago either have been implemented or are 
being carried out. Fully respecting and protecting human rights was identified as one of the 
goals in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. 
</p>
<p>7. China formulated and published the National Human Rights Action Plan of China 
(2012&#8211;2015) in June 2012. 
</p><p>8. From 2008 to 2012, rural and urban income increased by 9.9 per cent and 8.8 per 
cent annually. China implemented the Outline of Development-Oriented Poverty Reduction 
for China&#8217;s Rural Areas (2011&#8211;2020), leading to a drastic decline in those among the rural 
population living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>9. In the past four years, China helped 28 million university graduates find jobs. In 
2012, 12.66 million urban jobs were created and 260 million rural migrant workers found 
jobs in cities. China established a minimum wage adjustment mechanism generally. </p>


<p>10. The ratio of government spending on education to GDP increased from 3.31 per cent 
to 4.07 per cent. Free nine-year compulsory education has been accessible throughout the 
country. 
</p>
<p>11. China has established a nationwide primary medical insurance system and over 1.3 
billion people have joined various medical insurance schemes. The subsistence allowance 
programme has basically covered all urban and rural areas.  
</p>
<p>12. From 2009 to 2012, the Government set aside over 450 billion yuan in assistance 
funds to build government-subsidized urban apartments and renovate shanty areas. 
</p>
<p>13. China has made the reduction of major pollutants a mandatory target in economic 
and social development and taken steps to improve mechanisms, strengthen supervision and 
resolve outstanding environmental problems. 
</p>
<p>14. China encourages greater public involvement in the legislative process by publishing 
draft laws and holding hearings, discussions and forums. 
</p>
<p>15. Deputies to the People&#8217;s Congresses are to be elected on the same population ratio in 
both urban and rural areas. Direct elections are held for more than 98 per cent of villagers&#8217; 
committees. 
</p>
<p>16. All 60 tasks of the judicial system reform have been completed. The Amendment 
VIII to the Criminal Law abolished the death penalty for 13 economic and non-violent 
crimes. The procedures for the review of death penalty and the system to exclude the use of 
illegal evidence were improved and the application of coercive measures standardized. 
</p>
<p>17. China has taken concrete actions in protecting people&#8217;s freedom of speech and 
freedom of religious belief in accordance with law. People can express views freely through 
microblogs, postings and other means. There are 5,500 religious organizations, 100 
religious universities and 140,000 sites for religious activities.  
</p>
<p>18. China has put the Law against Domestic Violence on its legislative agenda. 
Mechanisms designed to assist and guarantee the rights of orphans, children with 
disabilities and HIV/AIDS-affected children have been improved. Old-age insurance 
schemes had covered all rural areas and non-working urban residents. 
</p>
<p>19. Minority ethnic groups enjoy extensive human rights. Their freedom of religious 
belief and the right to use and develop their spoken and written languages are respected and 
guaranteed.  
</p>
<p>20. China is party to 26 international conventions and worked hard to implement them. 
Every year, China holds human rights dialogues or consultations with 20 countries. China 
has provided economic and technical assistance to other developing countries to help them 
realize their right to development. 
</p>
<p>21. China will increase its annual donation to OHCHR to US$ 800,000. It will receive 
the Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice and 
three other special procedures.  
</p>
<p>22. China faces difficulties and challenges in promoting and protecting human rights. 
Unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable development remains an acute problem. Too 
many people still live in poverty. A balanced income distribution structure is yet to be put 
in place. Judicial injustice exists. 
</p><p>23. Hong Kong, China, implemented the statutory minimum wage in 2011 and amended 
the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance in 2012. The methods of selecting the Chief 
Executive in 2017 and forming the Legislative Council in 2016 should be strictly in 
accordance with the Basic Law and relevant interpretations and decisions of the Standing 
Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress. It will continue to enhance the protection of </p>


<p>the rights of persons with disabilities, women and children, and provide support to 
individual groups, such as people with an ethnic minority background or a different sexual 
orientation. 
</p>
<p>24. Macao, China, has continued expanding resources for the optimization of all policies
