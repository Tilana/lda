Of: Inoke J.

INTRODUCTION

[1]     
This is an appeal from the Nadi Magistrates Court in respect of the learned Magistrates refusal to issue the applicant with a General Certificate to act as a Bailiff under s 3 of the Distress for Rent Act [Cap 36].

GROUNDS OF APPEAL

[2]     
The main ground of appeal was that the Magistrate took into account the applicants previous convictions, the last dating back to 23 October 1989.

[3]     
It appears that the Magistrate was swayed by a Police report recommending that the application be refused because of these convictions.

CONSIDERATION OF THE APPEAL

[4]     
The applicant was unrepresented and may not have drawn His Worships attention to the Rehabilitation of Offenders (Irrelevant Convictions) Act 1997.

[5]     
Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Act, so far as relevant here makes convictions of more than 10 years irrelevant for consideration. The last of the convictions here was close to 20 years ago. Sections 9, 12 and 15 of the Act prohibit the learned Magistrate from taking those irrelevant convictions into account. His Worship clearly erred in this regard.

[6]     
I note that the police officer responsible for disclosing the applicants irrelevant convictions may have committed an offence under s 22 of the Act. I do not have power to expunge the applicants convictions but I can order that all copies of the Police report submitted to Court be destroyed and order accordingly.

[7]     
Counsel also drew my attention to the case of State v Koroi [2002] FJHC 144; HAA0050J.2002S (12 August 2002) where Justice Shameem said: "I do not consider that (the learned Magistrate) erred in ignoring the two previous convictions of the Respondent. They are more than 20 years old and were rightly disregarded."

[8]     
The applicant had been issued with a Bailiffs Certificate in 2005 and 2006. In 2007 and 2008 he went to Liberia as a security officer with an American company under contract with the Liberian Government. He produced his Identification Card issued by that company to prove his absence from Fiji in those years. It was only after he came back that he re-applied for his Certificate.

[9]     
In these circumstances, I find that the applicant is a fit and proper person and the learned Magistrate erred in not granting him a General Certificate to act as a bailiff.

ORDERS

[10]    
The Orders are therefore as follows:

1)      
The appeal is upheld.

2)      
I direct the Nadi Magistrates Court to issue the applicant with a certificate to act as a bailiff under s 3 of the Distress for Rent Act [Cap 36] forthwith.

3)      
I direct that the High Court Registry remove and destroy all copies of the police report submitted to the Nadi Magistrates Court.
