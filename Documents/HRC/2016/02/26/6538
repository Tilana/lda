</p>
<p>Based on Religion or Belief, and all resolutions on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and 
of discrimination based on religion or belief adopted by the General Assembly and by the former 
Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights 
provisions, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the call of the World Conference on Human Rights upon all Governments to 
take all appropriate measures in compliance with their international obligations and with due 
regard to their respective legal systems to counter intolerance and related violence based on 
religion or belief, including practices of discrimination against women and the desecration of 
religious sites, recognizing that every individual has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, 
expression and religion, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> the recognition by the World Conference on Human Rights that all 
human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the 2005 World Summit Outcome in which the Heads of State and Government 
reaffirmed the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace as well as the Global 
Agenda for Dialogue Among Civilizations and its Programme of Action adopted by the 
General Assembly and the value of different initiatives on dialogue among cultures and 
civilizations, including the dialogue on interfaith cooperation and the Alliance of Civilizations, 
and committed themselves to taking action to promote a culture of peace and dialogue at the 
local, national, regional and international level, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of promoting dialogue in order to enhance mutual 
understanding and knowledge among different social groups, cultures and civilizations in various 
areas, including culture, religion, education, information, science and technology, and in order to 
contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> the important work carried out by the Human Rights Committee in 
providing guidance with respect to the scope of the freedom of religion or belief, </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/L.15* 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Seriously concerned</i> at all attacks upon religious places, sites and shrines, including any 
deliberate destruction of relics and monuments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Seriously concerned also</i> at the misuse of registration procedures as a means to limit the 
right to freedom of religion or belief of members of certain religious communities and at the 
limitations placed on religious publications, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> of the need to address the rise in all parts of the world of religious extremism 
affecting the rights of individuals and groups based on religion or belief, the situations of 
violence and discrimination that affect many women as a result of religion or belief and the 
abuse of religion or belief for ends inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other 
relevant instruments of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that a formal or legal distinction at the national level between different kinds of 
religions or faith-based communities may, in some cases, constitute discrimination and may 
impinge on the enjoyment of the freedom of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the importance of education in the promotion of tolerance, which involves the 
acceptance by the public of, and its respect for, diversity, including with regard to religious 
expressions, and of the Final Document adopted at the International Consultative Conference on 
School Education in Relation with Freedom of Religion or Belief, Tolerance and 
Non-Discrimination, held in Madrid from 23 to 25 November 2001, to which Governments are 
invited to give consideration, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that States, regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, religious 
</p>
<p>bodies and the media have an important role to play in promoting tolerance, respect and freedom 
of religion or belief, including through interreligious and intra-religious dialogue and such 
initiatives as the High-level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and 
Cooperation for Peace, to take place in New York on 4 and 5 October 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Seriously concerned</i> at the slow progress in the implementation of the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/L.15* 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Believing</i> that further intensified efforts are therefore required to promote and protect the 
right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief and to eliminate all forms of hatred, 
intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, as also noted at the World Conference 
against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Having conducted</i> the assessment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur during the 
interactive dialogue of its present session, in accordance with its resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work and the report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief of the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Condemns</i> all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief 
as well as violations of the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Recognizes with deep concern</i> the overall rise in instances of intolerance and 
violence directed against members of many religious and other communities in various parts of 
the world, including cases motivated by Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and Christianophobia; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses concern</i> over the persistence of institutionalized social intolerance and 
discrimination practised against many in the name of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Condemns</i> any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audio-visual and 
electronic media or any other means; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages</i> the efforts made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to coordinate in the field of human rights the activities of relevant United Nations organs, 
bodies and mechanisms dealing with all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on 
religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Urges</i> States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To ensure that their constitutional and legislative systems provide adequate and 
effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief to all without </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/L.15* 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p>distinction, inter alia by the provision of effective remedies in cases where the right to freedom 
of thought, conscience, religion or belief, or the right to practise freely one&#8217;s religion, including 
the right to adopt, change or renounce one&#8217;s religion or belief, is violated; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To ensure that appropriate measures are taken in order to adequately and effectively 
guarantee the freedom of religion or belief of women, persons deprived of their liberty, refugees, 
children, persons belonging to minorities and migrants; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To exert the utmost efforts, in accordance with their national legislation and in 
conformity with international human rights law, to ensure that religious places, sites, shrines and 
symbols are fully respected and protected and to take additional measures in cases where they 
are vulnerable to desecration or destruction; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To review, whenever relevant, existing registration practices in order to ensure the 
right of all persons to manifest their religion or belief, alone or in community with others and in 
public or in private; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To ensure, in particular, the right of all persons to worship or assemble in connection 
with a religion or belief and to establish and maintain places for these purposes and the right of 
all persons to write, issue and disseminate relevant publications in these areas; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To ensure that, in accordance with appropriate national legislation and in conformity 
with international human rights law, the freedom of all persons and members of groups to 
establish and maintain religious, charitable or humanitarian institutions is fully respected and 
protected; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To ensure that no one within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty 
or security of person because of religion or belief and that no one is subjected to torture or 
arbitrary arrest or detention on that account and to bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of 
these rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To ensure that all public officials and civil servants, including members of law 
enforcement bodies, the military and educators, including teachers, in the course of their official 
duties, respect different religions and beliefs and do not discriminate on the grounds of religion 
or belief, and that all necessary and appropriate education or training is provided; </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/L.15* 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges</i> States to step up their efforts to eliminate intolerance and discrimination based 
on religion or belief, notably by: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Fully implementing the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance 
and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Taking all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international 
standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation 
and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to 
hostility and violence, with particular regard to religious minorities, and devoting 
particular attention to practices that violate the human rights of women and discriminate against 
women, including in the exercise of their right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or 
belief; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Promoting and encouraging, through education and other means, including regional 
or international cultural exchanges, understanding, tolerance and respect in all matters relating to 
freedom of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Stresses</i> the need to strengthen dialogue, inter alia through the Global Agenda for 
Dialogue among Civilizations and the Alliance of Civilizations, including through the recently 
appointed High Representative of the Secretary-General for the Alliance of Civilizations; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Invites</i> all actors to address in the context of that dialogue, inter alia, the following 
issues within the framework of international standards of human rights: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The rise of religious extremism affecting religions in all parts of the world; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The situations of violence and discrimination that affect many women as a result of 
religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The use of religion or belief for ends inconsistent with the Charter of the 
United Nations and other relevant instruments of the United Nations; </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/L.15* 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Emphasizes</i> the importance of a continued and strengthened dialogue among and 
within religions or beliefs, at all levels and with a broader participation including of women, to 
promote greater tolerance, respect and mutual understanding; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also emphasizes</i> that equating any religion with terrorism should be avoided, as this 
may have adverse consequences on the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief of 
all members of the religious communities concerned; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Further emphasizes</i> that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, restrictions 
on the freedom to manifest religion or belief are permitted only if limitations are prescribed by 
law, are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others, and are applied in a manner that does not vitiate the right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Recommends</i> that the United Nations and other actors, including non-governmental 
organizations and bodies and groups based on religion or belief, in their efforts to promote 
freedom of religion or belief, ensure the widest possible dissemination of the text of the 
Declaration, in as many different languages as possible, and promote its implementation; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Concludes</i> that there is a need for the continued contribution of the Special 
Rapporteur to the protection, promotion and universal implementation of the right to freedom of 
religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Decides</i> therefore to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief for a further period of three years; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to ensure that the Special Rapporteur receives the 
necessary resources to enable her to discharge her mandate fully; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Urges</i> all Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur and to respond 
favourably to her requests to visit their countries and to provide her with all necessary 
information so as to enable her to fulfil her mandate even more effectively; </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/L.15* 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Encourages</i> the continuing efforts in all parts of the world of the Special Rapporteur 
to examine incidents and governmental actions that are incompatible with the provisions of the 
Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on 
Religion or Belief and to recommend remedial measures, as appropriate; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Stresses</i> the need for the Special Rapporteur to continue to apply a gender 
perspective, inter alia through the identification of gender-specific abuses, in the reporting 
process, including in information collection and in recommendations; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit an interim report to the General Assembly 
at its sixty-third session; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Also requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit the outstanding reports to the Council 
in accordance with its annual programme of work and the next annual report to its first session of 
the calendar year 2009; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of this question and to continue consideration of measures 
to implement the Declaration.
