<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session 
from 28 April to 9 May 2014. The review of Qatar was held at the 15th meeting, on 7 May 
</p><p>2014. The delegation of Qatar was headed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin 
Jassim Al-Thani, Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs for International Cooperation. At 
its 18th meeting, held on 9 May 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Qatar. 
2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Qatar: Cuba, India and Italy. 
3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Qatar: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/19/QAT/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/QAT/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/QAT/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Qatar through 
the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review 
(UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of delegation said that it was a pleasure to meet the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review. Qatar appreciated the important role played by the Working 
Group in helping States to better fulfil their obligations under international human rights 
law. The periodic review process represented a valuable opportunity for Qatar to make a 
critical and proper analysis of the situation, in order to improve and develop its internal 
practices. 
</p>
<p>6. By a decision of 2010, the Council of Ministers had requested the committee that 
prepared the initial report to continue its work and had entrusted it with the preparation of 
subsequent reports and with following up the recommendations of the Working Group. 
That committee was chaired by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and its 10 other members 
were drawn from various ministries and councils. The consultation process was broad, 
involving coordination and cooperation with related stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>7. For Qatar, the promotion and protection of human rights was a strategic choice that 
constituted the backbone of the comprehensive development policy enshrined in the Qatar 
National Vision 2030, which involved constitutional, economic, social and cultural reforms. 
That policy included important topics related to key human rights issues in the areas of 
education, health, the environment, expatriate workers&#8217; rights, women&#8217;s empowerment and </p>


<p>child rights. The aim of the National Development Strategy (2011-2016) was to transform 
the objectives of the National Vision 2030 into reality in the years to come. 
</p><p>8. In a short period, Qatar had become a State in which the rule of law prevailed, with 
institutions that upheld the rights and maintained the dignity of all. The Government 
responded swiftly and effectively to all human rights issues and concerns, in support of its 
endeavours to achieve human development, to develop democracy and civilization, and to 
maintain the prosperity and well-being enjoyed by Qatar. It considered that many of the 
recommendations presented during the interactive dialogue of its first review had already 
been implemented or were in the process of being implemented. 
</p>
<p>9. The most significant developments since the adoption of the initial report included 
the amendment by Qatar of the Criminal Code by the introduction of an explicit definition 
of torture that was fully consistent with article 1 of the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, in addition to its enactment 
of the Trafficking in Persons Act No. 15 of 2011, to protect victims and enhance 
international cooperation against human trafficking, and its espousal of the Arab Initiative 
to Build National Capacities to Combat Human Trafficking in the Arab Countries. Its 
commitment to that Initiative was evident in the financial support that it had offered, which 
amounted to US$ 6 million. In addition, Qatar had ratified the Convention on the Protection 
and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. Furthermore, it had established the 
Qatari National Commission for International Humanitarian Law, recognizing the 
importance of applying the principles of international humanitarian law in order to protect 
victims of conflict. Qatar had also established the National Committee for Occupational 
Health and Safety, in cooperation with experts from the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), in addition to the Committee on Climate Change and Clean Development and the 
Qatar Committee for Alliance of Civilizations. It had established the Qatar Foundation for 
Protection and Social Rehabilitation, a private foundation for the public good that included 
the Qatar Foundation for the Protection of Children and Women, the Qatar Foundation for 
Combating Human Trafficking and the Social Rehabilitation Centre. 
</p>
<p>10. Qatar had continued its policy of openness towards hosting international conferences 
and forums on development, democracy, human rights and the promotion of a culture of 
peace. Every year, it hosted the Doha Forum and the Doha Conference for Interfaith 
Dialogue, as well as the U.S.&#8211;Islamic World Forum. It had hosted the Fourth Global Forum 
of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations in 2011 and, in April 2014, the preparatory 
conference for the Sixth Global Forum, to be held in Indonesia in August 2014. In addition, 
it had hosted the eighteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the thirteenth session of the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development. Moreover, it would host the Thirteenth United 
Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, to be held from 12 to 19 April 
2015 in Doha. 
</p>
<p>11. Qatar attached great importance to international cooperation and deployed 
considerable human and financial resources in that field. In addition, it offered development 
assistance to developing countries around the world. In 2011 and 2012, it had provided 
humanitarian and development assistance (governmental and non-governmental) amounting 
to over 3 billion Qatar riyals (QR). It provided assistance to 100 countries, in particular to 
least developed countries, to help them achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 
</p><p>2015. The contributions of Qatar also included humanitarian and development initiatives, 
such as: &#8220;Hope For&#8221;, an initiative to improve the effectiveness and coordination of military 
and civil defences in response to natural disasters; &#8220;Protecting Education in Insecurity and 
Armed Conflict&#8221;, an initiative to support and promote the right to education in crisis, 
conflict and war zones; &#8220;Al-Fakhurah&#8221;, an initiative to support and protect students and 
schools in conflict zones, particularly in Gaza; &#8220;Silatech&#8221;, an initiative to expand </p>


<p>employment and business opportunities for young people throughout the Arab world; and 
&#8220;Reach Out to Asia (ROTA)&#8221;, an initiative to enable communities in Asia to overcome 
obstacles and establish links in order to achieve education for all. 
</p>
<p>12. Since February 2010, Qatar had taken serious steps to implement the 
recommendations of the Working Group at the national and the international levels in order 
to promote human rights, based on its enduring desire to improve the human rights situation 
in Qatar and to strengthen constructive cooperation with the relevant special procedures. 
That desire had been confirmed when Qatar had accepted the recommendation to extend an 
open and standing invitation to all special procedures mandate holders. Qatar had received 
a visit from the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants in November 2013 and, 
in January 2014, had welcomed the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers. It had received the visit of a delegation of the European Parliament 
Subcommittee on Human Rights in March 2014, as well as the visits of numerous non-
governmental human rights organizations. Since May 2010, Qatar had continued to 
strengthen its relationship with the OHCHR through bilateral consultations. Moreover, 
Qatar continued to support the United Nations Human Rights Training and Documentation 
Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region in Doha. 
</p>
<p>13. Qatar faced particular challenges as it underwent a rapid and historic transition 
towards complete and comprehensive development. It had recorded unprecedented rates of 
growth and economic recovery, and had been ranked first among the countries of North 
Africa and the Middle East and eighteenth on the global scale by the World Economic 
Forum in the <i>Human Capital Report 2013</i>. Although there had been numerous 
developments in Qatar with regard to the promotion and protection of human rights in 
terms of legislation, institutions and awareness, some temporary obstacles remained. Those 
included the unprecedented population increase of over 100 per cent in recent years, and the 
fact that legislative and institutional developments were recent and that Qatar had only 
recently dealt with international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>14. Qatar emphasized its appreciation for the contribution of expatriate workers, whom 
it considered to be real partners in the development and advancement project pursued by 
the State. 
</p>
<p>15. In the context of enhancing and strengthening the legislative structure, Qatar was 
conducting a comprehensive review of labour laws and of procedures and policies to 
promote and protect the rights of workers, citizens and residents in accordance with 
international standards. The competent authorities were also considering a draft regulatory 
mechanism for domestic workers. In addition, the Entry, Exit, Residence and Sponsorship 
of Expatriates Act and the Labour Code were under review, with a view to their being 
developed. 
</p>
<p>16. Qatar was considering accession to both the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>17. The delegation of Qatar was ready to work to develop appropriate strategies and 
mechanisms to follow up on the recommendations that the Working Group would put 
forward. Qatar realized that much more needed to be done; therefore, it would continue to 
build on and improve its achievements through the exchange of experiences, taking 
advantage of international best practices. Lastly, it should be emphasized that political will 
and a supportive environment for the promotion and protection of human rights existed in 
Qatar. </p>

</p>

accusations made by the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>62. The Syrian Arab Republic raised a point of order, indicating that the Syrian 
statement had been objective. In fact, it had displayed restraint and adhered to the 
principles of UPR since no mention had been made of the inhuman role played by Qatar in 
the Syrian Arab Republic. The representative of the Syrian Arab Republic requested the 
President to urge Qatar to refrain from using provocative language and to respond 
objectively to the Syrian statement. 
</p><p>63. The President reminded delegations that the UPR procedure required them to focus 
on the human rights situation in the country under review. The procedure was based on 
reports and recommendations, and it was essential to avoid confrontation regarding 
bilateral issues. 
</p>
<p>64. The representative of Qatar said that the Qatar Foundation for Protection and Social 
Rehabilitation provided legal guidance and counselling to women victims of violence, as 
well as assistance in filing complaints. Special offices had been set up in health centres and 
hospitals to receive complaints of violence and to provide support. Victims were also 
provided with free legal support. Women and child victims could seek refuge in special 
shelters. A hotline for victims of violence operated 24 hours a day. The Foundation 
recorded such cases in a database, preserving confidentiality. The services provided to 
victims were taken into account in formulating policies and conducting research, with a 
view to promoting reform and enhancing rehabilitation and legal assistance.  
</p>
<p>65. Workers could file complaints with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs 
against employers who failed to comply with working conditions. If an amicable 
settlement could not be reached, the case was referred to the competent court. Some 8,000 
complaints had been filed in 2012, of which some 6,500 had been settled and some 600 
had been referred to the courts. The corresponding figures for 2013 were approximately 
10,000, 8,000 and 600 cases, respectively. The Labour Code set out the basic rules </p>


<p>governing the establishment of trade unions. The demographic composition of the country 
and the ratio of migrant workers to Qatari workers were taken into account. Forced labour 
was prohibited under article 43 of the Labour Code. Qatar had ratified the ILO Forced 
Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29) and the ILO Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 
1957 (No. 105). The Human Trafficking Act (Act No. 15 of 2011) prohibited forced labour 
and contemporary forms of slavery, prescribing penalties of up to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment 
and fines of up to QR 300,000. 
</p><p>66. Ministerial Decision No. 15 of 2005 and articles 104 and 105 of the Labour Code 
required employers to provide a first aid kit for every 25 employees, and required those 
employing more than 100 employees to provide a medical service. Routine tests should be 
conducted free of charge for employees engaged in hazardous work. 
</p>
<p>67. The Nationality Act was applied in accordance with the Constitution. The legal 
status of Qatari women married to foreigners in no way interfered with their enjoyment of 
human rights. The Act accorded priority in the acquisition of citizenship to children born 
of a Qatari mother, and recognized children born of unknown parents as Qatari nationals. 
</p><p>68. Serious steps were being taken at the highest level to amend the law on the kafala 
system in order to align it with international human rights law and the rights of migrants. 
</p>
<p>69. The age of criminal responsibility was 7 years. Cases involving minors were heard 
by juvenile courts, which applied juvenile legislation. Special police officers and 
prosecutors dealt with such cases. 
</p>
<p>70. With regard to sexual freedoms and same-sex marriage, sharia law was the main 
source of Qatari legislation, pursuant to article 1 of the Constitution. The corresponding 
principles were reflected in articles 279 to 289 of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>71. The death penalty was applicable to anyone who killed another person with 
premeditation under the highly specific circumstances defined in articles 300 and 302 of 
the Criminal Code. However, the death penalty had not been imposed since 2003. 
</p>
<p>72. The Czech Republic commended Qatar on its efforts to advance human rights, 
notably for extending a standing invitation to all special procedures. 
</p>
<p>73. Denmark encouraged Qatar to strengthen independent monitoring systems, 
especially for detention facilities. It expressed concern about the lack of rights for and 
legal protection of immigrant workers, and about reported exploitation and abuse of 
domestic and construction workers. 
</p>
<p>74. Ecuador welcomed the creation of mechanisms in Qatar to protect women, children 
and the elderly and of institutions for social assistance, in addition to the importance 
attached by Qatar to the development of human rights plans, programmes and strategies 
with civil society and with public and private national institutions and to sharing 
experiences and information at the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>75. France welcomed the delegation of Qatar and made several recommendations.  
</p><p>76. Germany acknowledged the first steps taken by Qatar to heed the recommendations 
of the previous cycle, most notably the recent adoption of labour welfare standards aimed 
at protecting workers&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>77. Ghana commended Qatar for conducting programmes to promote a culture of 
human rights, for issuing a standing invitation to the special procedures and for amending 
its Criminal Code to align its definition of torture with that in the Convention against 
Torture.  
</p>
<p>78. Greece noted positively the numerous efforts of Qatar to promote women&#8217;s rights 
and asked about the steps it envisaged taking next to advance women&#8217;s participation in </p>


<p>public life. Recognizing the measures that had been taken, it asked about the results of the 
implementation of the Human Trafficking Act and the associated National Plan. 
</p>
<p>79. India welcomed the reforms introduced and the measures taken by Qatar, including
