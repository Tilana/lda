<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/9, 
contains the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food on his visit to Malaysia 
from 9 to 19 December 2013. Noting impressive achievements made in reducing poverty 
and food insecurity and examining the existing legal, institutional and policy framework, 
the Special Rapporteur outlines what he sees as main steps the country should now take 
towards the full realization of the right to food. These steps include moving towards 
agrifood policies that are both more resilient and more sustainable; further improving living 
conditions, building on the recent introduction of a minimum wage for the working poor, 
strengthening social protection by moving from ad hoc schemes to the guarantee of legal 
entitlements and addressing obstacles faced by vulnerable communities; and tackling new 
challenges related to unhealthy diets.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, conducted a visit 
to Malaysia from 9 to 18 December 2013, at the invitation of the Government. During his 
visit, he met with senior federal government officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-Based Industry, the National Security Council, the 
Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development, the Ministry of Human 
Resources, the Ministry of Rural and Regional Development, the Department of Orang Asli 
Development, the Ministry of Urban Well-being, Housing and Local Government, the 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of 
Education, the Attorney General&#8217;s Chamber, the Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives 
and Consumer Affairs, the Prime Minister&#8217;s Department (Economic Planning Unit and 
Performance Management and Delivery Unit), the Department of Islamic Development, 
and the Federal Land Development Authority. A series of meetings were also held with 
senior representatives of ministries of the State governments of Sabah, in Kota Kinabalu, 
and of the State of Sarawak, who met with the Special Rapporteur in Putrajaya.  
</p><p>2. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur met with members of the Parliament of Malaysia 
and of the Sabah State Legislative Assembly, as well as with members of the United 
Nations country team. He also convened five round-table discussions with representatives 
of non-governmental organizations, indigenous communities of West and East Malaysia, 
trade unions, farmers associations and academics, held in the Federal Territory of Kuala 
Lumpur and the States of Selangor and Sabah. In Petaling Jaya, Selangor, the Special 
Rapporteur met with residents of a low-cost flats neighbourhood (Desa Mentari); and in the 
village of Terian, Sabah, he met with residents of seven villages of the Ulu Papar region.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur is most grateful to the Government for having facilitated his 
visit and for the open and constructive spirit in which dialogues were conducted. He 
expresses his thanks and appreciation to the wide range of people and local communities 
with whom he was able to meet. He also thanks the United Nations country team and the 
United Nations Resident Coordinator in Malaysia for the excellent support provided. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  General context  
</b>4. Malaysia has enjoyed sustained economic growth since its independence in 1957, 
and today is known for its high human development standards and its status as an upper-
middle-income country. Since the 1970s, the economy has gradually changed from being 
one based on primary production to one diversified with important secondary 
(manufacturing and production of processed goods) and tertiary (services) sectors. 
Agriculture accounted for more than 20 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1985. 
By 2012, it had dropped to 7.3 per cent of GDP, surpassed by other sectors of the economy, 
including services (56.4 per cent), manufacturing (24.9 per cent) and mining and quarrying 
(8.4 per cent).  
5. With its move away from agriculture, Malaysia has seen a rapid growth in 
urbanization. Between 1970 and 2010, the proportion of the population living in urban 
areas increased from 27 per cent to 71 per cent.1 At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
visit, the population of Malaysia was estimated at 29 million and projected to increase by a

</p>
<p>further 10 million by 2040.2 These figures do not include undocumented migrant workers 
living in the country (see paras. 53 to 59 below).  
</p>
<p><b> III. Food insecurity and nutrition 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Situation  
</b>6. Malaysia has made impressive strides in reducing poverty in recent decades. 
According to statistics provided by the Government of Malaysia, from 1995 to 2012, the 
incidence of aggregate national poverty was reduced from 8.7 to 1.7 per cent. The income 
poverty gap between urban and rural areas was also reduced. The rate of urban poverty 
dropped from 3.6 per cent to 1 per cent, while the rural poverty rate went from 14 per cent 
to 3.4 per cent. Disparities in income levels among Malaysia&#8217;s 13 States and three Federal 
Territories have also been reduced. Notably, Sabah has witnessed the greatest reduction in 
the poverty rate, dropping from 19.7 per cent in 2009 to 8.1 per cent in 2012.  
</p>
<p>7. The above-mentioned poverty statistics are based on national Poverty Line Income 
(PLI), which takes into account the size and geographical location of households. One of 
the components of the PLI is the monetary value of a basic food basket needed by a family 
allowing access to what is considered a balanced diet, including cereals and cereal products 
(rice, wheat flour), chicken, eggs and fish, milk, oil and fats, sugar, vegetables and fruits 
and pulses (food PLI). The other component of the PLI measurement is set according to the 
cost of a range of non-food items, such as clothing, housing and transport costs (non-food 
PLI).3 Those with an income under the PLI are considered poor in national statistics, while 
the population with an income under the Food PLI are described as &#8220;hard-core poor&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. The number of households living in hard-core poverty, unable to meet their basic 
food needs, decreased from 0.7 per cent in 2009 to 0.2 per cent in 2012, while the incidence 
of hard-core poverty for urban and rural areas dropped from 0.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent in 
2009 to 0.1 per cent and 0.6 per cent in 2012, respectively. Given these numbers, the 
Government considers that food insecurity and malnutrition related to poverty to have been 
practically abolished. Nevertheless, there are still pockets of poverty to be tackled, and the 
obstacles still faced by vulnerable communities in their access to an adequate diet must be 
removed.  
</p>
<p>9. Two groups stand out as particularly vulnerable. The first is the population of 
indigenous communities, accounting for some 12 per cent of the national population. The 
second is the non-citizen population, which, according to the International Labour 
Organization,4 comprises some 3.8 million migrant workers (around 14 per cent of the total 
population) and about 200,000 refugees and asylum seekers. Notably, national poverty 
statistics do not include the large number of unskilled migrant workers, who are among the 
poorest in the country. Similarly, while the Government recognizes the particularly 
vulnerable situation of indigenous communities and specifically targets poverty alleviation

<p>efforts at these groups, the migrant population is conspicuous by its absence in social 
policies.  
</p>
<p>10. While national statistics and household surveys do not provide disaggregated data 
on the poverty and food insecurity situation of specific indigenous communities in Sabah 
and Sarawak, official statistics show higher levels of poverty among the Orang Asli, the 
indigenous communities of peninsular Malaysia. Although poverty levels among the Orang 
Asli have been reduced in recent decades, in 2010, 31.16 per cent still lived below the 
income poverty line,5 around 10 times more than the national average. Furthermore, 
monetary income may not be an adequate gauge of vulnerability of indigenous 
communities whose livelihoods depend to a significant extent on their surrounding national 
resources. The distinct challenges affecting the right to food of indigenous populations is 
discussed below (see sect. VI).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Availability of statistical data 
</b>11. In order to effectively target national efforts to eliminate poverty and to ensure 
access to adequate food for all, the collection and analysis of appropriately disaggregated 
data on the situation of specific population groups are essential. Such data collection and 
analysis must be carried out periodically to identify vulnerable groups and to monitor 
continuously the impact of policies and programmes to improve their situation.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur notes with interest the recent establishment of a national 
database (E-kasih), which was designed to register vulnerable low-income households 
across the country. He regrets to note, however, that, in the case of independent observers, 
including national civil society organizations and academia, access to information on the 
situation of specific population groups is limited. The disaggregation of data in national 
household surveys is limited to geographical location (districts and rural and urban 
populations) and three main population groups (Chinese, Indians and Bumiputra). Such 
broad categories do not, however, allow for more detailed identification of poor and 
vulnerable groups in society. Equally, national household surveys do not present statistics 
disaggregated by gender. In 2006, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women also noted the difficulty in finding disaggregated data on poverty rates and 
the socioeconomic status of women.6  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Legal, institutional and policy frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights framework 
</b>13. Malaysia has recognized the right to adequate food though its commitments under 
international human rights law. It is party to three of the nine core international human 
rights treaties &#8211; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities &#8211; which each contain provisions specifically related to the right to 
adequate food.7

and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, arts. 1, 3, 12(2), and 14. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The Federal Constitution of Malaysia also recognizes elements of the right to food. 
In part II, the Constitution provides for a range of &#8220;fundamental liberties&#8221;, such as the right 
to life and personal liberty (art. 5), freedom of movement (art. 9) and freedom of speech, 
assembly and association (art. 10), all of which are relevant to the right to adequate food. 
The Constitution also protects against discrimination, including in access to employment 
and services, which allow people to have access to adequate food. Specifically, article 8 
provides that &#8220;except as expressly authorized by this Constitution, all persons are equal 
before the law and entitled to its equal protection&#8221;, and prohibits discrimination &#8220;against 
citizens on the ground only of religion, race, descent, gender or place of birth&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>15. Malaysia has yet to accede to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights and the Optional Protocol thereto, and the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and Optional Protocols thereto, which together with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights constitute the International Bill of Human Rights. The State 
has also yet to accede to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the statement made by Malaysia 
in the context of the universal periodic review in 2009 that the Government was seriously 
considering the changes required in domestic legislation and policies to accede to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and the Optional 
Protocol thereto.8  
</p>
<p>16. While taking note of the assessment made by the Human Rights Commission of 
Malaysia (SUHAKAM) that the Government had not made any concrete move to accede to 
any international human rights instruments,9 the Special Rapporteur is encouraged that the 
Government mandated the formulation of a national human rights action plan for Malaysia 
in October 2012, and that a steering committee under the Prime Minister&#8217;s Department is 
now coordinating the development of such a plan.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Policy framework 
</b>17. The overarching policy objective set out in Vision 2020, formulated in 1991, and a 
series of national development policies that have since followed is to transform Malaysia 
into an advanced, high-income country by 2020. The specific targets set for 2020 include 
raising the gross national income per capita to $15,000.10 With that target in mind, the State 
has developed an array of policy initiatives outlined in the Tenth Malaysia Plan for the 
period 2011-2015, the Economic Transformation Programme and the Government 
Transformation Programme.

  High-income countries are defined by the World Bank as those with a gross national income per head 
</p>
<p>of at least $12,616 (2012 figures). In 2012, income per head in Malaysia stood at $9,800. See World

<p>18. The Economic Transformation Programme focuses on 12 national key economic 
areas, identified as particularly important to economic growth. These key areas include 
palm oil and agriculture. The Government Transformation Programme identifies seven 
national key results areas, assigning lead responsibilities on each result area to individual 
ministries. Consistent with the focus of the Tenth Malaysia Plan on &#8220;moving towards 
inclusive socioeconomic development&#8221;, three of the results areas concern &#8220;raising living 
standards of low-income households&#8221;, led by the Minister for Women, Family and 
Community Development; &#8220;improving rural development&#8221;, led by the Minister for Rural 
and Regional Development; and &#8220;addressing the cost of living&#8221;, led by the Deputy Prime 
Minister. 
</p>
<p>19. The Tenth Malaysia Plan refers to four key strategies to achieve inclusive 
socioeconomic development:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Elevating the livelihoods of the bottom 40 per cent of households  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Enhancing economic participation of the Bumiputra  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that basic physical infrastructure is accessible to all  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Enabling a progressive and more inclusive society  
</p>
<p>20. The focus on the economic empowerment of the Bumiputra (&#8220;sons of the soil&#8221;) has 
been a mainstay of Government policy since the New Economic Policy (1971-1990). The 
Bumiputra is not a legal term: it refers broadly to citizens considered indigenous to 
Malaysia, and excludes members of the Chinese and Indian ethnic groups who account 
respectively for 24.6 per cent and 7.3 per cent of the population. National policies have 
established an affirmative action scheme to advance the Bumiputra majority (67.4 per cent 
of citizens). These policies have been developed in line with article 153 of the Federal 
Constitution, which refers to the need &#8220;to safeguard the special position of the Malays and 
natives of any of the States of Sabah and Sarawak&#8221;, and are justified by the Government 
with reference to a need to bridge socioeconomic disparities between the country&#8217;s ethnic 
groups.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Food availability and agricultural production 
</b></p>
<p>21.  The agricultural sector can be grouped into two sub-sectors: the agro-industrial 
commodities sub-sector, comprising oil palm, rubber, cocoa, tobacco, pepper and timber; 
and the agrifood sub-sector, which includes rice, fruit and vegetables, livestock and 
fisheries. Plantation-based agriculture has a very long history in Malaysia, having also been 
a cornerstone of the colonial economy.  
</p>
<p>22. The fishing sector continues to play an important role in providing fish as a source 
of food and protein. Malaysia is self-sufficient in fish products (with a self-sufficiency rate 
of 134 per cent in 2012); in 2012, the sector contributed about 1.3 per cent to GDP. Apart 
from a fishing fleet of more than 54,000 vessels, the country is also expanding aquaculture 
production through the development of aquaculture industrial zones covering more than 
28,000 hectares.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Increasing levels of self-sufficiency for staple foods 
</b>23. Malaysia depends on imports for most of its foods. The food trade deficit grew from 
RM1 billion in 1990 to RM13 billion in 2013. The country is self-sufficient in some food 
commodities, such as poultry (self-sufficiency rate of 128 per cent), eggs (115 per cent) and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>fisheries (101 per cent), but not in others, such as rice (71 per cent), fruit (66 per cent), 
vegetables (41 per cent), beef (29 per cent), mutton (11 per cent) and milk (5 per cent).11 Of 
these commodities, self-sufficiency in rice is considered the most important given that rice 
is the staple food of the majority of the population.  
</p><p>24. As it underlined in the National Agrifood Policy for 2011-2020, the Government is 
well aware of the need to raise the levels of self-sufficiency, wherever possible, as the 
prices of food commodities on international markets will become more volatile and higher 
in the future because of the effects of climate change, increasing input costs, the 
competitive use of food for biofuel production, population growth and changing consumer 
preferences.12 The objective of the Policy is to reduce dependency on imported food, to 
increase the revenue of farmers and agro-entrepreneurs, and to allow the agricultural sector 
to develop into a steady and resilient industry.13 The Policy is accompanied by a number of 
schemes for agricultural revitalization, such as the Muda Agricultural Development 
Authority and the New Concept Joint-Ventures on Native Customary Rights land in 
Sarawak.14 
</p>
<p><b> B. Improving the sustainability of food production by adequate agronomic 
choices 
</b>25. Agrifood policies in Malaysia face specific challenges of relevance to the realization 
of the right to food. First, the expansion of commercial tree crops, in particular for oil palm, 
combined with urbanization has led to greater competition for farmland, in a context in 
which the Government has pledged not to clear more than 50 per cent of virgin rainforest 
for plantations. Second, monocropping schemes have been prioritized, at the expense of 
intercropping schemes or more diversified farming systems integrating trees with non-
perennial crops and small animals. These two characteristics combined reduce the State&#8217;s 
ability to achieve adequate levels of self-sufficiency for some foods. They also entail high 
rates of deforestation and lead to greenhouse gas emissions, the contamination of soils and 
water and rapidly decreasing fish stocks.  
</p>
<p>26. In response to the above-mentioned challenges, the Government has introduced 
programmes to optimize the use of resources on a sustainable basis (including recycling 
waste products for food production) and to ensure efficient land use (including soil and 
water conservation).15 It also seeks to encourage sustainable farming through the Good 
Agricultural Practices (MyGAP) schemes, including the Malaysian Farm Good Agricultural 
Practice Scheme (SALM), which allows vegetables and fruits to be branded as &#8220;Malaysia&#8217;s 
Best&#8221;. In the context of food supply chains that are increasingly demand-driven rather than 
supply-driven and as consumers seek to be reassured about the sustainability of their 
purchasing practices, such schemes also represent an asset in gaining access to export 
markets, particularly the high-value markets of countries belonging to the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development.

<p>27. More, however, could be done in this regard. Despite the efforts of the National 
Agriculture Training Council, the Special Rapporteur was struck by the lack of attention 
paid to agroecological modes of production in the training and support programmes of the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-Based Industry. He refers in this regard to his report on 
the contribution of agroecology to the realization of the right to food16 and to the emerging 
consensus on the need to move to less input-intensive and more knowledge-intensive types 
of production, placing the restoration of soil health at the centre of agronomic choices. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Supporting rural development 
</b>28. The Special Rapporteur studied the experience of the Federal Land Development 
Authority (FELDA) in addressing poverty in rural areas. Established in 1956, with a 
mandate to fight poverty by giving land to the landless, FELDA has organized smallholder 
farms growing cash crops (primarily palm oil) in a scheme that currently involves 112,625 
families and more than 300,000 hectares of land across the country, managed by FELDA as 
commercial estates. The programme has been highly successful in raising the incomes of 
the original poor settlers and their families, for whom FELDA acts as a trustee. Work on 
plantations has been increasingly carried out by migrant workers, while settler families rely 
on dividends from the profits generated through the cultivation of their shareholdings in the 
FELDA estates. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Challenges specific to the palm oil industry 
</b>29. Palm oil plays an important role in the agronomic landscape of the country, as well 
as in its economy. About 5 million hectares of arable land (out of a total of around 7 million 
hectares in the country) are dedicated to palm oil production. Malaysia is the second largest 
producer of palm oil in the world (after Indonesia) and the first exporter, producing 39 per 
cent of all palm oil and accounting for 44 per cent of global exports.17 Despite the 
diversification of the economy, in 2013, palm oil still accounted for 6.3 per cent of the 
country&#8217;s total exports,18 and represented a significant percentage of sales tax revenues for 
State Governments (30 per cent in Sabah).  
30. While palm oil production has been a key source of revenue for Malaysia, the 
extensive utilization of arable land for palm oil cultivation has meant that less land is 
available today for the production of food crops, thereby lowering the State&#8217;s levels of self-
sufficiency in certain staple foods, in particular rice. This exposes Malaysia to price shocks 
on international markets.  
</p>
<p>31. The expansion of oil palm plantations has also had agronomic and environmental 
consequences. Monocropping oil palm depletes the soil of its nutrients and, because it is 
input-intensive, results in the pollution of soil and water sources owing to the intensive use 
of fertilizers. Oil palm has been a major factor in the loss of tropical rainforest in Malaysia, 
a process that continues largely unabated.19 In fact, despite the Government&#8217;s commitment 
to a cap of 50 per cent for the clearing of forests, the pace of deforestation has increased

</p>
<p>over the past decade as a consequence of the expansion of palm oil plantations and timber 
logging.20 It is estimated that, from 1990 to 2005, palm oil production in Malaysia increased 
by between 55 and 59 per cent (0.83 &#8211; 1.1 million ha) through forest conversion.21 In 
addition to its impact on the ecosystem and biodiversity, forest degradation caused by 
agriculture and forestry is estimated to account for 16 per cent of Malaysia&#8217;s greenhouse 
gas emissions.22 The gains from a slower rate of deforestation in reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions would be significant: if implemented today, a mere 1 per cent cut in the 
deforestation rate could lead to fewer emissions equal to about 3.34 Mt of CO2by 2020.23  
</p>
<p>32. Lastly, palm oil plantations in Malaysia rely heavily on the availability of a cheap 
and compliant workforce, made up of foreign migrant workers primarily from the 
Philippines and Indonesia, as discussed below. 
</p>
<p>33. Concerns about the social and environmental impact of palm oil production led to 
the establishment of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a private multi-
stakeholder initiative with a secretariat based in Kuala Lumpur. Some 14 per cent of palm 
oil is today certified under the RSPO, including that produced by a total certified area of 
1,092,423 in Malaysia, involving more than 100 farms working under 13 plantation 
companies.24 RSPO certification is based on compliance with eight principles, including 
environmental responsibility and conservation of natural resources and biodiversity 
(principle 5) and responsible consideration of employees, and of individuals and 
communities affected by growers and mills (principle 6). While bearing in mind the need to 
improve the balance between the production of cash crops and food production for local 
consumption, the Special Rapporteur encourages efforts to improve the sustainability of 
palm oil production. While the RSPO could be strengthened, any attempt to weaken the 
sustainability criteria its principles embody must be discouraged. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Food accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>34.  Accessibility requires that individuals are able to either produce food for their own 
consumption or to purchase food without compromising other basic needs. Food should 
also be physically accessible to all people, including those living in remote areas and the 
physically vulnerable, such as older persons or persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Own production 
</b></p>
<p>35. The number of people relying on their own agricultural production, foraging or 
fishing to meet their food needs in Malaysia is declining, due to the agrarian transition and 
changing lifestyles, as well as to the emphasis on commodity agriculture and the conversion 
of farmland into palm oil and rubber plantations.  
</p>
<p>36. While some communities practice subsistence agriculture, particularly indigenous 
communities living in remote areas, smallholder agriculture is dominated by the cultivation 
of commercial crops and commodities (mainly palm oil and rubber) rather than food crops. 
The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to increase efforts to support

</p>
<p>37. The fishing sector provides direct employment to some 136,500.25 Many are small-
scale fishers, coexisting with large-scale commercial operators.26 The Special Rapporteur 
notes with interest several initiatives undertaken to support small-scale fishers and promote 
sustainable fishing practices, including the regulation of fishing of different types of vessels 
within designated fishing zones, reserving the coastal zones (within five nautical miles off-
shore) to artisanal small-scale fishers.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Access to decent work and a living wage 
</b></p>
<p>38. Ensuring in law access to decent work and a living wage is a key factor for families 
and individuals who rely on an earned income to meet their food needs. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur commends the adoption in 2011 of a minimum wage across Malaysia. 
Prior to the introduction of the minimum wage, 33.8 per cent of private sector workers 
earned less than RM700 a month, well below the 2007 PLI of RM750 per month/per 
household. The introduction of the minimum wage should to help ensure a higher standard 
of living for the working poor across Malaysia and that the working poor are not left behind 
in Malaysia&#8217;s move towards high-income status.  
</p>
<p>39. Under the National Wages Consultative Council Act (No. 732) of 2011, as of 1 
January 2013 (1 July for small businesses), the minimum wage for private sector employees 
was set at RM800 for workers in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan, and RM900 per month for 
employees in peninsular Malaysia. This basic wage must exclude any additional payment 
allowances provided by employers. It applies to all employees, whether local or foreign, 
and in all economic sectors, except those in the domestic service sector, such as gardeners, 
child minders and housekeepers. The minimum wage also applies to sectors in which wages 
are not paid on an hourly, weekly or monthly basis. In particular, estate and plantation 
owners must pay employees at least a minimum wage, even if they are paid on a pieces-
rate, tonnage, trip or commission basis. Employers are required to supplement the wages of 
employees if their income does not meet the minimum wage.  
</p>
<p>40. Enforcement of the minimum wage is conducted by labour officers, who review 
individual workplaces on a scheduled rotation of seven years. Adjustments to the minimum 
wage made on the basis of the recommendations of the National Wages Consultative 
Council, also established under the Act, to conduct studies on all matters concerning 
minimum wages and make recommendations to the Government.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the minimum wage as a means to 
ensure more equitable development. However, while acknowledging that the minimum was 
set taking into account the median wages in different parts of the country and the need to 
balance the interests of employers against those of the workers, he expresses concern at the 
rate at which the minimum wage was set. For a minimum wage to help to ensure access to 
an adequate standard of living, it must provide at least a living wage, allowing access to 
housing, food, education, health care and other basic necessities. The current rate for the 
minimum wage &#8211;RM800 in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan, and RM900 per month in

<p><b>A/HRC/25/57/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>peninsular Malaysia &#8211; does not provide a basic living wage to Malaysia&#8217;s poor and hard-
core poor. Though the median wages in Sabah and Sarawak (RM577 and RM738 
respectively) were lower than in the rest of the country when the minimum wage was 
introduced, the costs of living may be higher: the PLI for a 5-member household is RM830 
in peninsular Malaysia, RM1090 in Sabah and RM920 in Sarawak. Community members 
with whom the Special Rapporteur met during his visit uniformly expressed concerns that 
the PLI was not sufficient to meet a basic standard of living for families in Malaysia. With 
the minimum wage set well under the PLI for Sabah and Sarawak, and not considerably 
above the PLI for peninsular Malaysia, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned that, 
despite the welcome establishment of a minimum wage, Malaysia does not guarantee a 
living wage that will lift people out of poverty. Households that rely on one income, paid at 
the minimum wage, or that are in precarious employment may remain in poverty. Similarly, 
the urban poor, who face high transportation costs and public housing on the fringes of 
urban areas, may spend most of their wages earned at the minimum rate on transportation to 
and from work, and will therefore not be left with adequate funds to meet their food needs. 
The Special Rapporteur encourages the National Wages Consultative Council, when 
reviewing the Minimum Wages Order (in accordance with Section 25 of Act No. 732), to 
take into account the requirement that the minimum wage should correspond at least to a 
living wage, as defined above. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur also expresses his concern at the exclusion of the domestic 
service sector from minimum wage requirements, although some domestic workers do 
receive a minimum wage under bilateral inter-governmental agreements. Individuals 
employed in domestic service are often the most vulnerable to abuse from their employers 
and, owing to the nature of their work in the home, are hidden and unable to seek redress 
for human rights violations. Employers often retain significant portions of wages for room 
and board, and fail to pay overtime. Malaysia should amend the National Wages 
Consultative Council Act to include domestic workers, and to ensure that room and board 
are considered additional payment allowances, not to be calculated as a part of the 
minimum wage. 
</p>
<p>43. In addition, with regard to access to a living wage, the Special Rapport noted with 
concern reports on the use of child labourers, primarily in the plantation sector. While 
Malaysia regulates the employment of children through the Children and Young Persons 
(Employment) Act 1966 (Act 350), it has been reported that between 72,000 and 200,000 
children of undocumented migrants work on palm oil plantations.27 While these figures are 
impossible to verify, such reports should prompt the Government to investigate the 
situation and take measures to ensure and protect the best interests of the child, as required 
under article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Special Rapporteur has 
concerns that piece-rate rather than salaried payment schemes in the plantation sector 
encourage parents to have their children assist in work. This is especially a concern for the 
children of undocumented migrant workers, who have no access to education and, as a 
result, have idle time that can be spent on labour.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Social protection 
</b></p>
<p>44. Social protection is an essential means of access to food, for those who are unable to 
work or to produce their own food. It can include a wide range of services, from food aid, 
income support and health care to housing allowances that aim to offer protection against

<p>the consequences of illness, accident, loss of income, inadequate income, parenthood and 
old age. Malaysia provides a range of social protection schemes for the poor and hard-core 
poor implemented by the federal, State and urban governments, as well as by a host of 
ministries.  
</p>
<p>45. Rather than assistance-based measures, Malaysia has generally prioritized 
employment-oriented schemes that seek to assist individuals in entering and remaining in 
the workforce. For example, at the national level, the 1AZAM Programme aims to lift low-
income households out of poverty by means of employment, entrepreneurship, agricultural 
activities and services. Specific programmes under 1AZAM provide economic resources to 
enable the poor to venture into agriculture and agro-based initiatives, opportunities to start 
small business, to enter the service sector or to become self-employed, and job-matching 
and placement. Also at the national level, the Ministry of Rural and Regional Development 
coordinates employment-based programmes specifically focused on rural communities, 
including income enhancement through participation in economic projects, skills training 
and career development. At the State level, Sarawak focuses on enhancing human capital 
development through awareness-raising programmes, agricultural training and education 
assistance, as well as income-generating activities, while entrepreneurial schemes in Sabah, 
such as the Mini Estet Sejahtera, focus predominately on developing land and water 
through palm oil, rubber and aquaculture as a means to increase the income of poor 
households. To date, the Mini Estet Sejahtera has had more than 2,000 participants, 
engaged in more than 48 enterprises. Other programmes in Sabah include the Program 
Pembangunan Rakyat Termiskin, which facilitates the creation of joint ventures to which 
the hard-core poor contribute land to be developed, and Kampung Sejahtera, which seeks to 
increase human capital. 
</p>
<p>46. Another set of social protection schemes seek to assist the poor and hard-core poor 
by providing access to food at below-market rates. A basket of 12 essential items are 
subsidized, including wheat flour, chicken, cooking oil and bread. Price controls are 
established for certain food items during festive seasons. 1Malaysia initiatives, including 
the 1Malaysia stores (Kedai Rakyat 1Malaysia), which aim to provide access to wide range 
of basic foods (predominantly those with long shelf-lives rather than fresh produce) at a 
reduced price, also support access to food. In addition, the Price Uniformity Programme, 
renewed under the 2014 federal budget, seeks to ensure that the cost of essential food items 
are the same in rural and urban Malaysia, as well as in East and West Malaysia, by 
subsidizing the transportation costs for these items.28  
</p>
<p>47. Lastly, a number of programmes provide access to income, cash transfers or 
transfers in kind that assist individuals and families in meeting their basic needs. The 
federal Government&#8217;s BR1M programme, for example, provides individual cash transfers 
to families on an ad hoc basis, not exceeding one transfer per year. In his 2014 budget 
speech, the Prime Minister announced BR1M payments of between RM300 and RM700, 
with amounts depending on family size and income. Similarly, the KAR1SMA programme 
provides social assistance, in the form of financial assistance, access to services by State 
institutions, community assistance and counselling, to benefit children, senior citizens, the 
disabled, and police and army widows. The Federal Welfare Assistance scheme, which 
covers peninsular Malaysia, provides additional financial assistance to individuals or 
families in financial distress for a limited period of time or for the period required to help 
them secure financial self-sufficiency. With respect specifically to the provision of food, 
the Ministry of Urban Well-being, Housing and Local Government provides RM80 per

para. 12 above), who are not above 60 years old, reside in households comprising at least 
five persons with a per capita income of RM130 or less per month. In 2013, the programme 
reached 3,200 recipients. The Ministry of Health also provides food baskets specifically 
aimed at rehabilitating malnourished children from hard-core poor families. 
</p>
<p>48. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made at all levels of government 
to ensure access to adequate food as part of an adequate standard of living, a number of 
concerns arose from the consultations held during his visit. 
</p>
<p>49. First, community members from Sabah, Sarawak and peninsular Malaysia with 
whom the Special Rapporteur met regretted the limited availability of the 1Malaysia 
initiatives and, as a result, their limited impact in alleviating the high cost burden of 
purchasing food for the poor. Similarly, individuals from rural and remote communities 
indicated that, even with the Price Uniformity Programme, the cost of goods in rural areas, 
as well as in Sabah and Sarawak more generally, remained above that in urban areas and 
peninsular Malaysia. 
</p>
<p>50. Second, given the overwhelming focus on providing opportunities to the poor to 
help them to engage in gainful employment, the segments of the population who are unable 
to work &#8211; such as the elderly, children, often single mothers and persons living with severe 
disabilities &#8211; may not be receiving adequate support to meet their basic needs, including 
access to food. Similarly, with rising housing, food and transportation costs, there may be 
populations of working poor in need of greater assistance to achieve an adequate standard 
of living and access to food, as well as a social safety net in place to mitigate the impact of 
sudden injury, loss of employment or inability to work. 
</p><p>51. Third, the Special Rapporteur was struck by the ad hoc manner in which many of the 
social protection schemes in Malaysia are instituted, their generally limited reach, and the 
lack of legal protection afforded under the schemes. He therefore welcomes the plans of the 
Economic Planning Unit to develop a comprehensive social safety net, integrating and 
coordinating the various efforts of different ministries into one coherent policy, and to 
introduce a rights-based approach to social protection. It is time that Malaysia moved to a 
rights-based approach and redefined as legal entitlements benefits that have traditionally 
been seen as voluntary handouts. Such an institutionalization of social protection schemes 
facilitates decentralized monitoring of their implementation and broader accountability, 
acting as a safeguard against elite capture, corruption, political clientelism or 
discrimination. According to International Labour Organization (ILO) recommendation No. 
202 concerning national floors of social protection, national laws and regulations 
[establishing basic social security guarantees] should specify the range, qualifying 
conditions and levels of the benefits giving effect to these guarantees. Impartial, 
transparent, effective, simple, rapid, accessible and inexpensive complaint and appeal 
procedures should also be specified. Access to complaint and appeal procedures should be 
free of charge to the applicant. Systems should be in place that enhance compliance with 
national legal frameworks. (para. 7) 
52. In funding social protection schemes, Malaysia should also be cognizant of its 
obligations under international human rights law to engage in the progressive realization of 
the right to an adequate standard of living that includes the right to food.29 The progressive 
realization of the right to food requires the State to pursue the maximum use of available 
resources. Where gaps are left in social protection schemes as a result of an apparent lack of

groups or persons are not left behind.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>53. Malaysia hosts an estimated 1.8 million documented and 2 million undocumented 
migrant workers, accounting for nearly a third of the country&#8217;s workforce.30 Roughly 70 per 
cent of labourers on palm oil plantations in the country are migrant workers, most 
commonly from Indonesia.31 The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Workers (JKKPA-PATI) 
sets policy on foreign workers at the national level, while Sabah and Sarawak are each 
responsible for their respective immigration legal framework and policy direction.  
</p>
<p>54. Despite the positive step taken by the State of introducing a minimum wage, the 
Special Rapporteur is greatly concerned about the legal situation and working conditions of 
documented and undocumented migrant workers in Malaysia, and the impact that they have 
on the rights of migrant workers to have an adequate standard of living, including access to 
adequate food. 
</p>
<p>55. Notwithstanding protection afforded by legislation, such as the Anti-Trafficking in 
Persons and Smuggling of Migrants Act of 2007 and the Employment Act of 1955, migrant 
workers, and in particular those who are undocumented, often face abuse and malpractice, 
unfavourable employment terms (such as low wages and informal or unwritten contracts of 
employment), coercion at various stages of the recruitment, migration and employment 
process, and hazardous working conditions (long hours of work, physically demanding and 
arduous jobs, workplace injuries and ill health, limited social protection coverage). Some 
migrant workers in Malaysia are the victims of trafficking in persons as they are recruited 
through fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation. Workers from Indonesia, the 
Philippines, Nepal, Viet Nam and Myanmar have reported restrictions on their freedom of 
movement, retention of passports and delayed or non-payment of wages.32 Some find 
themselves in a form of debt bondage until they are able to repay the fees charged during 
the recruitment process.33  
</p>
<p>56. Working permits in Malaysia are linked to one specific employer, making the 
situation of migrant workers wishing to report cases of abuse, even by legal means, 
precarious as termination of employment results in the cancellation of working permits, 
depriving them of the right to stay and work lawfully in Malaysia. The fear of retaliation 
has a chilling effect on migrant workers reporting human rights abuses to the authorities.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by recent efforts made by the federal 
Government to grant an amnesty to undocumented migrant workers in the country by 
means of the 6P programme. The programme aims to create a comprehensive database of 
all foreigners in the country regardless of whether they are documented. As part of the 
programme, the Government has adopted temporal opportunities for undocumented migrant

<p>workers to regularize their status. An initial registration period, from 11 July to 31 August 
2011, saw 2,320,034 foreign workers, of whom slightly more than half were 
undocumented, become registered across the country. Providing regularized status for 
undocumented workers will help to reduce the ability of employers to exploit their 
employees. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur recommends that a review of the situation of migrant 
workers be done at a high level by the federal Government, as well as by the governments 
of Sabah and Sarawak. The National Inquiry into the Land Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
could serve as a model. Such an inquiry could determine, for instance, whether 
undocumented migrant workers filing a complaint for abuse could be issued residence 
permits, at least pending the end of the legal proceedings; this would institutionalize a 
practice already informally followed by the Department of Labour in Sabah, and it would 
avoid these workers being fearful of filing a claim.  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur is also encouraged by some programmes that designed to 
address the issues facing migrant workers. For example, on 2 October 2013, the Cabinet 
Committee on Foreign Workers and Illegal Immigrants endorsed a programme to assist 
employers and migrant workers who have been deceived by recruitment and outsourcing 
companies. The programme ran from 21 Oct 2013 to 20 January 2014. A national strategy 
for migrant workers that addresses immigration, working conditions and socioeconomic 
concerns is however necessary. The above-mentioned Inquiry could serve as a model for 
reviewing the situation of migrant workers and making recommendations with regard to 
addressing human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>60. Another group who find themselves at risk of food poverty in Malaysia is the 
population of about 200,000 refugees and asylum seekers. Malaysia is not a party to the 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto; refugees whose 
status has been so determined by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) are therefore not recognized under Malaysian law. Refugees 
recognized by UNHCR have access to public health care at a rate lower than that for other 
foreigners. Asylum seekers and refugees do not, however, have access to the formal labour 
market, and are expected to rely on the charity of non-governmental organizations for their 
livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>61. Likewise, refugee children are not permitted to attend public schools and depend on 
informal schools set up by the refugee community, with some limited support from the 
United Nations system and non-governmental organizations. Such an arrangement 
negatively affects the future livelihood opportunities for these children. Refugees are 
relegated to jobs in the informal market, and often must accept work for below the 
minimum wage and in substandard conditions.34 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls that Malaysia has obligations under article 22, paragraph 1 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child to ensure that such children receive appropriate protection and 
humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of the applicable rights set forth in the 
Convention.

<p><b> VII. Indigenous communities, their land and livelihoods 
</b></p>
<p>62. Indigenous peoples in Malaysia, also referred to as the Orang Asal (&#8220;original 
people&#8221;), comprise the Negrito, Senoi and Proto Malay in peninsular Malaysia, collectively 
known to as the Orang Asli, and around 100 ethnic and sub-ethnic groups in East Malaysia, 
collectively called Orang Uluor or Dayak in Sarawak, and Anak Negeri in Sabah. The 
Orang Asli number some 178,000 people, about 0.6 per cent of the population. The number 
of indigenous peoples in East Malaysia is estimated at around 2.8 million people, about 50 
per cent of the populations of Sabah and Sarawak.35  
</p>
<p>63. A significant number of Orang Asal live in rural areas and have a special 
relationship to their lands and the ecosystems, which serve as a source of livelihood and 
cultural identity. While there is a lack of specific statistics on the situation of individual 
ethnic groups in Sabah and Sarawak, it is generally recognized that these indigenous rural 
communities are among the poorest and most vulnerable groups in the country.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Land rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>64. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur heard a range of testimonies of indigenous 
peoples from peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. While the legal and policy 
framework to protect the rights of indigenous peoples presents differences across States, the 
concerns expressed by indigenous communities were very similar. They related, in 
particular, to problems faced in their access to traditional sources of livelihood as a result of 
encroachment on their lands and the degradation of ecosystems caused by development 
projects, logging and the expansion of palm oil plantations. Closely related to such 
concerns were the problems faced by communities in acquiring official recognition of 
native customary land rights and in participating in the decision-making processes related 
to major development projects affecting their lands and livelihood.  
</p><p>65. As noted elsewhere by the Special Rapporteur,36 and as highlighted in the report of 
the National Inquiry into the Land Rights of Indigenous Peoples, released by SUHAKAM 
on 5 August 2013,37 access to land presents a direct relationship to the right to food: where 
indigenous communities have lost access to the forests and land that they depend on for 
their livelihood, they can fall into a situation of food insecurity and extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur commends SUHAKAM for conducting the Inquiry. The 
recommendations made in its report are in line with international human rights norms and 
standards, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
and jurisprudence from Malaysian courts.38 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes 
the fact that a task force has been set up by the Government to consider ways to implement 
the recommendations made in the report.

</p>
<p>67. Indigenous peoples of Malaysia have clear systems of land tenure, whether 
individual or collective, based on <i>adat</i> (customary systems). Their customary land rights 
are recognized in different laws and policies, such as the Sabah Land Ordinance (1930) and 
the Sabah Land Use Policy (2010); the Sarawak Land Code (1958); the Aboriginal Peoples 
Act (1954) and the National Land Code (1965). Yet, as demonstrated by SUHAKAM, the 
statutory laws relating to land in Sabah, Sarawak and peninsular Malaysia that give 
recognition to traditional land tenure systems fall short for three main reasons: (a) a lack of 
recognition by the authorities of the concept of customary land, or what constitutes 
customary land, resulting in considerable land not being registered as customary land with 
the relevant government departments; (b) inefficiency on the part of the government 
agencies concerned in &#8220;processing&#8221; land ownership claims; and (c) a lack of consultation 
with the indigenous peoples.39 In particular, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
customary land rights are being defined too narrowly by all governments as land that has 
been actively and productively used since a given point in time; this results in effectively 
excluding land used by indigenous groups for foraging, hunting and fishing, or land used in 
rotational agriculture, whereby land is left fallow for a number of years before people are 
allowed to return to it. As a result, the indigenous communities not only lose their access to 
this land, but when land is developed for commercial uses, indigenous groups are not 
consulted and are not given any compensation.  
</p>
<p>68. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recalls the obligation of the Government to 
ensure the demarcation and protection of native customary land rights, as underlined in the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Under the Declaration, 
States are required to give legal recognition and protection to the lands, territories and 
resources that indigenous peoples have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or 
acquired. They are also required to recognize the right of indigenous peoples to own, use, 
develop and control the lands, territories and resources that they possess by reason of 
traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or use, as well as those which they 
have otherwise acquired. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Development projects 
</b>69. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with indigenous communities affected 
by large-scale development projects and the expansion of commercial plantations. He 
heard, inter alia, concerns about the relocation and resettlement of communities for 
development projects and the need to find ways to improve dialogue between the 
Government and the communities affected. In Sabah, he visited communities in the Ulu 
Papar region, where the proposed construction of a dam would require the displacement of 
nine villages, which would have an impact on the communities&#8217; agricultural land and 
sources of livelihood.  
</p>
<p>70. The allocation of competences between the Federation and the States leads to 
differing, though broadly similar, requirements for environmental impact assessments in 
Sabah, Sarawak and peninsular Malaysia for resource-based projects (namely, for land 
development). While environmental impact assessments are required for all major 
development projects in Malaysia, however, social impact assessments are not 
systematically required, and are in fact only made where large-scale development projects 
lead to the resettlement of communities. Although social impact assessments include some 
elements that would overlap with human rights impact assessments, the latter, which would

</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>rely on the normative requirements of human rights and be prepared with the participation 
of the people affected, are not made.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur recommends that all levels of government begin to institute 
social impact and/or human rights impact assessments with environmental impact 
assessments. They should be conceived as a means to build trust between the authorities in 
charge of development projects and the communities affected. The process would have to 
be conducted transparently, with the provision of adequate information to communities 
affected; include the full consideration of all alternatives; and be undertaken prior to the 
launch of any project (rather than as a means to validate a project already commenced). The 
Special Rapporteur also recommends that follow-up assessments be conducted throughout 
and after the conclusion of any project to address ongoing or arising concerns, and that any 
human rights violations that have occurred be remedied.  
</p>
<p>72. In the above regard, the Special Rapporteur also stresses the importance of the 
principle of free, prior and informed consent for any change to the lands and territories of 
the indigenous peoples, as also provided for in the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Article 19 of the Declaration requires States &#8220;to consult and 
cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own 
representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the 
approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly 
in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other 
resources&#8221;. Similarly, consultations should allow for discussion about alternatives and serve 
to ensure that, consistent with the right to development, development projects will &#8220;aim at 
the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals, 
on the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair 
distribution of the benefits resulting therefrom&#8221;.40 
</p>
<p>73. Free, prior and informed consent requires that any option proposed to the indigenous 
communities be part of a range of alternative options from which they should be able to 
make a genuine choice, and that the said communities be fully informed of the long-term 
consequences of such a choice on their livelihoods. It is not enough to consult the 
communities about the consequences of development choices made on their behalf without 
their involvement; instead, they must have a right to oppose the project proposed.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Food adequacy 
</b></p>
<p>74. Malaysia, like many other middle-income countries today, is experiencing a 
nutrition transition, characterized by a shift to more processed foods, generally higher in 
saturated fats, sugars and salt, and to more sedentary lifestyles. In the light of the increasing 
rates of obesity and diabetes in the country, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the 
adequacy of diets available to Malaysians. Obesity increased threefold among adults 
between 1996 and 2006, from 4.4 per cent to 14 cent, then increased more gradually to 15.1 
per cent in 2011.41 Diabetes rates have also seen a steady increase over the same period, 
with current figures suggesting that around 15 per cent of Malaysians are now diabetics.42 
</p>
<p>75. Addressing changing diets and rising rates of non-communicable diseases requires 
coordinated and interministerial action. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur lauds the

<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>National Plan of Action for Nutrition of Malaysia2006-2015 and the National Strategic 
Plan for Non-Communicable Diseases 2010-2014. The National Plan of Action for 
Nutrition involves and coordinates the efforts of 29 government and non-governmental 
agencies in an effort to achieve and maintain the nutritional well-being of Malaysians. The 
National Strategic Plan focuses on seven strategies for the prevention and control of non-
communicable diseases through a &#8220;whole-of-government&#8221; and &#8220;whole-of-society&#8221; 
approach. The Special Rapporteur also commends Malaysia for the recent policy decision 
to end subsidies for sugar in an effort to reduce the sugar intake of Malaysians in the face of 
rising obesity and diabetes rates.43 the Special Rapporteur notes, however, that Malaysia 
will need to continue to invest and engage in strategic planning to address diabetes and 
obesity and the inadequacy of diets if it is to ensure a healthy population in the future. 
</p>
<p>76. Malaysia is also taking important strides to reduce malnutrition in children and to 
introduce healthy eating education at an early age. Healthy school canteen guidelines are 
addressed to school canteen operators and identify the types of food that should be sold. 
Programmes such as the Rehabilitation Programme for Malnourished Children and the ones 
aimed specifically at Orang Asli children have provided immediate assistance to families as 
well as communities to improve the nutritional status of malnourished children. The said 
programmes might not, however, be meeting all families in need and, as a result, may only 
have a limited impact. Concerns have been raised by civil society that programmes often 
end too early; as a result, children enter primary school still undernourished. The 
Supplementary Feeding Programme (RMT) and School Milk Programme (PSS) in schools, 
coordinated by the Ministry of Education, work to ensure that primary school pupils whose 
families have a monthly income of less RM520 to RM 660 (depending on their location) 
are provided with nutritious meals and milk at school. Despite these efforts, however, the 
Special Rapporteur heard concerns from civil society about the quality and nutritional value 
of foods available in school canteens, and that children were not consuming sufficient 
quantities of fruit and vegetables. Although the rates of childhood obesity in the country are 
disputed, promoting healthy eating from a young age can ensure that children are educated 
about healthy diets and have the tools to make proper choices about their nutritional intake 
as they grow older.  
</p>
<p>77. Supporting breastfeeding is another means by which the Government of Malaysia 
can support adequate diets and a healthy start for children. The increasing prevalence of 
women in the workforce (the Ministry of Human Resources suggests women made up 56.4 
per cent of the workforce in 2013) may pose challenges to breastfeeding. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue and further develop programmes to 
assist employers in providing affordable child-care options for women in the workplace, 
and to ensure that facilities exist where women can breastfeed or express milk. Similar 
facilities should be made available in other public spaces. Other programmes, such as peer 
education for new mothers and strengthened protection of maternity leave, could further 
provide women with the resources needed to breastfeed their children.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Concluding observations and recommendations 
</b>78. <b>Malaysia has adopted a wide range of policies and programmes under the 
Tenth Malaysia Plan to ensure the effective enjoyment of the right to food as part of 
the right to an adequate standard of living. Impressive results have followed in the 
form of a continuous reduction of income poverty. Innovative measures have been 
taken to enhance intersectoral coordination in the implementation of these

Transformation Programme and the Government Transformation Programme

<p>79.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that more should be done to facilitate 
non-governmental oversight of government action. In particular, appropriately 
disaggregated statistical data should be more easily accessible and further space 
should be created for dialogue with civil society partners. The process of formulating 
the Eleventh Malaysia Plan 2016-2020 as well as efforts under way to develop a 
national human rights plan of action offer ideal opportunities to institutionalize 
intersectoral coordination and the participation of civil society.
