<p><i>Recalling</i> resolution 2/4-EX (IS) of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation of 15

<p>August 2012 on the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, in which the Organization called 
</p>
<p>for the immediate implementation of the transitional plan and the development of a

</p>
<p>and a democratic and civilian system, where there would be equality on the basis of law, 
</p>
<p>citizenship and fundamental freedoms,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and 
</p>
<p>territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the principles of the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>grave concern</i> at the escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab Republic 
</p>
<p>and at the growing number of refugees and internally displaced persons fleeing the 
</p>
<p>violence, and welcoming the efforts by neighbouring countries to host Syrian refugees, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its deep concern </i>at the failure to implement the six-point plan of the 
</p>

</p>
<p>Brahimi as the new joint special representative of the United Nations and the League of 
</p>
<p>Arab States on the Syrian crisis, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the statements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights before the Human Rights Council and the Security Council that crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity are likely to have been committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and 
</p>
<p>noting her repeated encouragement to the Security Council to refer the situation to the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes </i>the report of the independent international commission of inquiry 
</p>
<p>on the Syrian Arab Republic,1 submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>

</p>
<p>with the commission of inquiry; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Condemns</i> all violence, irrespective of where it comes from, including 
</p>
<p>terrorist acts; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the continued widespread and systematic gross violations 
</p>
<p>of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities and the Government 
</p>
<p>controlled militia <i>Shabbiha</i>, such as the use of heavy weapons and force against civilians, 
</p>
<p>massacres, arbitrary executions, extrajudicial killings, the killing and persecution of 
</p>
<p>protestors, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances, interference with access to medical treatment, torture, sexual violence and 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment, including against children, as well as any human rights abuses by armed 
</p>
<p>opposition groups; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Condemns in the strongest terms</i> the massacre of the village of Al-Houla near 
</p>
<p>Homs, where the forces of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and members of 
</p>
<p>the <i>Shabbiha</i> were found by the commission of inquiry to be the perpetrators of outrageous 
</p>
<p>and heinous crimes, and stresses the need to hold those responsible to account; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Calls upon</i> all parties to put an end to all forms of violence; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Also</i> <i>calls upon</i> all parties to respect fully international law applicable to the 
</p>
<p>rights and protection of women and girls, and to take special measures to protect women 
</p>
<p>and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>and also calls for the involvement of women at decision-making levels in conflict resolution 
</p>
<p>and peace processes; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Urges</i> the Syrian authorities to release immediately all persons arbitrarily 
</p>
<p>detained, to publish a list of all detention facilities, to ensure that conditions of detention 
</p>
<p>comply with applicable international law and to allow immediately access of independent 
</p>
<p>monitors to all detention facilities;

<p>9. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its call</i> upon the Syrian authorities to meet its responsibility to 
</p>
<p>protect the Syrian population; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Stresses</i> <i>the need</i> to follow up on the report of the commission of inquiry and 
</p>
<p>to conduct an international, transparent, independent and prompt investigation into abuses 
</p>
<p>and violations of international law, with a view to hold to account those responsible for 
</p>
<p>violations and abuses, including those that may amount to crimes against humanity and war 
</p>
<p>crimes, and encourages members of the international community to ensure that there is no 
</p>
<p>impunity for such violations or abuses, stressing that the Syrian authorities have failed to 
</p>
<p>prosecute alleged perpetrators of serious violations or abuses, which may amount to war 
</p>
<p>crimes or crimes against humanity, and notes in this regard the potential relevance of 
</p>
<p>international justice, while underscoring the importance of the recommendation of the 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry that the Syrian people, on the basis of broad, inclusive and credible 
</p>
<p>consultations, should determine, within the framework provided by international law, the 
</p>
<p>process and mechanisms to achieve reconciliation, truth and accountability for gross 
</p>
<p>violations, as well as reparations and effective remedies for victims; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Stresses</i> <i>its support</i> for the aspirations of the Syrian people for a peaceful, 
</p>
<p>democratic and pluralistic society, in which there is no room for sectarianism or 
</p>
<p>discrimination on ethnic, religious, linguistic or any other grounds, based on the promotion 
</p>
<p>of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Underlines</i> <i>the responsibility</i> of all States Members of Human Rights Council

</p>
<p>Arab Republic;

<p>13. <i>Urges</i> the international community to provide urgent financial support to the

<p>14. <i>Urges</i> all relevant United Nations agencies, in particular the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other donors, to provide urgent and 
</p>
<p>more support to Syrian refugees and their host countries;

<p>15. <i>Urges </i>all donors to provide expeditiously financial support to the Office for 
</p>
<p>the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and international humanitarian organizations as 
</p>
<p>requested in the humanitarian appeal on the Syrian Arab Republic so that they can 
</p>
<p>implement more actively the humanitarian response plan inside the country; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its call</i> upon the Syrian authorities to allow and facilitate 
</p>
<p>immediate, unimpeded and full access of humanitarian organizations to all areas of the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic in order to allow them to provide relief and humanitarian assistance,
