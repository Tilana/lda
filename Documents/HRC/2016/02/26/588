<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>,

</p>
<p>particular the provisions of Articles 1 and 55 thereof, which affirm the right of peoples to 
</p>
<p>self-determination, and reaffirming the need for the scrupulous respect of the principle of 
</p>
<p>refraining in international relations from the threat or use of force, as specified in the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and 
</p>
<p>Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 
</p>
<p>by the General Assembly in its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also</i> by the provisions of article 1 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights, which affirm that all peoples have the right to self-determination, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided further</i> by the International Covenants on Human Rights, the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to 
</p>
<p>Colonial Countries and Peoples, in particular article 1 thereof, as well as by the provisions 
</p>
<p>of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted on 25 June 1993 by the 
</p>
<p>World Conference on Human Rights,1 and in particular Part I, paragraphs 2 and 3, relating 
</p>
<p>to the right of self-determination of all peoples and especially those subject to foreign 
</p>
<p>occupation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>General Assembly resolutions 181 A and B (II) of 29 November 1947 and 
</p>
<p>194 (III) of 11 December 1948, and all other relevant United Nations resolutions, including 
</p>
<p>those adopted by the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, that confirm and define the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, 
</p>
<p>particularly their right to self-determination, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Recalling also</i> Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, 338 
</p>
<p>(1973) of 22 October 1973, 1397 (2002) of 12 March 2002 and 1402 (2002) of 30 March 
</p>
<p>2002, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of General Assembly resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the provisions of the Charter, relevant United Nations resolutions and declarations, 
</p>
<p>and the provisions of international covenants and instruments relating to the right to self- 
</p>
<p>determination as an international principle and as a right of all peoples in the world, and 
</p>
<p>emphasizing that this jus cogens norm of international law is a basic prerequisite for 
</p>
<p>achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> the applicability of the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural 
</p>
<p>resources to the Palestinian situation as an integral component of the right to self- 
</p>
<p>determination, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the conclusion of the International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion 
</p>
<p>of 9 July 2004, that the construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying Power, in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, along with measures previously 
</p>
<p>taken, severely impedes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, which is a 
</p>
<p>right <i>erga omnes</i>, and considering that the right to self-determination of the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>people is being further violated by Israel through the existence and ongoing expansion of 
</p>
<p>settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the United Nations will continue to be engaged on the question of 
</p>
<p>Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in accordance with international 
</p>
<p>law, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the inalienable, permanent and unqualified right of the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>people to self-determination, including their right to live in freedom, justice and dignity and 
</p>
<p>the right to their independent State of Palestine; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> its support for the solution of two States, Palestine and Israel, 
</p>
<p>living side by side in peace and security; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Notes</i> that the fragmentation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</p>
<p>undermines the possibility of the Palestinian people realizing their right to self-
</p>
<p>determination and is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, and stresses in this regard the need for respect for and the preservation of 
</p>
<p>the territorial unity, contiguity and integrity of all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Confirms</i> that the right of the Palestinian people to permanent sovereignty 
</p>
<p>over their natural wealth and resources must be used in the interest of their national 
</p>
<p>development, the well-being of the Palestinian people and as part of the realization of their 
</p>
<p>right to self-determination; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> all Member States and relevant bodies of the United Nations system to 
</p>
<p>support and assist the Palestinian people in the early realization of their right to self- 
</p>
<p>determination; </p>


<p>6. <i>Decides</i> to continue the consideration of this question at its thirty-first 
</p>
<p>session. 
</p>
