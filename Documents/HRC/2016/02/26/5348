<p><i> Recalling</i> Council resolution 7/36 of 28 March 2008 and all previous resolutions of the

<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression is one of 
the essential foundations of a democratic society, is enabled by a democratic environment, which 
offers, inter alia, guarantees for its protection, is essential to full and effective participation in a 
free and democratic society, and is instrumental to the development and strengthening of 
effective democratic systems, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that the effective exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression is an important indicator of the level of protection of other human rights and 
freedoms, bearing in mind that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
continue to occur, including increased attacks directed against, and killings of, journalists and 
</p>
<p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>media workers, and stressing the need to ensure greater protection for all media professionals 
and for journalistic sources, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the need to ensure that the invocation of national security, including 
counter-terrorism, is not used unjustifiably or arbitrarily to restrict the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing also</i> the importance of the full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information, including the fundamental importance of access to information, democratic 
participation, accountability and combating corruption, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the importance of all forms of the media<i>, </i>including the printed media, radio, 
television and the Internet, in the exercise, promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression carries with it special 
duties and responsibilities, in accordance with article 19 (3) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> that States should encourage free, responsible and mutually respectful 
dialogue, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>the rights contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, in particular the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference, as well as the 
right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information 
and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of 
art or through any other media of their choice, and the intrinsically linked rights to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion, peaceful assembly and association and the right to take part in 
the conduct of public affairs; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression (A/HRC/11/4), as well as his presentation and the 
interactive dialogue thereon at its eleventh session; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses </i>its continuing concern that: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Violations of the rights referred to in paragraph 1 above continue to occur, often with 
impunity, including extrajudicial killing, arbitrary detention, torture, intimidation, persecution 
and harassment, threats and acts of violence and of discrimination, including gender-based 
violence and discrimination, increased abuse of legal provisions on defamation and criminal libel 
as well as on surveillance, search and seizure, and censorship against persons who exercise, seek 
to promote or defend these rights, including journalists, writers and other media workers, 
Internet users and human rights defenders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) These above-mentioned violations are facilitated and aggravated by the abuse of 
states of emergency; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Threats and acts of violence, including killings, attacks and terrorist acts, particularly 
directed against journalists and other media workers in situations of armed conflict, have </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>increased and are not adequately punished, in particular in those circumstances where public 
authorities are involved in committing those acts; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) High rates of illiteracy continue to exist in the world, especially among women, and 
reaffirms that full and equal access to education for girls and boys, women and men, is crucial 
for the full enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Media concentration is a growing phenomenon in the world and can limit a plurality 
of views; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also expresses </i>its concern that incidents of racial and religious intolerance, 
discrimination and related violence, as well as of negative racial and religious stereotyping 
continue to rise around the world, and condemns, in this context, any advocacy of national, racial 
or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, and urges 
States to take effective measures, consistent with their obligations under international human 
rights law, to address and combat such incidents; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> all States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To respect and ensure the respect for the rights referred to in paragraph 1 above; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To take all necessary measures to put an end to violations of these rights and to 
create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that relevant national 
legislation complies with their international human rights obligations and is effectively 
implemented; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure that victims of violations of the rights referred to in paragraph 1 above 
have an effective remedy, to investigate effectively threats and acts of violence, including 
terrorist acts, against journalists, including in situations of armed conflict, and to bring to justice 
those responsible in order to combat impunity; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To ensure that persons exercising the above-mentioned rights are not discriminated 
against, particularly in employment, housing, the justice system, social services and education, 
with particular attention to women; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To facilitate the full, equal and effective participation and free communication of 
women at all levels of decision-making in their societies and in national, regional and 
international institutions, including in mechanisms for the prevention, management and 
resolution of conflicts; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To enable children to exercise their right to express their views freely, including 
through school curricula that encourage the development of and respect for different opinions, 
and to have their views taken into account in all matters affecting them, the views of the child 
being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To respect freedom of expression in the media and broadcasting, in particular the 
editorial independence of the media; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To promote a pluralistic approach to information and multiple points of view by 
encouraging a diversity of ownership of media and of sources of information, including mass 
media, through, inter alia, transparent licensing systems and effective regulations on undue 
concentration of ownership of the media in the private sector; </p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) To create and permit an enabling environment in which training and professional 
development of the media can be organized in order to promote and protect the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression and can be carried out without threat of legal, criminal or 
administrative sanction by the State; 
</p>
<p> (<i>j</i>) Consistent with their human rights law obligations, to refrain from the use of 
imprisonment or the imposition of fines for offences relating to the media, which are 
disproportionate to the gravity of the offence; 
</p>
<p> (<i>k</i>) To adopt and implement policies and programmes that aim to effectively raise 
awareness of, and disseminate information and education on, prevention and treatment of 
HIV/AIDS and other diseases through effective and equal access to information and all 
appropriate means, including through the media and availability of information and 
communication technologies, and targeted at specific vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p> (<i>l</i>) To adopt and implement laws and policies that provide for a general right of public 
access to information held by public authorities, which may be restricted only in accordance with 
article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; </p>
<p> (<i>m</i>) To facilitate equal participation in, access to and use of information and 
communications technology, such as the Internet, applying a gender perspective, and to 
encourage international cooperation aimed at the development of media and information and 
communication facilities in all countries; </p>
<p> (<i>n</i>) To review their procedures, practices and legislation, as necessary, with a view to 
ensure the full and effective implementation of all their obligations under international human 
rights law, including to ensure that any limitations on the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression are only such as are provided by law and are necessary for the respect of the rights 
and reputations of others, or for the protection of national security or of public order (<i>ordre</i> 
<i>public</i>) or of public health or morals; 
</p>
<p> (<i>o</i>) To refrain from using counter-terrorism as a pretext to restrict the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression in ways that are contrary to their obligations under international law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>p</i>) While noting that article 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights provides that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
carries with it special duties and responsibilities, to refrain from imposing restrictions that are not 
consistent with paragraph 3 of that article, including on: 
</p>
<p>(i) Discussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human 
rights, government activities and corruption in government; engaging in 
election campaigns, peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>for peace or democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or 
belief, including by persons belonging to minorities or vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p>(ii) The free flow of information and ideas, including practices such as the banning 
or closing of publications or other media and the abuse of administrative 
measures and censorship; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Access to or use of information and communication technologies, including 
radio, television and the Internet; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> that condemning and addressing, in accordance with their obligations under 
international human rights law, including those regarding equal protection of the law, any 
advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence is an important safeguard to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all, including persons belonging to<b> </b>minorities; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls on</i> all parties to armed conflict to respect international humanitarian law, 
including their obligations under the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and, where 
applicable, the Additional Protocols thereto of 8 June 1977, the provisions of which extend 
protection to journalists in situations of armed conflict, and to allow, within the framework of 
applicable rules and procedures, media access and coverage, as appropriate, in situations of 
international and non-international armed conflict; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Recognizes</i> the moral and social responsibilities of the media and the importance that 
the media&#8217;s elaboration of voluntary codes of professional ethical<b> </b>conduct can play in combating 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also recognizes</i> the positive contribution that the exercise of the right to freedom of 
expression, particularly by the media, including through information and communication 
technologies such as the Internet, and full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information can make to the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance and to preventing human rights abuses, but expresses regret at the promotion by 
certain media of false images and negative stereotypes of vulnerable individuals or groups of 
individuals, and at the use of information and communication technologies such as the Internet 
for purposes contrary to respect for human rights, in particular the perpetration of violence 
against and exploitation and abuse of women and children, and disseminating racist and 
xenophobic discourse or content; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Reaffirms </i>the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information can play 
in strengthening democracy, combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, in line with relevant provisions of international human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes</i> that the open public debate of ideas, as well as interfaith and intercultural 
dialogue at the local, national, and international levels, can be among the best protections against 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and can play a positive role in 
strengthening democracy and combating national, racial or religious hatred; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to
