<p><i>Summary 
</i>The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/29, 
</p>
<p>provides information on the status of implementation of the recommendations contained in

It addresses continued Israeli settlement activity, settler violence and accountability, 
Palestinian detainees, including children in Israeli custody, as well as business and human 
rights in relation to the settlements. The report also includes summaries of the submissions 
received from Member States. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b> I. Background  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 22/29 on the follow-up to the report of the independent international 
fact-finding mission to investigate the implications of Israeli settlements on the civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem (A/HRC/22/63), the Human 
Rights Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
present a report detailing the implementation of the recommendations contained in the 
report to the Council at its twenty-fifth session. The present report, submitted pursuant to 
that request, contains the information requested and received from States to which the fact-
finding mission addressed recommendations, as well as information gathered directly by 
the United Nations. It should be read in conjunction with the recent reports of the 
Secretary-General and the High Commissioner on the situation of human rights in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory.1   
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview 
</b>2. In its report, the fact-finding mission made six recommendations, of which four 
were addressed to the State of Israel. Basing itself on article 49 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention, the mission called upon Israel to cease all settlement activities without 
preconditions; to immediately initiate a process of withdrawal of all settlers from the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory; and to ensure adequate, effective and prompt remedy for all 
Palestinian victims for the harm suffered as a consequence of human rights violations that 
were a result of the settlements, in accordance with its international obligation to provide 
effective remedy. The mission noted that, where necessary, steps should be taken to provide 
such remedy in concurrence with the representatives of the Palestinian people and the 
assistance of the international community.  
</p>
<p>3. In addition, the fact-finding mission called upon Israel to put an end to the human 
rights violations linked to the presence of settlements, and to ensure full accountability for 
all violations, including for all acts of settler violence, in a non-discriminatory manner, and 
to put an end to the policy of impunity. It furthermore urged Israel to put an end to arbitrary 
arrests and detention of Palestinians, especially children, and to observe the prohibition of 
the transfer of prisoners from the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the territory of Israel, in 
accordance with article 76 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
</p>
<p>4. In its report, the fact-finding mission called upon all Member States to comply with 
their obligations under international law and to assume their responsibilities in their 
relations with a State breaching peremptory norms of international law, and specifically not 
to recognize an unlawful situation resulting from Israel&#8217;s violations.  
</p>
<p>5. Lastly, the fact-finding mission stated that private companies must assess the human 
rights impact of their activities and take all necessary steps &#8211; including by terminating their 
business interests in the settlements &#8211; to ensure that they do not have an adverse impact on 
the human rights of the Palestinian people, in conformity with international law and the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In this regard, the mission called upon 
all Member States to take appropriate measures to ensure that business enterprises 
domiciled in their territory and/or under their jurisdiction, including those owned or 
controlled by them, that conduct activities in or related to the settlements, respect human

<p>rights throughout their operations. The mission recommended that the Working Group on 
Business and Human Rights be seized of this matter. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Status of implementation of the recommendations of the fact-
finding mission 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Israeli settlement activity and recourse to remedy for Palestinians  
</b></p>
<p>6. As noted in the report of the Secretary-General on Israeli settlements in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, submitted to the General 
Assembly at its sixty-eighth session (A/68/513), Israel has continued to play a leading role 
in the creation and expansion of settlements in violation of international law. 
Notwithstanding the recommendations made to Israel by the fact-finding mission in its 
report and the renewal of peace negotiations mediated by the United States of America, 
Israel has continued to promote settlement expansion. As affirmed by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 22/29, Israeli settlement activities undermine international efforts 
with respect to the peace process and the realization of a two-State solution.  
</p>
<p>7. From March to November 2013, plans for at least 8,943 new settlement units were 
promoted by the Government of Israel in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.2 Israel 
has also made a number of public announcements regarding settlement construction, for 
example on 30 October, when it announced the construction of 5,000 new units in the West 
Bank, including East Jerusalem, a day after the release of 26 Palestinian prisoners in the 
context of the peace process. The Secretary-General publicly deplored the continuing 
expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, on a number 
of occasions, and has repeatedly stated that settlements are in violation of international law, 
and that all settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem must cease.3 He urged 
Israel to heed the calls of the international community and abide by its commitments under 
international law and the Quartet road map.4  
8. The continued fragmentation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, through 
Israeli settlement expansion has gone hand-in-hand with the construction of the wall, the 
destruction of Palestinian-owned property and the forcible displacement of Palestinian 
civilians, including Bedouin communities. These acts violate Israel&#8217;s obligation to protect 
the population under occupation and run counter to the advisory opinion of the International 
Court of Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory</i> of 4 July 2004, and may have further undermined the possibility for 
the Palestinian people to realize their right to self-determination through the creation of a 
viable State.5  
</p>
<p>9. As at November 2013, Israel had not provided remedy for Palestinian victims for the 
harm suffered as a consequence of human rights violations resulting from settlements. The 
United Nations Register of Damage Caused by the Construction of the Wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, established in 2007, collected more than 38,500 claims and 
more than half a million supporting documents in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Of

<p>these claims, to date 8,994 cases have been reviewed by the Board of the Register and 
deemed valid for inclusion in the Register.6<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Settler violence and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>10. With regard to settler violence, in her most recent report submitted to the Human 
Rights Council on the implementation of resolution 22/26,7the High Commissioner 
highlighted the failure of Israel to maintain public order, contain settler violence, address 
the lack of meaningful accountability and afford protection from the said violence. Since 
February 2013, Israeli settlers have continued to attack Palestinians and their property in 
the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, despite Israel&#8217;s obligation under international law 
to protect Palestinians and their property from acts of violence by settlers, to ensure 
accountability for crimes committed and to provide remedy for violations suffered by 
Palestinians. Between 2005 and 2013, only 8.5 per cent of the investigations opened in 
relation to settler violence incidents in the West Bank resulted in indictments, and some 84 
per cent of the investigations were closed, owing mainly to investigatory failures, including 
the lack of identification of suspects and the inability to collect evidence for prosecution.8  
</p>
<p><b> C. Palestinian detainees, including children in Israeli custody 
</b></p>
<p>11. The fact-finding mission called for Israel to put an end to arbitrary arrests and 
detention of Palestinians, especially children. As at 1 October 2013, 5,046 Palestinians 
were in Israeli detention. A total of135 of them were in administrative detention on security 
grounds, without charge or trial; well over half of them had been held for more than six 
months, and some for more than three years.9 In this connection, the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967,the 
Secretary-General, the High Commissioner,  and the Special Committee to Investigate 
Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of 
the Occupied Territories have documented the treatment of Palestinian detainees, including 
children in Israeli custody.10 
</p>
<p>12. In February 2013, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) issued a report in 
which it documented significant alleged violations of children&#8217;s rights in the West Bank, 
noting that the ill-treatment of Palestinian children who come in contact with the Israeli 
military detention system appeared to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized 
throughout the process, from the moment of arrest until the child&#8217;s prosecution and 
eventual conviction and sentencing.11 
</p>
<p>13. UNICEF issued an update report in October 2013 concerning progress made by the 
Israeli authorities towards implementing some of the 38 recommendations contained in its 
previous report. The actions taken by the Israeli Military Advocate General included, inter 
alia, an agreement by the Israeli Defense Forces Central Command for the West Bank to 
pilot a test summons of children in certain areas of the West Bank, in lieu of night arrests,

<p>and the issuance of military orders reducing the time that a Palestinian child could be 
detained prior to appearing before a military court judge for the first time, as well as 
regulating the duration of remand prior to indictment.12  
</p>
<p><b> D. Business and human rights in relation to the settlements  
</b></p>
<p>14. In its resolution 22/29, the Human Rights Council called upon the relevant United 
Nations bodies to take all necessary measures and actions within their mandates to ensure 
full respect for and compliance with Council resolution 17/4 on the Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights and other relevant international laws and standards, and to 
ensure the implementation of the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; 
Framework, which provides a global standard for upholding human rights in relation to 
business activities that are connected with Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem. Pursuant to resolution 22/29, the Working Group on 
the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises 
discussed the Council&#8217;s request to fulfil its mandate accordingly during its fifth session, and 
decided to issue a statement thereon before the twenty-sixth session of the Council.13 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories 
occupied since 1967 reported on the involvement of companies that profit from the 
construction and maintenance of settlements as well as other activities related to settlements 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.14 In his most recent report (A/68/376), the Special 
Rapporteur explored the implications of corporate involvement by way of a model of legal 
analysis to assess the probability of liability, including international criminal liability, for 
corporate complicity in breaches of international law related to illegal settlements. 
</p>
<p>16. In this context, the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the 
Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories also 
reported on the involvement of companies profiting from the settlements, and noted that 
businesses need to exercise due diligence in the light of the potential legal and reputational 
consequences for businesses associated with Israel&#8217;s settlement enterprise.15 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Submissions by Member States pursuant to resolution 22/29  
</b>17. On 16 October 2013, the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) addressed 
notes verbales to all Permanent Missions to the United Nations Office and other 
international organizations in Geneva (except Israel and the State of Palestine), in which it 
requested information on any steps that their Government had taken, envisaged taking or 
were otherwise aware of concerning the status of implementation of the recommendations 
of the fact-finding mission report (A/HRC/22/63), and in particular with regard to those 
contained in paragraphs 116 and 117 thereof.  
</p>
<p>18. Separate notes verbales were addressed to the Permanent Mission of Israel and the 
Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine, in which OHCHR requested 
information on any steps that their respective Government had taken, envisaged taking or 
were otherwise aware of concerning the status of implementation of the recommendations 
of the fact-finding mission report. At the time of the preparation of the present report, no

<p>information had been received from either the Permanent Mission of Israel or the 
Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine.  
</p>
<p><b>  Cuba 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Permanent Mission of Cuba submitted a note verbale dated 7 November 2013. 
Cuba condemned the colonization by Israel of the occupied Palestinian territories, including 
East Jerusalem, and the violence, terror, provocation and incitement by Israeli settlers 
against Palestinian civilians and property, including homes, orchards, mosques and 
churches. Cuba deplored all illegal Israeli measures associated with the continued 
colonization of the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including the destruction of vast tracts 
of land, and the construction and expansion of illegal settlements, outposts and associated 
settlement infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>20. Cuba also condemned the demolition of Palestinian homes, the revocation of 
residency permits, the ongoing construction of the wall and the imposition of arbitrary and 
racist restrictions on residence and movement through a regime of permits and checkpoints 
throughout occupied Palestine, including within and around East Jerusalem. Cuba 
expressed concern at the separation of East Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied territory 
and the fragmentation of Palestinian territory into isolated areas and walled cantons. It also 
expressed its concern at the displacement of thousands of Palestinians in the occupied 
Palestinian territories, including many Bedouin families.  
</p>
<p>21. Cuba stated that such policies and practices by Israel, the occupying Power, 
constituted serious violations of international law and a flagrant defiance of United Nations 
resolutions and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July 2004. In 
this regard, Cuba called for the prompt implementation of the mandate of the United 
Nations Register of Damage Caused by the Construction of the Wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory. 
</p>
<p>22. Cuba noted that there was an incompatibility between the peace process negotiations 
and the practice of illegal colonization, which aimed to impose a unilateral solution by 
creating facts on the ground through the illegal acquisition of land and de facto annexation 
of Palestinian territory. It also noted that Israel&#8217;s illegal colonization seriously undermined 
the contiguity, integrity, unity and viability of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and 
threatened the prospects of a peaceful two-State solution within the borders of 1967. Cuba 
affirmed that illegal settlement activities remained the largest obstacle to peace, which 
undermined all efforts to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, including East 
Jerusalem.  
</p>
<p>23. Cuba stressed that Israel had no jurisdiction over the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including the &#8220;illegal&#8221; settlements, and urged the international community to continue its 
efforts to achieve compliance with the resolutions adopted by the Security Council, the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>  Denmark 
</b></p>
<p>24. In a note verbale dated 12 November 2013, the Permanent Mission of Denmark 
stated that Denmark was pursuing a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
and that it actively supported the ongoing efforts made by the two parties to reach a peace 
agreement. Denmark associated itself fully with the efforts made by the United States of 
America in recent months, and noted that the present situation offered more hope than in 
the past few years.  </p>


<p>25. Denmark pointed out that, as a member of the European Union, it fully associated 
itself with the policy and initiatives undertaken by the European Union as a whole, as well 
as the various efforts made by the European External Action Service and the Commission 
of the European Union to further peace and justice.  
</p><p>26. Denmark also pointed out that, in October 2012, it had issued guidance to Danish 
retailers on labelling certain settlement products on a voluntary basis. The correct 
identification of the country of origin was required for all products, and the guidance issued 
by the Government of Denmark prohibited the labelling of products from the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory as originating from &#8220;Israel&#8221;. According to the guidance, settlement 
produce could be labelled as &#8220;Origin: the West Bank&#8221; or &#8220;Produced at the West Bank&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>  European Union 
</b></p>
<p>27. According to the note by the Permanent Delegation of the European Union 
submitted dated 21 November 2013, the European Union had consistently regarded Israeli 
settlements as illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace. Continued settlement 
expansion undermined the prospects of a negotiated resolution of the conflict by 
jeopardizing the possibility of a contiguous and viable Palestinian State, and that of 
Jerusalem, as the future capital of two States.  
</p>
<p>28. The European Union also pointed out that, on 19 July 2013, it had published 
guidelines on the eligibility of Israeli entities for European Union funding, in conformity 
with a series of unanimous political positions taken by the Foreign Affairs Council. This 
included the conclusions by the Council on the Middle East peace process of 10 December 
2012, according to which all agreements between the State of Israel and the European 
Union had to, in accordance with international law, indicate unequivocally and explicitly 
their inapplicable nature to the territories occupied by Israeli in 1967. It also referred to the 
decision by the Council with regard to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which stated that 
&#8220;settlement activity will not benefit from any sort of EU funding or programmes&#8221;. The 
European Union also noted that these guidelines were in line with the long-standing 
position of the European Union not to recognize the sovereignty of Israel over the occupied 
territories or to consider them part of Israel.  
</p>
<p>29. The European Union reaffirmed its commitment to ensure continued, full and 
effective implementation of existing European Union legislation and bilateral agreements 
applicable to settlement products, and referred to a revised notice to importers issued on 3 
August 2012 concerning imports from Israel to the European Union. It also referred to an 
earlier notice, published on 25 January 2005, in which operators had been reminded that 
products produced in the Israeli settlements located within the territories brought under 
Israeli administration in June 1967 were not entitled to benefit from preferential tariff 
treatment under the European Union-Israel Association Agreement.  
</p>
<p>30. The European Union also noted that, since 1 February 2005, the exclusion of 
settlement goods from preferential treatment has been implemented in the European Union 
in accordance with a &#8220;technical agreement&#8221; concluded by the European Union and Israel, 
whereby the postal code and the name of the city, village or industrial zone where 
production conferring originating status had taken place appeared on all proof of 
preferential origin issued, or made in Israel. Member States custom authorities also checked 
whether the postal codes appearing on Israeli proof of origin presented to them 
corresponded to any of the postal codes appearing in the list of non-eligible locations made 
available to them by the Commission, and refused preference where it was. It noted that the 
list of non-eligible locations had been made public as a result of the afore-mentioned 
revised notice of 3 August 2012.  </p>


<p>31. In addition, on 22 June 2013, the European Commission had published 
implementing regulation OJEU L-170 on marketing standards that excluded fresh fruit and 
vegetables in the occupied territories from the possibility of being certified by Israeli 
authorities. The European Union also expressed its belief that the Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, endorsed by the Human Rights Council, had to be applied 
globally, and called on European companies to implement the Guiding Principles in all 
circumstances, including in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
</p>
<p><b>  Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>32. In a note submitted by the Permanent Mission of Ireland on 6 November 2013, the 
Government of Ireland pointed out that it did not recognize any transfer of sovereignty or 
annexation of Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967 pending an agreement 
between the parties to the conflict. Ireland had consistently affirmed that the establishment 
of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory was in breach of international 
law. 
</p>
<p>33. Ireland was considering the formulation of a national plan of action for the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It was not aware 
of any Irish businesses engaged in activities in Israeli settlements. It stated that the website 
of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland carried a warning to persons 
considering investing in or buying property in the settlements with regard to their legal 
status. The questions of access to the market and the treatment and labelling of goods 
produced in settlements were determined at the level of the European Union. 
</p>
<p><b>  Saudi Arabia 
</b></p>
<p>34. In a note verbale dated 23 October 2013, the Permanent Mission of the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia stated that Arabia had no political, economic, trade or investment relations 
with Israel or with any companies referred to in the recommendation contained in 
paragraph 117 of the report (A/HRC/22/63) or any of their activities.  
</p>
<p><b>  Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>35. In a note verbale dated 6 November 2013, the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab 
Republic stated that the report of the fact-finding mission had reaffirmed the &#8220;viciousness&#8221; 
of Israeli policies and practices towards the Palestinian people, their property and land. It 
noted that the said policies and practices demonstrated Israel&#8217;s contempt for international 
humanitarian and human rights law.  
</p>
<p>36. The Syrian Arab Republic endorsed the findings of the report of the fact-finding 
mission and affirmed that the continued occupation of Arab territories since 1967 was the 
root cause of the human rights violations witnessed. It called upon Israel to comply with 
United Nations resolutions, including Security Council resolution 242 (1967), and to 
withdraw from the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, occupied since 1967. 
This was the only solution that would enable the Palestinians to enjoy fully their right to 
self-determination and to establish an independent State.  
</p>
<p>37. The Syrian Arab Republic was fully cognizant of the implications of the practices of 
the occupying Power in the Palestinian territories, given that Israel committed the same 
violations in the occupied Syrian Golan. The Syrian Arab Republic asserted that its call for 
Israel to end the occupation did not contradict the recommendations of the fact-finding 
mission, and noted that the recommendations contained in the report of the mission were 
temporary measures needed to mitigate the impact of the occupation, including settler 
violence, and to halt the encroachment on Palestinian land through illegal settlement 
construction.  </p>


<p>38. In conclusion, the Syrian Arab Republic welcomed the report of the fact-finding 
mission and commended the efforts to seek the truth in an independent, apolitical and 
impartial manner. It also expressed its willingness to cooperate by furthering the 
implementation of the recommendations outlined by the mission in its report in order to end 
Israeli violations of the Palestinian people. Finally, the Syrian Arab Republic urged that 
serious measures be taken to end the occupation of all Arab territories occupied since 1967.
