<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 13/2 of the Human Rights 
Council. In the report, the Secretary-General analyzes the impact of the arbitrary 
deprivation of nationality on the enjoyment of human rights, including civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights. He notes that, while international human rights law 
clearly establishes the obligation of all States to respect the human rights of all individuals 
without distinction of any kind, States may restrict the enjoyment of some international 
human rights vis-&#224;-vis non-citizens, subject to stringent conditions related to the principle 
of non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p> The Secretary-General further notes that the arbitrary deprivation of nationality 
leads the affected persons to become non-citizens with respect to the State that deprived 
them of their nationality. Arbitrary deprivation of nationality, therefore, effectively places 
the affected persons in a more disadvantaged situation concerning the enjoyment of their 
human rights because some of these rights may be subjected to lawful limitations that 
otherwise would not apply, but also because these persons are placed in a situation of 
increased vulnerability to human rights violations.

<p> I. Introduction .............................................................................................................  1&#8211;<footnote name="4">. States may limit the enjoyment of certain human rights to nationals, but any such 
restriction must nevertheless meet stringent conditions so as to comply with the principle of 
non-discrimination.<footnote name="2">. In the present report, it is recalled that States are bound to respect the human rights 
of all persons in their territory or under their jurisdiction, irrespective of their nationality or 
lack thereof. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, among others, declares that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration. Other international human rights 
instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (arts. 2, 
para. 1, and 26); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(art. 2, para. 2); the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (art. 1, para. 1); the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (art. 1); and the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(art. 2, para. 1), also provide that the human rights contained therein should be enjoyed by 
everyone without discrimination. This has been confirmed in relation to specific human 
rights by United Nations treaty bodies, including the Human Rights Committee in its 
general comments No. 15 (1986) on the position of aliens under the Covenant, No. 18 
(1989) on non-discrimination, No. 23 (1994) on the rights of minorities and No. 31 (2004) 
on the nature of the general legal obligation imposed on States parties to the Covenant; the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its general recommendation No. 
30 (2004) on discrimination against non-citizens; the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
in its general comment No. 6 (2005) on the treatment of unaccompanied and separated 
children outside their country of origin; the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights in its general comment No. 20 (2009) on non-discrimination in economic, social and 
cultural rights; and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 
its general recommendation No. 28 (2010) on the core obligations of States parties under 
article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. The Human Rights Committee, for instance, stated in its general comment No. 31 
that the enjoyment of the rights in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
is not limited to citizens of States parties but must also be available to all individuals, 
regardless of nationality or statelessness, who may find themselves in the territory or 
subject to the jurisdiction of the State party (para. 10).

and economic rights. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has stated 
that differential treatment based on citizenship or immigration status will constitute 
discrimination if the criteria for such differentiation are not applied pursuant to a legitimate 
aim, and are not proportional to the achievement of this aim.1

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>

<p>nationality is not explicitly listed among the prohibited grounds for discrimination, it is 
included within the reference to the &#8220;other status&#8221; included in article 2 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.3 Therefore, if States distinguish between citizens 
and non-citizens in the protection of civil and political rights, such law or practice may be 
subject to scrutiny and could be found to violate the principle of non-discrimination.4   
</p>
<p><b> II. Impact of arbitrary deprivation of nationality on the 
enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political rights 
</b></p>
<p>5. Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights provides for the 
right of every citizen to take part in the conduct of public affairs, the right to vote and to be 
elected and the right to have access to public service.<footnote name="5">3 General recommendation No. 30, para. 32. </footnote> Persons who have been arbitrarily 
deprived of their nationality may, as a result, be precluded from the enjoyment of these 
rights.  
</p>
<p>6. Current State practice reflects the continuing importance of nationality to the 
exercise of political rights. The predominant view is that the exercise of political rights is 
an entitlement of citizens only.<footnote name="6">9 Background document by the independent expert on minority issues, on minorities and effective 
political participation presented at the second session of the Forum on Minority Issues 
(A/HRC/FMI/2009/3), para. 37. 
</footnote> The independent expert on minority issues has stated that 
deprivation of citizenship generally results in the inability to participate politically 
(A/HRC/7/23, para. 45). Yet, recent developments show an increasing separation between 
the exercise of political rights and nationality. In a number of States, non-citizens who meet 
various conditions are now entitled to cast a vote or stand for office in certain elections, 
primarily in the context of local-level systems of government, rather than national level 
politics.  
</p>
<p>7. This development has been viewed favourably by United Nations treaty bodies, in 
particular the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Human 
Rights Committee.7 There is further support for this more flexible approach to political 
participation in the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families (art. 42, para. 3). The Human Rights Committee 
has expressed concern about how the perpetuation of a situation of exclusion from 
nationality continues to result in a concomitant lack of effective enjoyment of political

<p>rights, the impossibility of occupying certain State and public positions and the exclusion 
from membership of a political party.8 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>8. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides for 
the right of everyone lawfully within the territory of a State to liberty of movement and the 
freedom to choose a residence. The right to freedom of movement is of fundamental 
importance, as it deals with the question of physical access to a State&#8217;s territory and, by 
consequence, with the opportunity to exercise other human rights.9 Persons who have been 
arbitrarily deprived of their nationality may face severe limitations on their ability to travel 
and to choose a place of residence if, by depriving them of their nationality, the State has 
put them in a situation of irregularity concerning their country of residence. 
</p>
<p>9. The Human Rights Committee has stated that the question of whether a non-citizen 
is lawfully within the territory of a State is a matter governed by domestic law and that 
States may subject the entry of a non-citizen to the territory of a State to restrictions, 
provided they are in compliance with the State&#8217;s international obligations.10 However, the 
Committee also indicated that the right to enter one&#8217;s own country provided in article 12, 
paragraph 4, of the Covenant is not limited to an individual&#8217;s country of nationality in a 
formal sense, but that it also covers the country with which the person has special ties or 
claims. The Committee further stated that this would be the case of nationals of a country 
who have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality, and of individuals whose country of 
nationality has been incorporated in or transferred to another national entity, whose 
nationality is denied to them. This also includes other categories of long-term residents, 
including stateless persons who have been arbitrarily deprived of the right to acquire the 
nationality of their country of residence.11 
</p>
<p>10. The Human Rights Committee has also stated that, according to article 12, 
paragraph 3, of the Covenant, once a person is lawfully within a State, any restrictions on 
the right to freedom of movement, as well as any treatment different from that accorded to 
nationals, may not be imposed except if they are provided by law and are necessary to 
protect national security, public order, public health or morals, or the rights and freedoms of 
others. If none of these restrictions is invoked, non-citizens should have the right to move 
from one place to another and to establish themselves in a place of their choice. The 
enjoyment of this right must not be made dependent on any particular purpose or reason for 
the person wanting to move or to stay in a place.12 However, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
has reported on certain practices where stateless persons are subject to severe restrictions to 
their freedom of movement, which resulted in their inability to access medical and 
educational services. Moreover, stateless persons wishing to travel outside their respective 
villages were required to obtain official authorization and to pay a fee that in many cases 
they could not afford (A/HRC/4/19/Add.1, para. 126). 
</p>
<p>11. The right to freedom of movement also comprises the right to leave any country, as 
provided in article 12, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. The Human Rights Committee has 
</p>
<p>  
 8 See, for example, the Committee&#8217;s concluding observations on Estonia (CCPR/CO/77/EST), para. 17, 
</p>
<p>and Latvia (CCPR/CO/79/LVA), para. 18.

 12 Ibid., para. 5. </p>


<p>highlighted that freedom to leave the territory of a State may not be made dependent on any 
specific purpose or on the period of time the individual chooses to stay outside the 
country.13 The Committee has, therefore, expressed concern about certain practices that 
limit the right of non-citizens to leave their country of residence. For instance, the 
Committee has indicated that the requirement for non-citizens to obtain exit visas 
constitutes a violation of article 12 of the Covenant.14  
</p>
<p>12. Furthermore, the Human Rights Committee has stated that the right of the individual 
to leave a country also implies the right to determine the State of destination and that this 
right should not be restricted to persons lawfully within the territory of a State. The 
Committee has further stated that a non-citizen who is expelled must be allowed to leave 
for any country that agrees to take him.15 Article 13 of the Covenant further regulates the 
issue of expulsion and provides that non-citizens lawfully in the territory of a State may be 
expelled only in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with the law. According to 
the Human Rights Committee, this provision is applicable to all procedures aimed at the 
obligatory departure of a non-citizen lawfully in the territory of the State, whether 
described in national law as expulsion or otherwise. Therefore, national legislation 
concerning the requirements for entry and stay must be taken into account in determining 
the scope of that protection, and non-citizens who are not legally in the territory of the 
State, or have stayed longer than the law or their permits allow, are not covered by this 
provision.16  
</p>
<p>13. However, States may not expel a non-citizen to a State in which there is a risk of 
being subject to torture or ill-treatment. For instance, the Human Rights Committee has 
expressed concern about reports of extraditions and informal transfers of non-citizens to 
countries in which the practice of torture is alleged. The Committee stated that States 
should ensure that no individual, including persons suspected of terrorism, who is 
extradited, is exposed to the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and that States should exercise the utmost care in the use of diplomatic 
assurances.17 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to liberty 
</b></p>
<p>14. Persons who have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality may also face 
violations of the right to liberty provided for in article 9 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, according to which no one shall be subject to arbitrary arrest or 
detention, and that procedures to deprive a person of his liberty shall be established in the 
law.  
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has stated that detention is a direct 
response to the irregular status of the person within a State or to a lack of identity 
documentation that may itself also be a direct consequence of arbitrary deprivation of 
nationality. According to the Working Group, statistics indicate that in some countries, the 
number of non-citizens in administrative detention exceeds the number of sentenced

<p>prisoners or detainees who have or are suspected of having committed a crime (A/HRC/7/4, 
para. 45). Sometimes detention lasts only for a short period, while the person&#8217;s identity is 
verified. However, detention may also become prolonged, as the State seeks to process the 
individual&#8217;s deportation.  
</p>
<p>16. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has explicitly reminded 
States of the need to ensure the security of non-citizens, in particular with regard to 
arbitrary detention.18 The Human Rights Committee has also considered that practices 
involving the continued detention of a non-citizen when there is no real prospect of them 
being expelled constitute a violation of the right to liberty.19 For instance, the Committee 
has recalled that in order to avoid a characterization of arbitrariness, detention should not 
continue beyond the period for which the State party can provide appropriate justification. 
The Committee, therefore, considered arbitrary the continued detention for a period of four 
years of a person as an unlawful non-citizen because the State did not demonstrate that, in 
the light of the person&#8217;s particular circumstances, there were no less invasive means of 
achieving the same ends.20 The Committee has also expressed concern about the prolonged 
detention pursuant to immigration laws of non-citizens suspected of committing terrorist-
related offences, with fewer guarantees than in the context of criminal procedures.21 
Similarly, the Committee against Torture has indicated that States should take measures to 
ensure that detention of non-citizens is used only in exceptional circumstances or as a last 
resort, and only for the shortest possible time.22 The Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination has expressed its concern that non-citizens may be remanded in 
custody when they are not able to produce a valid identity document, or on suspicion of 
having produced a false identity. According to the Committee, in such circumstances, 
detention should only be imposed on the basis of objective grounds stipulated in law, such 
as the risk of flight, the risk that the person might destroy evidence or influence witnesses, 
or the risk of serious disturbance of public order.23 The independent expert on minority 
issues has also expressed concern that travel of non-citizens or stateless persons between 
different areas or to a particular region may sometimes be limited or confined to the 
boundaries of a particular village or dedicated settlement and that failure to comply with 
such measures may lead to arrest and imprisonment (A/HRC/4/19/Add.1, para. 126).

<p><b> D. Right to an effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p>17. Non-citizens also face obstacles in exercising their right to an effective remedy and 
to a fair trial provided in articles 2, paragraph 3(a), 9 and 14 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights.24 
</p>
<p>18. Numerous factors are of concern in relation to the enjoyment of the right of access to 
courts, the right to an effective remedy and the principle of fair trial. Non-citizens in 
general and persons who have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality in particular are 
often exposed to the threat of detention or expulsion and may, therefore, decide not assert 
their rights. As a result, they are often left without the effective means to challenge and 
obtain remedies for violations of their human rights. For instance, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination has expressed concern in relation to the small 
numbers of complaints of acts of racial discrimination lodged with courts and other relevant 
authorities in spite of persistent reports of de facto discrimination against non-citizens, 
including migrants and refugees.25 
</p>
<p>19. Persons who have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality may also face legal 
constraints in relation to their access to an effective remedy, in particular in relation to the 
right to challenge administrative or judicial decisions affecting them. For example, the 
Committee against Torture has expressed concerns with regard to the difficulties affecting 
documented and undocumented non-citizens detained under immigration laws and awaiting 
deportation, who are unable to contest the validity of their detention or claim asylum or 
refugee status without access to legal aid.26 Similarly, the Human Rights Committee has 
recommended that constitutional provisions relating to the right of the executive branch to 
expel any non-citizen whose stay is deemed inappropriate, with immediate effect and 
without the possibility of appeal, should be amended in order to comply with the right to an 
effective remedy.27 The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has also 
expressed concern about the impossibility to appeal, before a judicial body, presidential 
decrees declaring a non-citizen as a prohibited migrant.28 Another difficulty is that persons 
who have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality often lack documents to establish 
their identity, which leaves them in a situation where they may not effectively pursue any 
kind of legal claim. 
</p>
<p>20. Therefore, a range of procedural safeguards should be adopted to guarantee access to 
justice in decisions relating to the rights of non-nationals and stateless people, as well as in 
any decision on the deprivation of nationality itself. Where the initial decision has failed to 
take all factors into account, the ability to challenge this decision will present a chance to 
review the decision, taking into account the principles of proportionality and non-
discrimination. Without effective access to justice, persons who have been arbitrarily 
deprived of their nationality are hindered from seeking a remedy and redress for any 
subsequent human rights violations suffered. Moreover, in order to gain access to most 
regional or international individual complaints procedures against human rights violations, 
applicants are required to first exhaust all domestic remedies, thereby compelling them to

<p>

<p>regard to non-citizens (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/23/Add.3).

<p>first seek redress at the national level. Where they encounter obstacles in that respect, the 
pathway to an international remedy could present serious legal challenges. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to family life 
</b></p>
<p>21. Article 23 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes the 
obligation of States to protect the family. Furthermore, article 17 of the Covenant 
establishes a prohibition on arbitrary or unlawful interference with the family. Persons who 
have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality may experience difficulties in exercising 
their right to family life due to limitations to the right to enter or reside in the territory of a 
State.29  
</p>
<p>22. The Human Rights Committee has stated that while the Covenant does not recognize 
the right of non-citizens to enter or reside in the territory of a State, in certain circumstances 
a non-citizen&#8217;s right to entry or residence may be protected under the Covenant when 
considerations of non-discrimination, prohibition of inhuman treatment and respect for the 
right to family life arise.30 For instance, while the Committee has indicated that the mere 
fact that certain members of the family are entitled to remain on the territory of a State does 
not necessarily mean that requiring other members of the family to leave involves an 
unlawful interference to the right to family life, it has also stated that there may be cases in 
which a State&#8217;s refusal to allow one member of a family to remain in its territory would 
involve interference in that person&#8217;s family life.31 In that regard, the Committee has ruled 
that a deportation order issued against two stateless parents of a child violated rights 
relating to the protection of the family and of the child.32 The Committee also found that the 
deportation of a non-citizen violated his right to family life because, notwithstanding the 
fact that he had been convicted of a serious crime and was in the country in an irregular 
situation, all his family resided in that State and he had no family ties with his home 
country.33 The European Court of Human Rights has also ruled that the prolonged refusal to 
grant a permanent residence permit violated the right to private life.34

<p><b> F. Right to work 
</b></p>
<p>23. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the 
right of everyone to work, including the right to earn one&#8217;s living by work which the 
individual freely chooses or accepts. This right is not, in principle, subject to citizenship or 
statelessness.35 The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has held that

<p>while States may refuse to offer jobs to non-citizens without a work permit, all individuals 
are entitled to the enjoyment of labour and employment rights, including the freedom of 
assembly and association, once an employment relationship has been initiated until it is 
terminated.36 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has further 
determined that the labour market must be open to everyone under the jurisdiction of the 
State, which suggests that the lack of a work permit should not, in fact, form an obstacle to 
access to employment.37 However, given that States are generally free to regulate access by 
non-nationals to their territory and thereby jurisdiction, whether it is through the 
withholding of a work permit or residence permit or both, there is no guarantee that a 
person will be entitled to exercise the right to work in respect of a State in which he or she 
is a non-citizen. 
</p>
<p>24. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has recalled the 
obligation to ensure adequate working conditions for non-citizens. The Committee has 
recommended to States that they strengthen the protection of all non-citizen workers 
through adequate legislation and policies aimed at curbing abuses such as the withholding 
of passports by employers, extended non-payment of wages, arbitrary deductions of wages, 
and non-payment of overtime and working hours. It has also recommended the effective 
implementation of existing legislation and the strengthening of monitoring mechanisms, 
such as labour inspections, with regard to payment of wages, medical care, housing and 
other living and working conditions of non-citizen workers.38 
</p>
<p>25. The Committee has also expressed concern in relation to other discriminatory 
situations affecting non-citizens. For instance, the Committee has recommended that States 
intensify their efforts to protect non-citizens against exploitative work conditions and 
discrimination in job recruitment, for example, by providing effective remedies for victims 
and by training judges and labour inspectors on the application of labour standards.39 It has 
also expressed concern about restrictions that prohibit non-citizens from freely changing 
employment, and has recommended that States take measures to ensure that non-citizens 
are able to freely exercise their right to seek alternative employment except where the 
authorization of residence is expressly dependent upon the specific remunerated activity for 
which they were admitted.40 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of non-citizens has pointed out that non-
citizenship renders people vulnerable to poor working conditions, including difficult, 
dangerous jobs; verbal abuse; violence; racism; discriminatory attitudes; cramped living 
conditions; intimidating workplace environments; and low salaries, which are often 
withheld (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/23/Add.3, para. 11). He has indicated that the root of these 
problems is the restrictions commonly imposed by States on entry to the formal labour 
market for non-citizens (ibid.). Where a non-citizen lacks any form of personal 
identification, this is likely to also obstruct the opportunity to legally enter into even a basic 
employment contract.41 Specific restrictions imposed on non-citizens&#8217; exercise of certain

<p>professions or participation in certain employment sectors, as well as fixed quotas on 
foreign labour, also serve to curtail access to the formal labour market for non-citizens.42 
</p>
<p><b> G. Right to social security 
</b></p>
<p>27. Closely related to the right to work are the rights to social security and social 
insurance, as provided in article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and 
Cultural Rights. As stated by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
right to social security encompasses the right to access and maintain benefits, whether in 
cash or in kind, without discrimination in order to secure protection, inter alia, from lack of 
work-related income caused by sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, 
unemployment, old age, or death of a family member; unaffordable access to health care; 
and insufficient family support, particularly for children and adult dependents.43 
</p>
<p>28. The Committee has further recalled that article 2, paragraph 2, of the Covenant 
prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality. The Committee has noted that the 
Covenant contains no express jurisdictional limitation and, therefore, where non-citizens, 
including migrant workers, have contributed to a social security scheme, they should be 
able to benefit from that contribution or retrieve their contributions if they leave the 
country.44 Moreover, according to the Committee, non-citizens should be able to access 
non-contributory schemes for income support, affordable access to health care and family 
support. Refugees, stateless persons and asylum-seekers, and other disadvantaged and 
marginalized individuals and groups, should enjoy equal treatment in access to non-
contributory social security schemes, including reasonable access to health care and family 
support, consistent with international standards. Indeed, all persons, irrespective of their 
nationality, residency or immigration status, are entitled to primary and emergency medical 
care. Any restrictions, including a qualification period, must be proportionate and 
reasonable.45 
</p>
<p>29. However, it should be noted that social security is an area in which States have used 
bilateral agreements to define the treatment of non-citizens. Where arbitrary deprivation of 
nationality renders a person stateless, they will likely be unable to benefit from such 
bilateral arrangements.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>30. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
provides that everyone has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
stated that everyone, regardless of nationality, statelessness or legal status, should have 
access to existing health-care opportunities.46 Indeed, article 2, paragraph 2, the Covenant 
prohibits discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or

<p>other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status in access to health 
care and underlying determinants of health, as well as to means and entitlements for their 
procurement.  
</p>
<p>31. The Committee has stressed that even in times of severe resource constraints, the 
vulnerable members of society must be protected by the adoption of relatively low-cost 
targeted programmes. States have, therefore, a special obligation to provide those who do 
not have sufficient means with the necessary health insurance and health-care facilities, and 
to prevent any discrimination on internationally prohibited grounds in the provision of 
health care and health services, especially with respect to the core obligations of the right to 
health.<b> </b>Moreover, the Committee has recalled that inappropriate health resource allocation 
can lead to discrimination that may not be overt.47 As such, initiatives taken to include non-
citizens in national health insurance systems have been welcomed.48 
</p>
<p>32. In practice, however, the enjoyment of the right to health by non-citizens can be 
severely restricted, especially as compared to the services often available to citizens. The 
causes range from formal exclusion from some or all public health-care services to practical 
inability to access such services due to fees charged to non-nationals, absence of a regular 
immigration status or lack of any basic identity documentation.49 For instance, while 
acknowledging the efforts of a State regarding health care and the improvement of living 
conditions, the Committee expressed concern at the very high rate of HIV/AIDS among 
persons belonging to the most vulnerable groups, including non-citizens and persons 
without any identification documents, as well as at their access to health care. 50 
</p>
<p><b> I. Right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>33. The right to adequate housing is one component of the right to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of living and is recognized in article 11 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The right to adequate housing has been 
defined by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as the right to live 
somewhere in security, peace and dignity.<footnote name="5">8 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 13 (1999) on the right to

of the core obligation of the Covenant, are access to at least basic shelter and the 
prohibition of forced eviction.52 As with other economic, social and cultural rights, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has called upon States to guarantee 
the equal enjoyment of the right to adequate housing for citizens and non-citizens.53

<p>34. In practice, however, persons arbitrarily deprived of their nationality face numerous 
obstacles to enjoy their right to adequate housing. States sometimes impose restrictions on

</p>
<p>35. Non-citizens may face difficulties in exercising their right to adequate housing 
because they are unable to enter lease agreements or are excluded from government 
housing assistance as a result of lack of residence status or of basic identity documents.56 
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has also pointed out that States 
should take effective measures to ensure that housing agencies refrain from engaging in 
discriminatory practices.57 
</p>
<p><b> J. </b>Children&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>36. With regard to the impact of arbitrary deprivation of nationality on the enjoyment of 
rights by children, one of the most evident problems relates to the right to education. Both 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child recognize that neither non-citizenship nor statelessness should have a bearing 
on the enjoyment of the right to education.58 However, non-citizen and stateless children in 
law and practice experience difficulties in exercising their right to education.59 The Special 
Rapporteur on the right to education has pointed out that many countries formally guarantee 
this right to all citizens in their national constitutions.<footnote name="60">E/CN.4/2003/9/Add.1, para. 15; A/HRC/14/25/Add.3, para. 33; A/HRC/17/29 and Corr. 1, para. 40. </footnote> While this does not imply that non-
citizens cannot access education, the lack of a constitutional guarantee of equal access to 
education for everyone may present a problem when non-citizens seek to challenge 
education policies that exclude them. Thus, domestic law or policy may directly exclude

</footnote>1 
</p>
<p>37. The difficulties faced by non-citizen children in accessing education are indirectly, 
yet closely, linked to their non-citizenship. One significant issue, for instance, is that while 
non-citizens are technically eligible to access a State&#8217;s education system, they may not 
enjoy the same entitlement as nationals to subsidized schooling. Thus, a child or adult who 
has been arbitrarily deprived of nationality could find himself or herself confronting fees 
and other costs that would not otherwise have been levied against them.<footnote name="6">4 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to education (A/HRC/11/8/Add.2, para. 34); Committee 
on the Rights of the Child, concluding observations: Russian Federation (CRC/C/15/Add.110), para. 
53; Argentina (CRC/C/15/Add.187), paras. 29 and 56; Netherlands (including Aruba) 
(CRC/C/15/Add.227), para. 53.   
</footnote>2 Inability to meet 
these costs could result in exclusion from schooling. Even in States that provide equal 
access to subsidized education at the primary level, regardless of nationality, problems are 
reported in the context of secondary schooling, higher education or vocational training 
where higher fees may be levied against non-citizens.<footnote name="63">Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, concluding observations: Canada

</p>
<p>38. As with the enjoyment of other human rights, a lack of requisite documentation, in 
particular residence permits or even basic identity documents, affects non-citizens&#8217; right to 
education.64 
</p>
<p><b> K. </b>Women&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. Arbitrary deprivation of nationality has particularly negative effects on the human 
rights of women. Where national legislation contains discriminatory elements against 
women that result in non-citizenship or statelessness, women are put in a particularly 
precarious situation, among others because it heightens the risk that they may become 
exposed to violence or human trafficking. For instance, the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination has stated its concern over the trafficking of women and girls, in 
particular non-citizens, for the purpose of sexual exploitation.65 
</p>
<p>40. Stateless women may seek to marry in order to acquire a nationality or better legal 
status for themselves or their children and may subsequently find themselves trapped in an 
abusive relationship, because to leave would mean to forfeit this nationality or status. For 
instance, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has expressed concern 
over nationality-related cases of discrimination against women allowing the transfer of 
nationality only by fathers who have the nationality of that State.66

</p>

<p>41. Where non-citizenship or statelessness causes difficulties in accessing health-care 
services, this can also have a disproportionately severe impact on the well-being of women. 
For example, women may be unable to receive maternal or neonatal care or to benefit from 
a State&#8217;s HIV/AIDS or vaccination programmes. 
</p>
<p>42. The Human Rights Committee has indicated that while States have the obligation 
under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to ensure the equal right of 
men and women to the enjoyment of their Covenant rights, legislation or administrative 
measures adopted by States to regulate matters other than those dealt with in the Covenant 
could have a negative effect on the equal enjoyment of human rights by women. For 
example, the Committee has highlighted the degree to which immigration laws which 
distinguish between a male and a female citizen may adversely affect the scope of the right 
of the woman to marriage to non-citizens or to hold public office.67 
</p>
<p><b> L. Minority rights 
</b></p>
<p>43. Another area in which non-citizens experience difficulties and where the impact of 
arbitrary deprivation of nationality can be felt is in respect of the enjoyment of minority 
rights. Although non-citizenship or statelessness should not be a bar to the enjoyment of 
minority rights under international law,68 the independent expert on minority issues stated 
that in practice, some States explicitly reserve the enjoyment of minority rights to citizens. 
Persons arbitrarily deprived of their nationality face additional challenges to the realization 
of the right to the protection and promotion of their collective cultural identity, including 
with regard to the recognition and use of minority languages or the freedom to practice 
minority religions (A/HRC/7/23, para. 45).  
</p>
<p>44. In the context of the protection of the rights of minorities, article 2, paragraph 3, of 
the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities, persons belonging to minorities have the right to participate 
effectively in decisions at the national and, where appropriate, regional level concerning the 
minority to which they belong or the regions in which they live, in a manner not 
incompatible with national legislation. According to the independent expert on minority 
issues, denial of citizenship has been used by States to exclude minorities from the 
enjoyment of their rights. The independent expert, therefore, indicated that States should 
consider allowing non-citizens belonging to minorities to vote, stand as candidates in local 
elections and be members of the governing boards of self-governing bodies, while making 
sure that access to citizenship is regulated in a non-discriminatory manner.69 The Forum on 
Minority Issues also recommended that where citizenship is a requirement for the exercise 
of political rights, there should be a reasonable process for attaining such citizenship that is 
clearly defined, widely communicated and non-discriminatory with regard to race, ethnicity 
or religion.70

<p><b> III. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>International human rights law clearly establishes the international obligation 
of States to respect the human rights of all individuals without distinction of any kind, 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
</b></p>
<p><b>social origin, property, birth or other status. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>While according to international law States may restrict the enjoyment of some

<p>47. <b>Arbitrary deprivation of nationality leads the affected persons to become non-
citizens with respect to the State that deprived them of their nationality. Arbitrary
