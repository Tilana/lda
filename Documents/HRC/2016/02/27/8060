<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-first session 
</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 6 
</p>
<p><b>Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Statement made by the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees on the adoption of the report on the universal 
periodic review of Brazil 
</b></p>
<p>The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
</p>
<p>welcomes the adoption of the report on the universal periodic review of Brazil, and 
</p>
<p>congratulates the Government of Brazil on having accepted all relevant recommendations. 
</p>
<p>As a country that is fully committed to the protection of refugees, Brazil and its 
</p>
<p>people are to be commended for their solidarity towards persons of concern and their 
</p>
<p>support for UNHCR. This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption by Brazil of 
</p>
<p>the Refugee Act, which has been referred to as a model for asylum legislation in the region. 
</p>
<p>As a State party to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the 
</p>
<p>Protocol thereto of 1967, and sponsor of the Brasilia Declaration on the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Refugees and Stateless Persons in the Americas of 2010, Brazil continues to demonstrate its 
</p>
<p>commitment and remains a pioneer in refugee protection. As an example, a generous 
</p>
<p>interpretation of Brazilian refugee legislation has allowed the national commission for 
</p>
<p>refugees, CONARE, to recognize as refugees persons fleeing persecution because of their 
</p>
<p>sexual orientation and gender identity, thus reinforcing the protection of lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual, transgender and intersex persons who are victims of forced displacement. 
</p>
<p>UNHCR continues to welcome the efforts made by Brazil to provide a durable 
</p>
<p>solution to refugees and others of concern to UNHCR. The solidarity resettlement 
</p>
<p>programme has granted protection to and found solutions for many refugees over past years 
</p>
<p>and includes a fast-track modality, which enables the emergency resettlement of refugees 
</p>
<p>with urgent protection needs. The local integration of refugees is also a priority for the 
</p>
<p>Government, as demonstrated by the granting of permanent residency to refugees from 
</p>
<p>Angola and Liberia and the establishment of State committees in charge of the coordination 
</p>
<p>of policies and interventions for the local integration of refugees. 
</p>
<p>UNHCR also applauds the Government of Brazil for its commitment to the 
</p>
<p>protection of stateless persons. Brazil is a party to both the Convention relating to the Status 
</p>
<p>of Stateless Persons of 1954 and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness of 1961. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the latter Convention, it is worth mentioning constitutional amendment 
</p>
<p>54/07, which allows for acquisition of nationality by children born abroad through a simple 
</p>
<p>consular registration and represents an important example of the prevention of 
</p>

<p>statelessness, which has benefited approximately 200,000 children born to Brazilian 
</p>
<p>nationals outside the country. 
</p>
<p>As a final note, UNHCR highlights the reaffirmation made by Brazil of the pledges 
</p>
<p>made at the ministerial meeting on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of UNHCR in 
</p>
<p>2011, and stands ready to continue to assist the Government in their implementation, 
</p>
<p>including the establishment of a stateless status determination procedure.
