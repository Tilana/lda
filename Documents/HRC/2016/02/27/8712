<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present document is a compilation of good practices on legal and institutional 
frameworks and measures that ensure respect for human rights by intelligence agencies 
while countering terrorism, including on their oversight, as requested by the Human Rights 
Council and prepared by the Special Rapporteur on the protection and promotion of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism. The compilation is the 
outcome of a consultation process where Governments, experts and practitioners in various 
ways provided their input. In particular, written submissions received from Governments 
by a deadline of 1 May 2010 have been taken into account. The submissions will be 
reproduced in the form of an addendum (A/HRC/14/46/Add.1). 
 The outcome of the process is the identification of 35 elements of good practice. 
The elements of good practice were distilled from existing and emerging practices in a 
broad range of States throughout the world. The compilation also draws upon international 
treaties, resolutions of international organizations and the jurisprudence of regional courts. 
 The substance of the elements of good practice is explained in the commentary, 
usually presented separately for each of the 35 elements. The sources of good practice are

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present compilation of good practice on legal and institutional frameworks for 
intelligence services and their oversight is the outcome of a consultation process mandated 
by the Human Rights Council, which, in its resolution 10/15, called upon the Special 
Rapporteur to prepare, working in consultation with States and other relevant stakeholders, 
a compilation of good practices on legal and institutional frameworks and measures that 
ensure respect for human rights by intelligence agencies while countering terrorism, 
including on their oversight. 
</p>
<p>2. Intelligence services1 play a critical role in protecting the State and its population 
against threats to national security, including terrorism. They help to enable States to fulfil 
their positive obligation to safeguard the human rights of all individuals under their 
jurisdiction. Hence, effective performance and the protection of human rights can be 
mutually complementary goals for intelligence services. 
</p>
<p>3. The compilation is distilled from existing and emerging practice from a broad range 
of States throughout the world. These practices are primarily derived from national laws, 
institutional models, as well as the jurisprudence and recommendations of national 
oversight institutions and a number of civil society organizations. The compilation also 
draws upon international treaties, resolutions of international organizations and the 
jurisprudence of regional courts. In this context, the notion of &#8220;good practice&#8221; refers to 
legal and institutional frameworks which serve to promote human rights and the respect for 
the rule of law in the work of intelligence services. &#8220;Good practice&#8221; not only refers to what 
is required by international law, including human rights law, but goes beyond these legally 
binding obligations.   
</p>
<p>4. Very few States have included all of the practices outlined below in their legal and 
institutional frameworks for intelligence services and their oversight. Some States will be 
able to identify themselves as following the majority of the 35 elements of good practice. 
Other States may start by committing themselves to a small number of these elements 
which they consider as essential to promoting human rights compliance by intelligence 
services and their oversight bodies.  
</p>
<p>5. It is not the purpose of this compilation to promulgate a set of normative standards 
that should apply at all times and in all parts of the world. Hence, the elements of good 
practice presented in this report are formulated in descriptive, rather than normative, 
language. It is nevertheless possible to identify common practices that contribute to the 
respect for the rule of law and human rights by intelligence services.  
</p>
<p>6. The Human Rights Council mandated the present compilation of good practices 
within the context of the role of intelligence services in counter-terrorism. However, it 
should be noted that the legal and institutional frameworks which apply to intelligence 
services&#8217; counter-terrorism activities cannot be separated from those which apply to their 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * The Special Rapporteur would like to acknowledge the contribution of Hans Born and Aidan Wills of 
the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces for conducting a background study 
and assisting in the preparation of this compilation. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is grateful to 
Governments, as well as members of intelligence oversight institutions, (former) intelligence officials, 
intelligence and human rights experts as well as members of civil society organizations for their 
participation in the consultation process which led to this compilation. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 For the purposes of the present study, the term &#8216;intelligence services&#8217; refers to all state institutions 
</p>
<p>that undertake intelligence activities pertaining to national security. Within this context, this 
compilation of good practice applies to all internal, external, and military intelligence services.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>activities more generally. While international terrorism has, since 2001, changed the 
landscape for the operation of intelligence agencies, the effects of that change go beyond 
the field of counter-terrorism.  
</p>
<p>7. The compilation highlights examples of good practice from numerous national laws 
and institutional models. It is, however, important to note that the citation of specific 
provisions from national laws or institutional models does not imply a general endorsement 
of these laws and institutions as good practice in protecting human rights in the context of 
counter-terrorism. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that the 
existence of legal and institutional frameworks which represent good practice is essential, 
but not sufficient for ensuring that intelligence services respect human rights in their 
counter-terrorism activities. 
</p>
<p>8. The 35 areas of good practice presented below are grouped into four different 
&#8220;baskets&#8221;, namely legal basis (1&#8211;5), oversight and accountability (6&#8211;10 and 14&#8211;18), 
substantive human rights compliance (11&#8211;13 and 19&#8211;20) and issues relating to specific 
functions of intelligence agencies (21&#8211;35). For reasons of presentation, the elements are 
grouped under a somewhat higher number of subheadings.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Compilation of good practices on legal and institutional 
frameworks for intelligence services and their oversight 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate and legal basis 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 1</b>. Intelligence services play an important role in protecting national 
security and upholding the rule of law. Their main purpose is to collect, analyse and 
disseminate information that assists policymakers and other public entities in taking 
measures to protect national security. This includes the protection of the population 
and their human rights.  
</p>
<p>9. The functions of intelligence services differ from one country to another; however, 
the collection, analysis and dissemination of information relevant to the protection of 
national security is the core task performed by most intelligence services:2 indeed, many 
States limit the role of their intelligence services to this task. This represents good practice, 
because it prevents intelligence services from undertaking additional security-related 
activities already performed by other public bodies and which may represent particular 
threats to human rights if performed by intelligence services. In addition to defining the 
types of activities their intelligence services may perform, many States also limit the 
rationale for these activities to the protection of national security. While the understanding 
of national security varies among States, it is good practice for national security and its 
constituent values to be clearly defined in legislation adopted by parliament.3 This is 
important for ensuring that intelligence services confine their activities to helping to 
safeguard values that are enshrined in a public definition of national security. In many 
areas, safeguarding national security necessarily includes the protection of the population

</p>
<p>and its human rights;4 indeed, a number of States explicitly include the protection of human 
rights as one of the core functions of their intelligence services.5  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 2</b>. The mandates of intelligence services are narrowly and precisely defined 
in a publicly available law. Mandates are strictly limited to protecting legitimate 
national security interests as outlined in publicly available legislation or national 
security policies, and identify the threats to national security that intelligence 
services are tasked to address. If terrorism is included among these threats, it is 
defined in narrow and precise terms.   
</p>
<p>10. The mandates of intelligence services are one of the primary instruments for 
ensuring that their activities (including in the context of counter-terrorism) serve the 
interests of the country and its population, and do not present a threat to the constitutional 
order and/or human rights. In the majority of States, intelligence services&#8217; mandates are 
clearly delineated in a publicly available law, promulgated by parliament.6 It is good 
practice for mandates to be narrowly and precisely formulated, and to enumerate all of the 
threats to national security that intelligence services are responsible for addressing.7 Clear 
and precise mandates facilitate accountability processes, enabling oversight and review 
bodies to hold intelligence services to account for their performance of specific functions. 
Finally, a clear definition of threats is particularly relevant in the context of counter-
terrorism; many States have adopted legislation that provides precise definitions of 
terrorism, as well as of terrorist groups and activities.8 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 3</b>. The powers and competences of intelligence services are clearly and 
exhaustively defined in national law. They are required to use these powers 
exclusively for the purposes for which they were given. In particular, any powers 
given to intelligence services for the purposes of counter-terrorism must be used 
exclusively for these purposes. 
</p>
<p>11. It is a fundamental tenet of the rule of law that all powers and competences of 
intelligence services are outlined in law.9 An exhaustive enumeration of the powers and 
competences of intelligence services promotes transparency and enables people to foresee

<p>what powers may be used against them. This is particularly important given that many of 
the powers held by intelligence services have the potential to infringe upon human rights 
and fundamental freedoms.10 This practice is closely connected to practice 2, because the 
mandates of intelligence services serve to define the framework within which they can use 
the powers given by the legislature.11 A prohibition of <i>d&#233;tournement de pouvoir</i> is implicit 
in the legislation of many States as intelligence services are only permitted to use their 
powers for very specific purposes. This is particularly in the context of counter-terrorism, 
because many intelligence services have been endowed with greater powers for these 
purposes. 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 4</b>. All intelligence services are constituted through, and operate under, 
publicly available laws that comply with the Constitution and international human 
rights law. Intelligence services can only undertake or be instructed to undertake 
activities that are prescribed by and in accordance with national law. The use of 
subsidiary regulations that are not publicly available is strictly limited, and such 
regulations are both authorized by and remain within the parameters of publicly 
available laws. Regulations that are not made public do not serve as the basis for any 
activities that restrict human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 5</b>. Intelligence services are explicitly prohibited from undertaking any 
action that contravenes the Constitution or international human rights law. These 
prohibitions extend not only to the conduct of intelligence services on their national 
territory but also to their activities abroad.  
</p>
<p>12. Intelligence services are organs of the State and thus, in common with other 
executive bodies, are bound by relevant provisions of national and international law, and in 
particular human rights law.12 This implies that they are based upon and operate in 
accordance with publicly available laws that comply with the Constitution of the State, as 
well as, inter alia, the State&#8217;s international human rights obligations. States cannot rely 
upon domestic law to justify violations of international human rights law or indeed any 
other international legal obligations.13 The rule of law requires that the activities of 
intelligence services and any instructions issued to them by the political executive comply 
with these bodies of law in all of their work.14 Accordingly, intelligence services are 
prohibited from undertaking, or being asked to undertake, any action that would violate 
national statutory law, the Constitution or the State&#8217;s human rights obligations. In many 
States, these requirements are implicit; however, it is notably good practice for national 
legislation to make explicit reference to these broader legal obligations and, in particular, to 
the obligation to respect human rights.15 Subordinate regulations pertaining to the internal

<p>processes and activities of intelligence services are sometimes withheld from the public in 
order to protect their working methods. These types of regulations do not serve as the basis 
for activities that infringe human rights. It is good practice for any subordinate regulation to 
be based on and comply with applicable public legislation.16 
</p>
<p><b> B. Oversight institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 6</b>. Intelligence services are overseen by a combination of internal, 
executive, parliamentary, judicial and specialized oversight institutions whose 
mandates and powers are based on publicly available law. An effective system of 
intelligence oversight includes at least one civilian institution that is independent of 
both the intelligence services and the executive. The combined remit of oversight 
institutions covers all aspects of the work of intelligence services, including their 
compliance with the law; the effectiveness and efficiency of their activities; their 
finances; and their administrative practices. 
</p>
<p>13. In common with intelligence services, the institutions that oversee their activities are 
based on law and, in some cases, founded on the Constitution.17 There is no single model 
for the oversight intelligence services; however, the following components are commonly 
included in comprehensive systems of oversight:18 internal management and control 
mechanisms within intelligence services;19 executive oversight;20 oversight by 
parliamentary bodies;21 as well as specialized and/or judicial oversight bodies.22 It is good

<p>practice for this multilevel system of oversight to include at least one institution that is fully 
independent of both the intelligence services and the political executive. This approach 
ensures that there is a separation of powers in the oversight of intelligence services; the 
institutions that commission, undertake and receive the outputs of intelligence activities are 
not the only institutions that oversee these activities. All dimensions of the work of 
intelligence services are subject to the oversight of one or a combination of external 
institutions. One of the primary functions of a system of oversight is to scrutinize 
intelligence services&#8217; compliance with applicable law, including human rights. Oversight 
institutions are mandated to hold intelligence services and their employees to account for 
any violations of the law.23 In addition, oversight institutions assess the performance of 
intelligence services.24 This includes examining whether intelligence services make 
efficient and effective use of the public funds allocated to them.25 An effective system of 
oversight is particularly important in the field of intelligence because these services conduct 
much of their work in secret and hence cannot be easily overseen by the public. Intelligence 
oversight institutions serve to foster public trust and confidence in the work of intelligence 
services by ensuring that they perform their statutory functions in accordance with respect 
for the rule of law and human rights.26 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 7</b>. Oversight institutions have the power, resources and expertise to initiate 
and conduct their own investigations, as well as full and unhindered access to the 
information, officials and installations necessary to fulfil their mandates. Oversight 
institutions receive the full cooperation of intelligence services and law enforcement 
authorities in hearing witnesses, as well as obtaining documentation and other 
evidence. 
</p>
<p>14. Oversight institutions enjoy specific powers to enable them to perform their 
functions. In particular, they have the power to initiate their own investigations into areas of 
the intelligence service&#8217;s work that fall under their mandates, and are granted access to all 
information necessary to do so. These powers of access to information encompass the legal 
authority to view all relevant files and documents,27 inspect the premises of intelligence 
services,28 and to summon any member of the intelligence services to give evidence under 
oath.29 These powers help to ensure that overseers can effectively scrutinize the activities of 
intelligence services and fully investigate possible contraventions of the law. A number of 
States have taken steps to reinforce the investigative competences of oversight institutions

<p>by criminalizing any failure to cooperate with them.30 This implies that oversight 
institutions have recourse to law enforcement authorities in order to secure the cooperation 
of relevant individuals.31 While strong legal powers are essential for effective oversight, it 
is good practice for these to be accompanied by the human and financial resources needed 
to make use of these powers, and, thus, to fulfil their mandates. Accordingly, many 
oversight institutions have their own independent budget provided directly by parliament,32 
the capacity to employ specialized staff,33 and to engage the services of external experts.34 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 8</b>. Oversight institutions take all necessary measures to protect classified 
information and personal data to which they have access during the course of their 
work. Penalties are provided for the breach of these requirements by members of 
oversight institutions. 
</p>
<p>15. Intelligence oversight institutions have access to classified and sensitive information 
during the course of their work. Therefore, a variety of mechanisms are put in place to 
ensure that oversight institutions and their members do not disclose such information either 
inadvertently or deliberately. Firstly, in almost all cases, members and staffers of oversight 
institutions are prohibited from making unauthorized disclosure of information; failure to 
comply with these proscriptions is generally sanctioned through civil and/or criminal 
penalties.35 Secondly, many oversight institutions also subject members and staff to security 
clearance procedures before giving them access to classified information.36 An alternative 
to this approach, most commonly seen in parliamentary oversight institutions, is for 
members to be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.37 Ultimately, the appropriate 
handling of classified information by oversight institutions also relies upon the professional 
behaviour of the members of the oversight institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Complaints and effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 9</b>. Any individual who believes that her or his rights have been infringed by 
an intelligence service is able to bring a complaint to a court or oversight institution, 
such as an ombudsman, human rights commissioner or national human rights 
institution. Individuals affected by the illegal actions of an intelligence service have 
recourse to an institution that can provide an effective remedy, including full 
reparation for the harm suffered.

<p>16. It is widely acknowledged that any measure restricting human rights must be 
accompanied by adequate safeguards, including independent institutions, through which 
individuals can seek redress in the event that their rights are violated.38 Intelligence services 
possess a range of powers &#8211; including powers of surveillance, arrest and detention, which, 
if misused, may violate human rights. Accordingly, institutions exist to handle complaints 
raised by individuals who believe their rights have been violated by intelligence services 
and, where necessary, to provide victims of human rights violations with an effective 
remedy. Two broad approaches can be distinguished in this regard.39 First, States have 
established a range of non-judicial institutions to handle complaints pertaining to 
intelligence services. These include the ombudsman,40 the national human rights 
commission,41 the national audit office,42 the parliamentary oversight body,43 the inspector 
general,44 the specialized intelligence oversight body45 and the complaints commission for 
intelligence services.46 These institutions are empowered to receive and investigate 
complaints; however, since they cannot generally issue binding orders or provide remedies, 
victims of human rights violations have to seek remedies through the courts. Second, 
judicial institutions may receive complaints pertaining to intelligence services. These 
institutions may be judicial bodies set up exclusively for this purpose,47 or part of the 
general judicial system; they are usually empowered to order remedial action. 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 10</b>. The institutions responsible for addressing complaints and claims for 
effective remedy arising from the activities of intelligence services are independent 
of the intelligence services and the political executive. Such institutions have full 
and unhindered access to all relevant information, the necessary resources and 
expertise to conduct investigations, and the capacity to issue binding orders.  
</p>
<p>17. In order for an institution to provide effective remedies for human rights violations, 
it must be independent of the institutions involved in the impugned activities, able to ensure 
procedural fairness, have sufficient investigative capacity and expertise, and the capacity to 
issue binding decisions.48 For this reason, States have endowed such institutions with the 
requisite legal powers to investigate complaints and provide remedies to victims of human 
rights violations perpetrated by intelligence services. These powers include full and

<p>unhindered access to all relevant information, investigative powers to summon witnesses 
and to receive testimony under oath,49 the power to determine their own procedures in 
relation to any proceedings, and the capacity to issue binding orders.50  
</p>
<p><b> D. Impartiality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 11</b>. Intelligence services carry out their work in a manner that contributes 
to the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all 
individuals under the jurisdiction of the State. Intelligence services do not 
discriminate against individuals or groups on the grounds of their sex, race, colour, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, or other 
status.  
</p>
<p>18. Intelligence services are an integral part of the State apparatus that contributes to 
safeguarding the human rights of all individuals under the jurisdiction of the State. They are 
bound by the well-established principle of international human rights law of non-
discrimination. This principle requires States to respect the rights and freedoms of 
individuals without discrimination on any prohibited ground.51 Many States have enshrined 
the principle in national law, requiring their intelligence services to fulfil their mandates in 
a manner that serves the interests of the State and society as a whole. Intelligence services 
are explicitly prohibited from acting or being used to further the interests of any ethnic, 
religious, political or other group.52 In addition, States ensure that the activities of their 
intelligence services (in particular in the context of counter-terrorism) are undertaken on the 
basis of individuals&#8217; behaviour, and not on the basis of their ethnicity, religion or other such 
criteria.53 Some States have also explicitly proscribed their intelligence services from 
establishing files on individuals on this basis.54 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 12</b>. National law prohibits intelligence services from engaging in any 
political activities or from acting to promote or protect the interests of any particular 
political, religious, linguistic, ethnic, social or economic group.  
</p>
<p>19. Intelligence services are endowed with powers that have the potential to promote or 
damage the interest of particular political groups. In order to ensure that intelligence 
services remain politically neutral, national laws prohibit intelligence services from acting 
in the interest of any political group.55 This obligation is not only incumbent upon the 
intelligence services but also upon the political executives whom they serve. A number of 
States have also passed measures to prohibit or limit intelligence services&#8217; involvement in 
party politics. Examples of these measures include prohibitions on employees of 
intelligence services being members of political parties; accepting instructions or 
money from a political party;56 or from acting to further the interests of any political

<p>party.57 In addition, various States have taken measures to safeguard the neutrality of the 
directors of intelligence services. For example, the appointment of the director of 
intelligence services is open to scrutiny from outside the executive;58 there are legal 
provisions on the duration of tenure and specification of the grounds for the dismissal of 
directors, as well as safeguards against improper pressure being applied on directors of 
intelligence services.59 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 13</b>. Intelligence services are prohibited from using their powers to target 
lawful political activity or other lawful manifestations of the rights to freedom of 
association, peaceful assembly and expression. 
</p>
<p>20. Intelligence services have recourse to information-collection measures that may 
interfere with legitimate political activities and other manifestations of the freedoms of 
expression, association and assembly.60 These rights are fundamental to the functioning of a 
free society, including political parties, the media and civil society. Therefore, States have 
taken measures to reduce the scope for their intelligence services to target (or to be asked to 
target) these individuals and groups engaged in these activities. Such measures include 
absolute prohibitions on targeting lawful activities, and strict limitations on both the use of 
intelligence collection measures (see practice 21) and the retention and use of personal data 
collected by intelligence services (see practice 23).61 In view of the fact that the media plays 
a crucial role in any society, some States have instituted specific measures to protect 
journalists from being targeted by intelligence services.62 
</p>
<p><b> E. State responsibility for intelligence services 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 14</b>. States are internationally responsible for the activities of their 
intelligence services and agents, and any private contractors they engage, regardless 
of where these activities take place and who the victim of internationally wrongful 
conduct is. Therefore, the executive power takes measures to ensure and exercise 
overall control of and responsibility for their intelligence services.  
</p>
<p>21. States are responsible under international law for the activities of their intelligence 
services and agents wherever they operate in the world. This responsibility extends to any 
private contractors that States engage to undertake intelligence functions.63 States have a 
legal obligation to ensure that their intelligence services do not violate human rights and to

<p>provide remedies to the individuals concerned if such violations occur.64 Accordingly, they 
take steps to regulate and manage their intelligence services in a manner that promotes 
respect for the rule of law and in particular, compliance with international human rights 
law.65 Executive control of intelligence services is essential for these purposes and is 
therefore enshrined in many national laws.66  
</p>
<p><b> F. Individual responsibility and accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 15</b>. Constitutional, statutory and international criminal law applies to 
members of intelligence services as much as it does to any other public official. Any 
exceptions allowing intelligence officials to take actions that would normally violate 
national law are strictly limited and clearly prescribed by law. These exceptions 
never allow the violation of peremptory norms of international law or of the human 
rights obligations of the State. 
</p>
<p>22. While great emphasis is placed on the institutional responsibilities of intelligence 
services, individual members of intelligence services are also responsible and held to 
account for their actions.67 As a general rule, constitutional, statutory and international 
criminal law applies to intelligence officers as much as it does to any other individual.68 
Many States have made it a cause for civil liability or a criminal offence for any member of 
an intelligence service to knowingly violate and/or order or request an action that would 
violate constitutional or statutory law.69 This practice promotes respect for the rule of law 
within intelligence services, and helps to prevent impunity. Many States give members of 
their intelligence services the authority to engage in activities which, if undertaken by 
ordinary citizens, would constitute criminal offences.70 It is good practice that any such 
authorizations be strictly limited, prescribed by law and subject to appropriate safeguards.71 
Statutory provisions that authorize intelligence officers to undertake acts that would 
normally be illegal under national law do not extend to any actions that would violate the 
Constitution or non-derogable international human rights standards. 72

<p>orders an action that would violate national law or international human rights law. 
These laws also establish procedures to hold individuals to account for such 
violations. 
</p>
<p>23. States ensure that employees of intelligence services are held to account for any 
violations of the law by providing and enforcing sanctions for particular offences. This 
serves to promote respect for the rule of law and human rights within intelligence services. 
Many national laws regulating intelligence services include specific sanctions for 
employees who violate these laws or other applicable provisions of national and 
international law.73 Given that many of the activities of intelligence services take place in 
secret, criminal offences (perpetrated by employees) may not be detected by the relevant 
prosecutorial authorities. Therefore, it is good practice for national law to require the 
management of intelligence services to refer cases of possible criminal wrongdoing to 
prosecutorial authorities.74 In cases of serious human rights violations, such as torture, 
States are under an international legal obligation to prosecute members of the intelligence 
services.75 The criminal responsibility of employees of intelligence services may be 
engaged not only through their direct participation in the given activities, but also if they 
order or are otherwise complicit in such activities..76  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 17</b>. Members of intelligence services are legally obliged to refuse superior 
orders that would violate national law or international human rights law. 
Appropriate protection is provided to members of intelligence services who refuse 
orders in such situations.  
</p>
<p>24. It is good practice for national laws to require members of intelligence services to 
refuse orders that they believe would violate national law or international human rights 
law.77 While this provision is more common in laws regulating armed forces, several States 
have included it in statutes regulating their intelligence services.78 A requirement for 
members of intelligence services to refuse illegal orders is an important safeguard against 
possible human rights abuses, as well as against incumbent Governments ordering 
intelligence services to take action to further or protect their own interests. It is a well-
established principle of international law that individuals are not absolved of criminal 
responsibility for serious human rights violations by virtue of having been requested to 
undertake an action by a superior.79 Hence, to avoid individual criminal liability, members 
of intelligence services are required to refuse to carry out any orders that they should 
understand to be manifestly unlawful. This underlines the importance of human rights 
training for intelligence officers because they need to be aware of their rights and duties 
under international law (see practice 19). In order to promote an environment in which 
human rights abuses are not tolerated, States provide legal protections against reprisals for 
members of intelligence services who refuse to carry out illegal orders.80 The obligation to

<p>refuse illegal orders is closely linked to the availability of internal and external mechanisms 
through which intelligence service employees can voice their concerns about illegal orders 
(see practice 18 below).  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 18</b>. There are internal procedures in place for members of intelligence 
services to report wrongdoing. These are complemented by an independent body 
that has a mandate and access to the necessary information to fully investigate and 
take action to address wrongdoing when internal procedures have proved 
inadequate. Members of intelligence services who, acting in good faith, report 
wrongdoing are legally protected from any form of reprisal. These protections 
extend to disclosures made to the media or the public at large if they are made as a 
last resort and pertain to matters of significant public concern.  
</p>
<p>25. Employees of intelligence services are often first, and best, placed to identify 
wrongdoing within intelligence services, such as human rights violations, financial 
malpractice and other contraventions of statutory law. Accordingly, it is good practice for 
national law to outline specific procedures for members of intelligence services to disclose 
concerns about wrongdoing.81 These provisions aim to encourage members of intelligence 
services to report wrongdoing, while at the same time ensuring that disclosures of 
potentially sensitive information are made and investigated in a controlled manner. State 
practice demonstrates that there are several channels for such disclosures, including internal 
mechanisms to receive and investigate disclosures made by members of intelligence 
services,82 external institutions to receive and investigate disclosures, and members of 
intelligence services making disclosures directly to these institutions.83 In some systems, 
members of intelligence services may only approach the external institution if the internal 
body has failed to address adequately their concerns.84 In some States, members of 
intelligence services are permitted to make public disclosures as a last resort or when such 
disclosures concern particularly grave matters, such as a threat to life.85 Regardless of the 
precise nature of the channels for disclosure, it is good practice for national law to afford 
individuals who make disclosures authorized by law to protection against reprisals.86

<p><b> G. Professionalism 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 19</b>. Intelligence services and their oversight institutions take steps to foster 
an institutional culture of professionalism based on respect for the rule of law and 
human rights. In particular, intelligence services are responsible for training their 
members on relevant provisions of national and international law, including 
international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>26. The institutional culture of an intelligence service refers to widely shared or 
dominant values, attitudes and practices of employees. It is one of the main factors defining 
the attitude of intelligence officials towards the rule of law and human rights.87 Indeed, 
legal and institutional frameworks alone cannot ensure that members of intelligence 
services comply with human rights and the rule of law. A number of States and their 
intelligence services have formulated codes of ethics or principles of professionalism in 
order to promote an institutional culture that values and fosters respect for human rights and 
the rule of law.88 Codes of conduct typically include provisions on appropriate behaviour, 
discipline and ethical standards that apply to all members of intelligence services.89 In some 
States, the minister responsible for intelligence services promulgates such documents; this 
ensures political accountability for their content.90 It is good practice for codes of conduct 
(and similar documents) to be subject to the scrutiny of internal and external oversight 
institutions.91 Training is a second key instrument for the promotion of a professional 
institutional culture within intelligence services. Many intelligence services have initiated 
training programmes that emphasize professionalism and educate employees on relevant 
constitutional standards, statutory law and international human rights law.92 It is good 
practice for these training programmes to be both required and regulated by law, and to 
include all (prospective) members of intelligence services.93 Finally, a professional culture 
can be reinforced by internal personnel management policies that reward ethical and 
professional conduct. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Human rights safeguards 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 20</b>. Any measures by intelligence services that restrict human rights and 
fundamental freedoms comply with the following criteria: 
</p>
<p> (a) They are prescribed by publicly available law that complies with 
international human rights standards; 
</p>
<p> (b) All such measures must be strictly necessary for an intelligence 
service to fulfil its legally prescribed mandate;

<p> (c) Measures taken must be proportionate to the objective. This requires 
that intelligence services select the measure that least restricts human rights, and 
take special care to minimize the adverse impact of any measures on the rights of 
individuals, including, in particular, persons who are not suspected of any 
wrongdoing; 
</p>
<p> (d) No measure taken by intelligence services may violate peremptory 
norms of international law or the essence of any human right; 
</p>
<p> (e) There is a clear and comprehensive system for the authorization, 
monitoring and oversight of the use of any measure that restricts human rights; 
</p>
<p> (f) Individuals whose rights may have been restricted by intelligence 
services are able to address complaints to an independent institution and seek an 
effective remedy<b>. 
</b></p>
<p>27. Under national law, most intelligence services are permitted to undertake activities 
that restrict human rights. These powers are primarily found in the area of intelligence 
collection but also include law enforcement measures, the use of personal data and the 
sharing of personal information. National laws contain human rights safeguards for two 
main reasons: to limit interference with the rights of individuals to what is permissible 
under international human rights law; and to prevent the arbitrary or unfettered use of these 
measures.94  
</p>
<p>28. Any measure restricting human rights must be prescribed by a law that is compatible 
with international human rights standards and in force at the time the measure is taken.95 
Such a law outlines these measures in narrow and precise terms, sets out strict conditions 
for their use and establishes that their use must be directly linked to the mandate of an 
intelligence service.96 
</p>
<p>29. Many national laws also include the requirement that any intelligence measures 
restricting human rights must be necessary in a democratic society.97 Necessity entails that 
the use of any measures is clearly and rationally linked to the protection of legitimate 
national security interests as defined in national law.98  
</p>
<p>30. The principle of proportionality is enshrined in laws of many States and requires that 
any measures that restrict human rights must be proportionate to the specified (and legally 
permissible) aims.99 In order to ensure that measures taken by intelligence services are 
proportionate, many States require their intelligence services to use the least intrusive 
means possible for the achievement of a given objective.100

<p>international law. Some States have included explicit prohibitions on serious human rights 
violations in their laws on intelligence services.101 While non-derogable human rights may 
be singled out as inviolable, every human right includes an essential core that is beyond the 
reach of permissible limitations. 
</p>
<p>32. States ensure that intelligence measures that restrict human rights are subject to a 
legally prescribed process of authorization, as well as ex post oversight and review (see 
practices 6, 7, 21, 22, 28 and 32). 
</p><p>33. It is a fundamental requirement of international human rights law that victims of 
human rights violations be able to seek redress and remedy. Many States have procedures 
in place to ensure that individuals have access to an independent institution that can 
adjudicate on such claims (see practices 9 and 10 above).102 
</p>
<p><b> I. Intelligence collection 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 21</b>. National law outlines the types of collection measures available to 
intelligence services; the permissible objectives of intelligence collection; the 
categories of persons and activities which may be subject to intelligence collection; 
the threshold of suspicion required to justify the use of collection measures; the 
limitations on the duration for which collection measures may be used; and the 
procedures for authorizing, overseeing and reviewing the use of intelligence-
collection measures. 
</p>
<p>34. In most States, intelligence services have recourse to intrusive measures, such as 
covert surveillance and the interception of communications, in order to collect information 
necessary to fulfil their mandates. It is a fundamental requirement of the rule of law that 
individuals must be aware of measures that public authorities may use to restrict their rights 
and be able to foresee which activities may give rise to their use.103 National law outlines 
the categories of persons and activities that may be subject to intelligence collection,104 as 
well as the threshold of suspicion required for particular collection measures to be 
initiated.105 Some national laws also impose specific limitations on the use of intrusive 
collection measures against particular categories of individuals, notably journalists and 
lawyers.106 These measures are designed to protect professional privileges deemed to be 
essential to the functioning of a free society, such as the right of journalists not to disclose 
their sources, or lawyer-client privilege. Strict limitations on the use of intrusive collection

<p>methods help to ensure that intelligence collection is both necessary and limited to 
individuals and groups that are likely to be involved in activities posing a threat to national 
security. National law also includes guidelines on the permissible duration of the use of 
intrusive collection measures, after which time intelligence services are required to seek 
reauthorization in order to continue using them.107 Similarly, it is good practice for national 
law to require that intelligence collection measures are ceased as soon as the purpose for 
which they were used has been fulfilled or if it becomes clear that that purpose cannot be 
met.108 These provisions serve to minimize infringements on the rights of individuals 
concerned and help to ensure that intelligence-collection measures meet the requirement of 
proportionality. 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 22</b>. Intelligence-collection measures that impose significant limitations on 
human rights are authorized and overseen by at least one institution that is external 
to and independent of the intelligence services. This institution has the power to 
order the revision, suspension or termination of such collection measures. 
Intelligence-collection measures that impose significant limitations on human rights 
are subject to a multilevel process of authorization that includes approval within 
intelligence services, by the political executive and by an institution that is 
independent of the intelligence services and the executive. 
</p>
<p>35. It is common practice for national laws to include detailed provisions on the process 
for authorizing all intelligence collection measures that restrict human rights.109 
Authorization processes require intelligence services to justify the proposed use of 
intelligence-collection measures in accordance with a clearly defined legal framework (see 
practices 20 and 21 above). This is a key mechanism for ensuring that collection measures 
are used in accordance with the law. It is good practice for intrusive collection measures to 
be authorized by an institution that is independent of the intelligence services, i.e., a 
politically accountable member of the executive110 or a (quasi) judicial body.111 Judicial 
bodies are independent of the intelligence process and therefore best placed to conduct an 
independent and impartial assessment of an application to use intrusive collection 
powers.112 Furthermore, it is notably good practice for the authorization of the most 
intrusive intelligence collection methods (e.g. the interception of the content of 
communications, the interception of mail and surreptitious entry into property) to include

<p>senior managers in intelligence services, the politically accountable executive and a (quasi)

</p><p>36. States also ensure that intelligence collection is subject to ongoing oversight by an 
institution that is external to the intelligence services. It is good practice for intelligence 
services to be required to report on the use of collection measures on an ongoing basis and 
for the external oversight institution to have the power to order the termination of collection 
measures.114 In many States, external oversight bodies also conduct ex post oversight of the 
use of intelligence-collection measures to ascertain whether or not they are authorized and 
used in compliance with the law.115 This is particularly important in view of the fact that the 
individuals whose rights are affected by intelligence collection are unlikely to be aware of 
the fact and, thus, have limited opportunity to challenge its legality. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Management and use of personal data 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 23</b>. Publicly available law outlines the types of personal data that 
intelligence services may hold, and which criteria apply to the use, retention, 
deletion and disclosure of these data. Intelligence services are permitted to retain 
personal data that are strictly necessary for the purposes of fulfilling their mandate. 
</p>
<p>37. There is a number of general principles that apply to the protection of personal data 
that are commonly included in national laws116 as well as in international instruments.117 
These include the following requirements: that personal data be collected and processed in 
a lawful and fair manner; that the use of personal data be limited and confined to its original 
specified purpose; that steps be taken to ensure that records of personal data are accurate; 
that personal data files be deleted when no longer required; and that individuals have the 
right to have access to and correct their personal data file.118 In the context of personal data 
use by intelligence services, the opening, retention and disposal of personal data files can 
have serious human rights implications; therefore, guidelines for the management and use 
of personal data by intelligence services are set out in public statutory law. This is a legal 
safeguard against giving the executive or the intelligence services unchecked powers over 
these matters.119 A second safeguard is that legal guidelines are established to specify and

Fourth, various States have made it a criminal offence for intelligence officers to disclose or 
use personal data outside the established legal framework.122 A final safeguard is that States 
have explicitly stipulated that intelligence services are not allowed to store personal data on 
discriminatory grounds.123  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 24</b>. Intelligence services conduct regular assessments of the relevance and 
accuracy of the personal data that they hold. They are legally required to delete or 
update any information that is assessed to be inaccurate or no longer relevant to their 
mandate, the work of oversight institutions or possible legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>38. States have taken steps to ensure that intelligence services regularly check whether 
personal data files are accurate and relevant to their mandate.124 Safeguards on the 
relevance and accuracy of personal data help to ensure that any ongoing infringement of the 
right to privacy is minimized. In some States, the intelligence services have not only the 
legal obligation to destroy files that are no longer relevant125 but also files that are incorrect 
or have been processed incorrectly.126 While intelligence services are ordinarily obliged to 
delete data that are no longer relevant to their mandate, it is important that this is not to the 
detriment of the work of oversight bodies or possible legal proceedings. Information held 
by intelligence services may constitute evidence in legal proceedings with significant 
implications for the individuals concerned; the availability of such material may be 
important for guaranteeing due process rights. Therefore, it is good practice for intelligence 
services to be obliged to retain all records (including original transcripts and operational 
notes) in cases that may lead to legal proceedings, and that the deletion of any such 
information be supervised by an external institution (see practice 25 below).127  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 25</b>. An independent institution exists to oversee the use of personal data by 
intelligence services. This institution has access to all files held by the intelligence 
services and has the power to order the disclosure of information to individuals 
concerned, as well as the destruction of files or personal information contained 
therein. 
</p>
<p>39. In many States, the management of personal data files is subject to regular and 
continuous oversight by independent institutions.128 These institutions are mandated to 
conduct regular inspection visits and random checks of personal data files of current and

<p>past operations.129 States have also mandated independent oversight institutions to check 
whether the internal directives on file management comply with the law.130 States have 
acknowledged that oversight institutions need to be autonomous in their working and 
inspection methods, and have sufficient resources and capacities to conduct regular 
inspections of the management and use of personal data by intelligence services.131 
Intelligence services have a legal duty to cooperate fully with the oversight institution 
responsible for scrutinizing their management and use of personal data.132 
</p>
<p><b>Practice 26</b>. Individuals have the possibility to request access to their personal data 
held by intelligence services. Individuals may exercise this right by addressing a 
request to a relevant authority or through an independent data-protection or 
oversight institution. Individuals have the right to rectify inaccuracies in their 
personal data. Any exceptions to these general rules are prescribed by law and 
strictly limited, proportionate and necessary for the fulfilment of the mandate of the 
intelligence service. It is incumbent upon the intelligence service to justify, to an 
independent oversight institution, any decision not to release personal information. 
</p>
<p>40. Many States have given individuals the right to have access to their personal data 
held by intelligence services. This right may be exercised by addressing a request to the 
intelligence service,133 a relevant minister,134 or an independent oversight institution.135 The 
right of individuals to have access to their personal data files should be understood in the 
context of safeguards for privacy rights and the freedom of access to information. This 
safeguard is important not only because it allows individuals to check whether their 
personal data file is accurate and lawful, but also because it is a safeguard against abuse, 
mismanagement and corruption. Indeed, an individual&#8217;s right to have access to personal 
data held by intelligence services serves to enhance transparency and accountability of the 
decision-making processes of the intelligence services and, therefore, assists in developing 
citizens&#8217; trust in Government actions.136 States may restrict access to personal data files, for 
reasons such as safeguarding ongoing investigations and protecting sources and methods of 
the intelligence services. However, it is good practice for such restrictions to be outlined in 
law, and that they meet the requirements of proportionality and necessity.137

<p><b> K. The use of powers of arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 27</b>. Intelligence services are not permitted to use powers of arrest and 
detention if they do not have a mandate to perform law enforcement functions. They 
are not given powers of arrest and detention if this duplicates powers held by law 
enforcement agencies that are mandated to address the same activities.  
</p>
<p>41. It is widely accepted as good practice for intelligence services to be prohibited 
explicitly from exercising powers of arrest and detention if their legal mandate does not 
require them to exercise law enforcement functions in relation to national security offences, 
such as terrorism.138 Strong arguments have been made against combining intelligence and 
law enforcement functions.139 However, if national law provides intelligence services with 
powers of arrest and detention, it is good practice for this to be explicitly within the context 
of a mandate that gives them the responsibility for performing law enforcement functions 
pertaining to specified threats to national security, such as terrorism.140 If national or 
regional law enforcement bodies have a mandate to enforce criminal law in relation to 
national security offences, there is no legitimate reason for a separate intelligence service to 
be given powers of arrest and detention for the same activities. There is a risk of the 
development of a parallel enforcement system, whereby intelligence services exercise 
powers of arrest and detention in order to circumvent legal safeguards and oversight that 
apply to the law enforcement agencies.141  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 28</b>. If intelligence services have powers of arrest and detention, they are 
based on publicly available law. The exercise of these powers is restricted to cases in 
which there is reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed or is about to 
commit a specific criminal offence. Intelligence services are not permitted to deprive 
persons of their liberty simply for the purpose of intelligence collection. The use of 
any powers and arrest and detention by intelligence services is subject to the same 
degree of oversight as applies to their use by law enforcement authorities, including 
judicial review of the lawfulness of any deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>42. If intelligence services are given powers of arrest and detention, national law 
outlines the purposes of such powers and circumstances under which they may be used.142 It 
is good practice for the use of these powers to be strictly limited to cases where there is 
reasonable suspicion that a crime (falling under the mandate of the intelligence services) 
has been, or is about to be, committed. It follows that intelligence services are not permitted 
to use these powers for the mere purpose of intelligence collection.143 The apprehension and 
detention of individuals when there is no reasonable suspicion that they have committed or 
are about to commit a criminal offence, or other internationally accepted ground for

<p>detention, is not permissible under international human rights law.144 If national law permits 
intelligence services to apprehend and detain individuals, it is good practice for the exercise 
of these powers to be subject to the same degree of oversight applying to the use of these 
powers by law enforcement authorities.145 Most importantly, international human rights law 
requires that individuals have the right to challenge the lawfulness of their detention before 
a court.146   
</p>
<p><b>Practice 29</b>. If intelligence services possess powers of arrest and detention, they 
comply with international human rights standards on the rights to liberty and fair 
trial, as well as the prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. 
When exercising these powers, intelligence services comply with international 
standards set out in, inter alia, the Body of Principles for the Protection of All 
Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, the Code of Conduct for 
Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.  
</p>
<p>43. If intelligence services are given powers of arrest and detention, they are required to 
comply with international standards applying to the deprivation of liberty (see also practice 
28 above).147 These standards are further elaborated in several international and regional 
codes of conduct of law enforcement officials codifying a range of good practices that can 
be applied to intelligence services with powers of arrest and detention.148 In addition to the 
legal obligation (pertaining to the judicial review of detention) outlined in practice 28 
above, there are three additional sets of standards that apply the use of powers of arrest and 
detention by intelligence services. First, intelligence services are bound by the absolute 
prohibition on the use of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment.149 Second, any use 
of force during arrest and detention must comply with international standards, including the 
requirements that any use of force be strictly necessary, proportionate to the perceived 
danger and properly reported.150 Third, it is good practice for intelligence services to 
comply with the following international standards on the apprehension and detention of 
individuals: that all arrests, detentions and interrogations are recorded from the moment of 
apprehension;151 that officers making an arrest identify themselves to the individual 
concerned and inform them of the reasons and legal basis for their

access to legal representation.153  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 30</b>. Intelligence services are not permitted to operate their own detention 
facilities or to make use of any unacknowledged detention facilities operated by 
third parties. 
</p>
<p>44. It is good practice for intelligence services to be explicitly prohibited in national law 
from operating their own detention facilities.154 If intelligence services are permitted to 
exercise powers of arrest and detention, the individuals concerned are remanded in regular 
detention centres administered by law enforcement agencies.155 Equally, intelligence 
services are not permitted to make use of unacknowledged detention facilities run by third 
parties, such as private contractors. These are essential safeguards against arbitrary 
detention by intelligence services and/or the possible development of a parallel detention 
regime in which individuals could be held in conditions that do not meet international 
standards of detention and due process. 
</p>
<p><b> L. Intelligence-sharing and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>Practice 31</b>. Intelligence-sharing between intelligence agencies of the same State or 
with the authorities of a foreign State is based on national law that outlines clear 
parameters for intelligence exchange, including the conditions that must be met for 
information to be shared, the entities with which intelligence may be shared, and the 
safeguards that apply to exchanges of intelligence.  
</p>
<p>45. It is good practice for all forms of information-sharing between intelligence services 
and other domestic or foreign entities to have a clear basis in national law. National law 
includes criteria on the purposes for which intelligence may be shared, the entities with 
which it may be shared, and the procedural safeguards that apply to intelligence-sharing.156 
A legal basis for intelligence-sharing is an important requirement of the rule of law, and is 
particularly important when personal data are exchanged, because this directly infringes the 
right to privacy and may affect a range of other rights and fundamental freedoms. In 
addition to ensuring that intelligence-sharing is based on national law, it is widely accepted 
as good practice that intelligence-sharing be based on written agreements or memoranda 
between the parties, which comply with guidelines laid down in national law.157 The 
elements that are commonly included in such agreements include rules governing the use of 
shared information, a statement of the parties&#8217; compliance with human rights and data 
protection, and the provision that the sending service may request feedback on the use of

<p>the shared information.158 Intelligence-sharing agreements help to establish mutually agreed 
standards and expectations about shared information, and reduce the scope for informal 
intelligence-sharing, which cannot be easily reviewed by oversight institutions.  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 32</b>. National law outlines the process for authorizing both the agreements 
upon which intelligence-sharing is based and the ad hoc sharing of intelligence. 
Executive approval is needed for any intelligence-sharing agreements with foreign 
entities, as well as for the sharing of intelligence that may have significant 
implications for human rights. 
</p>
<p>46. It is good practice for national law to set out guidelines for the authorization of the 
sending of information on an ad hoc basis, as well as for the establishment of agreements 
for intelligence-sharing.159 This serves to ensure that there are established channels of 
responsibility for intelligence-sharing and that relevant individuals can be held to account 
for any decisions they make in this regard. In many States, routine intelligence-sharing at 
the domestic level is authorized internally (within the intelligence services). However, 
when information shared by intelligence services may be used in court proceedings, it is 
good practice for executive authorization to be required; the use of intelligence in such 
proceedings may have profound implications for the rights of the individuals concerned, as 
well as for the activities of the intelligence services themselves.160 Additionally, many 
national laws require executive authorization for the sharing of intelligence or 
establishment of sharing agreements with foreign entities.161  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 33</b>. Before entering into an intelligence-sharing agreement or sharing 
intelligence on an ad hoc basis, intelligence services undertake an assessment of the 
counterpart&#8217;s record on human rights and data protection, as well as the legal 
safeguards and institutional controls that govern the counterpart. Before handing 
over information, intelligence services make sure that any shared intelligence is 
relevant to the recipient&#8217;s mandate, will be used in accordance with the conditions 
attached and will not be used for purposes that violate human rights.  
</p>
<p>47. Both the sending and receipt of intelligence can have important implications for 
human rights and fundamental freedoms. Information sent to a foreign Government or 
intelligence service may not only contribute to legal limitations on the rights of an 
individual, but could also serve as the basis for human rights violations. Similarly, 
intelligence received from a foreign entity may have been obtained in violation of 
international human rights law. Therefore, before entering into a sharing agreement or 
sharing any information, it is good practice for intelligence services to conduct a general 
assessment of a foreign counterpart&#8217;s record on human rights and the protection of personal 
data, as well as the legal and institutional safeguards (such as oversight) that apply to those 
services.162 Before sharing information on specific individuals or groups, intelligence 
services take steps to assess the possible impact on the individuals concerned.163 It is good

<p>practice to maintain an absolute prohibition on the sharing of any information if there is a 
reasonable belief that sharing information could lead to the violation of the rights of the 
individual(s) concerned.164 In some circumstances, State responsibility may be triggered 
through the sharing of intelligence that contributes to the commission of grave human rights 
violations. Additionally, many national laws require States to evaluate the necessity of 
sharing particular information from the point of view of their own mandate and that of their 
counterparts.165 An assessment of whether information-sharing is necessary and relevant to 
the mandate of the recipient allows intelligence services to uphold the principle of 
minimization when sharing information, i.e., intelligence services minimize the amount of 
personal data shared to the greatest extent possible.166 These safeguards help to prevent 
excessive or arbitrary intelligence-sharing.  
</p>
<p>48. In view of the possible implications of intelligence-sharing for human rights, it is 
good practice for intelligence services to screen all outgoing information for accuracy and 
relevance before sending it to foreign entities.167 Where there are doubts about the 
reliability of outgoing intelligence, it is either withheld or accompanied by error 
estimates.168 Finally, it is good practice for all intelligence-sharing to take place in writing 
and to be recorded; this facilitates subsequent review by oversight institutions.169  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 34</b>. Independent oversight institutions are able to examine intelligence-
sharing arrangements and any information sent by intelligence services to foreign 
entities. 
</p>
<p>49. It is good practice for oversight institutions to be mandated to review the agreements 
upon which intelligence-sharing is based, as well as any arrangements based on such 
agreements.170 Independent oversight institutions can scrutinize the legal framework and 
procedural dimensions of intelligence-sharing agreements to ensure that they comply with 
national laws and relevant international legal standards. As a general rule, oversight 
institutions are authorized to have access to all information necessary to fulfil their mandate 
(see practice 7 above). However, within the context of international intelligence-sharing, 
the third party rule may entail restrictions on oversight institutions&#8217; access to incoming 
information provided by foreign entities. Oversight institutions are generally considered to 
be third parties; therefore, they cannot normally have access to information shared with 
intelligence services by foreign entities. Nevertheless, oversight institutions have a right to 
scrutinize information sent to foreign entities, and they exercise this right as part of a 
mandate to oversee all aspects of an intelligence service&#8217;s activities (see practice 7 above). 
Within this context, it is good practice for national law to explicitly require intelligence 
services to report intelligence-sharing to an independent oversight institution.171 This

</b></p>
<p>provides a check on the legality of intelligence-sharing practices, and is an important 
safeguard against the sharing of personal data that may have serious human rights 
implications for the individuals concerned.  
</p>
<p><b>Practice 35</b>. Intelligence services are explicitly prohibited from employing the 
assistance of foreign intelligence services in any way that results in the 
circumvention of national legal standards and institutional controls on their own 
activities. If States request foreign intelligence services to undertake activities on 
their behalf, they require these services to comply with the same legal standards that 
would apply if the activities were undertaken by their own intelligence services. 
</p>
<p>50. National laws regulating the activities of intelligence services provide legal and 
institutional safeguards to protect human rights and the constitutional legal order within the 
context of intelligence activities. In view of this, it would be contrary to the rule of law for 
States or their intelligence services to request a foreign entity to undertake activities in their 
jurisdiction that they could not lawfully undertake themselves. It would be good practice 
for national law to contain an absolute prohibition on intelligence services cooperating with 
foreign entities in order to evade legal obligations that apply to their own activities.172 In 
addition, it is important to recall that States have an international legal obligation to 
safeguard the rights of all individuals under their jurisdiction. This implies that they have a 
duty to ensure that foreign intelligence services do not engage in activities that violate 
human rights on their territory, as well as to refrain from participating in any such 
activities.173 Indeed, States are internationally responsible if they aid or assist another State 
to violate the human rights of individuals.174

</p>
<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Good practices on legal and institutional frameworks for 
intelligence services and their oversight 
</b></p>
<p>Practice 1. Intelligence services play an important role in protecting national security and 
upholding the rule of law. Their main purpose is to collect, analyse and disseminate 
information that assists policymakers and other public entities in taking measures to protect 
national security. This includes the protection of the population and their human rights.  
</p>
<p>Practice 2. The mandates of intelligence services are narrowly and precisely defined in a 
publicly available law. Mandates are strictly limited to protecting legitimate national 
security interests as outlined in publicly available legislation or national security policies, 
and identify the threats to national security that intelligence services are tasked to address. 
If terrorism is included among these threats, it is defined in narrow and precise terms.  
</p>
<p>Practice 3. The powers and competences of intelligence services are clearly and 
exhaustively defined in national law. They are required to use these powers exclusively for 
the purposes for which they were given. In particular, any powers given to intelligence 
services for the purposes of counter-terrorism must be used exclusively for these purposes.  
</p>
<p>Practice 4. All intelligence services are constituted through, and operate under, publicly 
available laws that comply with the Constitution and international human rights law. 
Intelligence services can only undertake or be instructed to undertake activities that are 
prescribed by and in accordance with national law. The use of subsidiary regulations that 
are not publicly available is strictly limited, and such regulations are both authorized by and 
remain within the parameters of publicly available laws. Regulations that are not made 
public do not serve as the basis for any activities that restrict human rights. 
</p>
<p>Practice 5. Intelligence services are explicitly prohibited from undertaking any action that 
contravenes the Constitution or international human rights law. These prohibitions extend 
not only to the conduct of intelligence services on their national territory but also to their 
activities abroad.  
</p>
<p>Practice 6. Intelligence services are overseen by a combination of internal, executive, 
parliamentary, judicial and specialized oversight institutions whose mandates and powers 
are based on publicly available law. An effective system of intelligence oversight includes 
at least one civilian institution that is independent of both the intelligence services and the 
executive. The combined remit of oversight institutions covers all aspects of the work of 
intelligence services, including their compliance with the law; the effectiveness and 
efficiency of their activities; their finances; and their administrative practices. 
</p>
<p>Practice 7. Oversight institutions have the power, resources and expertise to initiate and 
conduct their own investigations, as well as full and unhindered access to the information, 
officials and installations necessary to fulfil their mandates. Oversight institutions receive 
the full cooperation of intelligence services and law enforcement authorities in hearing 
witnesses, as well as obtaining documentation and other evidence. 
</p>
<p>Practice 8. Oversight institutions take all necessary measures to protect classified 
information and personal data to which they have access during the course of their work. 
Penalties are provided for the breach of these requirements by members of oversight 
institutions. 
</p>
<p>Practice 9. Any individual who believes that her or his rights have been infringed by an 
intelligence service is able to bring a complaint to a court or oversight institution, such as </p>


<p>GE.10-13410 <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>an ombudsman, human rights commissioner or national human rights institution. 
Individuals affected by the illegal actions of an intelligence service have recourse to an 
institution that can provide an effective remedy, including full reparation for the harm 
suffered.  
</p>
<p>Practice 10. The institutions responsible for addressing complaints and claims for effective 
remedy arising from the activities of intelligence services are independent of the 
intelligence services and the political executive. Such institutions have full and unhindered 
access to all relevant information, the necessary resources and expertise to conduct 
investigations, and the capacity to issue binding orders.  
</p>
<p>Practice 11. Intelligence services carry out their work in a manner that contributes to the 
promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all individuals 
under the jurisdiction of the State. Intelligence services do not discriminate against 
individuals or groups on the grounds of their sex, race, colour, language, religion, political 
or other opinion, national or social origin, or other status.  
</p>
<p>Practice 12. National law prohibits intelligence services from engaging in any political 
activities or from acting to promote or protect the interests of any particular political, 
religious, linguistic, ethnic, social or economic group.  
</p>
<p>Practice 13. Intelligence services are prohibited from using their powers to target lawful 
political activity or other lawful manifestations of the rights to freedom of association, 
peaceful assembly and expression. 
</p>
<p>Practice 14. States are internationally responsible for the activities of their intelligence 
services and their agents, and any private contractors they engage, regardless of where these 
activities take place and who the victim of internationally wrongful conduct is. Therefore, 
the executive power takes measures to ensure and exercise overall control of and 
responsibility for their intelligence services.  
</p>
<p>Practice 15. Constitutional, statutory and international criminal law applies to members of 
intelligence services as much as it does to any other public official. Any exceptions 
allowing intelligence officials to take actions that would normally violate national law are 
strictly limited and clearly prescribed by law. These exceptions never allow the violation of 
peremptory norms of international law or of the human rights obligations of the State. 
</p>
<p>Practice 16. National laws provide for criminal, civil or other sanctions against any 
member, or individual acting on behalf of an intelligence service, who violates or orders an 
action that would violate national law or international human rights law. These laws also 
establish procedures to hold individuals to account for such violations. 
</p>
<p>Practice 17. Members of intelligence services are legally obliged to refuse superior orders 
that would violate national law or international human rights law. Appropriate protection is 
provided to members of intelligence services who refuse orders in such situations.  
</p>
<p>Practice 18. There are internal procedures in place for members of intelligence services to 
report wrongdoing. These are complemented by an independent body that has a mandate 
and access to the necessary information to fully investigate and take action to address 
wrongdoing when internal procedures have proved inadequate. Members of intelligence 
services who, acting in good faith, report wrongdoing are legally protected from any form 
of reprisal. These protections extend to disclosures made to the media or the public at large 
if they are made as a last resort and pertain to matters of significant public concern.  
</p>
<p>Practice 19. Intelligence services and their oversight institutions take steps to foster an 
institutional culture of professionalism based on respect for the rule of law and human 
rights. In particular, intelligence services are responsible for training their members on 
relevant provisions of national and international law, including international human rights 
law.  </p>


<p><b>32</b> GE.10-13410 
</p>
<p>Practice 20: Any measures by intelligence services that restrict human rights and 
fundamental freedoms comply with the following criteria: 
</p>
<p> (a) They are prescribed by publicly available law that complies with 
international human rights standards; 
</p>
<p> (b) All such measures must be strictly necessary for an intelligence service to 
fulfil its legally prescribed mandate; 
</p>
<p> (c) Measures taken must be proportionate to the objective. This requires that 
intelligence services select the measure that least restricts human rights, and take special 
care to minimize the adverse impact of any measures on the rights of individuals, including, 
in particular, persons who are not suspected of any wrongdoing; 
</p>
<p> (d) No measure taken by intelligence services may violate peremptory norms of 
international law or the essence of any human right; 
</p>
<p> (e) There is a clear and comprehensive system for the authorization, monitoring 
and oversight of the use of any measure that restricts human rights; 
</p>
<p> (f) Individuals whose rights may have been restricted by intelligence services are 
able to address complaints to an independent institution and seek an effective remedy<b>. 
</b></p>
<p>Practice 21. National law outlines the types of collection measures available to intelligence 
services; the permissible objectives of intelligence collection; the categories of persons and 
activities which may be subject to intelligence collection; the threshold of suspicion 
required to justify the use of collection measures; the limitations on the duration for which 
collection measures may be used; and the procedures for authorizing, overseeing and 
reviewing the use of intelligence-collection measures.   
</p>
<p>Practice 22. Intelligence-collection measures that impose significant limitations on human 
rights are authorized and overseen by at least one institution that is external to and 
independent of the intelligence services. This institution has the power to order the revision, 
suspension or termination of such collection measures. Intelligence collection measures that 
impose significant limitations on human rights are subject to a multilevel process of 
authorization that includes approval within intelligence services, by the political executive 
and by an institution that is independent of the intelligence services and the executive. 
</p>
<p>Practice 23. Publicly available law outlines the types of personal data that intelligence 
services may hold, and which criteria apply to the use, retention, deletion and disclosure of 
these data. Intelligence services are permitted to retain personal data that are strictly 
necessary for the purposes of fulfilling their mandate. 
</p>
<p>Practice 24. Intelligence services conduct regular assessments of the relevance and 
accuracy of the personal data that they hold. They are legally required to delete or update 
any information that is assessed to be inaccurate or no longer relevant to their mandate, the 
work of oversight institutions or possible legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>Practice 25. An independent institution exists to oversee the use of personal data by 
intelligence services. This institution has access to all files held by the intelligence services 
and has the power to order the disclosure of information to individuals concerned, as well 
as the destruction of files or personal information contained therein. 
</p>
<p>Practice 26. Individuals have the possibility to request access to their personal data held by 
intelligence services. Individuals may exercise this right by addressing a request to a 
relevant authority or through an independent data-protection or oversight institution. 
Individuals have the right to rectify inaccuracies in their personal data. Any exceptions to 
these general rules are prescribed by law and strictly limited, proportionate and necessary 
for the fulfilment of the mandate of the intelligence service. It is incumbent upon the </p>


<p>GE.10-13410 <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>intelligence service to justify, to an independent oversight institution, any decision not to 
release personal information. 
</p>
<p>Practice 27. Intelligence services are not permitted to use powers of arrest and detention if 
they do not have a mandate to perform law enforcement functions. They are not given 
powers of arrest and detention if this duplicates powers held by law enforcement agencies 
that are mandated to address the same activities.  
</p>
<p>Practice 28. If intelligence services have powers of arrest and detention, they are based on 
publicly available law. The exercise of these powers is restricted to cases in which there is 
reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed or is about to commit a specific 
criminal offence. Intelligence services are not permitted to deprive persons of their liberty 
simply for the purpose of intelligence collection. The use of any powers and arrest and 
detention by intelligence services is subject to the same degree of oversight as applies to 
their use by law enforcement authorities, including judicial review of the lawfulness of any 
deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>Practice 29. If intelligence services possess powers of arrest and detention they comply 
with international human rights standards on the rights to liberty and fair trial, as well as the 
prohibition of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. When exercising these powers, 
intelligence services comply with international standards set out in, inter alia, the Body of 
Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, 
the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.  
</p>
<p>Practice 30. Intelligence services are not permitted to operate their own detention facilities 
or to make use of any unacknowledged detention facilities operated by third parties. 
</p>
<p>Practice 31. Intelligence-sharing between intelligence agencies of the same State or with the 
authorities of a foreign State is based on national law that outlines clear parameters for 
intelligence exchange, including the conditions that must be met for information to be 
shared, the entities with which intelligence may be shared, and the safeguards that apply to 
exchanges of intelligence.  
</p>
<p>Practice 32. National law outlines the process for authorizing both the agreements upon 
which intelligence-sharing is based and the ad hoc sharing of intelligence. Executive 
approval is needed for any intelligence-sharing agreements with foreign entities, as well as 
for the sharing of intelligence that may have significant implications for human rights. 
</p>
<p>Practice 33. Before entering into an intelligence-sharing agreement or sharing intelligence 
on an ad hoc basis, intelligence services undertake an assessment of the counterpart&#8217;s 
record on human rights and data protection, as well as the legal safeguards and institutional 
controls that govern the counterpart. Before handing over information, intelligence services 
make sure that any shared intelligence is relevant to the recipient&#8217;s mandate, will be used in 
accordance with the conditions attached and will not be used for purposes that violate 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>Practice 34. Independent oversight institutions are able to examine intelligence-sharing 
arrangements and any information sent by intelligence services to foreign entities. 
</p>
<p>Practice 35. Intelligence services are explicitly prohibited from employing the assistance of 
foreign intelligence services in any way that results in the circumvention of national legal 
standards and institutional controls on their own activities. If States request foreign 
intelligence services to undertake activities on their behalf, they require these services to 
comply with the same legal standards that would apply if the activities were undertaken by 
their own intelligence services.
