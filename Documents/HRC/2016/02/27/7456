<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 
</p>
<p>27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of Bosnia and Herzegovina was held at the 
</p>
<p>16th meeting on 5 November 2014. The delegation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was headed 
</p>
<p>by Miladin Dragi&#269;evi&#263;, Deputy Minister for Human Rights and Refugees of Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina. At its 18th meeting, held on 7 November 2014, the Working Group adopted 
</p>
<p>the report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Republic of Korea, 
</p>
<p>the Russian Federation and Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina: 
</p>

<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/BIH/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Bosnia and Herzegovina through 
</p>
<p>the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, headed by Miladin Dragi&#269;evi&#263;, Deputy 
</p>
<p>Minister for Human Rights and Refugees, reported that a number of activities had been 
</p>
<p>launched and carried out following the first universal periodic review. However, the 
</p>
<p>country had been confronted with many economic and developmental problems which had 
</p>
<p>influenced the situation of human rights. Among those problems were the extensive floods 
</p>
<p>which had affected the greater part of the country. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation referred to some of the instruments it had recently acceded to, 
</p>
<p>including the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual 
</p>
<p>Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, the Council of Europe Convention on Contact concerning 
</p>
<p>Children and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR). 
</p>
<p>7. The initial report to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities had 
</p>
<p>been submitted and the delegation stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina had joined activities 
</p>
<p>of the Council of Europe to improve the situation of persons with disabilities. The Council 
</p>
<p>of Ministers had decided to establish the Council for People with Disabilities of Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina as an advisory body in charge of monitoring the implementation of the </p>


<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and had initiated 
</p>
<p>amendments to the relevant legislation. Bosnia and Herzegovina had ratified the 
</p>
<p>International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
</p>
<p>(ICPPED) in 2012 and recognized the competence of the Committee on Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearances. The Missing Persons Institute of Bosnia and Herzegovina had been 
</p>
<p>established and there were efforts under way to create a new management structure for it 
</p>
<p>and a fund to provide support to the families of missing persons. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation mentioned measures that were being taken, including expansion of 
</p>
<p>the number of trained officials at the entity level and improvements to the monitoring 
</p>
<p>system of discrimination at the national level through the establishment of a system for 
</p>
<p>collecting data on cases of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>9. As regards child protection, the delegation referred to the action plan for children 
</p>
<p>and cited several policy documents. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to inclusive education, the delegation mentioned a number of measures 
</p>
<p>related to the education of Roma children, including the provision of Roma teaching 
</p>
<p>assistants in cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and a number of 
</p>
<p>incentives for enrolment and attendance at school. It noted that the number of children 
</p>
<p>dropping out at primary and secondary level had significantly decreased. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation emphasized that the legal and strategic documents governing 
</p>
<p>education had created the preconditions for the development of a tolerant, multi-ethnic 
</p>
<p>environment in schools. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation stated that representatives of all minorities in Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina sat on the Council for National Minorities at the State and entity levels. A 
</p>
<p>strategy for Roma and a revised action plan for addressing Roma issues in the areas of 
</p>
<p>employment, housing and health care had been adopted in 2013, and a budget of EUR 
</p>
<p>1.5 million created for its implementation. A strategic platform to address the issues of 
</p>
<p>national minorities was also being developed. 
</p>
<p>13. On the issue of social inclusion, the delegation stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</p>
<p>reported regularly on the problems of vulnerable groups and proposed programmes aimed 
</p>
<p>at minorities, children and women victims of violence and trafficking, which were provided 
</p>
<p>through the use of additional funds from the budget and the donor programmes of a number 
</p>
<p>of international organizations. Protection programmes were also undertaken with domestic 
</p>
<p>NGOs. 
</p>
<p>14. In relation to the right to travel documents, the delegation stressed that citizens who 
</p>
<p>fulfilled the criteria under the legislation on identity cards were entitled to travel documents 
</p>
<p>and significant progress had been made in implementing the relevant regional declaration 
</p>
<p>(the Zagreb Declaration). 
</p>
<p>15. The delegation noted that in the last 15 years, since trafficking had first been 
</p>
<p>observed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, comprehensive measures had been undertaken to 
</p>
<p>prevent it. The delegation noted that a number of indicators given in international 
</p>
<p>monitoring reports were consistent in their assessment that the problem persisted, but to a 
</p>
<p>much lesser extent than in previous years. The delegation mentioned the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Strategy to Counter Trafficking in Human Beings in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Action 
</p>
<p>Plan 2013&#8211;2015. It noted that it was based on an innovative approach, involving the full 
</p>
<p>participation of civil society. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation stated that adequate psychological, medical, social and legal 
</p>
<p>assistance was provided for foreigners who had been victims of trafficking, and mentioned 
</p>
<p>amendments in 2010 to the criminal code of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which introduced the 
</p>
<p>criminal offence of trafficking in persons, in line with relevant international standards. The </p>


<p>delegation also provided many other details of the domestic legal framework in relation to 
</p>
<p>trafficking in human beings. 
</p>
<p>17. Regarding anti-corruption and organized crime, the delegation reported that the Law 
</p>
<p>on the Protection of Persons Reporting Corruption (Whistleblowers) in the Institutions of 
</p>
<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina was passed in late 2013. The anti-corruption strategy for the 
</p>
<p>period 2009&#8211;2014 and an action plan for the implementation of strategy had been adopted 
</p>
<p>and the delegation provided details of various related legislative and policy measures. 
</p>
<p>18. In relation to gender issues, the delegation stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina had 
</p>
<p>signed and ratified a number of international conventions dealing with the prohibition of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and domestic violence, and had harmonized national laws and 
</p>
<p>facilitated their implementation. At the entity level, laws and by-laws for the prevention of 
</p>
<p>and protection from domestic violence had been enacted. The new laws provided access to 
</p>
<p>all levels of health care in family planning for women, regardless of the status of their 
</p>
<p>health insurance. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation mentioned that the gender action plan had specific sectorial 
</p>
<p>strategies, such as the 2014&#8211;2017 action plan of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), the 2013&#8211;2017 strategy for 
</p>
<p>preventing and combating domestic violence of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</p>
<p>(the Federation) and the 2014&#8211;2019 strategy for combating domestic violence of Republika 
</p>
<p>Srpska. 
</p>
<p>20. The delegation also mentioned the 2014&#8211;2018 strategy for the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence, which was in the process of being adopted. Among other measures to 
</p>
<p>which the delegation referred were projects to promote the representation of women in 
</p>
<p>political and public life, implemented by the Agency for Gender Equality of Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina and entity gender centres. A women&#8217;s parliamentary caucus of the Federation 
</p>
<p>had been established. From its inception in March 2013, the caucus parties had made a 
</p>
<p>significant effort in organizational development and influence in parliament. 
</p>
<p>21. The representative of Republika Srpska recalled that the constitution of Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina was part of the Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</p>
<p>(the Dayton agreement) and was thus part of an international treaty, as well as of domestic 
</p>
<p>legislation. The constitution set out the limited competencies of the institutions of Bosnia 
</p>
<p>and Herzegovina and left all other competencies to the entities. Many of the issues being 
</p>
<p>considered by the meeting were within the competencies of Republika Srpska. It was also 
</p>
<p>important to note that the constitution included direct implementation of the European 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>22. The representative noted that during the period under consideration, Republika 
</p>
<p>Srpska had made significant progress in combating corruption, including the adoption of an 
</p>
<p>action plan and strategy and the formation of an expert group for the monitoring of their 
</p>
<p>implementation. 
</p>
<p>23. In relation to combating trafficking in human beings, the representative mentioned 
</p>
<p>the important step that had been taken through the harmonization of the criminal code of 
</p>
<p>Republika Srpska with international standards relating to the definition of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>Republika Srpska had also taken measures to implement the recommendations of the 
</p>
<p>European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment in relation to sentenced prisoners. Conditions of detention had been improved 
</p>
<p>and any abuse of authority or use of excessive force or inhuman treatment by police officers 
</p>
<p>was strictly punished. </p>


<p>24. The representative stated that the criminal code of Republika Srpska provided 
</p>
<p>sanctions against incitement of national, racial or religious hatred, discord or intolerance. 
</p>
<p>25. Republika Srpska had been active in judicial reform, but the representative noted 
</p>
<p>that many judicial institutions had been created in the post-war period in contravention of 
</p>
<p>the constitution. It was necessary to eliminate ethnic discrimination in the work of the 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in processing cases of 
</p>
<p>war crimes committed against Serbs. 
</p>
<p>26. The representative of Republika Srpska expressed the hope that the new 
</p>
<p>Government, which would be constituted after the recent general elections, would support 
</p>
<p>all reasonable proposals for the implementation of the decision in the case of <i>Sejd</i>i&#263;<i> and 
</i></p>
<p><i>Finci </i>v.<i> Bosnia and Herzegovina.</i> Republika Srpska had already proposed a way to 
</p>
<p>eliminate all discriminatory election provisions on its territory. The representative also 
</p>
<p>noted that in the case of <i>Maktouf and Damjanovi</i>&#263; v.<i> Bosnia and Herzegovina</i>, the 
</p>
<p>European Court of Human Rights had proposed that the practice of retroactive application 
</p>
<p>of the law in war crimes cases be eliminated, but that the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</p>
<p>had not yet adopted measures to implement this. 
</p>
<p>27. In relation to the equality of all ethnic minorities, the representative of Republika 
</p>
<p>Srpska noted that none of the entity&#8217;s laws contained discriminatory provisions in that 
</p>
<p>respect. Members of the Roma community enjoyed the same rights as other citizens, 
</p>
<p>including health care. Republika Srpska had undertaken numerous measures to advance the 
</p>
<p>status of women, including in combating violence against women, their political 
</p>
<p>participation and employment. Notably, the criminal code had been amended to treat 
</p>
<p>domestic violence as a crime rather than a misdemeanour. Republika Srpska had adopted a 
</p>
<p>strategy on combating domestic violence, a related law and protocols, and had also formed 
</p>
<p>the Council for Children. 
</p>
<p>28. The representative of the Federation noted that its Government was conscious of the 
</p>
<p>existence of discrimination in certain fields within the entity and was clear in condemning 
</p>
<p>all acts of discrimination. A series of legal measures had been introduced to address the 
</p>
<p>issue, but the entity Government had spoken boldly in favour of constitutional reform, the 
</p>
<p>need to simplify and reduce the structures of governance and against discrimination on any 
</p>
<p>basis. The support of friendly countries was necessary to enable citizens to enjoy the same 
</p>
<p>rights as those in the most developed countries. He noted that, while the entities did have 
</p>
<p>certain competencies, they did not have international legal personality and the statements of 
</p>
<p>the representative of Republika Srpska, which went outside the existing constitutional 
</p>
<p>framework, underlined the need for constitutional reform, which would assist democracy 
</p>
<p>and the fulfilment of the international obligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
</p>
<p>29. The representative of the Federation stated that education in the entity was within 
</p>
<p>the competency of its cantons and the Federal Ministry had only a coordinating role. 
</p>
<p>However, the Ministry of Education and the Government of the Federation had invested 
</p>
<p>much effort and adopted a strategy and recommendations for the elimination of divided 
</p>
<p>structures and segregation in schools, commonly known as &#8220;two schools under one roof&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Those were preconditions for the creation of a multi-ethnic and tolerant environment in 
</p>
<p>schools in the Federation. The representative also highlighted the investment and efforts 
</p>
<p>needed to improve conditions for children with special needs. 
</p>
<p>30. In relation to employment rights the Government of the Federation was 
</p>
<p>unswervingly committed to respecting the fulfilment of the rights and obligations of both 
</p>
<p>employees and employers. A new modern labour law was being drafted. The Federation 
</p>
<p>regretted the length of some judicial proceedings in labour-related cases. Tackling the 
</p>
<p>informal economy was another priority for the Government of the Federation: new laws on </p>


<p>misdemeanours and labour inspection had been adopted to increase employee protection, 
</p>
<p>with increased inspections and penalties. 
</p>
<p>31. The representative noted that the Government of the Federation fully understood the 
</p>
<p>significance and gravity of the problems caused by corruption and had consequently 
</p>
<p>initiated several major reform processes. The general plan on combating corruption and two 
</p>
<p>related laws were probably the most important recent reforms. Specialized courts and 
</p>
<p>prosecutors&#8217; offices were important elements of those. 
</p>
<p>32. Significant progress had been made in improving the conditions of detention and the 
</p>
<p>representative mentioned that the legislation had been amended. Particularly important 
</p>
<p>were the provisions for the serving of sentences under home detention orders and for 
</p>
<p>substituting the payment of financial compensation for imprisonment. Those provisions had 
</p>
<p>greatly relieved overcrowding. 
</p>
<p>33. The representative noted that the damage caused during the recent floods had 
</p>
<p>amounted to billions of euros and the Government of the Federation had undertaken great 
</p>
<p>efforts to help the affected citizens to return to normal life, with a particular emphasis on 
</p>
<p>ensuring the equitable distribution of assistance. 
</p>
<p>34. The representative highlighted the cooperation of the Federation with the Office of 
</p>
<p>the High Representative and international organizations, such as the International 
</p>
<p>Commission for Missing Persons and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
</p>
<p>Europe, and thanked them for the assistance of those and numerous other domestic and 
</p>
<p>international institutions. The Government of the Federation remained united in its support 
</p>
<p>for human rights as an overarching priority and would continue to apply itself to full 
</p>
<p>implementation of the accepted international instruments. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

</p>
<p>protection of victims. 
</p>
<p>42. Viet Nam commended achievements in promoting and protecting human rights, 
</p>

</p>
<p>rates.

</p>
<p>efficient judicial system, guaranteeing the right to a fair trial, and related staff training 
</p>
<p>programmes. 
</p>
<p>50. Belgium expressed regret that ethnic minorities had been prevented from standing

</p>
<p>discrimination based on ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>53. Canada requested information regarding progress towards ending ethnic segregation 
</p>
<p>in schools and remaining obstacles. It welcomed the constructive approach to dialogue, 
</p>
<p>acknowledging the challenges faced, but noted that segregation was not conducive to

</p>
<p>on discrimination, but noted failures regarding fundamental freedoms. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Disabilities and efforts to eliminate differential treatment based on disability or

</p>
<p>65. The head of the delegation of Bosnia and Herzegovina enumerated a number of the 
</p>
<p>human rights issues which had been raised in the review. In relation to the return of 
</p>
<p>refugees and internally displaced persons, he noted that 99 per cent of their housing had 
</p>
<p>been returned to them since the end of the war, but problems in ensuring sustainability had 
</p>
<p>contributed to a slow rate of return. Moreover, the living conditions for many of those that 
</p>
<p>had returned were not yet satisfactory. The recent elections had still not resulted in the 
</p>
<p>formation of a new Government, but the leaders had spoken of the priority of implementing 
</p>
<p>the decision in the case of <i>Se</i>jdi&#263;<i> and Finci</i> and improving cooperation within Bosnia and

</p>
<p>and Herzegovina had recently received under the individual communications procedures of

<p>number of activities in the process, including the action plan for children and amendments 
</p>
<p>to the Law on the Ombudsman, which would be submitted to parliament in early 2015. The 
</p>
<p>latter would include the creation of a national preventive mechanism and an increase in the 
</p>
<p>independence of the Ombudsman institution, in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>Technical amendments to the Anti-Discrimination Law would improve the procedures for 
</p>
<p>protection from discrimination. She noted the many judgements under that law in the past 
</p>
<p>years. 
</p>
<p>67. The Assistant Minister also noted the elimination in the majority of municipalities of 
</p>
<p>the problem of birth registration of Roma children, with the assistance of the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, 
</p>
<p>and amendments to the legislation. In relation to street children and their social exclusion 
</p>
<p>and exploitation, the Ministry had initiated research and created local teams and a number 
</p>
<p>of day-care centres to support both the children and their families. The Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina and entity Governments had adopted plans and activities, in cooperation with 
</p>
<p>the NGOs, with the aim of ensuring support for victims of domestic violence. </p>

</p>
<p>rights had been prepared and the Assistant Minister also noted that there was legislation in 
</p>
<p>place to protect persons of various sexual orientations. The Ministry was seeking to 
</p>
<p>improve practices in that area. Both the Council for Children and the Council for Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities had continued their work. 
</p>
<p>69. The delegation referred to the measures taken to implement CRPD since the last 
</p>
<p>review, including the creation of the Association of Persons with Disabilities, which 
</p>
<p>monitors policy at the State and entity levels. Both entities have laws to stimulate 
</p>
<p>employment. Measures included financial incentives for employers and support for self-
</p>
<p>employment. All strategies related to employment took into account persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities as one of the target groups. Other policies, including those in education, also 
</p>
<p>targeted that group. Bosnia and Herzegovina had made progress with regard to the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, but would re-examine issues raised in the interactive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>70. The representative of the Ministry of Justice of Bosnia and Herzegovina noted the 
</p>
<p>importance of the case of Sejdi&#263;<i> and Finci</i>. Although the issue had not been resolved,

<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina had taken some measures for enforcing the decision of the court, 
</p>
<p>including the creation of a commission, which was to prepare the draft constitutional and 
</p>
<p>legislative amendments. Unfortunately, no agreement had been reached, but the work had 
</p>
<p>continued and the working group for drafting the amendment to the Election Law had not 
</p>
<p>yet submitted its report. 
</p>
<p>71. The delegation referred to the training of judges and prosecutors, which was carried 
</p>
<p>out by the entity judicial and prosecutorial training centres and which covered a wide range 
</p>
<p>of topics. Other projects covered the training of prison staff. 
</p>
<p>72. The head of the delegation regretted that there had not been time to provide verbal 
</p>
<p>answers to all the questions raised in the interactive dialogue, but stressed that written 
</p>
<p>answers on the achievements and plans of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be made 
</p>
<p>available. 
</p>
<p>73. Iceland echoed concerns raised by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination regarding hate speech and discrimination on grounds of ethnicity and race.

</p>
<p>encouraged further efforts against human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>74. Indonesia welcomed the accession to core international instruments, good 
</p>
<p>cooperation and the standing invitation to special procedures. It believed that a national

</p>
<p>Herzegovina to accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child on a communications procedure.

</p>
<p>standing invitation issued to special procedures. It expressed concern regarding the limited 
</p>
<p>cooperation with treaty bodies; the fragmented implementation of policies; and the low rate 
</p>
<p>of prosecution and conviction of alleged perpetrators of war crimes, especially as regards 
</p>
<p>sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>77. Italy welcomed the accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the core international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments; the lack of use of the death penalty; and the steps to combat </p>


<p>corruption, organized crime and human trafficking through related strategies and action
