Eagle Rock Reports Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results
HOUSTON - Eagle Rock Energy Partners, L.P. (“Eagle Rock” or the “Partnership”) (NASDAQ:
EROC) today announced its unaudited financial results for the three months ended June 30,
2015.
Second Quarter 2015 Highlights
•
•
Announced the Merger Agreement with Vanguard Natural Resources, LLC (“Vanguard”) on May
21, 2015
Average daily production during the quarter was 83.1 MMcfe/d, a 4.4% increase over first quarter
2015
Adjusted EBITDA of $25.7 million for the second quarter, compared to $25.5 million for the first
quarter, as higher production volumes were partially offset by lower realized natural gas and
NGL prices
•Distributable cash flow of $12.5 million, equivalent to $0.082/unit
•Announced a distribution of $0.07/unit for the second quarter, or $0.28/unit annualized
Distribution coverage of 1.17x Distributable Cash Flow for the second quarter; expect to be at or
above 1.0x distribution coverage for the full year 2015
Sold remaining Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”) units and exited the position, reducing
the leverage ratio to 1.2x LTM Adjusted EBITDA as of June 30, 2015
•Total liquidity of $176 million as of June 30, 2015
•
•
•
Joseph A. Mills, the Partnership's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Eagle Rock
had a strong second quarter, increasing our daily production by 4% over our first quarter volumes
and increasing our distributable cash flow per unit by 4% as compared to the first quarter. We
sold the remaining ETP units we obtained from the sale of our Midstream Business in 2014 (the
“Midstream Business Contribution”), which generated total aggregate proceeds of $197.8 million,
thus reducing our leverage to 1.2x LTM Adjusted EBITDA.”
Mills added, “Our unitholder vote to approve the previously announced merger with a subsidiary
of Vanguard is set to occur on Thursday, September 17th.  Pending unitholder approval, we
expect to close the merger soon thereafter.”
Merger Transaction Highlights
Vanguard and Eagle Rock announced on May 21, 2015 that they have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which a subsidiary of Vanguard will merge into Eagle
Rock. As a result of the transaction, Eagle Rock will become a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary
of Vanguard. The transaction, which has been approved by the board of directors of both
companies, will be a tax-free unit-for-unit transaction with an exchange ratio of 0.185 Vanguard
common units per Eagle Rock common unit. Eagle Rock and Vanguard will coordinate to ensure
that each Eagle Rock unitholder receives, either from Eagle Rock or Vanguard, a distribution for
each month leading up to the merger. Vanguard and Eagle Rock have set their respective
unitholder meetings to occur on Thursday, September 17, 2015 and expect the transaction to
close soon thereafter. The merger
is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval by both the Vanguard and
Eagle Rock unitholders of record as of August 6, 2015.
Second Quarter 2015 Financial and Operating Results
Significant results from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Adjusted EBITDA of $25.7 million, compared to $25.5 million for first quarter 2015, as higher
production volumes, lower G&A and higher realized oil prices were offset by lower natural gas
and NGL prices.
Distributable Cash Flow of $12.5 million or $0.082/unit, a 4% increase compared to $0.079/unit
for first quarter 2015.
Participated in 13 gross (1.2 net) non-operated wells and conducted one gross (0.6 net) capital
workover in the Mid-Continent region.
Total production was 7.57 Bcfe, compared to 7.17 Bcfe in first quarter 2015. Average daily
production was 83.1 MMcfe/d, compared to 79.7 MMcfe/d in first quarter.
•Oil production increased 5% quarter over quarter from 349 MBbl to 368 MBbl.
•NGL production increased 3% quarter over quarter from 327 MBbl to 336 MBbl.
•Natural gas production increased 8% quarter over quarter from 3.11 Bcf to 3.34 Bcf.
Realized a 1.2 MMcfe/d increase quarter over quarter from Mid-Continent non-operated new
well completions and prior period adjustments.
The overall increase in production volumes was primarily driven by strong performance from a
full quarter’s contribution from three high working interest operated Golden Trend wells that
came on-line late in the first quarter and from recently completed third party operated wells in the
Woodford “SCOOP” play that came on-line during the second quarter.
Big Escambia Creek (“BEC”) Plant runtime in the second quarter was 97%, which included
completing the previously disclosed and scheduled April turnaround ahead of plan. Impact of
the BEC turnaround on production volumes during the quarter amounted to approximately 2.3
MMcfe/d of deferred production and increased operating expenses by $3.4 million.
Product revenue of $33.2 million, compared to $29.5 million for first quarter 2015, due to higher
oil prices and higher production volumes. Oil revenue increased by $4.9 million, or 37%, over
the first quarter, due primarily to a 30% increase in our realized oil price, and also due to our 5%
increase in oil production for the quarter.
Realized commodity derivative gains of $13.1 million, compared to $14.4 million for first quarter
2015, due to higher oil prices.
Cash distributions of $1.0 million received on the ETP common units held by the Partnership,
•
•
•
•
•compared to $2.1 million in first quarter 2015, due to the sale of ETP units by the Partnership
during the quarter.
Operating expenses, including taxes, of $14.1 million, 23% higher than first quarter, primarily
due to the scheduled BEC turnaround project, and partially offset by lower than expected ad
valorem taxes.
General and administrative expenses, excluding merger-related costs of $2.6 million (also
excluding amortization of expenses pursuant to the Partnership’s Amended & Restated Long-
Term Incentive Plan), were $7.6 million for the second quarter 2015, down 16% compared to first
quarter 2015 and in line with management’s target run-rate of $7.3 - $7.7 million per quarter.
Operating loss of $20.2 million as compared to operating income of $15.0 million for first quarter
2015 (excluding an impairment charge of $68.3 million), primarily due to a $25 million loss on
•
•
unrealized commodity derivatives as compared to an $8 million gain on unrealized commodity
derivatives in the first quarter.
•Net Loss of $23.4 million.
Maintenance capital expenditures of $10.1 million, as compared to $10.3 million spent in the first
quarter 2015.
•
ETP Unit Sale
As of June 30, 2015, the Partnership had sold all of its ETP units received as part of the
consideration for the Midstream Business Contribution. Aggregate proceeds from sales of RGP
and ETP units were approximately $197.8 million in addition to aggregate distributions of $11.2
million. Proceeds have been used to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes.
Capitalization and Liquidity Update
As of June 30, 2015, the Partnership’s borrowing base under its senior secured credit facility
totaled $270 million, and based on outstanding borrowings, the Partnership had approximately
$176 million of availability under its senior secured credit facility.
As of June 30, 2015, the Partnership had 152.8 million common units outstanding and eligible to
receive the distribution, including 3.3 million unvested restricted common units issued under the
Partnership’s Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The Partnership has not repurchased any of its units since its last update as of February 23,
2015. The common unit repurchase program of up to $100 million is still in effect until March
2016, and Eagle Rock has repurchased 8.6 million units to date for total consideration of $22
million.
Hedging Update
The Partnership employs risk mitigation strategies to protect its cash flows and reduce volatility in
cash flows from commodity price fluctuations. One important risk mitigation strategy is the use of
commodity price hedging to stabilize cash flows. The Partnership’s current hedge portfolio has
an estimated mark-to-market value of approximately $104 million. As of July 29, 2015, the
Partnership’s estimated hedge profile is as follows:

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This news release and the accompanying schedules include the non-generally accepted
accounting principles, or non-GAAP, financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable
Cash Flow. The accompanying non-GAAP financial measures schedules (after the financial
schedules) provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly
comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered alternatives
to GAAP measures such as net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows from operating
activities or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance.
Eagle Rock defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus or (minus) income tax provision
(benefit); interest-net, including (gains) and losses from interest rate risk management
instruments that settled during the period and other expense; depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense; impairment expense; other operating and general and administrative
expense, non-recurring, including certain expenses incurred in connection with our potential
merger with Vanguard; other non-cash operating and general and administrative expenses,
including non-cash compensation related to our equity-based compensation program; (gains)
and losses on commodity and interest rate risk management related instruments; gains and
(losses) from risk management instruments that settled during the period; (gains) losses on non-
cash mark-to-market imbalances; (gains) losses on discontinued operations; losses on short-term
investments; and other (income), excluding distributions received on short-term investments.
Eagle Rock uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of its core profitability to assess the financial
performance of its assets. Adjusted EBITDA also is used as a supplemental financial measure by
external users of Eagle Rock's financial statements such as investors, commercial banks and
research analysts. For example, the Partnership's lenders under its revolving credit facility use a
variant of its Adjusted EBITDA in a compliance covenant designed to measure the viability of
Eagle Rock and its ability to perform under the terms of the revolving credit facility; Eagle Rock,
therefore, uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure its compliance with its revolving credit facility.
Eagle Rock believes that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures
that its management uses in evaluating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is useful in determining
Eagle Rock's ability to sustain or increase distributions. By excluding unrealized derivative gains
(losses), a non-cash, mark-to-market benefit (charge) which represents the change in fair market
value of the Partnership's executed derivative instruments and is independent of its assets'
performance or cash flow generating ability, Eagle Rock believes Adjusted EBITDA reflects the
Partnership's ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support its level of
indebtedness, make cash distributions to its unitholders and finance its maintenance capital
expenditures. Eagle Rock further believes that Adjusted EBITDA also portrays the underlying
performance of its operating assets by isolating the performance of its operating assets from the
impact of an unrealized, non-cash measure designed to portray the fluctuating inherent value of a
financial asset. Similarly, by excluding the impact of non-recurring discontinued operations,
Adjusted EBITDA provides users of the Partnership's financial statements a picture of its current
assets' cash generation ability, independently from that of assets which are no longer a part of its
operations.
Eagle Rock's Adjusted EBITDA definition may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA or
similarly titled measures of other entities, as other entities may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in
the same manner as Eagle Rock. Eagle Rock has reconciled Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP
financial measure of net income (loss) at the end of this release.
Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense, income taxes or depreciation and
amortization expense. Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations, interest
expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate net income. Because we
use capital assets, depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs.
Therefore, any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations. To compensate
for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider both net income (loss) and net
cash flows provided by operating activities determined under GAAP, as well as Adjusted
EBITDA, to evaluate
our performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net
income, operating income, cash flows provided by operating activities or any other measure of
financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
Distributable Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus: (i) maintenance capital
expenditures; (ii) cash interest expense; (iii) cash income taxes; and (iv) the addition of losses or
subtraction of gains relating to other miscellaneous non-cash amounts affecting net income (loss)
for the period. Maintenance capital expenditures represent capital expenditures necessary to
maintain the Partnership's production. We estimate these amounts based on current projections
and expectations, and do not undertake to adjust any historical amounts based on the actual
impact of such expenditures on production. As a result, the included amount of maintenance
capital expenditures could fail to maintain production if actual performance does not meet the
Partnership’s projections and expectations, including, without limitation, on account of: (i)
unanticipated mechanical issues; (ii) unanticipated delays; (iii) poorer than expected production
performance of the Partnership’s new wells and recompletions; and/or (iv) unanticipated loss of,
or higher than anticipated decline in, existing production.
Distributable Cash Flow is a performance metric used by senior management to compare cash
flows generated by the Partnership (excluding growth capital expenditures and prior to the
establishment of any retained cash reserves by the Board of Directors) to the cash distributions
expected to be paid to unitholders. Using this metric, management can quickly compute the
coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions. This financial measure also
is important to investors as an indicator of whether the Partnership is generating cash flow at a
level that can sustain, or support an increase in, quarterly distribution rates. Actual distributions
are set by the Board of Directors.
The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Distributable Cash Flow is net income (loss).
Eagle Rock's Distributable Cash Flow definition may not be comparable to Distributable Cash
Flow or similarly titled measures of other entities, as other entities may not calculate Distributable
Cash Flow (and Adjusted EBITDA, on which it builds) in the same manner as Eagle Rock. Eagle
Rock has reconciled Distributable Cash Flow to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss)
at the end of this release.
