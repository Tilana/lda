<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This addendum to the High Commissioner&#8217;s report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/22/35) contains issues of concern related to international humanitarian law and 
human rights law in the context of the escalation of hostilities of 14 to 21 November 2012 
(hereinafter &#8220;the crisis&#8221;). With regard to the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), the following 
issues are addressed: killing of civilians; destruction of residences; destruction of other 
civilian property; attacks against media; destruction of medical facilities; destruction of 
other infrastructure; and humanitarian access. With regard to Palestinian armed groups and 
the De Facto Authorities (DFA), the following issues are addressed: indiscriminate attacks 
on Israel; the targeting of civilians; the launching of attacks from populated areas; rockets 
launched by Palestinian armed groups that fell within the Gaza Strip; and the execution of 
alleged collaborators.  
</p>
<p>2. It is noted that while the OHCHR office in the occupied Palestinian territory 
(OHCHR oPt) is mandated to monitor the human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory 
(oPt), it does not have such a mandate relating to the State of Israel. As such, OHCHR oPt 
is not in position to directly monitor or document the consequences of possible violations 
of international human rights and international humanitarian law within Israel.  
</p>
<p>3. It is also noted that OHCHR oPt shared its findings related to several cases 
contained in this addendum with the IDF, with a request for clarification and comments. No 
response was received at the time of writing. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>4. On 14 November at about 16:00, the IDF launched an airstrike targeting Ahmad El 
Ja&#8217;abari, the commander of the military wing of Hamas, the Izz El Din El Qassam 
</p>
<p>Brigades. The attack marked the beginning of a new military operation by the IDF in Gaza 
- Operation Pillar of Cloud/Pillar of Defence.1 A ceasefire was announced on 21 November.  
</p>
<p>5. The week leading up to the crisis was marked by flare ups of violence. Four Israeli 
soldiers were reportedly injured on 10 November, when Palestinian armed groups fired an 
anti-tank missile at an Israeli military vehicle on the Israeli side of the fence, east of Al-
Shojayaa2. From 10 to 12 November, the IDF targeted several locations in Gaza, including 
a residential neighbourhood in the east of Al-Shojayya, with strikes. In an incident on 10 
November, four Palestinian civilians, including two children, were killed and over 40 
Palestinians were injured. Prior to the crisis, according to Israel&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign 
</p>
<p>Affairs, Palestinian armed groups had fired approximately 800 rockets and mortar shells 
toward Israel between January and November 2012. Also according to the Israeli Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, more than 120 such rockets were launched between 10 and 14 
November 2012.3 
</p>
<p>  
 1 In Hebrew, the term &#8220;Pillar of Cloud&#8221; was used throughout the crisis. &#8220;Pillar of Defence&#8221; was 
</p>
<p>introduced in English.

</p>
<p>6. During the crisis, 174 Palestinians were killed in Gaza. At least 168 of them were 
killed by Israeli military action, of whom 101 are believed to be civilians, including 33 
children and 13 women. Hundreds of persons were injured.4 Six civilians, including one 
woman and three children, may have been killed by rockets fired by Palestinian armed 
groups that landed in Gaza. In the context of the crisis, six Israelis, including four civilians, 
were reportedly killed, and 239 Israelis, including 219 civilians, were reportedly injured.5   
</p>
<p>7. According to the IDF6, Israel conducted over 1500 air strikes on Gaza. In addition, 
seven strikes by the Israeli Navy and 360 Mortar shells, all of which were recorded by the 
United Nations, were fired by Israel on Gaza. Palestinian armed groups fired 765 
homemade rockets, 741 long-range Grad rockets, and 135 mortar shells at Israel during the 
crisis7. For the first time, a number of rockets fired from Gaza reached Tel Aviv and 
Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p>8. During the first few days of the crisis, IDF airstrikes appeared to be focused on open 
areas and fields that were allegedly used to launch rocket attacks against Israel, training 
sites belonging to the Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, and other apparent military 
objectives. Thereafter, the IDF also targeted buildings and installations of the DFA, such as 
police stations, buildings housing civilian ministries, and other de facto governmental 
installations, objects which are <i>prima facie</i> considered civilian in nature. In the last few 
days of the operation, residential buildings and areas were also attacked, resulting in a 
significant increase in civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p>9. In gathering information during and after the crisis, OHCHR noted concerns with 
regard to the conduct of hostilities. Such concerns relate to all actors to the conflict. 
Throughout the crisis, airstrikes by the IDF targeted and damaged farmlands, residences, 
other civilian property, and other infrastructure, in the course of which civilians lost their 
lives and were injured. Hospitals and schools were damaged. Some of OHCHR&#8217;s concerns 
related to the apparent failure of the IDF to respect the principles of distinction, 
proportionality and precautions, as required by international humanitarian law. In cases in 
which military objectives were targeted, the possible failure to take all necessary 
precautions, including by providing effective advance warning, and take all feasible 
measures to assess whether an attack would respect the principle of proportionality were

</p>
<p>OHCHR for which Palestinian and Israeli organizations provided data. According to a news article 
the IDF estimates the number of Palestinians killed at 177, including approximately 120 combatants, 
and the number of injuries including an unspecified number of civilians at 900. Gaza&#8217;s ministry of 
</p>
<p>health estimates the number of Palestinians killed at 189, and persons injured at 1526. No details on 
casualties of civilians are provided by the ministry of health. For IDF figures see Times of Israel,

<p>noted. Concerns were also noted in relation to incidents in which media offices were 
destroyed and members of the media killed and injured.  
</p>
<p>10. While some of the projectiles fired by the Palestinian armed groups at Israel appear 
to have been directed at military objectives8, the indiscriminate nature of the vast majority 
of these projectiles raises serious concerns under international humanitarian and human 
rights law. Further, some Palestinian armed groups clearly or indirectly stated that their 
intended targets were civilians or large population centres in Israel,9 or objects that are 
<i>prima facie</i> civilian objects, such as Israel&#8217;s parliament,10 in clear violation of international 
humanitarian law. Rockets were launched from densely populated areas, in contravention 
of customary international humanitarian law.11 In addition, seven Palestinian men detained 
by the de facto authorities for allegedly having collaborated with Israel were summarily 
executed, in public, by unknown armed persons, in clear violation of international 
humanitarian and human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Issues of concern in relation to international humanitarian 
law and human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Israel Defence Forces 
</b></p>
<p>11. OHCHR&#8217;s findings raise a number of concerns with regard to the IDF&#8217;s respect for 
the basic rules on the conduct of hostilities, including distinction, proportionality and 
precautions in attack. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Killing of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>12. In a number of cases, civilians who happened to be present in or passing through 
open areas and fields, locations that could potentially be used for rocket launches, were 
killed. The cases mentioned below raise the question of whether the IDF took all feasible 
measures to verify that their targets were military objectives, in line with the principle of 
distinction under international humanitarian law, which requires that t<i>he parties to a 
conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants </i>. Under 
international human rights law these cases may constitute violations of the right to life.  
</p>
<p>13. On 19 November, a father, his 12-year-old daughter, and his 19-year-old son were 
allegedly killed by a drone missile while collecting spearmint in a farm adjacent to their 
house in Ahmad Yassin Street, north of Gaza City. Information collected by OHCHR 
indicates that the victims were farmers. In a similar case, on 21 November, an 84-year-old 
man working on his olive farm and his 14-year-old granddaughter were killed by a missile 
that landed in their farm, east of Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip. Information received

<p>by OHCHR indicates that in neither case were residents warned prior to the attack, and that 
no militant activities were carried out from the attacked locations throughout the crisis.12 
</p>
<p>14. On 19 November, two civilians, including a boy, were walking next to a field on a 
paved road in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, when a missile hit them, killing them 
instantly. A three-year-old girl was injured in the same incident. Witnesses reported that 
that airstrike was the only one that occurred in the area during the crisis. On the same day, 
two farmers and a school guard were travelling in a truck reportedly carrying tomatoes in 
Dier El Balah, central Gaza Strip, when an Israeli airstrike hit their truck, killing the three 
of them. Information gathered by OHCHR indicates that the IDF had been launching 
attacks on the surrounding areas prior to this attack.13 On 21 November, an 8-year-old boy 
was killed and five other children as well as an 80-year-old man were injured, in an 
airstrike in Zaitoun area, Gaza City. The children were reportedly playing in the privately-
owned courtyard when the missile hit. 
</p>
<p>15. On at least one occasion, access of ambulances to victims was not granted for hours. 
On 20 November, two 16-year-old boys were killed, allegedly by a drone missile, while 
hunting birds in an open area located approximately 700 meters away from the fence, east 
of Rafah, southern Gaza Strip. Relatives of the victims reported that the IDF did not grant 
access to the ambulances to retrieve the bodies for at least five hours.14 International 
humanitarian law prohibits the IDF from arbitrarily denying the access of medical staff to 
people injured in hostilities. On 17 November, the IDF targeted a 31-year-old civilian in 
Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, who was attempting to rescue three persons who had been hit 
and killed by a missile that struck a farm just a few minutes prior.15 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Destruction of residences and incidental killing of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>16.  The IDF targeted residential buildings and properties during the last few days of the 
crisis, with some reports estimating that a total of 382 residences were destroyed or 
sustained severe damages due to Israeli attacks.16 In certain cases, attacks on residences 
resulted in casualties among civilians. The targeting of residences is a violation of the 
principle of distinction as they are civilian objects. However, if a residence is used in a way 
that makes an effective contribution to the military action and whose destruction or 
neutralisation offers a definite military advantage, then it loses its civilian character, 
qualifies as a military objective and is liable to attack. A member of an armed group present 
in the residence can be a legitimate military objective. Nevertheless, attacks in such 
circumstances still have to respect the rules on the conduct of hostilities, especially those 
regarding distinction, proportionality and precautions in attacks. Residences that have been 
vacated, even following warnings, by members of an armed group &#8211; if these members were 
the military target, no longer constitute a legitimate military objective. 
</p>
<p>17. On 18 November, an Israeli air strike without prior warning hit a three-storey house 
belonging to the Al-Dalou family in Al-Nasser neighbourhood, central Gaza City. The 
airstrike killed 12 people, five of whom were children and four were women.  Ten of those 
killed belonged to one family. Israel alleged that a member of the Al-Dalou family was

</b></p>
<p>affiliated with the Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades.17 The location where the incident took 
place is a heavily populated area. Two of the persons killed were neighbours, while a 
number of other neighbours were injured.18 Even if one member of the Al-Dalou family 
was affiliated with an armed group, and therefore potentially a legitimate military target, an 
attack under the given circumstances with the large number of civilians present, would not 
meet the requirement of proportionality, i.e., the anticipated concrete and direct military 
gain from the attack would not outweigh the anticipated civilian loss.  
</p>
<p>18. In a similar case, on 19 November an Israeli airstrike hit a four-story house 
belonging to the Azzam family in Al-Shojayaa&#8217;, east of Gaza City. This airstrike killed four 
persons, two women and two children, and injured at least 25 civilians, including 22 
children. Witnesses stated that the IDF was likely targeting a member of the Azzam family, 
allegedly affiliated with the Islamic Jihad, who was reportedly living with his family on the 
second floor of the house. A phone call by the IDF to the alleged member of the armed 
group, perceived to be an advance warning, was immediately followed by at least two small 
missiles hitting the house, and shortly thereafter the house of the Abu-Zoor family, often 
referred to as warning missiles or &#8220;roof knocking&#8221;.  In the less than 10 minutes that 
</p>
<p>reportedly followed, prior to the principal attack on the house, the alleged member of the 
armed group tried to inform family members and neighbours of the imminent attack. It is 
doubtful whether the 10 minutes provided constituted an effective warning. A number of 
Azzam family members were injured while evacuating their houses, though the majority of 
those killed and injured were members of the Abu-Zoor family who were residing in 
houses located at the backside of the targeted house. Only one out of several of Abu-Zoor 
family houses was warned.19 Given that the alleged member of Islamic Jihad was no longer 
in the house at the time of the attack, this incident raises questions regarding Israel&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>respect for the basic rule of distinction, if the objective of the attack was solely militants 
residing there, and also regarding the basic rules of proportionality and precautions if the 
house itself was the intended military objective. 
</p>
<p>19. On 17 November, a woman was killed by a missile while she was at home in 
Khuzaa, east of Khan Younis. On 18 November in Al-Shojaaya, east of Gaza City, a rocket 
hit a house killing a 19-year-old woman and seriously injuring her mother. A further three 
people who were in the area when the attack occurred were killed, while at least 14 people, 
including five children, were injured. The targeted house is located in a heavily populated 
area that is also full of commercial activities.20 On 19 November, a father and his two 
children were killed when an Israeli missile hit their house, which was located in the centre 
of Jabalia, north of Gaza City. Seven members of the same family were injured. Also on 19 
November, an airstrike hit a house east of Rafah City, southern Gaza Strip, killing one child 
and one adult. In these four cases, the houses were either completely destroyed or sustained 
serious damages, and no advance warning was given.21 OHCHR, while gathering 
information, was not able to identify any military objective that the IDF might have had in 
these cases, thus raising concerns with regard to possible violations of the principle of 
distinction and potentially also the right to life.

</p>
<p><b> 3. Destruction of other civilian property 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the crisis civilian properties other than residences, such as farms and 
businesses, also sustained damages or were destroyed as a result of IDF attacks. While 
some of these were the result of direct hits by airstrikes, others were the result of being 
located next to or close to targeted areas. This again raises questions whether the basic 
principles of distinction, proportionality, and precautions were fulfilled. The overall loss 
and damage inflicted on the agricultural sector is estimated at USD 20 million.22 
</p>
<p>21. On 15 November, an Israeli airstrike hit a mosque in the Al-Zaitoun area, east of 
Gaza City. The airstrike completely destroyed the mosque, damaged a nearby house and 
injured one person. In addition, 17 camels from a neighbouring farm were killed and the 
remaining seven injured due to the airstrike. OHCHR did not obtain any information that 
would allow for the conclusion that a military objective was targeted. On 19 and 21 
November, two warehouses belonging to Alaska production and distribution chocolate 
company, in Al-Tufah neighbourhood, eastern Gaza, sustained major damages when Israeli 
aircraft targeted neighbouring open areas. Both warehouses were fully stocked when the 
attacks took place.23 
</p>
<p>22. The IDF regularly claimed during the crisis that open areas were being used to 
launch rockets, including from underground tunnels, and were therefore legitimate military 
targets.24 Even if such claims were accurate, the IDF remains obliged to take all feasible 
precautionary measures to avoid or minimize damage to civilian objects. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Media 
</b></p>
<p>23. During the crisis the IDF attacked several media offices and journalists in Gaza 
City. Such attacks killed two cameramen travelling in a car marked as a press vehicle, and 
injured at least eight journalists. On 20 November at around 17.00, two cameramen from Al 
Aqsa TV station were targeted on Al-Shifa street, while in a vehicle marked with &#8220;TV,&#8221; 
after having finished filming at Shifa hospital.25 An Israeli Government spokesman 
described the two cameramen as &quot;people who have relevance to terror activity,&quot; explaining 
that both Al Aqsa and Al Quds TV stations &quot;are integral parts of terrorist military 
organizations.&quot;26 The blog of the IDF stated that the two were &#8220;Hamas operatives&#8221; and 
cameramen for al-Aqsa TV, which &#8220;regularly features programming that encourages and 
praises attacks on Israeli civilians.&#8221;27 The IDF, however, did not provide information 
specifying that the two men were members of an armed group or that they were directly 
participating in the hostilities, raising serious doubts as to whether they had lost their 
protection as civilians. 
</p>
<p>24. On 18 November at around 1:30 in the morning, the IDF targeted the roof of the 
Shawa and Husari building in Gaza City with at least four missiles. The 11th floor office

<p>situated below the targeted roof, where at least three missiles hit, was used by the Al Quds 
TV channel. Seven journalists were injured due to the attack, two of them seriously. No 
advance warning of the attack was provided. Later the same morning, at around 7:00, two 
missiles hit the 15th floor of the Shorouk media building housing, among others, the Al 
Aqsa TV channel.28 One of the missiles hit the Al Aqsa TV antenna on the roof and badly 
damaged the studio itself, which had been evacuated following the attack on the Shawa and 
Husari Tower.29 The IDF claimed that its strikes on the two media buildings targeted 
&#8220;Hamas operational communication sites,&#8221; in particular communication equipment on the 
roof, in order &#8220;to disrupt the internal communications of Hamas who were using the 
</p>
<p>equipment on these buildings to direct attacks against Israeli civilians&#8221;.30 Lacking further 
justification by the IDF as to how the targets contributed to military action and how the 
attacks offered a military advantage, these attacks may amount to violations of international 
humanitarian law. In addition, such attacks could amount to violations of the right to 
freedom of expression. On 19 November at around 15:30, the third floor of the same 
building was hit in a separate attack. The strike, according to the IDF, targeted a group of 
Palestinian militants.31 The person killed in that strike was identified as a media officer with 
Saraya Al-Quds32, the military wing of Islamic Jihad.  Two other persons were injured. 
According to various reports,33 international journalists were told by the IDF to leave the 
building prior to this attack. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Destruction of medical facilities 
</b></p>
<p>25. During the hostilities, according to various sources,34 13 primary health care centres 
were partially damaged due to indirect shelling. Nine of these centres were administered by 
the DFA Ministry of Health (MoH) and four by UNRWA.35 The Palestine Red Crescent 
Society Emergency Medical Services station, the Central Archive of the MoH, and the 
DFA Department of the Medical Commission also sustained damages.36 
</p>
<p>26. At least three hospitals, including the Jordanian Military Field hospital in Gaza City, 
the Gaza European hospital and the Beit Hanoun hospital were hit in attacks by the IDF. On 
19 November at 22.20, a missile hit the roof of the Jordanian Military Field hospital and 
penetrated two floors.37 Nobody was injured, yet some oxygen pipes were damaged, 
thereby impacting on the hospital&#8217;s capacity to serve patients. On 20 November at 22:00, 
Beit Hanoun hospital in the northern Gaza Strip was reportedly hit by two artillery shells of

<p>the type meant to illuminate the area. Neither exploded.38 One of the shells hit the roof of 
the patient building, which was at that time accommodating around 15 patients, and then 
dropped into the hospital&#8217;s yard. No injuries were recorded. However, the shells caused 
</p>
<p>minor damages to water pipes and the roof. Neither of the hospitals was given an advance 
warning. 
</p>
<p>27. International humanitarian law provides that civilian hospitals may in no 
circumstances be the object of attack and that, if they are used to commit acts harmful to 
the enemy, such protection shall only cease &#8220;after due warning has been given, naming, in 
all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained 
unheeded.&#8221;39 The attacks on the hospitals could therefore amount to violations of 
international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Destruction of other infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p>28. On 20 November after midnight, a missile hit and caused severe damage to the 
headquarters of the National Islamic Bank in Gaza City, which occupies one and a half 
stories of a four-story building.40 The IDF claimed that it had targeted &#8220;a bank used to 
finance Hamas operatives&#8221;.41 However, the IDF did not provide any specific information on 
how the bank may have been making an effective contribution to military action and how 
the destruction of the building offered a concrete and direct military advantage. The 
management of the bank clarified that the DFA is one of its clients, and that the salaries of 
the DFA&#8217;s officials are paid through the National Islamic Bank. The bank, however, claims 
</p>
<p>not to be owned by the DFA. Based on the information gathered by OHCHR, the bank is a 
civilian object and was not a legitimate military target42.  
</p>
<p>29. Two stadiums, eight sports clubs, and the DFA&#8217;s ministry of youth, sport and culture 
buildings were reportedly damaged or destroyed. The DFA ministry estimates that the 
damages to the sports infrastructure caused by IDF airstrikes are around USD 3,654,40043. 
Information gathered by OHCHR suggests that the al-Yarmouk Stadium in Gaza City was 
attacked and extensively damaged during an airstrike on 21 November. The Palestine 
Stadium, also in Gaza City, was completely destroyed during at least three airstrikes 
conducted by the IDF on different days. While no warning specifically relating to the 
planned attacks on the stadium was provided by the IDF to the residents of the area, some 
residents left fearing further airstrikes. In the course of the airstrikes one person sustained a 
light injury and the showroom of a bamboo furniture company located next to the stadium 
and several cars parked in the street were damaged. The IDF claimed that it had attacked 
the Palestine Stadium &#8220;after receiving verified information of a launch from within the 
</p>
<p>stadium&#8221;. An Israeli army spokeswoman tweeted44 that rockets had been fired from the 
stadium three days before Israel had bombed it. The IDF added that &#8220;in an effort to warn 
the residents and innocent bystanders and keep them away from strikes&#8221; they were at that

<p>the civilians.&#8221;45 These messages were, however, general in nature, raising concerns as to 
whether they were effective in terms of providing advance warning on attacks. According 
to eyewitnesses interviewed by OHCHR, at least twice rockets were launched from a street 
south of the Palestine Stadium. The same sources noted that the stadium&#8217;s fence was too 
</p>
<p>high and the stadium ground still guarded by security guards, and therefore the stadium 
itself was not used to launch rockets. However, other sources indicated that rockets were 
indeed fired from the stadium.   
</p>
<p>30. Early morning on 21 November, Israeli airstrikes struck two bridges, damaging 
severely the coastal bridge connecting Gaza City and the central Gaza Strip, and the Al-
Sikka bridge, connecting Al-Nussairat refugee camp and al-Mughraqa village. According 
to UNDP, the costs of rehabilitation of both bridges are estimated at 586,000 USD.46 As a 
result of the attack on the Al-Sikka bridge, a main water pipeline, which supplies drinking 
water to residents of three camps, was damaged. This left around 20,000 people without 
running water for about a week.47 OHCHR did not find any information to suggest that the 
bridges constituted legitimate military objectives.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Other humanitarian issues 
</b></p>
<p>31. The escalation of hostilities affected civilians&#8217; access to shelter, education, food, 
medical care, and utilities, thereby increasing humanitarian concerns. The partial or 
complete destruction of at least 38248 residences displaced more than 2300 persons. A large 
number of these families were still being sheltered by their relatives at the time of writing.49 
At least 240 educational facilities were damaged. Twenty-five schools sustained major 
damages due to indirect shelling.50 The functioning of some health facilities in Gaza was 
interrupted due to damages inflicted on them as a result of Israeli airstrikes, as noted. In 
addition to the three hospitals and 13 primary health care centres that suffered minor 
damages due to indirect shelling, 51 Israeli airstrikes endangered the life of ambulance 
drivers transferring the injured and dead. Three drivers were injured when transferring 
victims and six ambulances sustained damages due to Israeli airstrikes.

Ashkelon, Israel, with two Grad rockets the prior day.53 Also on 15 November, the military 
wing of the Islamic Jihad, Saraya El Quds (Al-Quds Brigades), revealed that it had targeted 
Tel Aviv with a Fajr 5 rocket, and claimed that the attack had inflicted damages to the 
city&#8217;s communication network and forced the closure of Ben Gurion Airport.54 
</p>
<p>33. Official Israeli sources reported that Palestinian armed groups fired over 1500 
rockets at Israel in the period from 14 to 21 November.55 A number of these rockets 
reached, for the first time, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, targeting for example Israel&#8217;s 
parliament56. According to Israeli sources, in the context of the crisis a total of six Israelis, 
including 4 civilians,57 were killed, and a further 239, including 219 civilians, were 
injured.58 In one incident that took place on 15 November, three Israeli civilians, including a 
woman, were killed when a Palestinian rocket hit an apartment building in Kiryat Malachi, 
a town in Israel&#8217;s southern district.59 The same day Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades

<p>injuries.62 The same day, Saraya El Quds of Islamic Jihad announced that it had attacked 
Israeli cities, including Eshkol, with tens of rockets and mortars.63 
</p>
<p>35. Numerous rockets also hit Israeli residential buildings. An estimated 80 Israeli 
houses were either destroyed or sustained damages as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks 
during the crisis.  
</p>
<p>36. While some projectiles were directed at military objectives, many, if not the vast 
majority of the Palestinian attacks on Israel constituted indiscriminate attacks. Such attacks 
violate international humanitarian law. Most rockets fired by the armed groups did not 
seem to be directed at a specific military objective. Furthermore, many Palestinian armed 
groups directly and indirectly indicated their determination to &#8211; and took responsibility for 
&#8211; attacks on Israeli civilians or large population centres in Israel. Such acts clearly violate 
international humanitarian law, namely the principle of distinction. In addition, such acts 
could also have the aim of spreading terror among the civilian population, which would 
further violate international humanitarian law. While certain Palestinian armed actors cited 
the limits of their military arsenals as a reason for failing to precisely attack military 
targets,64 the military capacity of the conflicting parties is irrelevant to their duty, under 
international humanitarian law, to take all feasible measures to avoid loss among civilians 
and damage to civilian property.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Launching of attacks from populated areas and rockets launched by Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>armed groups falling within the Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p>37. Another issue of serious concern during the crisis was allegations related to rocket 
attacks launched by Palestinian armed groups from populated areas in Gaza. According to 
one source, a rocket attack was launched on 20 November from Al-Wahda Street, about 
100 meters from the Shawa and Housari Building, which hosts several media offices. In 
another incident, a rocket attack was launched from a yard of a house near Al-Deira Hotel, 
central Gaza City.65 Some of these rockets may have been launched from underground 
tunnels.66 As noted above, eyewitnesses informed OHCHR that on two occasions rockets 
were launched from an area south of the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, about 100 meters 
from a residential area. According to a witness, on both occasions following the day the 
rockets were fired by Palestinian armed groups, Israeli airstrikes targeted the Palestine 
Stadium, in one incident injuring a person.67  OHCHR received first-hand information 
indicating that rockets were fired from areas close to civilian buildings in the east of Gaza 
City. According to this account, rockets were fired from a land full of orange trees in Al-
Zaitoun, about 300 meters from several residential houses. In addition to damages inflicted 
to the orange trees as result of counter strikes by Israel, the rocket firing posed a serious 
risk to the nearby residents.

</p>
<p>38. Launching attacks from populated areas constitutes a violation of customary rules of 
international humanitarian law, i.e. the obligation to take all precautions to protect civilians. 
By having done so, the civilian population&#8217;s exposure to the inherent dangers of the 
military operations taking place around them was greatly heightened. 
</p>
<p>39. By 19 November, according to IDF sources, at least 99 rockets fired between 14 and 
19 November from within the Gaza Strip had landed in Gaza.68 On 14 November, a woman, 
an 11-month-old infant, and an 18-year-old adult in Al-Zaitoun were killed by what 
appeared to be a Palestinian rocket that fell short of Israel.69 In addition, OHCHR received 
reports related to an incident in which two civilians, including a child, were killed, and five 
persons, including three children, were injured, as a result of what appeared to be a 
Palestinian rocket that fell short and hit a house in Al-Quds Street, near Khilla Gas Station, 
Jabalya, on 16 November. For its part, Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades underlined the 
limited military arsenal of Palestinian armed groups as a reason for failing to precisely 
attack military targets.70 Yet the military capacity of the conflicting parties is irrelevant to 
the duty, under international humanitarian law, of these parties to take all feasible measures 
to avoid loss among civilians and damage to civilian property.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Summary execution of alleged collaborators 
</b></p>
<p>40. According to media reports, on 16 November at around 11:45 am, a 41-year-old 
man was shot dead in the street by a group of masked men.71 A sign was hung around the 
victim&#8217;s neck by which the Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades accused him of collaborating 
with Israel in the killing of 15 Palestinian leaders.72 According to the Palestinian 
Independent Commission for Human Rights, the victim had been detained at the Gaza 
central prison in Gaza City since 26 December 2011 and was facing trial for treason in a 
military court.73 
</p>
<p>41. On 20 November, masked militants shot six men dead in Nasser Street in Gaza City, 
for alleged collaboration with Israel. Again, the Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades claimed 
responsibility in a large handwritten note hung on a nearby electricity pole. The note 
claimed that the six men had provided information to Israel, thereby contributing to the 
killing of Palestinians.74 The corpses of the six men were then subjected to abuse by dozens 
of people. Such abuse included being spit on and kicked in the head. The corpse of one 
victim was tied by cable to a motorcycle and dragged through the streets of Gaza City, 
accompanied by gunmen on motorcycles.75 Contrary to the narrative provided by the Izz 
Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, the six men had been held at the DFA prisons for at least the 
last eighteen months, and had been issued death sentences by the military court.

<p>42. Death sentences can, under Palestinian law, only be implemented once they are 
ratified by the president of the Palestinian Authority.76 In addition, the death sentences of at 
least four of the victims were pending appeal at the military court. The final judgment for 
one of the cases was expected for 20 November. The lawyer in charge of the three other 
appeals had already prepared submissions based on the lack of evidence and procedural 
irregularities.77 
</p>
<p>43. While it is unclear whether or not the prison authorities handed the prisoners over to 
the armed men, prison authorities in any case have the duty to protect those in their 
custody, to ensure their security and to only hand them over to legally sanctioned 
government agencies, following court orders78. Information received by OHCHR indicates 
that a &quot;transfer order&quot; was signed by prison officials and officials of the Internal Security 
Agency prior to the transfer of the alleged collaborators in an ambulance from Kateeba 
prison to the detention facilities of the Internal Security Agency, where they were 
reportedly held until their execution. A military judge and a senior member of Al-Qassam 
brigades were reportedly involved in identifying the seven alleged collaborators. The 
families of the seven executed persons were not informed of the transfer and only heard 
about the killings through radio and news reports. 
</p>
<p>44. On 21 November, the deputy chief of Hamas, Mousa Abu Marzouq, condemned the 
public execution of the six men79, and said that &#8220;resistance&#8221; leaders &#8220;should use legal 
procedures to deal with suspected spies through the courts.&#8221;80 Mr. Abu Marzouq said the 
killings were &quot;not acceptable at all&quot; and that &#8220;those responsible for the killings must be held 
accountable,&#8221; and such incidents &quot;must never happen again.&#8221; The DFA&#8217;s spokesperson, 
</p>
<p>Taher al-Nunu, and the Ministry of Interior reportedly stated that an investigation would be 
initiated to examine the &#8220;extra-judicial executions&#8221;.81 OHCHR has not been able to obtain 
any information regarding any investigations being undertaken at the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>45. The public killing of the seven people constitutes both a violation of international 
human rights law and international humanitarian law. Information collected by OHCHR 
suggests that the seven men were taken out of the detention facilities with the knowledge, 
while possibly without the direct involvement, of the DFA, which failed to ensure their 
security. The killings, therefore, constitute a violation of article 3 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention which prohibits the murder of persons taking no active part in the hostilities, by 
the DFA and armed groups, as far as they were involved in carrying out the killings, as well 
as of the right to life, including possible summary execution, by the DFA.

<p><b> IV. Displacement and other issues  
</b></p>
<p>46. The IDF&#8217;s continued bombardment of the Gaza Strip during the crisis terrified and 
traumatized large segments of Gaza&#8217;s population, forcing the large majority to seek refuge 
out of concern for their safety. Bombardments were particularly intensified in areas 
bordering the fence; e.g., northern Gaza Strip, including Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun. 
Dozens of residences in these areas sustained damages to doors, windows, and roofs. 
Civilians reported that their children were traumatized and suffered psychological impacts, 
which manifested themselves in bedwetting, thumb-sucking, nightmares, and an acute 
sense of insecurity. A sense of disempowerment prevailed among parents, with many 
reporting feeling devastated that they were unable to protect their children. Many civilians 
were vulnerable to Israeli attacks, if their house or residential building happened to be 
located close to the target of an IDF attack. On 15 November, the IDF disclosed that it had 
dropped, on the Gaza Strip in the period from 15 to 17 November, 200,000 leaflets, 
advising residents to stay away from Hamas and other &#8220;terror organizations&#8217;&#8220; facilities and 
locations &#8220;that pose a risk to their safety&#8221;.82 Further, 20,000 phone calls83  and 12,000 text 
messages84 with the same warning were sent by the IDF during the crisis. No further details 
regarding the mentioned facilities and locations were disclosed, raising the question of how 
effective these warnings were. On 20 November, the IDF dropped further leaflets on a 
number of locations in the Gaza Strip urging civilians to evacuate their residences and 
move to Gaza City&#8217;s centre. The leaflets were dropped on many areas, including Sheikh 
</p>
<p>Ajlin, Tel Al-Hwa, Rimal South, Zeitoun, Sjaiya, Turkeman, SajiyaJadida, Shati, Al-Atatra, 
Beit Lahiya, and Beit Hanoun, and provided details on how to reach Gaza City.85 These 
leaflets prompted a large displacement among the population. By 21 November, almost 
12,000 people were staying in UNRWA schools.86 Following the announcement of the 
ceasefire, almost all returned to their homes.

<p><b> V. Summary of findings 
</b></p>
<p>47. The IDF, the DFA and Palestinian armed groups, in relation to numerous incidents 
that took place during the crisis as described above, failed in many instances to respect 
international law. In some cases, more information would be required to make a more 
specific assessment. Based on the information available to OHCHR, the IDF did not 
consistently uphold the basic principles of conduct of hostilities, namely, the principles 
distinction, proportionality and precautions. Further, the effectiveness, sufficiency and 
adequacy of precautions taken remains questionable in several cases.  
</p>
<p>48. Palestinian armed groups continuously violated international humanitarian law, by 
launching indiscriminate attacks on Israel and by attacking civilians, thereby disregarding 
the principle of distinction. The armed groups failed to take all feasible precautions in 
attacks, in particular by launching rockets from populated areas, which put the population 
at grave risk. Furthermore, several Palestinians were killed by rockets launched by the 
armed groups that fell short and landed in the Gaza Strip. In addition, seven alleged
