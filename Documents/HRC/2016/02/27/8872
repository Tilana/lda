<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as 
a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
discrimination in this context, undertook an official visit to the United States of America 
from 22 October to 8 November 2009. The main purpose of the mission was to examine the 
realization of the right to adequate housing in the country and the achievements and 
difficulties encountered in its fulfilment, in particular in relation to the existing subsidized 
housing programmes, the homeless situation and the foreclosure crisis. Given the size of the 
country, the nature of the federal system and the limited duration of the mission, the Special 
Rapporteur focused on specific themes and concentrated particularly on federal policies and 
programmes, and their impact at the local level. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur visited Washington D.C., New York, Chicago, New 
Orleans, Pine Ridge Reservation, Los Angeles and Pacoima (California). During her visit, 
the Special Rapporteur met with high-ranking officials and representatives of the federal, 
state and local governments. The Special Rapporteur also held meetings with members of 
Congress, people affected by housing issues, members of civil society and non-
governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>3. She warmly expresses her gratitude to the Government of the United States of 
America for the invitation, the constructive dialogue and openness, and support throughout 
and after the visit, and welcomes the engagement of the present administration to progress 
the implementation of the right to adequate housing as a policy goal for all. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Institutional and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>4. Modern housing policy in the United States began during the Depression, with the 
National Housing Act of 1934, which created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to 
underwrite and insure mortgages and provide security to lenders in case of default. The 
Government also created the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) to buy 
mortgages from lenders, enabling them to increase their liquidity and thus offer more loans 
to buyers. 
</p>
<p>5. Federal oversight of public housing was introduced in 1937 by the Wagner-Steagall 
Housing Act, allowing the Government to fund, construct, and own homes to rent for poor 
people. It was said to be created to improve living conditions, and create construction 
related jobs.1 
</p><p>6. The housing acts of 1934 and 1937 marked the beginning of a two-tier system of 
housing policy: public rental housing and subsidies for poor people and subsidized credit to 
promote homeownership for middle-income families. It also changed the urban landscape, 
with most of the public housing located in the cities, while most of the FHA-insured homes 
are in the suburbs. 
</p>
<p>7. The face of public housing changed rapidly. Initially racial minorities represented 26 
to 39 per cent of all tenants in public housing but had reached over 60 per cent by 1978.2

 Today the percentage of public housing residents who belong to racial minorities is 69 per cent: 46 
</p>
<p>per cent African American and 20 per cent Latino. <i>Residential Segregation and Housing

<p>Concurrently, the median income of tenants fell from 64 per cent to 37 per cent of the 
national median from 1950 to 1970.3 From the 1950s through the 1970s, large tracts of 
predominantly high-density public housing were built, whose residents were mainly 
African American.4 
</p>
<p>8. Simultaneously, homeownership for the (predominantly white) middle class was 
greatly facilitated through federal financing of more than half of all suburban homes during 
the 1950s and 1960s. This led to an increase in the home-ownership rate from 30 per cent in 
1930 to over 60 per cent by 1960. Due to a variety of discriminatory laws and practices, the 
vast majority of loans were not accessible to African Americans, and whites received 98 per 
cent of federally approved loans between 1934 and 1968.5 
</p>
<p>9. Public housing was established by the Federal Government with the aim of 
providing decent and safe rental housing for eligible low-income families, older persons, 
and persons with disabilities. However, over the years, the model of high-density public 
housing &#8220;projects&#8221; was increasingly questioned as they became more and more stigmatized 
as centres of extreme poverty, crime and segregation. Reasons for the perceived decline in 
the quality of public housing include physical deterioration related to the ageing of the 
public housing stock and poor maintenance, while little was done to deal with the larger 
systemic issue of racial and economic segregation in some cities.6 
</p>
<p>10. In 1974 the Housing and Community Development Act effectively ended most new 
construction of public housing. It also initiated the Housing Choice Voucher Program 
(commonly referred to as Section 8), consisting of both project-based and tenant-based rent 
subsidies. In the former instance, its use is limited to a specific housing development; in the 
latter case beneficiaries are free to choose a housing unit on the private market from a 
landlord who accepts the vouchers. Tenants pay a proportion of the rent (based on income, 
and generally not more than 30 per cent of total household income), while the rest is paid 
from federal funds. The Section 8 programme marked an important change in public 
housing policy as it shifted funds from public housing authorities to the private sector. It 
was created to avoid concentrations of low-income people, as public housing developments 
tended to do. However, it faced resistance from tenants and buildings in middle-income 
neighbourhoods and in some cities &#8220;the concentration of [Section 8] buildings and tenants 
has been blamed, just like public housing, for community decline&#8221;.7 
</p><p>11. A decade later, in 1986, the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) was established 
by the Tax Reform Act as a new mechanism for generating capital to develop affordable 
housing development. It has created approximately 2 million affordable rental units.8 Tax

<p>credits are awarded to developers of qualified projects to increase the local supply of 
affordable housing. Developers are allowed to sell tax credits to investors to raise capital, 
thus reducing the loan required by the developer, which translates into lower rents. 
</p>
<p>12. In 1989 Congress appointed the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public 
Housing to evaluate the state of public housing in the United States. The Commission 
concluded that while the majority of the 1.4 million units of public housing were well 
maintained and managed, a small proportion of units &#8212; 86,000 or about 6 per cent &#8212; were 
in &#8220;the most distressed and notorious urban developments in the nation, where crime, 
poverty, unemployment, and dependency were solidly entrenched&#8221;.9 Based on the 
recommendation of the Commission, the HOPE VI (Housing Opportunities for People 
Everywhere) programme was created in 1992. 
</p><p>13. The objectives of HOPE VI included the revitalization of public housing, de-
concentration of very low-income families, and creation of sustainable communities via 
demolition, rehabilitation, reconfiguration, or replacement of a large number of public 
housing units.10 Lower density, mixed-income developments were built, which generally 
included a combination of public housing, affordable, and market-rate units. Under this 
model, responsibility for the provision of subsidized housing has increasingly been 
devolved from the Federal Government to local authorities and the private sector. 
</p>
<p>14. Federal housing policy has resulted, on the one hand, in the achievement of a high 
rate of homeownership &#8211; about 69 per cent. On the other hand, it has also resulted in the 
decreasing supply of public housing &#8211; currently 1.2 million units. This loss has been 
accompanied by the progressive withdrawal of Government from the housing sector. The 
policy has included the promotion of private homeownership for lower-income households, 
and the privatization of subsidized housing complexes, allowing private developers to 
promote mixed-income developments. 
</p>
<p>15. In 1977 the Community Reinvestment Act required banks to allocate prescribed 
portions of their mortgage portfolios to neighbourhoods where they accepted deposits. 
Banks had to modify their normal definitions of risk (which included neighbourhood 
conditions) and in some cases they made risky loans11 and many homes were provided to 
families who could not afford them. As long as housing prices were increasing, the 
expectation was that those increases would be greater than the discrepancy between current 
expenditures and current incomes; however, as soon as prices stopped increasing, problems 
began to mount. Additionally, the curtailment of subsidies, in particular for public housing, 
created added pressure for lower-income households to seek homeownership as the only 
way of improving their housing conditions. The recent subprime mortgage crisis is the 
result of this policy and the commitment to homeownership, as an incarnation of the 
American Dream for the masses. 
</p>
<p>16. In the context of the current housing crisis, a greater proportion than previously of 
people living in the United States face serious challenges in accessing affordable housing. 
The subprime mortgage crisis has widened an already large gap between the supply of and

<p>demand for affordable housing. The economic crisis which followed has led to increased 
unemployment and an even greater need for affordable housing. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definition of affordable 
housing is that a household spend no more than 30 per cent of its income on housing. In 
2007, about 22 per cent of the 36.9 million rental households in the United States were 
spending more than half their income on rental costs.12 At the same time, about 8.8 million 
renter households with low incomes were spending more than half of their income for 
housing. The number of households facing serious affordability constraints increased by 33 
per cent between 2000 and 2007, and the poorest and most vulnerable people face the 
heaviest burdens in terms of housing costs. Nearly two thirds of the low-income households 
that face severe housing-cost burdens have family members who are children, elderly, or 
persons with disabilities.13 About 12.7 million children &#8212; more than one in six &#8212; in the 
United States live in households spending more than half their incomes on housing.14 
</p>
<p><b> A. Subsidized housing programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Federal housing assistance programmes for low-income households 
</b></p>
<p>18. Federal housing assistance programmes play a very important role in covering the 
difference between the rents that low-income families are able to afford and the cost of 
rental housing. The main federal assistance programmes to help households access 
affordable housing are the Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8), project-based 
Section 8 rental assistance, and public housing.15 All these programmes provide rental 
assistance to households, which reduces their housing costs to about 30 per cent of their 
income. 
</p>
<p>19. Today there are approximately 1.2 million households living in public housing units, 
managed by approximately 3,300 housing authorities, which include a variety of options 
from single-family houses to high-rise apartments. Almost two thirds of all public housing 
households include an older person or a person with disabilities. Public housing also 
represents a crucial support to more than 400,000 low-income families with children, the 
majority of them working families.16 The majority of public housing residents are very 
poor, around 73 per cent having incomes of 30 per cent or less of the area median income 
(AMI) for their household size. 
</p><p>20. Eligibility for public housing is based on income (the lower income limit is set at 80 
per cent and the very low income limit at 50 per cent of the AMI), family status, and 
citizenship/immigration status.17 The AMI is used to determine the rates for market rate and 
low-income housing in poor areas. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the problems

<p>generated by the use of this formula, when AMI is calculated including the incomes of very 
affluent areas to determine the rates for housing in poor areas. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the intention of HUD to revise this formula. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Cuts in low-income housing assistance programmes 
</b></p>
<p>21. In past years there were significant cuts in low-income housing assistance 
programmes. Budget cuts in the 1980s resulted in the gradual erosion and poor maintenance 
of the public housing system. Further subsequent funding cuts have also significantly 
affected the preservation of public housing. By the early 1990s, hundreds of thousands of 
public housing units had become dilapidated. Over the past decade there has been a net loss 
of approximately 170,000 public housing units due to deterioration and decay, and much of 
the current public housing stock needs substantial repairs and rehabilitation. However, 
annual funding for public housing fell by 25 per cent between 1999 and 2006. 
</p>
<p>22. When federal funding is inadequate, housing agencies reduce their own expenses. 
Measures have included shifting units to tenants with higher incomes (who can be charged 
higher rents than lower-income households but typically have less need for assistance), or 
cutting back in areas such as security or maintenance.18 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that low-income housing assistance 
programmes should receive additional funding. The Federal Government provides much 
higher levels of subsidies to high-income homeowners via tax exemptions as compared to 
subsidies for low-income housing assistance. &#8220;Each year, the federal government spends 
more than three times as much on tax breaks for homeowners &#8212; with a large share of the 
resulting tax benefits going to upper-income households &#8212; as it spends on low-income 
housing assistance.&#8221;19 The criteria for the distribution of federal housing assistance should 
be based on a real survey of housing needs and the distribution should be on a per capita 
basis, with priority for the low-income population. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent commitment of additional budgetary 
resources to creating and preserving affordable housing. Additional funds for housing have 
been requested in the fiscal year 2010 budget, representing an increase of 10.8 per cent over 
the fiscal year 2009 budget.20 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Mixed-income developments and demolition of public housing 
</b></p>
<p>25. The cuts in federal funding for low-income housing have led to a decrease in the 
quality of subsidized housing. At the same time, a new housing policy based on mixed-
income developments on public housing sites has been promoted, especially on those sites 
in prime locations within cities. HOPE VI gave local agencies funds to demolish distressed 
or obsolete public housing and replace it with mixed-income communities, usually with the 
collaboration of private developers. Over the past 15 years, the programme has invested 
$6.1 billion of federal funding in 235 projects to demolish 96,200 public housing units and 
produce 107,800 new or renovated housing units, 56,800 of which will be affordable. In 
addition, 78,000 housing vouchers have been issued.21 Besides the fact that some 
demolished units are replaced by market-rate housing, many &#8220;affordable&#8221; units are too 
costly for many public housing tenants.

<p>26. While HOPE VI has improved the quality of the public housing stock, it has also 
reduced the number of affordable housing units for poor families and permanently 
displaced many residents of the demolished projects. In principle, units that were not rebuilt 
were replaced by housing vouchers, but this procedure was not consistently followed. In 
addition, this practice places the responsibility of finding housing in the private market on 
the user. The real choices available for vouchers are in many cases very limited, with no 
units available in certain neighbourhoods, or landlords unwilling to participate in this 
programme. 
</p>
<p>27. The policy goal of creating diverse and inclusive mixed neighbourhoods is a positive 
one. While this policy has benefited residents in different locations, its implementation has 
also drawn criticism. Units were demolished without sufficient mechanisms in place for 
tenants to find comparable housing in the interim. Displaced residents often had to move to 
other subsidized housing in neighbourhoods as distressed as their original one, or were 
discriminated against in their new neighbourhoods. The interim period of redevelopment 
has been much longer than forecast and insufficient efforts were made to keep track of 
tenants in order to offer them housing once redevelopments were complete. In fact, less 
than 12 per cent of former public housing residents make it back to live in the redeveloped 
communities. The number of units rebuilt has often not matched the number of units 
demolished, in fact far from it, and the number of new units of public housing has usually 
been far fewer than formerly. 
</p>
<p>28. An example is Cabrini Green in Chicago. Cabrini Green originally had 3,114 high-
rise public housing units, of which 2,700 were demolished. Since the demolition, only 305 
public housing units have been built in mixed-income developments. As a result many 
residents were displaced and are unable to return to the area.22 The Housing Authority plans 
to demolish the remaining 414 high-rise units in September 2010. 
</p>
<p>29. On 15 June 2009 Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank and California 
Congresswoman Maxine Waters sent a letter to HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan urging him 
to &#8220;impose a one-year moratorium on the approval of applications for the demolition or 
disposition of public housing units&#8221;. Mr. Frank and Ms. Waters had sent a similar letter in 
August 2008 expressing their concern about the loss of public housing units which had 
reached &#8220;epic proportions&#8221;. No moratorium has been imposed. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets the demolition of thousands of public 
housing units in New Orleans. Many residents and victims of Hurricane Katrina were 
prevented from returning to their homes (many of which according to residents sustained 
little storm damage) and had their homes demolished.23 The current housing crisis in New 
Orleans reflects the disastrous impact of the demolition policy. In particular, the demolition 
of the &#8220;Big Four&#8221; housing complexes (B.W. Copper, C.J. Peete, Lafitte and St. Bernard) 
has displaced approximately 20,000 individuals. Only one public housing complex still 
remains, Iberville, which is in need of better maintenance. Residents of Iberville fear 
demolition of their homes. In addition, former public housing residents of New Orleans are 
facing grave housing challenges in other cities. One New Orleans resident told the Special 
Rapporteur that he had met Katrina survivors who are homeless or close to homeless in 
other cities, &#8220;the legacy of the demolition policy&#8221;.24

<p>31. Rental housing assistance was offered by HUD to more than 33,000 New Orleans 
households, many of them living in other cities and states. This programme assisted 
residents for more than four years and continues to assist about 12,000 families in New 
Orleans. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that many public housing units are in 
good physical condition and provide adequate homes; however, in some cases, even these 
units are under threat. During her visit to Los Angeles, the Special Rapporteur visited 
several public housing complexes which were in very good condition, such as Mar Vista 
Gardens. Located in a relatively wealthy community, Mar Vista Gardens achieves HUD&#8217;s 
stated goal of mixing households with different levels of income and provides housing in a 
neighbourhood which offers opportunities to residents. However, the Los Angeles Housing 
Authority (HACLA) has announced a plan to remove it from the public housing stock. 
When public housing is disposed of, ownership is often transferred from the housing 
authority to a private entity &#8212; most often for-profit developers, although sometimes non-
profit owners &#8212; putting its future as affordable housing at great risk. Tenants thus live in 
fear that the long-term affordability and stability of their housing is threatened and that they 
might be displaced in the future. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Choice Neighbourhood Initiative, which aims 
to revitalize communities and to transform very poor neighbourhoods, where public and 
assisted housing is concentrated, by challenging &#8220;public, private and non-profit partners to 
extend neighborhood transformation efforts beyond public housing and link housing 
interventions more closely with school reform and early childhood innovation&#8221;.25 However, 
the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the lack of safeguards to ensure that poor 
communities will be able to stay in their neighbourhoods once development takes place. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Expiring long-term rental assistance contracts and Section 8 vouchers 
</b></p>
<p>34. Options for low-income families and individuals are further reduced due to other 
pressures on the stock of affordable housing including &#8220;expiring use&#8221;. In the 1960s, the 
Federal Government partnered with private developers to provide affordable housing. In 
exchange for subsidies in the form of tax benefits or subsidized mortgages, developers 
providing affordable units signed contracts with the Federal Government for leases of 20 to 
40 years. Depending on the type of subsidy, landlords had the option of repaying their 
mortgage after 20 years, converting the units to market rate and/or opting out of renewing 
contracts once they expired.26 Many of these contracts are now ending, with landlords 
opting out of renewal. Thousands of units have already been lost, and a report estimates that 
an additional 300,000 units will see contracts expire within the next five years.27 Incentives 
are needed to encourage owners to remain in the Section 8 programmes, thus preserving 
housing for low-income families. 
</p>
<p>35. Congress is currently debating a preservation bill which aims to protect the current 
stock of project-based Section 8 buildings. The Special Rapporteur is dismayed that an 
important provision of the bill, the right to first purchase (RFP), has been withdrawn. This 
provision would require that a landlord wishing to sell a project-based Section 8 building 
give the right of first purchase to either the city or the tenants themselves, before being 
allowed to list the building for sale on the open market.

<p>36. Rental housing vouchers have become the nation&#8217;s largest low-income housing 
assistance programme, serving over 2 million households with extremely low incomes. 
Nevertheless, most cities have long waiting lists for assistance, typically of five years. 
Under existing funding levels, federal programmes can assist only about one quarter of the 
low-income families eligible for assistance.28 Funding cuts have also contributed to the 
additional loss of over 150,000 vouchers between 2005 and 2007. According to a study 
conducted by the United States Conference of Mayors in 2008, many cities had closed their 
waiting lists for Section 8/Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing because of excess 
demand.29 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Habitability, availability and location 
</b></p>
<p>37. The link between housing and health was stressed to the Special Rapporteur 
throughout her visit. Poor housing conditions expose residents &#8212; especially children &#8212; to 
a number of diseases. Most residents of public housing with whom the Special Rapporteur 
spoke complained of asthma, attributed to mould from poor maintenance of units. A 
resident in Los Angeles described living in slum housing conditions with rats, cockroaches, 
bedbugs, deteriorated piping and lead-based paint, and as a result developing chronic 
asthma.30 
</p>
<p>38. In several cities, many of the subsidized residents with whom the Special Rapporteur 
spoke complained of bedbugs. In Section 8 housing, the insect infestation problem is 
compounded by the fact that some residents do not complain about poor maintenance 
because they fear that they will be forced to move if their unit does not meet Section 8 
standards, while alternative low-income options are extremely scarce. 
</p>
<p>39. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur observed many families living in 
subsidized housing units in conditions of severe overcrowding. This was particularly the 
case amongst immigrant families in Los Angeles, and most strikingly on Pine Ridge Native 
American Reservation, where it was described as commonplace to have three to four 
families living in a three-bedroom house. The conditions in the houses on the Reservation 
were the worst seen by the Special Rapporteur during her mission, evidence of the urgent 
and severe need for additional subsidized housing units there. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur also heard numerous complaints of lack of services on many 
public housing sites, including the public housing complex Atgeld Gardens outside 
Chicago, where most local businesses have closed down, reportedly due to lack of 
sufficient residents to maintain profitability, as many apartments are vacant due to extended 
renovations. 
</p>
<p>41. Severe limitations in access to services such as public transportation and fresh food 
were observed by the Special Rapporteur during her visit to Pine Ridge Reservation. 
Problems have been compounded due to budget constraints and in her meetings with HUD 
the Special Rapporteur was told that the budget for Indian housing has essentially been flat 
for the past decade. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the effects of gentrification on the 
poorest. As middle- and upper-income families choose to move to or to stay in the cities, 
inner-city subsidized housing developments face increasing pressure as developers vie for 
prime land. Gentrification pushes out the poorest to areas with reduced services and

<p>employment opportunities. Legislation is needed to safeguard affordable housing in prime 
locations. 
</p>
<p>43. At the other end of the spectrum, the Special Rapporteur visited at least one 
subsidized housing development located next to polluted areas. Altgeld Gardens outside of 
Chicago is located near landfills, numerous industrial manufacturing plants and waste 
dumps. One resident stated that &#8220;environmental conditions in our community/city are 
appalling. We have polluted air and water and a lot of contaminants in our environment 
because our next door neighbours are big industries&#8221;.31 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Predatory equity 
</b></p>
<p>44. One tool utilized by certain districts in the United States to provide affordable 
housing is through the use of rent regulation legislation. This legislation was introduced at 
the federal level during the Second World War, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
signed into law the Emergency Price Control Act (EPCA) in 1942. Subsequently various 
states and local jurisdictions instituted rent control measures and many still exist today.32 
This rental stock is facing growing pressure from real estate markets, and more recently 
from the threat of &#8220;predatory equity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>45. Predatory equity appeared during the recent real estate bubble, described as an 
investor purchasing a rent-stabilized building, with a mortgage which is securitized and 
sold repeatedly over a short period of time for ever-increasing sums. The resulting 
mortgage payments increase with each sale, with existing rent rolls insufficient to cover the 
cost. As a result, new owners engage in aggressive tactics to evict residents in order to raise 
rents to subsequent residents, and eventually remove the building from the rent stabilization 
scheme. Given the downturn in the real estate market, there exists a high risk that such 
mortgages will default, and the Special Rapporteur heard reports of investors simply 
walking away, leaving the building to the bank, and tenants with uncertain futures. The 
Special Rapporteur also noticed that while the impacts of predatory equity are being felt 
across the country, they have been most acute in New York, where the full effect of 
foreclosures has yet to be felt. In New York alone, one civil society organization has 
identified over 90,000 rent-stabilized units subject to predatory equity.33 
</p><p>46. In addition to the long-standing challenges of affordability, more and more 
households are losing their homes to foreclosure, putting even more pressure on already 
stressed housing markets. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Foreclosure 
</b></p>
<p>47. As stated by HUD, &#8220;the extent of the housing and economic crisis is now painfully 
apparent. (&#8230;) approximately 3.7 million borrowers began the foreclosure process in 2007 
and 2008&#8221;.34 RealtyTrac reported a 32 per cent increase in foreclosure filings from April 
2008 to April 2009.35 A growing number of owners are losing their properties due to 
foreclosure and are displaced into the rental housing market. Families who were previously

<p>owners are now seeking to rent. Although housing markets vary widely in the United 
States, in some areas this increased demand for rental units has contributed to a rise in rents 
while real estate prices are falling. 
</p>
<p>48. Existing renters are another sector of the population affected by foreclosures. &#8220;At 
least 20 per cent of foreclosed properties are not owner-occupied, and in many parts of the 
country (such as New England, New York City, and Minneapolis), half or more of 
households living in foreclosed buildings are renters.&#8221;36 When creditors experience 
foreclosure on rental properties, tenants can frequently be evicted, even if they were 
regularly paying their rent. To address this situation, on 20 May 2009, President Obama 
signed into law the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act (P.L. 111-22): Protecting 
Tenants at Foreclosure Act (Title VII).37 Section 702 states that tenants must be given at 
least 90 days notice to vacate once the property has been foreclosed upon, and have the 
right &#8220;under any bona fide lease entered into before the notice of foreclosure to occupy the 
premises until the end of the remaining term of the lease, except that a successor in interest 
may terminate a lease effective on the date of sale of the unit to a purchaser who will 
occupy the unit as a primary residence&#8221;. In addition, under Section 703, the law states that 
when a unit receiving Section 8 assistance is foreclosed upon, tenants may not be evicted 
during the term of their lease in order for the new owner to sell the property. The renter 
protection provisions took effect immediately and expire at the end of 2012. 
</p>
<p>49. In spring 2009, the Federal Government also announced the Making Home 
Affordable programme. It seeks, inter alia, to prevent foreclosures by working with private 
industry to offer affordable loan refinancing and loan modifications. From the inception of 
this programme there have been questions as to whether it could diminish the wave of 
foreclosures. Criticism relates to the low number of banks and investment funds which are 
adhering to the programme and the modest number of homeowners who are actually 
benefiting. In addition, a large number of loans modified through the programme remain in 
a trial stage lasting up to five months, and only a small percentage have been made 
permanent. Some discussion is taking place within the Senate on new legislation that would 
create a national foreclosure prevention programme.38 
</p>
<p><b> C. Homelessness 
</b></p>
<p>50. The economic crisis and significantly increasing numbers of foreclosures are 
increasing the risk of homelessness in communities across the country. Many families &#8212; 
renters and homeowners &#8212; have been caught in the foreclosure crisis and become 
homeless, moving in with relatives or friends, going to emergency shelters or living on the 
streets. According to the 2008 study conducted by the United States Conference of Mayors, 
of the 25 cities with data available, 12 reported an increase in homelessness because of the 
foreclosure crisis.39 
</p>
<p>51. It is estimated that over 800,000 people are homeless on any given night in the 
United States, and as many as 3.5 million people experience homelessness annually, living

<p>in shelters, transitional housing, or public places. Including those who have lost their own 
homes and live with family or friends, the number reaches 4.5 million.40 
</p>
<p>52. The exact number of homeless people is difficult to determine, both due to the 
nature of homelessness and the definition used. The model used by HUD to record the 
homeless includes two surveys: one records the number of individuals and families that 
accessed emergency shelter or stayed in transitional housing during a one-year period while 
the other is a point-in-time analysis, which attempts to count the number of homeless, 
whether in a shelter or not, on a given night in January.41 While this method may provide 
useful information about the number of people who use shelters and other services, or who 
are easy to locate on the street, it can underestimate the extent of homelessness. Many 
people do not find a place in the emergency shelters and transitional housing spaces and as 
a result are forced to live with relatives and friends in crowded, temporary arrangements. 
These people are less likely to be counted but are nonetheless experiencing homelessness. 
</p>
<p>53. According to an official study conducted in 2006, on average single men comprise 
51 per cent of the homeless population, families with children account for 30 per cent, 
single women for 17 per cent and unaccompanied youth for 2 per cent. The homeless 
population is estimated to be 42 per cent African American, 39 per cent white, 13 per cent 
Hispanic, 4 per cent Native American and 2 per cent Asian.42 An average of 22 per cent of 
homeless single people are considered mentally ill while 8 per cent of homeless individuals 
in a family with children were found to have mental illness. Thirty seven per cent of single 
homeless people are substance abusers while 10 per cent of homeless adults with children 
are substance abusers.  
</p>
<p>54. More than 1.5 million children in the United States experience homelessness each 
year. In many cases, there are no adequate shelter facilities where parents and children can 
stay together and children are often removed from their parents and placed in foster care.43 
The Family Unification Program (FUP), which aims to prevent this practice, urgently needs 
more funds. A positive step is the resolution introduced in June 2009 by Congresswoman 
Maxine Waters in the House of Representatives on the right of children to adequate housing 
(H. Res. 582). While not yet adopted by Congress, this resolution recognizes the right of 
children and youth to adequate housing and states that projects that provide services to 
parents and other caretakers to prevent possible homelessness of youth in crisis should be 
created and maintained. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur also expresses her concern about homeless youth and their 
access to homelessness services. Some youths between the ages of 18 and 25 are considered 
adults but psychosocially they are still youth. Therefore, national homeless programmes 
should consider the unique needs of this community.  
</p>
<p>56. Homeless people need access to affordable housing; the lack of it is the main cause 
of homelessness. Many cities that do not provide enough affordable housing and shelters

<p>are resorting to the criminal justice system to punish people living on the streets. Some of 
the measures adopted include prohibition of sleeping, camping, eating, sitting, and/or 
begging in public spaces and include criminal penalties for violation of these laws.44 The 
Helping Families Save Their Home Act of 2009, recently signed into law, requires the 
federal Interagency Council on Homelessness to create constructive alternatives to 
criminalization measures. 
</p>
<p>57. The main Federal Government programmes addressing homelessness are the 
Emergency Food and Shelter Program and Emergency Shelter Grant. The American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;stimulus package&#8221;) signed by President Obama 
includes an important increase for both programmes. While funding increases are very 
positive steps in preventing homelessness, further measures could be envisaged. In 
particular, HUD should ensure that households living with family or friends due to 
economic difficulties are eligible to receive assistance. This temporary situation often 
eventually results in people becoming homeless. Currently, the definition of homelessness 
used by HUD does not include these families.  
</p>
<p>58. Section 8 housing measures have proven important in preventing homelessness. 
According to a recently published paper, &#8220;The federally funded Voucher Family Study 
found that voucher assistance resulted in a 74 per cent decrease in the incidence of &#8216;official&#8217; 
homelessness. That is, control group members &#8212; similarly poor families that did not 
receive housing vouchers &#8212; were four times more likely to have resided in a shelter or on 
the streets in the fourth year of the study than comparable families that were provided 
vouchers and rented housing with them.&#8221;45 Increased funding for additional households 
(homeless or imminent homeless) to receive housing assistance is crucial to reducing the 
number of families experiencing homelessness.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>59. The United States has strong legislation against discrimination in housing on the 
basis of race, colour, religion, national origin or disability. On a federal level the most 
fundamental and overarching legislation is Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (also 
known as the Fair Housing Act), which gives HUD the responsibility to enforce the Act. It 
also requires HUD to act in an affirmative way to further fair housing.46 The Fair Housing 
Act is generally thought to provide a robust legal framework, however there have been 
significant problems in its enforcement, and further strengthening is required. The Act 
governs both private and public housing stock. States and cities have additional legislative 
codes which bar discrimination on other grounds, for example source of income.47 
</p>
<p>60. HUD conducts activities to assist individuals who have experienced unlawful 
housing discrimination and educate housing professionals and the public on fair housing

</p>
<p>laws. Such activities include enforcement, education and outreach, and investigation of 
complaints. HUD also has the ability to lodge complaints and start investigations on its own 
initiative.  
</p>
<p>61. HUD&#8217;s authority to investigate housing discrimination complaints is shared with 
state and local government agencies that participate in the Fair Housing Assistance 
Program (FHAP). These agencies received 80 per cent of the housing discrimination 
complaints filed in HUD&#8217;s jurisdiction in fiscal year 2008. The total number of housing 
discrimination complaints filed in 2008 was 10,552, the highest number on record.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>62. Adequate housing must be accessible to all. Thus, such disadvantaged groups as 
older persons, children, persons with disabilities, the terminally ill, HIV-positive 
individuals, persons with persistent medical problems, victims of natural disasters, people 
living in disaster-prone areas and other groups should be assured some degree of priority in 
housing law and policy.48 
</p>
<p>63. Almost half of all complaints received by HUD (44 per cent) under the Fair Housing 
Act are from persons with disabilities.49 In 1988, the same year the Fair Housing Act was 
amended to include persons with disabilities, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act was 
implemented, mandating that all programmes, services or activities receiving public funds 
must be accessible to persons with disabilities. Section 504 also mandates that all buildings 
of five or more units must have a certain percentage of similarly accessible units, and that 
landlords must pay for &#8220;reasonable accommodation&#8221; or modifications requested by the 
tenant. However, while strong legislation exists to prevent discrimination against persons 
with disabilities, the implementation and enforcement of this legislation could be improved. 
The Special Rapporteur has received complaints that many new housing developments do 
not meet Fair Housing Act requirements. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Racial and related discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>64. Evidence shows that subprime loans were five times more likely to be made in 
neighbourhoods of African American people as compared to neighbourhoods of whites. 
Such loans were found to have been particularly marketed to minorities, even in cases 
where individuals qualified for traditional loan products.50 Minority women were 
particularly targeted. A report submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination recommended that the Department of Justice investigate and prosecute 
cases of lending discrimination, and that the United States Congress enact robust anti-
predatory lending legislation.51

<p>65. The 2008 concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination on the report of the United States expressed deep concern that minority 
groups are disproportionately concentrated in poor areas characterized by substandard 
housing conditions.52 The Committee&#8217;s recommendations on this issue are firmly supported 
by the Special Rapporteur.53 The Committee also stated its concern regarding the de facto 
racial segregation in United States public schools.54 In many communities this issue is 
directly linked to housing, as some public school districts are funded by the property taxes 
of the local community, thus providing more resources to schools in wealthier 
neighbourhoods.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that in fiscal year 2010, Congress 
appropriated $11 million for the Fair Housing Initiatives Program, aimed at assisting 
families most vulnerable to the current mortgage crisis.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>67. Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits 
States from denying the right of minorities to enjoy their own culture. Housing construction 
including building materials used and the relevant policies must appropriately enable the 
expression of cultural identity and diversity of housing. In its general comment No. 4 
(1991) on the right to adequate housing, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights found that development or modernization activities should not sacrifice such cultural 
dimensions of housing.  
</p>
<p>68. The issues facing Native Americans both off and on reservations are complex, and 
housing is but one aspect. The subsidized housing visited by the Special Rapporteur was 
built as &#8220;cluster housing&#8221;, in a traditional suburban model of a cluster of several homes in 
close proximity. She heard complaints that such a model was not appropriate to Native 
Americans who favour houses which are much more spread out, a model which is closer to 
their traditional mode of living. The choice of cluster housing is partially due to resource 
constraints, however critics contend that this approach has deprived Native Americans of 
their cultural norms of housing and privacy and has thus led to the creation of destructive 
social environments. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur applauds the Government&#8217;s historic gesture of engagement 
with Native Americans through the White House Tribal Nations Conference on 5 
November 2009, and encourages continued collaboration and discussion in the future. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Discrimination based on economic and other status  
</b></p>
<p><b>  &#8220;One strike and you&#8217;re out&#8221; zero tolerance policies 
</b></p>
<p>70. Subsidized housing applicants are subject to denial based on their criminal or drug 
record, and tenants are subject to eviction based on such records. Such policies were 
introduced with the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, part of the country&#8217;s &#8220;war on drugs&#8221;. The 
Anti-Drug Abuse Act required public housing authorities to adopt leases which required 
eviction of public housing tenants who engaged in criminal activity on or near public

<p>housing premises.55 It was later reinforced in 1990 by the Cranston-Gonzalez National 
Affordable Housing Act.56  
</p>
<p>71. In March 1996 President Clinton signed into law the Housing Opportunity Program 
Extension Act of 1996 creating a new HUD policy which gave additional authority to 
public housing authorities to screen tenants, enforce leases, and evict tenants. This Act 
authorized public housing authorities to evict tenants for criminal or drug-related activity 
which took place both &#8220;on or off&#8221; housing authority premises, whereas previous laws 
allowed for such evictions only if such activity occurred &#8220;on or near&#8221; housing authority 
premises. The Act also states that the &#8220;National Crime Information Center, police 
departments, and other law enforcement agencies shall upon request, provide information to 
public housing agencies regarding the criminal conviction records of adult applicants for, or 
tenants of, public housing for purposes of applicant screening, lease enforcement, and 
eviction&#8221;. The Act stipulates that public housing agencies must provide the tenant with a 
copy of his/her criminal record, as well as an opportunity to dispute its accuracy and 
relevance. Thus, public housing authorities were given the mandate to establish their own 
standards to achieve these federal mandates. 
</p>
<p>72. Additional reforms were instituted with the 1998 Quality Housing and Work 
Responsibility Act (QHWRA), which gave public housing authorities the right to refuse to 
sign new contracts with landlords administering project-based Section 8 contracts if they 
refused to, or had a history of refusing to, implement zero tolerance policies.57 
</p>
<p>73. While the Special Rapporteur recognizes the duty of the State to protect its 
population, she is concerned by the discriminatory nature of these practices towards the 
residents of public housing, and their negative, fragmenting effects on families.58  
</p>
<p>74. These policies also negatively target victims of domestic abuse, as they do not take 
into account whether tenants who are subject to eviction are the victims or perpetrators of 
criminal activity.59 Landlords have evicted women from their homes if they report abuse to 
police, even if their abuser does not live with them. This serves as an obvious disincentive 
for women to report abuse, encourages a dangerous cycle of secrecy around domestic 
abuse, and may force women to choose between abuse and homelessness. The Violence 
Against Women Act of 2005 (VAWA) prohibits such evictions by requiring public housing 
authorities to use leases which stipulate that domestic violence is not a cause for eviction of 
victims of such violence. It also prohibits public housing authorities from denying housing 
admission based on an applicant being the victim of domestic or dating violence, or 
stalking. Despite the presence of VAWA, the Special Rapporteur still received reports from 
civil society organizations that women victims of domestic violence continue to experience 
discrimination.

<p>75. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes HUD&#8217;s initiative to examine the extent that 
lesbians, gay men, bisexual and transgender people experience discrimination when renting 
or owning their homes. 
</p>
<p><b>  Housing discrimination based on source of income 
</b></p>
<p>76. Housing discrimination based on the source of income is prohibited only in certain 
districts. Such laws prevent anyone from refusing to sell, rent, or otherwise transfer housing 
based on the source of a person&#8217;s income. The Special Rapporteur repeatedly heard reports 
that tenants with Section 8 vouchers had great difficulty finding landlords willing to accept 
these vouchers. This puts voucher holders at risk of losing their benefit, as they can lose the 
voucher if they do not obtain housing within 90 days and do not obtain an extension. Once 
a voucher is lost, beneficiaries may have to go back on a long waiting list, or lose their 
chance to benefit at all if the waiting list is closed. In addition, properties that do accept 
such vouchers tend to be in poorer neighbourhoods and in buildings with poor maintenance.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Participation 
</b></p>
<p>77. The realization of the right to adequate housing requires that individuals and 
communities are consulted and able actively to participate in the decisions that affect their 
right to housing. In its general comment No. 25 (1996) on participation in public affairs and 
the right to vote, the Human Rights Committee recognizes the right of every citizen to take 
part in the conduct of public affairs. Unfortunately, government agencies too often make 
decisions without the necessary information on how they will affect the lives of the people 
involved. In adopting measures to achieve the full realization of the right to adequate 
housing, a genuine consultation with, and participation by, all those affected, including the 
homeless, the inadequately housed and their representatives, should be guaranteed. Efforts 
should be made to ensure that residents are involved from the beginning of any 
redevelopment or other projects, and continue to be engaged during the entire process. 
</p><p>78. The Special Rapporteur received a number of complaints about the lack of 
meaningful participation in decision-making on national housing policies, including HOPE 
VI. Residents at Argyll Gardens complained that they felt they have no voice or 
participation in key decisions which affect their lives.60 Residents from La Villa Hermosa 
noted that tenants should be notified early when new companies take over contracts for 
Section 8 housing.61 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the high quality of the majority of 
housing in the United States, as well as the availability and quality of utilities and 
services. However, she expresses her deep concern about the millions of people living 
in the United States today who face serious challenges in accessing affordable and 
adequate housing, issues long faced by the poorest people and today affecting a 
greater proportion of society. A new face of homelessness is appearing, with 
increasing numbers of working families and individuals finding themselves on the 
streets, or living in shelters or in transitional housing arrangements with friends and 
family. Federal funding for low-income housing has been cut over the past decades,

<p><b>leading to a reduced stock and quality of subsidized housing. In addition, several cities 
have experienced a real estate boom which has led to increased housing prices. The 
subprime mortgage crisis has increased an already large gap between the supply and 
demand of affordable housing, and the economic crisis which followed has led to 
increased unemployment and an even greater need for affordable housing.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Special Rapporteur noted throughout the visit that there is a long-standing 
commitment to provide adequate housing within their means for all Americans and an 
acknowledgement that the history of housing policy in the United States has been 
problematic. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan has stated that in many cases 
neighbourhoods of concentrated poverty were the result of government policy.</b>62<b> 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Housing is not simply about bricks and mortar, nor is it simply a financial 
asset. Housing includes a sense of community, trust and bonds built between 
neighbours over time; the schools which educate the children; and the businesses 
which support the local economy and provide needed goods and services. Government 
policy has sometimes resulted in tearing apart this important sense of community, 
removing a source of stability for subsidized housing residents, and engendering a 
sense of mistrust of Government regard for their interests.  
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The present Government is actively pursuing policy change to better meet the 
housing needs of its population. The Special Rapporteur strongly urges the 
Government to increase opportunities for dialogue with civil society and tenant 
organizations. The town hall format which was used during her visit was met with 
broad support from civil society organizations, and she recommends that it be 
explored for interaction between local public housing authorities and residents. Real 
participation of those affected by the housing crisis is essential for a successful 
outcome to current efforts to change and reform.  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the measures adopted by the new 
Administration to improve access to adequate housing, including committing 
significant resources to housing, addressing mortgage modification programmes, and 
neighbourhood enhancement and emergency recovery initiatives through the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> In a spirit of cooperation and dialogue, the Special Rapporteur makes several 
recommendations which echo the voices of the hundreds of individuals with whom she 
spoke during her visit. She hopes this report will serve as a tool for further dialogue 
between civil society organizations and residents, and the Government.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Federal housing assistance programmes  
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the existing federal housing assistance 
programmes that play a very important role in providing affordable housing to low-
income residents. Given their importance, the Special Rapporteur believes that they 
should receive more funding.

</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur considers that, given the crisis in affordable housing, 
an immediate moratorium is required on the demolition and disposition of public 
housing until such time as one-for-one replacement housing is secured, and the right 
to return is guaranteed to all residents. Housing should be made available for 
displaced residents before any unit is demolished.

the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, poor communities will be able to stay in their 
neighbourhoods once development takes place.</b>

</i></p>
<p>90.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to assign more resources to 
Section 8 vouchers. Legislative mechanisms should be established in order to 
encourage the extension of expiring Section 8 unit contracts, as well as other expiring 
affordable housing programmes involving private landlords.

<p>92. <b>Tenant protection legislation should be further strengthened for renters of 
foreclosed properties. The Helping Families Save Their Home Act (P.L. 111-22): 
Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act (Title VII) should be extended beyond 2012 and 
become permanent protection. </b> 
</p>
<p>93. <b>Empty foreclosed properties should be made available using incentives for the 
sale of the property to non-profit organizations or community land trusts, in order to 
increase the stock of affordable housing.</b> 
</p>
<p>94.<b> The Making Home Affordable Program is a positive initiative addressing 
foreclosure prevention. Further measures are necessary to ensure that an increased 
number of homeowners are benefited by the programme. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Senate to continue its discussion on the adoption of new legislation on 
the creation of a national foreclosure prevention programme, and encourages the 
Government to develop a study on the impact of this programme and alternative 
measures to address the foreclosure crisis in the medium and long term.

<p><b>  Homelessness 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The Interagency Council on Homelessness should develop constructive 
alternatives to the criminalization of homelessness in full consultation with members

</b></p>
<p><i>  Discrimination against persons with disabilities 
</i></p>
<p>100.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the United States Government to strengthen its 
enforcement and implementation of the Fair Housing Act and to promote accessible

opportunity and access to affordable housing for persons with disabilities. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes HUD&#8217;s plans to strengthen its enforcement of the Fair Housing 
Act.

<p><i>  Discrimination and zero tolerance policies 
</i></p>
<p>101.<b> The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the Government&#8217;s efforts to maintain a 
safe environment within subsidized housing developments. However, she suggests that 
zero tolerance policies are not an answer for achieving this aim, and suggests the 
Government commit resources to determine the real effects of such policies on 
families, particularly minority families, and reform these policies.

<p>102.<b> The Special Rapporteur was dismayed to observe the dire housing situation 
faced by some Native American tribes. She encourages the Government to devote

housing authorities to institutionalize mechanisms for real community participation

<p><i>  Housing discrimination based on source of income 
</i>103.<b> The Special Rapporteur commends those districts that prohibit housing 
discrimination on the basis of source of income, and recommends that the United 
States enact legislation to extend this to the national level. Such a policy would address 
a grave form of discrimination, as well as assist in the full utilization of the voucher 
programme, thus alleviating some of the difficulties in finding landlords who will
