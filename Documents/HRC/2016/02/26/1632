<p><b>  25/&#8230;  The role of good governance in the promotion and protection of 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of 
achievement of all peoples and all nations, and also the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
of Action, which affirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent 
and interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 7/11 of 27 March 2008 and 19/20 of 23 
March 2012, and all other resolutions relevant to the role of good governance in the 
promotion of human rights, as well as the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the resolve of States parties to the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption, and the commitment made by all States in the 2005 World Summit Outcome1 
to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels, and noting with interest the 
provisions of the Convention that have led to the development of a mechanism among 
States parties to review their progress in combating corruption, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Noting</i> the ongoing work by several important initiatives towards the deepening of 
good governance practices at the national, regional and international levels, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance of a conducive environment, at both the national and 
international levels, for the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and 
of the mutually reinforcing relationship between good governance and human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that transparent, responsible, accountable, open and participatory 
government, responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, is the foundation on 
which good governance rests, and that such a foundation is one of the indispensable 
conditions for the full realization of human rights, including the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that good governance at the national and international levels is essential 
for sustained economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and 
hunger and, in this context, reaffirming the Millennium Declaration, the 2005 World 
Summit Outcome and the outcome of the 2010 High-level Summit on the Millennium 
Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the increasing awareness in the international community of the 
detrimental impact of widespread corruption on human rights through both the weakening 
of institutions and the erosion of public trust in government, as well as through the 
impairment of the ability of Governments to fulfil all their human rights obligations, 
</p>
<p><i>Realizing</i> that the fight against corruption at all levels plays an important role in the 
promotion and protection of human rights and in the process of creating an environment 
conducive to their full enjoyment, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that effective anti-corruption measures and the protection of human 
rights, including through strengthening transparency and accountability in government, are 
mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with interest</i> the outcome of the third, fourth and fifth sessions of the 
Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, held 
in Doha in 2009, in Marrakech, Morocco, in 2011, and in Panama City, in 2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the importance of policy coherence and coordination in intergovernmental 
processes in the area of the promotion and protection of human rights, on the one hand, and 
of anti-corruption initiatives, on the other, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing also</i> the importance of developing and implementing national legislation 
on the promotion of access to information and of strengthening the administration of 
justice, transparency, accountability and good governance at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the right of every citizen to have access, in general terms of equality, to 
public service in his/her country as enshrined in article 21 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and article 25 (c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that a professional, accountable and transparent public service 
upholding the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity is one of the 
essential components of good governance, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that the knowledge, training and awareness of public servants, as 
well as the promotion of a human rights culture within the public service, play a vital role 
in promoting respect for and the realization of human rights in society, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the publication of report of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the role of the public service as an essential </p>


<p>component of good governance in the promotion and protection of human rights,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/25/27.  </footnote> and takes 
note with interest of her conclusions and recommendations; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also welcomes</i> the growing trend towards the universal ratification of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption, and encourages States that have not yet 
done so to consider ratifying this important international instrument; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Underlines</i> that the primary responsibility lies with States at the national 
level, including through their Constitutional provisions and other enabling legislation, 
consistent with their international obligations, to ensure that professional public services 
uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and are predicated on 
good governance principles, including impartiality, rule of law, transparency, accountability 
and combating corruption, and stresses the importance of human rights training and 
education in this regard; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Invites</i> the Secretary-General to ensure the upholding of the integrity of the 
United Nations system in its service of humanity, and improved coordination between 
United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, with a view to ensuring that the United 
Nations system continues to improve the quality of its work at all levels, including in 
support of objectives and priorities at the national level; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to organize, at the thirtieth session of the 
Human Rights Council, a panel discussion on a human rights-based approach to good 
governance in the public service, and to liaise with States, relevant United Nations bodies, 
agencies and programmes, treaty bodies, special procedures and regional human rights 
mechanisms, as well as with civil society, including non-governmental organizations, and 
national human rights institutions, with a view to ensuring their contribution to the panel 
discussion; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the panel 
discussion in the format of summary report and to present it to the Human Rights Council 
at its thirty-first session.
