ENERGEN CORPORATION
CONDENSED NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Energen Corporation (Energen or the Company) is an oil and natural gas exploration and
production company engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas
liquids and natural gas primarily in the Permian Basin in west Texas. Headquartered in
Birmingham, Alabama, our operations are conducted through our subsidiary, Energen
Resources Corporation (Energen Resources). The unaudited consolidated financial statements
and notes should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, included in the 2015 Annual Report of
Energen on Form 10-K.
Our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include Energen and its
subsidiaries, principally Energen Resources, and have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-
X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures required for complete financial
statements. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year. In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial
statements reflect all adjustments necessary to present a fair statement of our financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows for the periods and as of the dates shown. Such
adjustments consist of normal recurring items. Certain reclassifications were made to conform
prior periods’ financial statements to the current-quarter presentation.
Liquidity
At June 30, 2016, we had $309.9 million of cash on hand and $1.05 billion of committed
financing available under our credit facility. To finance our operations, working capital and capital
spending, we expect to use internally generated cash flow from operations supplemented by our
existing five-year syndicated credit facility. As discussed in Note 14, Acquisition and Disposition
of Properties, through June 30, 2016, Energen has completed a series of asset sales of certain
non-core Permian Basin assets in the Delaware Basin in Texas for an aggregate purchase price
of $294 million.
Access to capital is an integral part of Energen’s business plan. As discussed in Note 6, Equity
Offering, during the first quarter of 2016, Energen issued 18,170,000 additional shares of
common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $381.1 million, after deducting
offering expenses. Energen may also issue long-term debt and additional equity periodically to
replace short-term obligations, enhance liquidity and provide for permanent financing. As of June
30, 2016, the Company has $554.0 million outstanding under long term note agreements and no
outstanding amounts under its revolving credit facility. While we expect to have ongoing access
to our credit facility and capital markets, continued access could be adversely affected by current
and future economic and business conditions and possible credit rating downgrades.
Workforce Reduction
On January 22, 2016 and March 18, 2016, we reduced our workforce as part of an overall plan to
reduce costs and better align our workforce with the needs of our business in light of current oil
and natural gas commodity prices. In connection with the reductions, we incurred charges of
approximately 5.0 million during the year-to-date 2016 for one-time termination benefits which
are included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated income statement.
8
2. DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS
We periodically enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price
fluctuations on oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production. Such instruments may include
over-the-counter (OTC) swaps, options and basis swaps typically executed with investment and
commercial banks and energy-trading firms. Derivative transactions are pursuant to standing
authorizations by the Board of Directors, which do not authorize speculative positions.
The following tables detail the offsetting of derivative assets and liabilities as well as the fair
values of derivatives on the balance sheets:

Due to the volatility of commodity prices, the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments is
subject to fluctuation from period to period, which could result in significant differences between
the current estimated fair value and the ultimate settlement price. Additionally, Energen is at risk
of economic loss based upon the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We were in a net loss
position with thirteen of our active counterparties and in a net gain position with the remaining
two at June 30, 2016. The counterparty net gain positions at June 30, 2016, Morgan Stanley
Capital Group Inc. and BP Corporation North America Inc., constituted approximately $1.4 million
and $0.9 million, respectively, of Energen’s total net loss on fair value of derivatives.

During 2016, Energen entered into three-way collars which are a combination of three options: a
sold call, a purchased put and a sold put. The sold call establishes the maximum price that the
Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes. The purchased put establishes the
minimum price that the Company will receive for the contracted volumes. The Company will
receive the market price for the contracted volumes if the market price is between the sold call
and the purchased put. If, however, the market price for the commodity falls below the sold put
strike price, the minimum price that the Company will receive for the contracted volumes equals
the market price plus the excess of the purchased put strike price over the sold put strike price.
As of June 30, 2016, the maximum term over which Energen has hedged exposures to the
variability of cash flows is through December 31, 2017.

3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). In
determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches and classify all assets and liabilities
based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Observable
inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources, whereas unobservable inputs
reflect our own considerations about the assumptions other market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
Assessing the significance of a particular input may require judgment considering factors specific
to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the asset or liability and its placement
within the fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the
observability of inputs as follows:
  
Level 1 -Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level
2 -
Level
3 -
Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included within Level 1, which are
either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data as of the
reporting date;
Pricing that requires inputs that are both significant and unobservable to the calculation of
the fair value measure. The fair value measure represents estimates of the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are
developed based on the best available information and subject to cost-benefit constraints.
No transfers between fair value hierarchy levels occurred during the three months and six months
ended June 30, 2016.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Energen classifies the fair value of multiple derivative instruments executed under master netting
arrangements as net derivative assets and liabilities. The following fair value hierarchy tables
present information about Energen’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis:

Derivative Instruments: The fair value of Energen’s derivative commodity instruments is
determined using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including
market-based inputs to models and broker or dealer quotations. Our OTC derivative contracts
trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information as compared to markets with actively
traded, unadjusted quoted prices; accordingly, the determination of fair value is inherently more
difficult. OTC derivatives for which we are able to substantiate fair value through direct or indirect
observable market prices are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. These Level 2
fair values consist of swaps and options priced in reference to NYMEX oil and natural gas prices.
OTC derivatives valued using unobservable market prices have been classified within Level 3 of
the fair value hierarchy. These Level 3
11
fair values include basin specific, basis and natural gas liquids swaps. We consider the
frequency of pricing and variability in pricing between sources in determining whether a market is
considered active. While Energen does not have access to the specific assumptions used in its
counterparties’ valuation models, Energen maintains communications with its counterparties and
discusses pricing practices. Further, we corroborate the fair value of our transactions by
comparison of market-based price sources.
Energen utilizes a discounted cash flow model in valuing its interest rate derivatives, which are
comprised of interest rate swap agreements. The fair value attributable to Energen's interest rate
derivative contracts is based on (i) the contracted notional amounts, (ii) active market-quoted
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) yield curves and (iii) the applicable credit-adjusted risk-
free rate yield curve.
At June 30, 2016, Energen had interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of $33.3
million. The interest rate swaps exchange a variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate of
1.0425 percent. The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a $0.1 million and a $0.2 million
liability at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is classified as Level 2 fair
value liabilities. The fair value of our interest rate swaps are recognized on a gross basis in
accounts payable on the balance sheets.
Level 3 Fair Value Instruments: Energen prepared a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the
hypothetical effect that changes in the prices used to estimate fair value would have on the fair
value of its Level 3 instruments. We estimate that a 10 percent increase or decrease in
commodity prices would result in an approximate $4.5 million change in the fair value of open
Level 3 derivative contracts and to the results of operations.
The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of Energen’s Level 3 derivative

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in Energen’s
consolidated balance sheets. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
fair values.
Asset retirement obligations: Energen’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to the
future plugging, abandonment and reclamation of wells and facilities. We recognize a liability for
the fair value of the ARO in the periods incurred. See Note 11, Asset Retirement Obligations, for
further discussion related to these ARO’s. These assumptions are classified as Level 3 fair value.
Asset Impairments: We monitor our oil and natural gas properties as well as the market and
business environments in which we operate and make assessments about events that could
result in potential impairment. Such potential events may include, but are not limited to,
commodity price declines, unanticipated increased operating costs, and lower than expected
field production performance. If a material event occurs, Energen makes an estimate of
undiscounted future cash flows to determine whether the asset is impaired. If the asset is
impaired, we will record an impairment loss for the difference between the net book value of the
properties and the fair value of the properties. The fair value of the properties typically is
estimated using discounted cash flows and values derived from purchase and sale agreements
and similar support as applicable. Cash flow and fair value estimates require Energen to make
projections and assumptions for pricing, demand, competition, operating costs, legal and
regulatory issues, discount rates and other factors for many years into the future.
These assumptions are classified as Level 3 fair value. See Note 13, Asset Impairment, for
impairments recognized by Energen during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2015.
Financial Instruments not Carried at Fair Value
The stated value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable (net
of allowance), and short-term debt approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the
instruments. The Company invested in certain short-term investments that qualify and were
classified as cash and cash equivalents. Energen had allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.7
million at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value of Energen’s
long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $519.8 million and $690.1
million and had a carrying value of $554.0 million and $776.5 million at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair values are based on market prices of similar debt
issues having the same remaining maturities, redemption terms and credit rating. Short-term debt
is classified as Level 1 fair value and long-term debt is classified as Level 2 fair value.

The debt agreements of Energen contain financial and nonfinancial covenants including routine
matters such as timely payment of principal and interest, maintenance of corporate existence and
restrictions on liens. Although none of the agreements have events of default based on credit
ratings, the interest rates applicable to the syndicated credit facility discussed below may adjust
based on credit rating changes during certain periods.
Under Energen’s Indenture dated September 1, 1996 with The Bank of New York as Trustee, a
cross default provision provides that any debt default of more than $10 million by Energen or
Energen Resources will constitute an event of default by Energen. The Indenture does not
include a restriction on the payment of dividends.
Credit Facility: On September 2, 2014, Energen entered into a five-year syndicated secured
credit facility with domestic and foreign lenders. On April 13, 2016, the borrowing base and
aggregate commitments were reduced to $1.05 billion in association with the semi-annual
redetermination required under the agreement. Energen’s obligations under the syndicated credit
facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Energen Resources. Subject to release of collateral in
certain periods upon the achievement of certain investment grade ratings from designated ratings
agencies, the credit facility is collateralized by certain assets of Energen, including a pledge of
equity interests in subsidiaries of Energen other than Energen Resources, and by mortgages on
substantially all of Energen Resources’ oil and natural gas properties. The current credit facility
qualifies for classification as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. The financial
covenants of the credit facility require Energen to maintain a ratio of total debt to consolidated
income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, exploration
expense and other non-cash income and expenses (EBITDAX) less than or equal to 4.0 to 1.0; to
maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets (adjusted to include amounts available for
borrowings and exclude non-cash derivative instruments) to consolidated current liabilities
(adjusted to exclude maturities under the credit facility and non-cash derivative instruments)
greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0; and, during certain periods, to maintain a ratio of the net
present value of proved reserves of our oil and natural gas properties to consolidated total debt
greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.0. We are also bound by covenants which limit our ability to
incur additional indebtedness, make certain distributions or alter our corporate structure. Energen
may not pay dividends during an event of default if the payment would result in an event of
default or if availability is less than 10 percent of the loan limit under the credit facility. Our credit
facility also limits our ability to enter into commodity hedges based on projected production
volumes. In addition, the terms of our credit facility limit
14
the amount we can borrow to a borrowing base amount which is determined by our lenders in
their sole discretion based on their valuation of our proved reserves and their internal criteria
including commodity price outlook. The borrowing base amount is subject to redetermination
semi-annually and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. Our next scheduled
redetermination is October 1, 2016.
Under the credit facility, a cross default provision provides that any debt default of more than $75
million by Energen or Energen Resources will constitute an event of default by Energen.
Upon an uncured event of default under the credit facility, all amounts owing under the credit
facility, if any, depending on the nature of the event of default will automatically, or may upon
notice by the administrative agent or the requisite lenders thereunder, become immediately due
and payable and the lenders may terminate their commitments under the defaulted facility.
Energen was in compliance with the terms of its credit facility as of June 30, 2016.

6. EQUITY OFFERING
During the first quarter of 2016, Energen issued 18,170,000 additional shares of common stock
through a public equity offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $381.1 million, after
deducting offering expenses. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings
under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
During the second quarter of 2015, Energen issued 5,700,000 additional shares of common
stock through a public equity offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $398.6 million,
after deducting offering expenses. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings
under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes.
7. STOCK COMPENSATION
Stock Incentive Plan
Stock Options: The Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options and
non-qualified stock options to officers and key employees. Options granted under the Stock
Incentive Plan provide for the purchase of Energen common stock at not less than the fair market
value on the date the option was granted. The sale or transfer of the shares is limited during
certain periods. All outstanding options vest within three years from date of grant and expire 10
years from the grant date.
Restricted Stock: Additionally, the Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock
and restricted stock units. In March 2016, Energen awarded 154,633 restricted stock units with a
grant-date fair value of $26.77. In May 2016, Energen awarded 39,971 and 2,869 restricted stock
units with a grant-date fair value of $40.73 and $47.04, respectively. These awards have a three
year vesting period and were valued based on the quoted market price of Energen’s common
stock at the date of grant.
Performance Share Awards: The Stock Incentive Plan also provides for the grant of performance
share awards to eligible employees based on predetermined Company performance criteria at
the end of an award period. The Stock Incentive Plan provides that payment of earned
performance share awards be made in the form of Energen common stock. Performance share
awards are valued using the Monte Carlo model which uses historical volatility and other
variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the market condition of the award. Energen
granted 136,191 performance share awards during the first quarter of 2016 with a three year
vesting period and a grant-date fair value of $22.74. Energen granted 30,825 performance share
awards during the second quarter of 2016 with a three year vesting period and a grant-date fair
value of $36.83.
16
Stock Repurchase Program
During the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, Energen had non-cash purchases
of approximately $19,000 and $2.4 million, respectively, of Energen common stock in conjunction
with tax withholdings on our non-qualified deferred compensation plan and other stock
compensation. Energen had non-cash purchases of Energen common stock of $43,000 and $4.4
million during the three months and six months June 30, 2015. Energen utilized internally
generated cash flows in payment of the related tax withholdings.

remainder of approximately $14.5 million paid in the first quarter of 2016. The Company expects
to make no additional benefit payments with respect to the termination of the non-qualified
supplemental retirement plans. In the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, Energen incurred a
settlement charge of $3.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for the payment of lump sums
from the non-qualified supplemental retirement plans. Also in the first quarter and second quarter

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Commitments and Agreements: Under various agreements for third-party gathering, treatment,
transportation or other services, Energen is committed to deliver minimum production volumes or
to pay certain costs in the event the minimum quantities are not delivered. These delivery
commitments are approximately 4.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) through October
2020.
Legal Matters: Energen and its affiliates are, from time to time, parties to various pending or
threatened legal proceedings and we have accrued a provision for our estimated liability. Certain
of these lawsuits include claims for punitive damages in addition to other specified relief. We
recognize a liability for contingencies, including an estimate of legal costs to be incurred, when
information available indicates both a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. Based upon information presently available, and in light of available legal
and other defenses, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not
considered material in relation to the respective financial positions of Energen and its affiliates. It
should be noted, however, that there is uncertainty in the valuation of pending claims and
prediction of litigation results.
On November 4, 2015, Energen Resources filed a quiet title action against Endeavor Energy
Resources. L.P. in the District Court of Howard County, Texas, to remove a cloud on the title to
approximately 10,000 acres leased by Energen Resources in that county. Energen Resources
believes the cloud on title arises from a prior, unreleased but partially terminated oil and gas
lease covering the leased lands. Endeavor filed a counterclaim alleging Energen Resources
tortiously interfered with a prospective contract seeking $300 million in damages. On April 28,
2016, the trial judge ruled with respect to the acreage not held by production that Endeavor’s
lease terminated prior to the date Energen Resources entered into its lease and additionally
ruled that Endeavor’s claim for tortuous interference will be dismissed with prejudice. Ancillary
issues remain before the trial court. Following the court’s ruling on these remaining issues, an
appeal is expected.
Environmental Matters: Various environmental laws and regulations apply to the operations of
Energen and Energen Resources. Historically, the cost of environmental compliance has not
materially affected our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. New regulations,
enforcement policies, claims for damages or other events could result in significant unanticipated
costs.
During January 2014, Energen Resources responded to a General Notice and Information
Request from the Environmental Protection Agency regarding the Reef Environmental Site in
Sylacauga, Talladega County, Alabama. The letter identifies Energen Resources as a potentially
responsible party under The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act for the cleanup of the Site. In 2008, Energen hired a third party to transport
approximately 3,000 gallons of non-hazardous wastewater to Reef Environmental for wastewater
treatment. Reef Environmental ceased operating its wastewater treatment system in 2010. Due to
its one time use of Reef Environmental for a small volume of non-hazardous wastewater,
Energen Resources has not accrued a liability for cleanup of the Site.
New Mexico Audits: In 2011, Energen Resources received an Order to Perform Restructured
Accounting and Pay Additional Royalties (the Order), following an audit performed by the
Taxation and Revenue Department (the Department) of the State of New Mexico on behalf of the
Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), of federal oil and gas leases in New Mexico. The
audit covered periods from January 2004 through December 2008 and included a review of the
computation and payment of royalties due on minerals removed from specified U.S. federal
leases. The Order addressed ONRR’s efforts to change accounting and reporting practices, and
to unbundle fees charged by third parties that gather, compress and transport natural gas
production. ONRR now maintains that all or some of such fees are not deductible.
Energen Resources appealed the Order in 2011 and in July 2012, on a motion from ONRR, the
Order was remanded. In August 2014, ONRR issued its Revised Order and Energen Resources
appealed the Revised Order. In the Revised Order, ONRR ordered that Energen pay additional
royalties on production from certain federal leases in the amount of $129,700. At ONRR’s request
the Revised Order was also remanded in August 2015. On April 15, 2016 ONRR issued its
Second Revised Order. The Second Revised Order directs Energen Resources to pay additional
royalties of $189,000, replacing the previous demand of $129,700. Energen had previously
estimated that application of the ONRR position to all of the Company’s federal leases would
result in ONRR claims up to approximately $24 million, plus interest and penalties from 2004
forward. ONRR began implementing its unbundling initiative in 2010, but seeks to implement its
revisions retroactively, despite the fact that they conflict with previous audits, allowances and
industry practice. Energen plans to appeal and vigorously contest the Second Revised Order, the
predecessor orders and the findings. Management is unable, at this time, to determine a range of
reasonably possible losses, and no amount has been accrued as of June 30, 2016.
18
10. EXPLORATORY COSTS
Energen capitalizes exploratory drilling costs until a determination is made that the well or project
has either found proved reserves or is impaired. After an exploratory well has been drilled and
found oil and natural gas reserves, a determination may be pending as to whether the oil and
natural gas quantities can be classified as proved. In those circumstances, Energen continues to
capitalize the drilling costs pending the determination of proved status if (i) the well has found a
sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (ii) Energen is
making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of
the project. Capitalized exploratory drilling costs are presented in proved properties in the
balance sheets. If the exploratory well is determined to be a dry hole, the costs are charged to
exploration expense. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs, are
expensed as incurred.

At June 30, 2016, Energen had 31 gross exploratory wells either drilling or waiting on results
from completion and testing in the Permian Basin. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had two
gross wells capitalized greater than a year. These wells are scheduled for completion during
2017. No wells were capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2015.
11. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
Energen’s asset retirement obligations (ARO) primarily relate to the future plugging,
abandonment and reclamation of wells and facilities. We recognize a liability for the fair value of
the ARO in the periods incurred. The ARO fair value liability is determined by calculating the
present value of the estimated future cash outflows we expect to incur to plug, abandon and
reclaim our producing properties at the end of their productive lives, and is recognized on a
discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to Energen. Subsequent
to initial measurement, liabilities are accreted to their present value and capitalized costs are
depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Upon settlement of the liability,
Energen may recognize a gain or loss for differences between estimated and actual settlement
costs.

Non-cash impairment writedowns are reflected in asset impairment on the consolidated income
statement.
Permian Basin: During the first quarter of 2016, Energen recognized non-cash impairment
writedowns in the Permian Basin of $208.3 million to adjust the carrying amount of these
properties to their fair value. We estimate future discounted cash flows in determining fair value
using commodity assumptions, which are based on the commodity price curve for five years and
then escalated at 3 percent through our assumed price cap. Our commodity price assumptions
declined in the first quarter by approximately 5 percent for oil and 4 percent for natural gas in
comparable periods. During the second quarter of 2015, Energen recognized non-cash
impairment writedowns on certain properties in the Central Basin Platform of $51.5 million.
Estimated future cash flows were revised due to the receipt of an unsolicited offer for these
properties. During the first quarter of 2015, Energen recognized a non-cash impairment
writedown of $4.3 million in the Delaware Basin.
In the first quarter of 2016, Energen recognized unproved leasehold writedowns of $4.1 million
primarily on Permian Basin oil properties in the Delaware Basin and the Central Basin Platform.
Energen recognized unproved leasehold writedowns primarily on Permian Basin oil properties in
the Delaware Basin of $10.9 million during the year-to-date 2015.
San Juan Basin: During the first quarter of 2016, Energen recognized non-cash impairment
writedowns on held for sale properties in the San Juan Basin of $7.5 million to adjust the carrying
amount of these properties to their fair value.
During the first quarter of 2016, Energen recognized an insignificant amount of unproved
leasehold writedowns on San Juan Basin properties. Energen recognized unproved leasehold
writedowns on San Juan Basin properties of $0.2 million during the six months ended June 30,
2015.

14. ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES
In June 2016, Energen entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell certain non-core
Permian Basin assets in the Delaware Basin. This sale is expected to close during the third
quarter of 2016 and have an effective date of June 1, 2016. Energen classified these properties
as held for sale as of June 30, 2016.
In July 2016, Energen completed the sale of the remainder of its San Juan Basin assets in New
Mexico for an aggregate purchase price of $77.5 million. This transaction had a closing date of
July 15, 2016 with an effective date of March 1, 2016. Pre-tax proceeds to Energen were
approximately $74.8 million after purchase price adjustments of approximately $2.7 million
related to the operations of the properties subsequent to the effective dates and other one-time
adjustments including certain amounts due the buyer, but before consideration of transaction
costs of approximately $0.5 million. Energen will use proceeds from the sale to fund ongoing
operations. Energen classified these properties as held for sale as of December 31, 2015.
Through June 30, 2016, Energen has completed a series of asset sales of certain non-core
Permian Basin assets in the Delaware Basin in Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $294
million. These transactions had closing dates of June 3, 7 and 30 of 2016 with various effective
dates ranging from March 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016. Pre-tax proceeds to Energen were
approximately $284.8 million after purchase price adjustments of approximately $9.6 million
related to the operations of the properties subsequent to the effective dates and other one-time
adjustments including transfer payments and certain amounts due the buyer, but before
consideration of transaction costs of approximately $2.5 million. Energen recognized pre-tax
gains of $161.1 million on the sales. Energen used proceeds from the sales to fund ongoing
operations.
Summarized below are the consolidated results of operations for the three months and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, on an unaudited pro forma basis which gives effect to
the series of asset sales in the Permian Basin (closed through June 30, 2016)as if they had
occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The pro forma financial information
does not purport to be indicative of results of operations that would have occurred had the
transaction occurred on the basis assumed above nor are they indicative of results of the future
operations of the enterprises.

On March 31, 2015, Energen completed the sale of the majority of its natural gas assets in the
San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado (effective as of January 1, 2015) for an aggregate
purchase price of $395 million. The sales proceeds were reduced by purchase price adjustments
of approximately $11 million related to the operations of the San Juan Basin properties
subsequent to December 31, 2014 and one-time adjustments related primarily to liabilities
assumed by the buyer, which resulted in pre-tax proceeds to Energen of approximately $384
million before consideration of transaction costs of approximately $2.8 million. Energen
recognized a pre-tax gain of $27.0 million on the sale. Energen used proceeds from the sale to
reduce long-term indebtedness. At December 31, 2014, proved reserves associated with these
San Juan Basin properties totaled 69,038 MBOE.
Energen completed an estimated $27.2 million in various purchases of unproved leasehold
largely in the Permian Basin during the six months ended June 30, 2016. During the six months
ended June 30, 2015, Energen completed an estimated total of $46.0 million in various
purchases of unproved leasehold.
15. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard
Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,
which makes a number of changes meant to simplify and improve accounting for share-based
payments. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those annual periods. Energen does not expect the adoption of this
ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. This update increases
transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance
sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The amendment is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Energen does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs. This update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt
liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning on
or after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance
Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. This update clarifies the guidance regarding
line-of-credit arrangements with regards to the ASU No. 2015-03. ASU 2015-15 allows entities to
defer and present debt issue costs as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt
issue costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. The adoption of ASU No.
2015-03 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of Energen. The
additional disclosures are included in Note 4, Long-Term Debt.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No, 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This update codifies management’s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue
as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for
interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The
amendments in this ASU are not expected to impact the Company's financial position or results
of operations. The new guidance will require a formal assessment of going concern by
management based on the criteria prescribed. The Company is reviewing its policies and
processes to ensure compliance with this new guidance.
23
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This
update is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. It also requires additional disclosure about
the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
contracts. Companies may apply this update retrospectively or using a modified retrospective
approach to adjust retained earnings. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which deferred the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09
to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within
that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial
statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS
Energen Corporation (Energen or the Company) is an oil and natural gas exploration and
production company engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas
liquids and natural gas primarily in the Permian Basin in west Texas. Our operations are
conducted through our subsidiary, Energen Resources Corporation (Energen Resources).
Energen is focused on increasing its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production and
proved reserves largely through active development and/or exploratory programs in the Permian
Basin. The Company seeks to expand its footprint primarily through acquisitions of proved
properties and unproved leasehold within areas of existing operations. All oil, natural gas liquids
and natural gas production is sold to third parties. Energen operates properties for its own
interest and that of its joint interest owners. This role includes overall project management and
day-to-day decision-making relative to project operations.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Overview of Second Quarter and Year-to-Date 2016 Results and Activities
During the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year, we:
•experienced a significant decline in commodity prices;
completed a series of asset sales of certain non-core Permian Basin assets in the Delaware
•
Basin in Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $294 million and
realized a 39.1 percent decrease in general and administrative (G&A) expense and a 20 percent
decrease in oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production expense.
•
•
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year,
we:
expanded development and exploratory activities in the Permian Basin increasing production by
550 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE);
•experienced a significant decline in commodity prices;
issued 18,170,000 additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering receiving
net proceeds of approximately $381.1 million and
realized a 24.9 percent decrease in G&A expense and a 25.4 percent decrease in oil, natural
gas liquids and natural gas production expense.
•
•
Quarter ended June 30, 2016 vs. quarter ended June 30, 2015
Energen had net income of $36.8 million ($0.38 per diluted share) for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared with a net loss of $111.6 million ($1.52 per diluted share) for the
same period in the prior year. This change in net income was primarily the result of:
•
•
•
gain in the second quarter of 2016 on a series of asset sales of certain non-core Permian Basin
assets in the Delaware Basin in Texas (approximately $103 million after-tax);
lower year-over-year after-tax losses of $36 million on open derivatives (resulting from an after-
tax $39.1 million non-cash loss on open derivatives for the second quarter of 2016 and an after-
tax $75.1 million non-cash loss on open derivatives for the second quarter of 2015);
non-cash impairments in 2015 on certain oil properties in the Permian Basin (approximately $33
million after-tax);
decreased depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense (approximately $21
million after-tax);
•decreased G&A expense (approximately $9.7 million after-tax);
decreased oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production expense (approximately $6.9
million after-tax);
•lower exploration expense (approximately $6.1 million after-tax);
additional unproved leasehold writedowns in 2015 primarily on Permian Basin properties in the
Delaware Basin (approximately $4.9 million after-tax) and
•lower production and ad valorem taxes (approximately $1.3 million after-tax).

•decreased oil and natural gas liquids production volumes (approximately $1.2 million after-tax),
Six months ended June 30, 2016 vs. six months ended June 30, 2015
For the 2016 year-to-date, Energen had a net loss of $166.4 million ($1.81 per diluted share) as
compared with net loss of $127.0 million ($1.74 per diluted share) for the same period in the prior
year. This change in net loss was primarily the result of:
•
•
•
non-cash impairments on certain Permian Basin oil properties primarily in the Central Basin
Platform (approximately $120.3 million after-tax) and the Delaware Basin (approximately $13.7
million after-tax);
•loss on closed derivatives (approximately $101.8 million after-tax);
lower realized oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas commodity prices (approximately $67.4
million after-tax);
gain in 2015 on sale of the majority of our natural gas assets in the San Juan Basin
(approximately $17.3 million after-tax);
decreased natural gas production volumes (approximately $9 million after-tax) largely due to the
prior year sale of natural gas assets in the San Juan Basin;
non-cash impairments on certain held for sale properties in the San Juan Basin (approximately
$4.8 million after-tax) and
unproved leasehold writedowns primarily on Permian Basin properties in the Delaware Basin
and Central Basin Platform (approximately $2.7 million after-tax).

•
•
partially offset by:
•
•
•
gain in the second quarter of 2016 on a series of asset sales of certain non-core Permian Basin
assets in the Delaware Basin in Texas (approximately $103 million after-tax);
lower year-over-year after-tax losses of $74.2 million on open derivatives (resulting from an
after-tax $39.3 million non-cash loss on open derivatives for the first six months of 2016 and an
after-tax $113.5 million non-cash loss on open derivatives for the first six months of 2015);
non-cash impairments in 2015 on certain oil properties in the Permian Basin (approximately

2016 Outlook
2016 Capital Estimate: Energen plans to continue investing in oil and natural gas production
operations. In the 2016 year-to-date, Energen has incurred approximately $217 million on its oil
and natural gas capital program and expects the total for 2016 to approximate $450 million,
primarily all of which is for existing properties and exploration. In addition to drilling and
development,
Energen has invested approximately $27 million on unproved leasehold acquisitions in the 2016
year-to-date ($37 million through July 31, 2016) to acquire acreage and renew leases, including
adding more than 4,500 net acres in the core Delaware and Midland basins through bolt-on
acquisitions. Capital spending is required to offset declines in production and proved oil and
natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is
highly dependent on the results of our drilling program and our ability to add reserves
economically during a challenging market for crude oil and natural gas.
Capital expenditures in the Permian Basin by area during 2016 are planned as follows:
2016
(in thousands)
$300

Energen also may allocate additional capital for other oil and natural gas activities such as
property acquisitions and additional development of existing properties. Energen may evaluate
acquisition opportunities which arise in the marketplace. Energen’s ability to invest in property
acquisitions is subject to market conditions and industry trends. Property acquisitions, except as
disclosed above, are not included in the aforementioned estimate of oil and natural gas
investments and could result in capital expenditures different from those outlined above.

Revenues: Our revenues fluctuate primarily as a result of realized commodity prices, production
volumes and the value of our derivative contracts. Our revenues are predominantly derived from
the sale of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
In the second quarter of 2016, commodity sales decreased $47.7 million or 21.7 percent from the
same period of 2015. In the six months of 2016, commodity sales decreased $112.7 million or
27.7 percent from the same period of 2015. Particular factors impacting commodity sales include
the following:
Oil volumes in the second quarter decreased 1 percent to 3,558 thousand barrels (MBbl) as
decreased drilling activity in the Midland Basin Wolfberry, 3rd Bone Spring in the Delaware
Basin and the Central Basin Platform led to production declines that were largely offset by new
well performance in the horizontal Wolfcamp and Spraberry in the Midland Basin. For the year-
to-date, oil volumes rose 1.7 percent to 6,944 MBbl.
Average realized oil prices fell 21.6 percent to $41.14 per barrel during the three months ended
June 30, 2016. Average realized oil prices decreased 26.1 percent to $35.79 per barrel during
the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Natural gas liquids production for the current quarter decreased slightly to 44.8 million gallons
(MMgal). Production declines in the Midland Basin Wolfberry, 3rd Bone Spring in the Delaware
Basin and the Central Basin Platform were largely offset by new well performance in the
horizontal Wolfcamp and Spraberry in the Midland Basin. For the year-to-date, natural gas
liquids production rose 4.6 percent to 84.8 MMgal primarily due to new completions in the
Midland Basin Wolfcamp and Spraberry partially offset by the prior year sale of natural gas
assets in the San Juan Basin.
Average realized natural gas liquids prices decreased 6.1 percent to an average price of $0.31
per gallon during the second quarter of 2016. Average realized natural gas liquids prices
decreased 15.6 percent to an average price of $0.27 per gallon during the six months ended
June 30, 2016.
Natural gas production rose 2.3 percent to 7.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) in the second quarter. For
the six months ended June 30, 2016, natural gas production declined 27.8 percent to 14.7 Bcf
primarily due to the prior year sale of natural gas assets in the San Juan Basin.
Average realized natural gas prices declined 30 percent to $1.56 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf)
during the three months ended June 30, 2016. For the current year-to-date, average realized
natural gas prices fell 36.1 percent to $1.59 per Mcf.

Realized prices exclude the effects of derivative instruments.
Losses on derivative instruments were $65.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to
losses of $51.0 million in the same period of 2015. Losses on derivative instruments were $60.4
million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to losses of $16.9 million in the same
period of 2015. Our earnings are significantly affected by the changes of our derivative
instruments. Increases or decreases in the expected commodity price outlook generally result in
the opposite effect on the fair value of our derivatives. However, these gains and losses are
generally expected to be offset by the unhedged price on the related commodities.

Energen had oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production expense of $42.8 million and
$90.6 million during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as
compared to $53.6 million and $121.3 million during the same period in 2015. Lease operating
expense may be positively or negatively impacted by property acquisitions and dispositions and
also generally reflects year-over-year increases in the number of active wells resulting from
Energen’s ongoing development and exploratory activities. Overall lease operating expense was
positively impacted in the year-to-date by the prior year sale of certain San Juan Basin natural
gas assets.
29
•
•
Lease operating expense decreased $6.2 million for the quarter largely due to decreased water
disposal costs (approximately $2.8 million), lower gathering costs (approximately $1.9 million)
and decreased non-operated costs (approximately $1.1 million). On a per unit basis, the
average lease operating expense for the current quarter was $4.93 per barrel of oil equivalent
(BOE) as compared to $5.96 per BOE in the same period a year ago.
In the year-to-date, lease operating expense decreased $13.2 million largely due to decreased
water disposal costs (approximately $5.3 million), lower labor costs (approximately $2.5 million),
decreased gathering costs (approximately $2.4 million), lower other operations and
maintenance expense (approximately $2.2 million), decreased non-operated costs
(approximately $1.9 million) and decreased electrical costs (approximately $0.9 million) partially
offset by higher equipment rental costs (approximately $2.1 million) and increased chemical and
treatment costs (approximately $1 million). On a per unit basis, the average lease operating
expense for the current quarter was $5.36 per BOE as compared to $6.11 per BOE in the same
period a year ago.
Workover and repair costs decreased approximately $3.7 million in the three months ended June
30, 2016 and $11.2 million in the year-to-date primarily due to lower incidence of well failures
and reduced costs of services and materials.
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, marketing and transportation costs decreased $0.9
million and $6.3 million in the year-to-date. The year-to-date decline was primarily due to lower
natural gas volumes as a result of the prior year sale of certain San Juan Basin natural gas
assets.
Production and ad valorem taxes: Production and ad valorem taxes were $11.3 million ($1.93 per
BOE) and $22.4 million ($1.96 per BOE) during the three months and six months ended June 30,
2016, respectively, as compared to $13.4 million ($2.28 per BOE) and $32.4 million ($2.67 per
BOE) during the same periods in 2015. In the current quarter, production-related taxes were $1.9
million lower largely due to decreased commodity market prices. In the year-to-date, production-
related taxes were $5.6 million lower as decreased commodity market prices contributed
approximately $4.3 million and lower net production volumes contributed approximately $1.3
million. Commodity market prices exclude the effects of derivative instruments for purposes of
determining production taxes. Decreased ad valorem taxes in the quarter and year-to-date were
largely driven by the factor adjusted price impact on our Texas oil and natural gas properties.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization: Energen’s DD&A expense for the quarter fell $32.8
million and $47.8 million year-to-date. The average depletion rate for the current quarter was
$20.04 per BOE as compared to $25.60 per BOE in the same period a year ago. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016, the average depletion rate was $20.70 per BOE as compared to
$23.37 per BOE in the previous period. The decrease in the current quarter and year-to-date per
unit depletion rate which contributed approximately $32.3 million and $30.3 million to the
decrease in DD&A expense was largely due to lower rates resulting from asset impairments.
Lower net production volumes reduced DD&A expense approximately $0.3 million and $17.1
million for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively.
Asset impairment: Non-cash impairment writedowns are reflected in asset impairment on the
consolidated income statements.
Permian Basin: During the first quarter of 2016, Energen recognized non-cash impairment
writedowns in the Permian Basin of $208.3 million to adjust the carrying amount of these
properties to their fair value. We estimate future discounted cash flows in determining fair value
using commodity assumptions, which are based on the commodity price curve for five years and
then escalated at 3 percent through our assumed price cap. Our commodity price assumptions
declined in the first quarter by approximately 5 percent for oil and 4 percent for natural gas in
comparable periods. During the second quarter of 2015, Energen recognized non-cash
impairment writedowns on certain properties in the Central Basin Platform of $51.5 million.
Estimated future cash flows were revised due to the receipt of an unsolicited offer for these
properties. During the first quarter of 2015, Energen recognized a non-cash impairment
writedown of $4.3 million in the Delaware Basin.
In the first quarter of 2016, Energen recognized unproved leasehold writedowns of $4.1 million
primarily on Permian Basin oil properties in the Delaware Basin and the Central Basin Platform.
Energen recognized unproved leasehold writedowns primarily on Permian Basin oil properties in
the Delaware Basin of $10.9 million during the year-to-date 2015.
San Juan Basin: During the first quarter of 2016, Energen recognized non-cash impairment
writedowns on held for sale properties in the San Juan Basin of $7.5 million to adjust the carrying
amount of these properties to their fair value.
During the first quarter of 2016, Energen recognized an insignificant amount of unproved
leasehold writedowns on San Juan Basin properties. Energen recognized unproved leasehold
writedowns on San Juan Basin properties of $0.2 million during the six months ended June 30,
2015.

Total G&A expense decreased $15.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 largely
due to decreased legal expenses, decreased costs from Energen’s benefit and performance-
based compensation plans, decreased labor costs and lower professional services. G&A
expense declined $17.6 million for the year-to-date primarily due to decreased costs from
Energen’s benefit and performance-based compensation plans, lower legal expenses,
decreased labor and decreased professional services partially offset by charges associated with
the workforce reduction of $5.0 million. There were no pension costs included in benefit and
performance-based compensation plans costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to $1.1 million (including settlement expense of $0.7) during the same period in 2015.
Included in costs from the benefit and performance-based compensation plans were pension
costs of $3.3 million (all of which was settlement expense) for the six months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to $4.1 million (including settlement expense of $3.4) during the same period
in 2015.
(Gain) loss on sale of assets and other: Through June 30, 2016, Energen completed a series of
asset sales of certain non-core Permian Basin assets in the Delaware Basin in Texas for an
aggregate purchase price of $294 million. These transactions had closing dates of June 3, 7 and
30 of 2016 with various effective dates ranging from March 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016. Pre-tax
proceeds to Energen were approximately $284.8 million after purchase price adjustments of
approximately $9.6 million related to the operations of the properties subsequent to the effective
dates and other one-time adjustments including transfer payments and certain amounts due the
buyer, but before consideration of transaction costs of approximately $2.5 million. Energen
recognized pre-tax gains of $161.1 million on the sales. Energen used proceeds from the sales to
fund ongoing operations.
On March 31, 2015, Energen completed the sale of the majority of its natural gas assets in the
San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado (effective as of January 1, 2015) for an aggregate
purchase price of $395 million. The sales proceeds were reduced by purchase price adjustments
of approximately $11 million related to the operations of the San Juan Basin properties
subsequent to December 31, 2014 and one-time adjustments related primarily to liabilities
assumed by the buyer, which resulted in pre-tax proceeds to Energen of approximately $384
million before consideration of transaction costs of approximately $2.8 million. Energen
recognized a pre-tax gain of $27.0 million on the sale. Energen used proceeds from the sale to
reduce long-term indebtedness. At December 31, 2014, proved reserves associated with these
San Juan Basin properties totaled 69,038 MBOE.
31
Interest expense: Interest expense decreased $2.2 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $4.1
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Lower interest in the quarter and year-to-date
was primarily due to decreased borrowings under our syndicated credit facility.
Income tax expense (benefit): Income tax expense increased $84.4 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 largely due to higher pre-tax income. In the year-to-date, income tax benefit
increased $15.3 million primarily due to lower pre-tax income.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY
Cash Flow
The key drivers impacting our cash flow from operations are our oil, natural gas liquids and
natural gas production volumes and realized commodity market prices, net of the effects of
settlements on our derivative commodity instruments. We rely on our cash flows from operations,
proceeds from first quarter 2016 equity offering and the pre-tax proceeds from the series of assets
sales in the Permian Basin to fund our capital spending plans and working capital requirements.
Cash flows will be supplemented, as needed, by borrowings under our syndicated credit facility.
Net cash provided by operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 was $120.8 million as compared to $336.1 million for the same
period of 2015. Net income in 2016 was impacted overall by the decreased price environment
and lower production volumes which affected non-cash charges, including depreciation, asset
impairment charges, deferred income taxes, gain on sale of assets and the change in derivative
fair value. Energen’s working capital was influenced by commodity prices, the timing of payments
and recoveries and included pension contributions associated with our non-qualified
supplemental retirement plans of $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2016.
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities: Net cash provided by investing activities for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $29.5 million as compared to $381.4 million used in
investing activities for the same period of 2015. Energen incurred on a cash basis $256 million in
capital expenditures including $189 million largely related to the development of oil and natural
gas properties, $39 million for payment of accrued capital costs and $28 million primarily related
to unproved leasehold acquisitions. Included in the proceeds from the sale of assets are cash
proceeds of $284.8 million from the series of asset sales of certain non-core Permian Basin
assets.
Net cash provided by financing activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 was $158.3 million as compared to $45.0 million for the same
period of 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities in the year-to-date 2016 was primarily
due to the issuance of 18,170,000 shares of common stock largely offset by the repayment of
credit facility borrowings.
Changes in Commodity Prices
Realized commodity prices and production levels by commodity type are the two primary drivers
of our liquidity. Recent price declines in the outlook for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas
indicate a significant risk for lower revenues and related operating cash flows. Historically, prices
received for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production have been volatile because of
supply and demand factors, general economic conditions and seasonal weather patterns. Crude
oil prices also are affected by quality differentials, worldwide political developments and actions
of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Basis differentials, like the underlying
commodity prices, can be volatile because of regional supply and demand factors, including
seasonal variations and the availability and price of transportation to consuming areas.
We engage in derivative risk management activities, as discussed below, in order to reduce the
risk associated with commodity price fluctuations. Commodity hedges in place for 2016 will help
mitigate some of the commodity price volatility; however, we currently have hedges in place for
2016 at lower price levels than in 2015 and may not be able to execute new hedges at
acceptable volumes or price levels. At current commodity price levels, we expect that the net
prices we will receive for our 2016 production will decline relative to 2015. See Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, for a full detail of our hedged
volumes.
Derivative Commodity Instruments
We periodically enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price
fluctuations on oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production. Such instruments may include
over-the-counter swaps, options and basis swaps typically executed with investment and
commercial banks and energy-trading firms. Derivative transactions are pursuant to standing
authorizations by the Board of Directors, which do not authorize speculative positions.
32
Due to the volatility of commodity prices, the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments is
subject to fluctuation from period to period, which could result in significant differences between
the current estimated fair value and the ultimate settlement price. Additionally, Energen is at risk
of economic loss based upon the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We were in a net loss
position with thirteen of our active counterparties and in a net gain position with the remaining
two at June 30, 2016. Energen has policies in place to limit hedging to not more than 80 percent
of our estimated annual production; however, Energen’s credit facility contains a covenant which
operates to limit hedging at a lower threshold in certain circumstances.
See Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, in the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated
Financial Statements for information regarding our policies on fair value measurement.
Liquidity
At June 30, 2016, we had $309.9 million of cash on hand and $1.05 billion of committed
financing available under our syndicated credit facility. On September 2, 2014, Energen entered
into a five-year syndicated secured credit facility with domestic and foreign lenders. On April 13,
2016, our committed financing available under our credit facility was reduced to $1.05 billion in
conjunction with our scheduled semi-annual redetermination. To finance our operations, working
capital and capital spending, we expect to use internally generated cash flow from operations
supplemented by our existing five-year syndicated credit facility. As discussed in Note 14,
Acquisition and Disposition of Properties, in the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated
Financial Statements, through June 30, 2016, Energen has completed a series of asset sales of
certain non-core Permian Basin assets in the Delaware Basin in Texas for an aggregate
purchase price of $294 million.
Access to capital is an integral part of Energen’s business plan. During the first quarter of 2016,
Energen issued 18,170,000 additional shares of common stock and received net proceeds of
approximately $381.1 million, after deducting offering expenses. Energen may also issue long-
term debt and additional equity periodically to replace short-term obligations, enhance liquidity
and provide for permanent financing. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has $554.0 million
outstanding under long term note agreements and no outstanding amounts under its revolving
credit facility. While we expect to have ongoing access to our credit facility and capital markets,
continued access could be adversely affected by current and future economic and business
conditions and possible credit rating downgrades.
Our debt facilities are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants as discussed in
Note 4, Long-Term Debt, in the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements. The financial covenants of the credit facility require Energen to maintain a ratio of
total debt to consolidated income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion,
amortization, exploration expense and other noncash income and expenses (EBITDAX) less
than or equal to 4.0 to 1.0. As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with our covenants and
expect to maintain compliance during the remainder of 2016. However, factors including those
outside of our control may prevent us from maintaining compliance with the financial and non-
financial covenants, including our total debt to EBITDAX covenant, at future measurement dates
in 2016 and beyond. Such factors may include commodity price declines, lack of liquidity in
property and capital markets and our continuing ability to execute on our business plan. The
borrowing base on our credit facility is scheduled to be redetermined in October 2016. In the
event that we are unable to remain in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants,
we would seek covenant relief at a scheduled redetermination date or at an interim date, as
appropriate, during 2016. However, no assurances can be given with respect to such relief. If any
such covenant violations are not waived by the lenders such violation would result in an event of
default that could trigger acceleration of payment of the amounts outstanding under credit
facilities and long term note agreements, which is an aggregate balance outstanding of $554.0
million at June 30, 2016. Additionally, the lenders could refuse to make additional loans under
the credit facility, take possession of any collateral, and exercise other remedies or rights that
may be available to them, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the business and
financial condition of the Company.
Energen’s obligations under the syndicated credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by
Energen Resources. The financial covenants of the credit facility require Energen to maintain a
ratio of total debt to consolidated income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation,
depletion, amortization, exploration expense and other non-cash income and expenses
(EBITDAX) less than or equal to 4.0 to 1.0; to maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets
(adjusted to include amounts available for borrowings and exclude non-cash derivative
instruments) to consolidated current liabilities (adjusted to exclude maturities under the credit
facility and non-cash derivative instruments) greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0; and, during
certain periods, to maintain a ratio of the net present value of proved reserves of our oil and
natural gas properties to consolidated total debt greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.0. We are also
bound by covenants which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make certain
distributions or alter our corporate structure. Energen may not pay dividends during an event of
default, if the payment would result in an event of default or if availability is less than 10 percent
of the loan limit under the credit facility. Our credit facility also limits our ability to enter into
commodity hedges based on projected production volumes. In addition, the terms of our credit
facility limit the amount we can borrow to a borrowing base amount which is determined by our
lenders in their sole discretion based on their valuation of our proved
33
reserves and their internal criteria including commodity price outlook. The borrowing base
amount is subject to redetermination semi-annually and for event-driven unscheduled
redeterminations. Our next scheduled redetermination is October 1, 2016.
At June 30, 2016, Energen reported unadjusted working capital of $325.3 million arising from
current assets of $585.8 million exceeding current liabilities of $260.6 million. Working capital at
Energen is influenced by cash on hand, the fair value of derivative financial instruments
associated with future production and assets held for sale. Energen has $3.2 million in current
assets and $46.5 million in current liabilities associated with its derivative instruments at June 30,
2016. At June 30, 2016, Energen has $176.9 million in current assets and $13.3 million in current
liabilities associated with assets held for sale.
Workforce Reduction
On January 22, 2016 and March 18, 2016, we reduced our workforce as part of an overall plan to
reduce costs and better align our workforce with the needs of our business in light of current oil
and natural gas commodity prices. In connection with the reductions, we incurred charges of
approximately $5.0 million during the year-to-date 2016 for one-time termination benefits which
are included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated income statement.
Credit Ratings
On July 29, 2016, Moody’s Investors Service raised Energen’s Corporate Family rating from B1
to Ba3 with a stable outlook. Moody’s Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Notes and Senior
Unsecured Bond ratings were raised from B3 to B2 with a stable outlook.
Equity Offering and Shares Issued
During the first quarter of 2016, Energen issued 18,170,000 additional shares of common stock
through a public equity offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $381.1 million, after
deducting offering expenses. During the second quarter of 2015, Energen issued 5,700,000
additional shares of common stock through a public equity offering. We received net proceeds of
approximately $398.6 million, after deducting offering expenses. Net proceeds from these
offerings were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and for general corporate
purposes.

Stock Repurchase Authorization
From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock through open
market or negotiated purchases. Such repurchases would be pursuant to a 3.6 million share
repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors on October 22, 2014. The timing
and amounts of any repurchases are subject to changes in market conditions and other business
considerations. We would expect to finance any share repurchases under our existing credit
facility.
Contractual Cash Obligations
In the course of ordinary business activities, Energen enters into a variety of contractual cash
obligations and other commitments. There have been no material changes to the contractual
cash obligations of the Company since December 31, 2015.
Other Commitments
New Mexico Audits: In 2011, Energen Resources received an Order to Perform Restructured
Accounting and Pay Additional Royalties (the Order), following an audit performed by the
Taxation and Revenue Department (the Department) of the State of New Mexico on behalf of the
Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR), of federal oil and gas leases in New Mexico. The
audit covered periods from January 2004 through December 2008 and included a review of the
computation and payment of royalties due on minerals removed from specified U.S. federal
leases. The Order addressed ONRR’s efforts to change accounting and reporting
34
practices, and to unbundle fees charged by third parties that gather, compress and transport
natural gas production. ONRR now maintains that all or some of such fees are not deductible.
Energen Resources appealed the Order in 2011 and in July 2012, on a motion from ONRR, the
Order was remanded. In August 2014, ONRR issued its Revised Order and Energen Resources
appealed the Revised Order. In the Revised Order, ONRR ordered that Energen pay additional
royalties on production from certain federal leases in the amount of $129,700. At ONRR’s request
the Revised Order was also remanded in August 2015. On April 15, 2016 ONRR issued its
Second Revised Order. The Second Revised Order directs Energen Resources to pay additional
royalties of $189,000, replacing the previous demand of $129,700. Energen had previously
estimated that application of the ONRR position to all of the Company’s federal leases would
result in ONRR claims up to approximately $24 million, plus interest and penalties from 2004
forward. ONRR began implementing its unbundling initiative in 2010, but seeks to implement its
revisions retroactively, despite the fact that they conflict with previous audits, allowances and
industry practice. Energen plans to appeal and vigorously contest the Second Revised Order, the
predecessor orders and the findings. Management is unable, at this time, to determine a range of
reasonably possible losses, and no amount has been accrued as of June 30, 2016.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We consider accounting policies related to our accounting for oil and natural gas producing
activities and related proved reserves, asset impairments, derivatives and asset retirement
obligations as critical accounting policies. These policies are summarized in Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The policies include
significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates
are made. However, these estimates could change materially if different information or
assumptions were used.
Asset Impairments: We monitor the business environment and our oil and natural gas properties
for events that could result in a potential impairment. Further, we make assumptions about future
expectations in our evaluation of potential impairment. Such assumptions include, but are not
necessarily limited to, commodity prices and related basis differentials, transportation costs,
inflation assumptions, well and reservoir performance, severance and ad valorem taxes, other
operating and future development costs, and general business plans.
Our commodity price assumption is a significant and volatile uncertainty in our estimate, and we
are unable to reliably forecast future commodity prices. Our assumption is therefore based on the
commodity price curve for the next five years and then escalated at 3 percent through our
assumed price caps. Our other assumptions generally have less volatility than the price
assumption with variances tending to be field specific and more localized in effect. However,
these assumptions can also be impacted by a higher or lower inflationary environment,
limitations on takeaway capacity, well and reservoir performance over time, changes to
governmental taxation, or changes to cost assumptions, operational and development plans, or
the general economic or business environment.
Certain impairments were recognized during the first quarter of 2016 as discussed under Asset
Impairments in our Results of Operations. We estimate a further decline in our price assumptions
by 10 percent from the June 30, 2016 prices (assuming all other assumptions are held constant)
would not result in any additional expense for properties previously impaired. We would
recognize approximately $3 million of expense on properties not previously impaired due to
assumed price declines. Other assumptions such as operating costs, transportation costs, well
and reservoir performance, severance and ad valorem taxes, operating and development plans
may change given an assumed 10 percent commodity price decline. However, we are unable to
estimate their correlation to the price change and these other assumptions may worsen or
partially mitigate some of the estimated impairment.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK
FACTORS
All statements, other than statements of historical fact, appearing in this report constitute forward-
looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are included in
Energen’s disclosure and analysis as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about our
expectations, beliefs, intentions or business strategies for the future, statements concerning our
outlook with regard to the timing and amount of future production of oil, natural gas liquids and
natural gas, price realizations, the nature and timing of capital expenditures for exploration and
development, plans for funding operations and drilling program capital expenditures, the timing
and success of specific projects, operating costs and
35
other expenses, proved oil and natural gas reserves, liquidity and capital resources, outcomes
and effects of litigation, claims and disputes and derivative activities. In particular, forward-
looking statements may include words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”,
“expect”, “forecast”, “foresee”, “intend”, “may”, “plan”, “potential”, “predict”, “project”, “seek”, “will” or
other words or expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. These statements
involve certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from
expectations as of the date of this filing.
The future success and continued viability of our business, like any venture, is subject to many
recognized and unrecognized risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties could cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this
report and presented elsewhere by management. The following list identifies certain factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. The list should not be viewed as
complete or comprehensive, as the factors below are not the only risks facing Energen. Energen
could also be affected by other risks and uncertainties in addition to those described herein. If
any of our assumptions related to the factors identified below were to be proven incorrect, our
business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected; and
such events could impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development
activities as scheduled. Further, the trading price of our shares could decline; and shareholders
could lose part or all of their investment. In addition, such risks may prevent us from complying
with our financial and non-financial covenants and may result in a default under our credit facility
or other long-term debt.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The following quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are supplementary to the
quantitative and qualitative disclosures provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, and the information contained herein should be read in conjunction
with the related disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.
We are exposed to various market risks including commodity price risk, counterparty credit risk
and interest rate risk. We seek to manage these risks through our risk management program
which often includes the use of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative or other
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Commodity price risk: Energen’s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil
and natural gas production. Historically, prices received for oil, natural gas liquids and natural
gas production have been volatile due to world and national supply-and-demand factors,
seasonal weather patterns and general economic conditions. Crude oil prices also are affected
by quality differentials, by worldwide political developments and by actions of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Basis differentials, like the underlying commodity prices, can
be volatile because of regional supply-and-demand factors, including seasonal factors and the
availability and price of transportation to consuming areas. As impacted by such commodity price
volatility during the second quarter of 2016, our average realized oil prices fell 21.6 percent to
$41.14 per barrel, average realized natural gas liquids prices decreased 6.1 percent to an
average price of $0.31 per gallon and average realized natural gas prices decreased 30 percent
to$1.56 per Mcf. During the year-to-date, our average realized oil prices fell 26.1 percent to
$35.79 per barrel, average realized natural gas liquids prices decreased 15.6 percent to an
average price of $0.27 per gallon and average realized natural gas prices decreased 36.1
percent to$1.59 per Mcf.
We periodically enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price
fluctuations on oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production. Such instruments may include
over-the-counter swaps and basis swaps typically executed with investment and commercial
banks and energy-trading firms.

Realized prices are anticipated to be lower than New York Mercantile Exchange prices primarily
due to basis differences and other factors. See Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, in the
Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of changes in
the fair value of Energen’s Level 3 derivative commodity instruments.
37
Additionally, we have entered into certain sales volume and supply target arrangements with
certain customers. A failure to meet sales volume targets at Energen due to miscalculations,
weather events, natural disasters, accidents, mechanical failures, criminal acts or otherwise
could leave us exposed to our counterparties in commodity hedging contracts and result in
material adverse financial losses.
Counterparty credit risk: Our principal exposure to credit risk is through the sale of our oil, natural
gas liquids and natural gas production, which we market to energy marketing companies. Such
sales are typically made on an unsecured credit basis with payment due the month following
delivery. This concentration of sales to the energy marketing industry has the potential to affect
our overall exposure to credit risk. We consider the credit quality of our purchasers and, in certain
instances, may require credit assurances such as a deposit, letter of credit or parent guarantee.
We are also at risk for economic loss based upon the credit worthiness of our derivative
instrument counterparties. The counterparties to the commodity instruments are investment
banks and energy-trading firms and are believed to be creditworthy by Energen. All hedge
transactions are subject to Energen’s risk management policy, approved by the Board of
Directors, which does not permit speculative positions. Energen formally documents all
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items at the inception of the hedge, as
well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
Interest rate risk: Our interest rate exposure as of June 30, 2016 primarily relates to our
syndicated credit facility with variable interest rates. There was no outstanding credit facility
balance as of June 30, 2016. All long-term debt obligations, other than our credit facility, were at
fixed rates at June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2016, we had interest rate swap agreements with a
notional value of $33.3 million. The interest rate swaps exchange a variable interest rate for a
fixed interest rate of 1.0425 percent. The fair value of our interest rate swaps was a $0.1 million
liability at June 30, 2016.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a)
Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives and, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective at that reasonable assurance level.
(b)
Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that during the most
