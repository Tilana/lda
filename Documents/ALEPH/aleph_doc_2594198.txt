Gold Fields H1 2016 Results

Exceeding targets
JOHANNESBURG. 18 August 2016
Gold Fields Limited (NYSE & JSE: GFI) today announced normalised earnings of US$103
million
for the six months to June 2016 compared with normalised earnings of US$8 million for the six
months to June 2015.
An interim dividend of 50 SA cents per share (gross) is payable on 12 September 2016.
Statement by Nick Holland, 
Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields
It is pleasing to report our H1 2016 results 
into a much more buoyant gold market 
compared with the start of the year. 
Following Brexit at the end of June, the gold 
price has increased almost US$100/oz and 
is approximately US$250/oz higher than our
planning price for 2016. While we welcome 
the increase in the US$ gold price, we 
remain focused on delivering on our strategic 
objectives and have made good progress on 
a number of these during H1 2016.
Materially higher earnings and 
cash flow in H1 2016
Gold Fields had an operationally strong H1 
2016, with attributable gold equivalent 
production for the Group of 1,044koz (H1 
2015: 1,036koz), at all-in sustaining costs 
(AISC) of US$992/oz (H1 2015: 
US$1,083/oz) and all-in costs (AIC) of 
US$1,024/oz (H1 2015: US$1,108/oz).
In-line with the trading statement, published 
on 19 July, headline earnings for H1 2016 
was US$124m or US$0.16/share, compared 
with US$5m or US$0.01/share reported for 
H1 2015. Normalised earnings for the period 
was US$103m or US$0.13/share compared 
with US$8m or US$0.01/share reported for 
H1 2015.
The increase in earnings was primarily 
driven by an increase in the US$ gold price 
(3% YoY) and good cost control which 
resulted in lower net operating costs in local 
currencies as well as the impact of 
converting these costs at weaker exchange 
rates. In H1 2016, the A$ was 5% weaker 
YoY and the rand was 29% weaker YoY, 
against the US$.
The Group generated net cash flow of US$60m 
for H1 2016, compared with US$1m in H1 
2015, mainly due to the higher profit reported 
for the period and took into account US$22m 
spent on further drilling at Salares Norte.
We have declared an interim dividend of 
R0.50/share which is 12.5 times higher than 
the 2015 interim dividend of R0.04/share.
South Deep outperforming 
guidance
Production at South Deep increased by 87% to 
4,356kg (140koz) from 2,332kg (75koz) in H1 
2015 driven by increased volumes and grade. 
AIC in H1 2016 decreased 19% YoY to 
R622,453/kg (US$1,257/oz). Good progress
was made on a number of important activities:
·    Safety continues to be a priority at South
Deep, with no fatalities reported in H1 2016 
and the TRIFR improving 5% YoY to 2.89 
in H1 2016 from 3.03 in H1 2015.
·    Helped by the higher rand gold price and
favourable working capital movements, the 
net cash outflow for the period was R50m 
compared with an outflow of R728m in H1 
2015. Within this half year number, it is 
worth noting that the mine was cash 
positive in the June 2016 quarter.
·    Development increased by 74% to 3,078
metres in H1 2016 from 1,773 metres in H1 
2015.
·    Destress mining increased by 46% to
19,845 square metres for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 from 13,619 square 
metres for the six months ended 30 June 
2015.

Gold Fields H1 2016 Results
·    The conversion from low profile to high profile destress mining
yielded positive results. High profile destress mining contributed 
53% to total destress mining for the period. Low profile destress 
mining was completed subsequent to quarter-end.
·    Longhole stoping volumes increased by 120% to 301kt in H1 2016
from 137kt in H1 2015.
·    Secondary support increased by 34% YoY in H1 2016 to 3,891
metres.
·    Backfill placed was 47% higher YoY for the six months to June
2016 at 198m

.
·    As part of the fleet renewal strategy, 17 category 1 units were
commissioned during H1 2016, with an additional 11 units to be 
commissioned during the remainder of 2016. In the past 18 
months, we have commissioned 51 new category 1 units out of a 
total of 114 category 1 units.
·    Most of the critical skill position identified at the start of 2015 have
now been filled, with a limited number of specialist skill positions 
outstanding.
Australia
Gold production in the Australia region for H1 2016 was 2% lower YoY 
at 466koz due to lower production at all operations except Darlot, 
however all mines exceeded guidance. AIC for the region was only 
marginally higher in A$ terms at A$1,265/oz, but 6% lower YoY in US$ 
terms at US$928/oz due to the weakening of the A$ against the US$. 
AIC includes exploration expenditure (see below). Net cash flow from 
the region for H1 2016 was US$121m.
During H1 2016, A$52m of the exploration budget was spent, with 
347,456 metres drilled during the period. There have been encouraging 
results at all operations including: extensions at Wallaby laterally and 
at depth; prospective results from drilling at Northern Fleet on Lake 
Carey at Granny Smith and Waroonga North at Agnew as well as 
extensions at Invincible and Invincible South and Retribution on the 
Eastern Causeway at St Ives. Darlot continues to find resources to 
incrementally extend its life, while exploration to find the ‘game 
changer’ continues. We anticipate replacing ounces mined into 
reserves at year-end.
West Africa
Attributable gold production from the West Africa region was 7% lower 
YoY in H1 2016 at 311koz, due to lower production at both Tarkwa and 
Damang. However, AIC for the region decreased 9% YoY to 
US$1,052/oz mainly as a result of lower net operating costs and lower 
capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold. The region 
generated net cash flow of US$26m for the six months to June 2016.
As previously reported, the conclusion of a development agreement 
with the Government of Ghana was a key milestone during H1 2016 
and provides the platform for targeting many years of sustainable 
production by Gold Fields in Ghana. The lower royalties will become 
effective in 2017.
We continue to evaluate a range of options for Damang, with additional
work required following the conclusion of the Development Agreement. 
We expect to make a decision and provide an update to the market 
before year-end.
South America
Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona decreased by 
15% YoY to 128koz, mainly due to lower gold head grades, as a result 
of planned sequencing at the mine, and the lower copper price. 
Consequently, AIC increased by 9% YoY to US$728 per equivalent 
ounce. Despite the lower production, the mine generated net cash flow 
of US$19m.
Approaching 1x net debt to EBITDA target
Net debt decreased to US$1,155m during H1 2016, from US$1,380m 
at end December 2015 following the bond buyback and subsequent 
equity raising undertaken in the period. The net debt to EBITDA ratio 
reduced to 1.05x at 30 June 2016, from 1.38x at end-December 2015 
and positions the company well to meet its net debt to EBITDA target 
of 1.0x by year-end.
As previously reported in June, we have successfully refinanced our 
US$1,440m credit facilities due in November 2017. The new facilities 
amount to US$1,290m, with the interest rates being very similar to the 
previous facilities. The refinancing extends the maturity of our debt, 
with the first maturity now only in June 2019 (previously November 
2017).
Improved FY16 production guidance
As a result of the better than expected performance at South Deep, we 
have increased the FY16 production guidance for the mine to 9,000kg 
(289koz) from 8,000kg (257koz). However, we have also increased the 
AIC guidance for the year to R595,000/kg (US$1,310/oz) from 
R575,000/kg (US$1,265/oz). The higher AIC relates to increased 
capital expenditure of R211m (US$15m) to R1,210m (US$86m) due to 
a change in strategy on housing (decision to build instead of rent) and 
the acquisition of additional new fleet. The remainder of the increase is 
due to higher working costs, which comprise higher bonuses due to 
higher gold production achieved relative to plan as well as the 
investment in additional resources in line with the strategy to 
sustainably improve all aspects of the operation.
For Tarkwa, we have increased the FY16 AIC guidance to US$980/oz 
from US$940/oz, mainly due to a US$38m increase in capital 
expenditure to US$166m. The mine took advantage of the higher gold 
price and the benefits from the Development Agreement to increase 
capital stripping in order to increase flexibility for 2017 and beyond.
Based on the outperformance of the Australian operations relative to 
plan in H1 2016, we have increased the FY16 production guidance for 
the region to 925koz from 905koz.
Consequently, FY16 production guidance for the Group has been 
increased to 2.10 – 2.15koz, from 2.05 – 2.10koz. AISC and AIC 
guidance for the year remains unchanged at US$1,000 – 1,010/oz and 
US$1,035 – 1,045/oz. Group capital expenditure has increased to 
US$655m, from U$602m. The cost guidance is based on unchanged 
exchange rate assumptions: US$0.73 = A$1.00 and R14.14 = 
US$1.00.

REVENUE
Attributable equivalent gold production increased marginally from 
1,036,000 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
1,044,000 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016. South 
Deep and Darlot produced more gold in the six months ended 
30 June 2016.
Gold production at South Deep in South Africa, increased by 87 per 
cent from 2,332 kilograms (75,000 ounces) to 4,356 kilograms 
(140,000 ounces).
Attributable gold production at the West African operations 
decreased by 7 per cent from 335,200 for the six months ended 30 
June 2015 to 310,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 due to lower production at both Tarkwa and Damang. 
Attributable equivalent gold production at Cerro Corona in Peru 
decreased by 15 per cent from 149,400 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 126,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 
June 2016. Gold production at the Australian operations decreased 
by 2 per cent from 476,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to 466,100 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due 
to lower production at all the operations except Darlot.
At the South Africa region, production at South Deep increased by 
87 per cent from 2,332 kilograms (75,000 ounces) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 4,356 kilograms (140,000 ounces) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to increased volumes and grades.
At the West Africa region, managed gold production at Tarkwa 
decreased by 6 per cent from 292,000 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 273,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 mainly due to lower tonnes mined and lower plant 
throughput at a lower yield. At Damang, managed gold production 
decreased by 11 per cent from 80,500 ounces for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 71,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 mainly due to lower tonnes mined and processed as well 
as lower yield.
At the South America region, total managed gold equivalent 
production at Cerro Corona decreased by 15 per cent from 150,200 
ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 127,500 ounces 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to the lower
copper price relative to the gold price (price factor) and lower gold 
head grades, a function of planned changes in the mining sequence 
as the pit floor is lowered across the footprint.
At the Australia region, St Ives’ gold production decreased by 6 per 
cent from 187,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 
to 175,900 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly 
due to decreased tonnes processed and lower grades. At 
Agnew/Lawlers, gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 
113,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 109,300 
ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to 
decreased tonnes mined and processed, partially offset by higher 
grades. At Darlot, gold production increased by 31 per cent from 
28,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 37,200 
ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to 
increased tonnes mined and processed as well as higher grades. At 
Granny Smith, gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 
146,600 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 143,700 
ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower grades 
mined and processed.
The average US dollar gold price achieved by the Group increased 
by 3 per cent from US$1,186 per equivalent ounce for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,218 per equivalent ounce for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. The average rand gold price 
increased by 31 per cent from R460,152 per kilogram to R601,187 
per kilogram. The average Australian dollar gold price increased by 
8 per cent from A$1,540 per ounce to A$1,657 per ounce. The 
average US dollar gold price for the Ghanaian operations increased 
by 1 per cent from US$1,207 per ounce for the six months ended 30 
June 2015 to US$1,217 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 
2016. The average equivalent US dollar gold price, net of treatment 
and refining charges, for Cerro Corona increased by 16 per cent
from US$1,059 per equivalent ounce for the six months ended 30 
June 2015 to US$1,227 per equivalent ounce for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016. The average US dollar/Rand exchange rate 
weakened by 29 per cent from R11.89 for the six months ended 30 
June 2015 to R15.39 for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The 
average Australian/US dollar exchange rate weakened by 5 per cent 
from A$1.00 = US$0.78 to A$1.00 = US$0.74.
Revenue increased by 3 per cent from US$1,270 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,305 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to the higher gold price achieved. 
OPERATING COSTS
Net operating costs decreased by 11 per cent from US$748 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$666 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. The US$82 million lower net operating 
costs were due to lower mining costs of US$28 million in local 
currencies and the exchange rate effect of US$54 million on 
translation into US dollars. The gold-in-process credit to cost of 
US$25 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared 
with a charge of US$34 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2015. This change in gold-in-process was mainly at St Ives due to 
the processing of low grade stockpiles while the Invincible pit was 
being stripped in the six months to June 2015. Sufficient ore to fill 
the mill and to create stockpiles was mined in the six months ended 
June 2016.
At the South Africa region, net operating costs at South Deep 
increased by 46 per cent from R1,340 million (US$113 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to R1,959 million (US$127 
million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to higher 
production, annual salary increases and an increase in employees 
and contractors in line with the strategy to sustainably improve all 
aspects of the operation.
At the West Africa region, net operating costs decreased by 12 per 
cent from US$262 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$230 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. This 
decrease in net operating costs was mainly due to lower production, 
continued business process re-engineering, as well as a build-up of 
inventory of US$8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016

compared with a drawdown of US$2 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015.
At the South America region, net operating costs at Cerro Corona 
decreased by 11 per cent from US$71 million for the six months
ended 30 June 2015 to US$63 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 mainly due to a build-up of concentrate of US$6 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$nil million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015.
At the Australia region, net operating costs decreased by 13 per cent 
from A$387 million (US$303 million) for the six months ended 30 
June 2015 to A$337 million (US$247 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to gold-in-process movements. At 
St Ives, the gold-in-process credit to cost of A$16 million (US$12 
million) for the six months ended June 2016 compared with a charge 
of A$38 million (US$30 million) for the six months ended June 2015. 
In the six months ended June 2015, St Ives processed low grade 
stockpiles, whereas enough ore was mined to fill the mill and to 
create stockpiles in the six months ended June 2016. At Granny 
Smith, the gold-in-process credit to cost of A$2 million (US$1 million) 
for the six months ended June 2016 compared with a charge of A$6 
million (US$5 million) for the six months ended June 2015. This A$8 
million (US$6 million) change in gold-in-process was mainly due to 
timing of the campaign milling. At Agnew/Lawlers, a gold-in-process 
charge of A$4 million (US$3 million) for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 compared with a credit to cost of A$1 million (US$1 
million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015. At Darlot, a gold-
in-process charge of A$1 million (US$nil million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared with A$2 million (US$1 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015. 
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating profit for the Group increased by 22 per cent from US$522 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$639 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the increase in revenue 
and the decrease in net operating costs. 
AMORTISATION
Amortisation for the Group increased by 6 per cent from US$283 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$300 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016. This increase of US$17 million 
was due to actual amortisation increases of US$34 million due to the 
change in estimate in the depreciation at Cerro Corona and in 
Australia mainly due to lower reserves at St Ives, partially offset by 
an exchange rate effect of US$17 million. 
OTHER
Net interest expense for the Group decreased by 9 per cent from 
US$34 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$31 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Interest expense of 
US$41 million, partially offset by interest income of US$3 million and 
interest capitalised of US$7 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 compared with interest expense of US$46 million, partially 
offset by interest income of US$3 million and interest capitalised of 
US$9 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015.
The share of equity accounted losses decreased by 50 per cent from 
US$4 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$2 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to downscaling of 
activities at Far Southeast project (FSE) and mainly related to 
ongoing study and evaluation costs.
The gain on financial instruments of US$6 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 was mainly due to the South Deep currency 
hedge of US$70 million at an average price of R16.8273 to the US$. 
This compared with a loss of US$1 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 which related to the mark to market adjustment on the 
diesel hedges that the Australian operations entered into on 10 
September 2014 and 26 November 2014. The diesel hedges came 
to an end on 30 June 2015.
Share-based payments for the Group was similar at US$6 million 
while long-term employee benefits increased from US$3 million to 
US$20 million. The two schemes combined were at US$26 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$9 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015 due to upward mark to 
market adjustments on the long-term employee incentive scheme.
Other costs for the Group increased from US$19 million to US$24 
million, mainly due to the write-off of bank facility fees of US$5 
million as a result of refinancing the off-shore credit facility. 
EXPLORATION AND PROJECT COSTS
Exploration and project costs increased from US$33 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$41 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to increased expenditure of US$8 
million at Salares Norte. 
NON-RECURRING ITEMS
Non-recurring income of US$6 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 compared with non-recurring expenses of US$11 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015. The non-recurring income 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 included profit of US$18 
million on the buy-back of the bond which was partially offset by 
retrenchment costs of US$10 million at Damang.
The non-recurring expenses for the six months ended 30 June 2015 
included impairment of the Group’s investment in Hummingbird 
(US$7 million) to its fair value and retrenchment costs of A$3 million 
(US$3 million) at St Ives. 
ROYALTIES
Government royalties for the Group decreased from US$40 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$39 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. 
TAXATION
The taxation charge for the Group of US$68 million for the six
months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$87 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015. Normal taxation increased from 
US$64 million to US$83 million due to higher taxable income. The 
deferred tax credit of US$15 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 compared with a charge of US$23 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015. The deferred tax credit for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 arose mainly due to the strengthening 
of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol, as well as the change in the corporate 
tax rate from 35 per cent to 32.5 per cent in Ghana as a result of the 
conclusion of the Development Agreement in the March 2016 
quarter.
The tax returns for Cerro Corona are filed in Peruvian Nuevo Sol 
(Soles) and the functional currency for accounting purposes is the 
US dollar. For accounting purposes the unredeemed capital 
allowance balance in respect of the operation must be converted 
from Soles to dollars at the closing rate at quarter end. Therefore, 
the US dollar equivalent of the unredeemed capital allowance 
balance fluctuates due to movements in the exchange rate between 
the Peruvian Nuevo Sol and the US dollar. This resulted in a change 
in the temporary taxation differences for non-monetary assets on 
translation. A deferred tax credit of US$5 million arose due to the 
strengthening of the exchange rate from 3.38 Nuevo Sol to 3.28 
Nuevo Sol in the six months to June 2016, compared with a deferred 
tax charge of US$26 million which arose due to the weakening of 
the exchange rate from 2.84 Nuevo Sol to 3.17 Nuevo Sol in the six 
months ended June 2015. It has no cash effect.

CASH FLOW
Cash inflow from operating activities of US$384 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$342 million for the
six months ended 30 June 2015. This increase was mainly due to 
an increase in operating profit of US$117 million and non-recurring 
income of US$6 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared with non-recurring expense of US$11 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015, partially offset by an investment into 
working capital of US$13 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 compared with a release of working capital of US$43 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015 as well as higher tax paid 
(US$127 million versus US$119 million).
Dividends paid of US$11 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 compared with US$18 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2015. Dividends paid to owners of the parent decreased from 
US$13 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$11 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Dividends paid to 
non-controlling interest holders of US$nil million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared with US$5 million 30 June 2015.
Cash outflow from investing activities decreased from US$340 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to US$321 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a decrease in capital 
expenditure from US$333 million for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to US$316 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016. This 
decrease of US$17 million related to a decrease of US$24 million 
due to currency changes, partially offset by actual increased capital 
expenditure of US$7 million in local currency. Environmental 
payments decreased from US$9 million for the six months ended 
June 2015 to US$8 million for the six months ended 30 June 2016.
Cash inflow from operating activities less net capital expenditure and 
environmental payments of US$60 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2016 compared with US$1 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2015 mainly due to higher profit and lower capital 
expenditure, partially offset by higher royalties and taxation paid and 
negative working capital adjustments. The US$60 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 comprised: US$163 million net cash 
generated by the eight mining operations (after royalties, taxes, 
capital expenditure and environmental payments), less US$37 
million of net interest paid, US$28 million for exploration mainly at 
Salares Norte (this excludes any mine based brownfields 
exploration which is included in the US$163 million above) and 
US$38 million on non-mine based costs of which US$29 million was 
due to working capital movements. The US$1 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 comprised: US$70 million generated 
by the eight mining operations less US$39 million of interest paid 
(this excludes any interest paid by the mines), US$18 million for 
exploration (this excludes any mine based brownfields exploration 
which is included in the US$70 million above) and US$12 million on
non-mine based costs.
In the South Africa region at South Deep, capital expenditure 
increased from R419 million (US$35 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to R682 million (US$44 million) for the six
months ended 30 June 2016 due to higher expenditure on fleet, the 
refurbishment of the man winder at Twin shaft and higher 
expenditure on new mine development.
At the West Africa region, capital expenditure decreased from 
US$141 million to US$102 million. At Tarkwa, capital expenditure 
decreased from US$133 million to US$91 million due to higher fleet 
expenditure for the six months to June 2015 related to timing of 
deliveries and orders. Capital expenditure for the six months to June 
2016 was mainly incurred on pre-stripping. Capital expenditure at 
Damang increased from US$8 million to US$11 million mainly due 
to waste stripping at Amoanda pit.
In the South America region at Cerro Corona, capital expenditure 
decreased from US$19 million to US$14 million. The majority of the 
expenditure was on the construction of further raises to the tailings 
dam.
At the Australia region, capital expenditure increased from A$176 
million (US$138 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
A$214 million (US$157 million) for the six months ended 30 June 
2016. At St Ives, capital expenditure increased from A$77 million 
(US$60 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$94 
million (US$69 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due 
to increased pre-strip at Neptune, Invincible and A5. At 
Agnew/Lawlers, capital expenditure increased from A$44 million 
(US$34 million) to A$54 million (US$40 million) due to increased 
decline development. At Darlot, capital expenditure increased 
marginally from A$13 million (US$10 million) to A$14 million (US$10 
million) and at Granny Smith, capital expenditure increased from 
A$43 million (US$34 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 
to A$51 million (US$38 million) for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 due to increased capital development, the new fresh air intake 
ventilation raise and the completion of the new gas fired power 
station.
Net cash inflow from financing activities of US$7 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 compared with outflow from financing 
activities of US$18 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015. 
The inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2016 related to a 
drawdown of US$422 million and proceeds on the issue of shares 
of US$152 million, partially offset by the repayment of US$567 
million on offshore and local loans. The outflow for the six months
ended June 2015 related to a net repayment of loans.
The net cash inflow for the Group of US$59 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared with an outflow of US$34 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015. After accounting for a positive 
translation adjustment of US$4 million on non-US dollar cash 
balances, the cash inflow for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
was US$63 million. The cash balance was US$415 million at 30 
June 2015 compared with US$503 million at 30 June 2016. 
ALL-IN SUSTAINING AND TOTAL ALL-IN COST
The Group all-in sustaining costs decreased by 8 per cent from 
US$1,083 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$992 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly 
due to lower net operating costs and lower sustaining capital 
expenditure, partially offset by lower by-product credits and higher 
cash remuneration (long term employee benefits). Total all-in cost 
decreased by 8 per cent from US$1,108 per ounce for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,024 per ounce for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 for the same reasons as all-in 
sustaining costs.
In the South Africa region, at South Deep, all-in sustaining costs 
decreased by 17 per cent from R731,017 per kilogram (US$1,912 
per ounce) to R608,825 per kilogram (US$1,229 per ounce) mainly 
due to increased gold sold, partially offset by higher operating costs 
and higher sustaining capital expenditure. The total all-in cost 
decreased by 19 per cent from R772,702 per kilogram (US$2,020 
per ounce) to R622,453 per kilogram (US$1,257 per ounce) due to

the same reasons as for all-in sustaining costs as well as lower non-
sustaining capital expenditure.
At the West Africa region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost 
decreased by 9 per cent from US$1,156 per ounce for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to US$1,052 per ounce for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower net operating costs 
and lower capital expenditure, partially offset by lower gold sold.
At the South America region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in 
cost increased by 16 per cent from US$423 per ounce to US$489 
per ounce mainly due to lower gold sold and lower by-product 
credits, partially offset by lower net operating costs. All-in sustaining 
costs and total all-in cost per equivalent ounce increased by 9 per 
cent from US$666 per equivalent ounce to US$728 per equivalent 
ounce mainly due to the same reasons as above, other than lower 
by-product credits as well as lower equivalent ounces sold.
At the Australia region, all-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost 
increased marginally from A$1,263 per ounce (US$990 per ounce) 
for the six months ended 31 December 2015 to A$1,265 per ounce 
(US$928 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly 
due to higher capital expenditure and lower gold sold.

Gold production increased by 87 per cent from 2,332 kilograms 
(75,000 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 4,356 
kilograms (140,000 ounces) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
due to increased volumes and grades.
Underground tonnes milled increased by 52 per cent from 493,000 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 750,000 tonnes 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Total tonnes milled 
increased by 104 per cent from 0.56 million tonnes to 1.14 million 
tonnes. Total tonnes milled for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
included 47,900 tonnes of underground waste mined and 346,300 
tonnes of surface tailings material compared with 8,700 tonnes of 
underground waste mined and 58,300 tonnes of surface tailings 
material for the six months ended 30 June 2015. Underground reef 
yield increased by 23 per cent from 4.70 grams per tonne to 5.77 
grams per tonne due to greater adherence to spatial mining plans 
along with improved processes in the entire mining value chain.
Development increased by 74 per cent from 1,773 metres for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to 3,078 metres for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016. New mine capital development (phase one, 
sub 95 level) increased by 524 per cent from 83 metres for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to 518 metres for the six months ended 
30 June 2016. Development in the current mine areas in 95 level 
and above increased by 51 per cent from 1,690 metres to 2,560 
metres. Destress mining increased by 46 per cent from 13,619 
square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 19,845 
square metres for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The destress 
conversion from low profile to high profile mining was completed 
subsequent to quarter-end. Longhole stoping volume mined 
increased by 120 per cent from 136,858 tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 300,966 tonnes for the six months ended 30 
June 2016. High profile destress mining started in June 2015 and 
improved significantly from 52 square metres for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to 10,599 square metres for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to the introduction of 3 new drill rigs, 
improved productivity and the continued roll-out of the method 
across the entire mine. The high profile and low profile methods 
contributed 53 per cent and 47 per cent, respectively, to total 
destress for the six months ended 30 June 2016.
The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 65 per cent of the
ore tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016, while the new 
mine (below 95 level) contributed 35 per cent. The long-hole stoping 
method accounted for 42 per cent of total ore tonnes mined 
compared with 37 per cent for the six months ended 30 June 2015.

Net operating costs increased by 46 per cent from R1,340 million 
(US$113 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to R1,959 
million (US$127 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016. 
The main contributing factor is the 52 per cent increase in tonnes 
mined, which resulted in higher bonuses paid, higher consumable 
spend and higher utility consumption. The increased costs were 
also due to annual salary increases and additional resources 
(employees and contractors) in line with the strategy to sustainably 
improve all aspects of the operation.
Operating profit of R668 million (US$43 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 compared with a loss of R267 million (US$22 
million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015. This was mainly 
due to the 87 per cent (2,024 kilograms) increase in gold production 
together with a 31 per cent improvement in the rand gold price, 
partially offset by increased net operating costs.
Capital expenditure increased by 63 per cent from R419 million 
(US$35 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to R682 
million (US$44 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 as a 
result of higher spending on fleet and the refurbishment of the man 
winder at Twin shaft.
All-in sustaining costs decreased by 17 per cent from R731,017 per 
kilogram (US$1,912 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to R608,825 per kilogram (US$1,229 per ounce) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to increased gold sold, 
partially offset by higher operating costs and higher sustaining 
capital expenditure.
Total all-in cost decreased by 19 per cent from R772,702 per 
kilogram (US$2,020 per ounce) for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to R622,453 per kilogram (US$1,257 per ounce) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to the same reasons as for all-in-
sustainable costs as well as lower non-sustaining capital 
expenditure.
Sustaining capital expenditure increased from R322 million (US$27 
million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to R623 million 
(US$40 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to 
additional fleet and the refurbishment of the twin shaft man winder.
Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased from R97 million 
(US$8 million) to R59 million (US$4 million).
The independent Geotechnical Review Board (GRB), a committee 
of local and international experts, will continue to peer review 
progress at South Deep to ensure exposure to relevant industry 
leading practices and world class geotechnical support in massive 
underground mining at depth.

Gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 292,000 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 273,500 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower tonnes mined, lower plant 
throughput and lower grade. 
Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased from 52.4 
million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 51.3 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Ore tonnes mined 
decreased from 7.3 million tonnes to 6.5 million tonnes. Operational 
waste tonnes mined increased from 16.0 million tonnes to 16.9 
million tonnes while capital waste tonnes mined decreased from 
29.1 million tonnes to 27.6 million tonnes. Head grade mined 
increased from 1.43 grams per tonne to 1.44 grams per tonne. The 
strip ratio increased from 6.1 to 6.8.
The CIL plant throughput decreased from 6.81 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to 6.80 million tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 due to unplanned downtime (both power and 
operational related). Realised yield from the CIL plant decreased 
from 1.33 grams per tonne to 1.25 grams per tonne due to lower
head grades processed as a result of the blend between lower grade 
stockpiles, higher grade ore tonnes mined, related to timing 
differences between ore mined and ore feed to the plant.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, 
decreased by 7 per cent from US$168 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$156 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 due to a net increase in gold-in-process and lower 
operating costs. The US$9 million build-up of stockpiles for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 compared with a drawdown of US$nil 
million for the six months ended 30 June 2015.
Operating profit decreased from US$184 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$177 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 as a result of the lower gold sales, partially offset by lower 
net operating costs.
Capital expenditure decreased by 32 per cent from US$133 million 
to US$91 million mainly due to the purchase of mining fleet for 
replacement in the six months ended June 2015. Mining fleet 
expenditure for the six months ended June 2015 was US$46 million 
compared with US$nil million for the six months ended June 2016.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 10 per cent 
from US$1,106 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$993 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to 
lower net operating costs and lower capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 11 per cent from 80,500 ounces for
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 71,900 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower tonnes mined and 
processed and lower yield.
Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, decreased from 10.5 
million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 9.8 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the late start 
of mining at the Amoanda pit as a result of delays in securing 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permit.
Ore tonnes mined decreased from 2.3 million tonnes to 1.4 million 
tonnes. Operational waste tonnes mined decreased from 8.2 million 
tonnes to 5.0 million tonnes as a result of only mining operational 
waste tonnes for the six months ended June 2015, while both 
operational waste tonnes and capital waste tonnes were mined for 
the six months ended June 2016. Capital waste of 3.4 million tonnes 
was mined at Amoanda pit for the six months ended June 2016. The

six months to June 2015 had no capital waste. Head grade mined 
increased from 1.25 grams per tonne to 1.42 grams per tonne. The 
strip ratio increased from 3.5 to 6.0 due to capital stripping at the 
Amoanda pit.
Yield decreased from 1.19 grams per tonne to 1.11 grams per tonne 
due to an increase in lower grade stockpiles treated. For the six 
months ended June 2015, 1.79 million tonnes of fresh ore and 
oxides were milled at an average grade of 1.31 grams per tonne and 
0.33 million tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 
1.34 grams per tonne. This compared with 1.15 million tonnes of 
fresh ore and oxides milled at an average grade of 1.44 grams per 
tonne and 0.86 million tonnes of stockpiles milled at an average 
grade of 0.90 grams per tonne for the six months ended June 2016.
Tonnes processed decreased from 2.11 million tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to 2.01 million tonnes for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016 due to a tailings line blockage for 10 days.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, 
decreased by 21 per cent from US$94 million to US$74 million 
mainly due to lower mining and consumable costs in line with the 
lower production as well as lower payroll costs as a result of 
retrenchments for the six months ended June 2016.
Operating profit increased from US$4 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$13 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016 due to lower net operating costs and higher gold prices
achieved, partially offset by lower gold sold.
Capital expenditure increased by 38 per cent from US$8 million to 
US$11 million with the majority spent on waste stripping at Amoanda 
pit.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 6 per cent 
from US$1,336 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$1,260 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to 
lower operating costs, partially offset by lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 10 per cent from 78,100 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 70,500 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. Copper production increased 
marginally from 14,566 tonnes to 14,693 tonnes. Equivalent gold
production decreased by 15 per cent from 150,200 ounces to 
127,500 ounces. The decrease in equivalent gold production was 
due to the lower copper price ratio as well as lower gold head grades 
treated. The lower head grades were in line with the mine 
sequencing and the planned production schedule for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016. Gold head grade decreased from 1.08 grams 
per tonne to 0.96 grams per tonne and copper head grade 
decreased from 0.53 per cent to 0.50 per cent. Gold recoveries 
decreased from 71.6 per cent to 67.4 per cent mainly due to 
mineralisation characteristics of the ore mined which is expected to 
dissipate by the end of the September quarter 2016 once this section 
of the orebody is mined. Copper recoveries increased from 86.4 per 
cent to 86.7 per cent. As a result, gold yield decreased from 0.87 
grams per tonne to 0.65 grams per tonne and copper yield 
decreased from 0.55 per cent to 0.43 per cent. The decreases in 
grade is in line with the plan.
For the six months ended 30 June 2016, concentrate with a payable 
content of 66,847 ounces of gold was sold at an average price of 
US$1,220 per ounce and 13,877 tonnes of copper was sold at an 
average price of US$4,021 per tonne, net of treatment and refining 
charges. This compared with 76,720 ounces of gold that was sold 
at an average price of US$1,192 per ounce and 14,174 tonnes of 
copper that was sold at an average price of US$5,190 per tonne, net 
of treatment and refining charges, for the six months ended 30 June 
2015. Total equivalent gold sales decreased by 18 per cent from
147,200 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 120,100 
ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower 
volumes produced.
Total tonnes mined increased by 24 per cent from 6.12 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 7.56 million tonnes 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 in line with the mine 
sequencing. The higher tonnes mined was due to lower intensity of 
the rainy season. Ore mined increased by 6 per cent from 3.36 
million tonnes to 3.56 million tonnes. Waste tonnes mined increased 
by 45 per cent from 2.76 million tonnes to 4.00 million tonnes. The 
strip ratio increased from 0.82 to 1.13 due to higher waste mined for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016. Waste mined was higher for 
the six months ended June 2016 mainly due to the prioritisation of 
ore mined for the six months ended June 2015 due to the rainy 
season and the mining sequence.
Ore processed increased by 9 per cent from 3.23 million tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 3.53 million tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to record plant throughput 
(835 tonnes per hour vs 791 tonnes per hour) after the completion 
of the plant optimisation project.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, 
decreased by 11 per cent from US$71 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to US$63 million for the six months ended 30 
June 2016. The lower cost was mainly due to a US$6 million build-
up of concentrate inventory for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared with US$nil million for the six months ended 30 June 
2015.
Operating profit was similar at US$85 million.
Capital expenditure decreased by 26 per cent from US$19 million to 
US$14 million. The six months ended 30 June 2015 included 
construction of the new fuel station and the new camp.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 16 per cent 
from US$423 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
US$489 per ounce for the six months ended 30 June 2016. This 
was mainly due to lower gold sold and lower by-product credits, 
partially offset by lower net operating costs and lower capital 
expenditure. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per 
equivalent ounce increased by 9 per cent from US$666 per 
equivalent ounce to US$728 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the 
same reasons as above and lower equivalent ounces sold.

* Heap leach produced 400 ounces, rinsed from inventory (2,500 ounces was rinsed in the
six months ended 30 June 2015).
Gold production decreased by 6 per cent from 187,900 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 175,900 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to the closure of the Cave Rocks 
and Athena underground mines and transition to a predominantly 
open pit operation.
Total tonnes mined increased by 113 per cent from 10.5 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 22.4 million tonnes 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The additional tonnes 
mined are a result of the transition to a predominantly open pit 
operation.
At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 53 per cent 
from 0.70 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 
0.33 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 with the 
closure of the Cave Rocks and Athena underground mines. The 
grade mined increased by 19 per from 4.52 grams per tonne to 5.40 
grams per tonne as a result of the closure of the lower grade Cave 
Rocks mine.
At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined increased by 213 
per cent from 0.60 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to 1.88 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
due to the ramp-up of Invincible pit. Grade mined increased by 11 
per cent from 2.25 grams per tonne to 2.49 grams per tonne as the 
Invincible pit moved into a higher grade portion of the ore body.
Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 287 per cent from 
1.20 million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 4.64 
million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Capital waste 
tonnes mined increased by 94 per cent from 8.0 million tonnes to 
15.5 million tonnes. The strip ratio decreased from 15.5 to 10.7 as 
the Invincible Pit has moved from a predominately stripping to a 
production phase, partially offset by the stripping of the Neptune pit 
in the six months ended 30 June 2016. The increased tonnes reflect 
the increase in activity at the Invincible mine which is now in full 
production and the commencement of Stage 2 of the Neptune open 
pit giving St Ives two significant areas of open pit activity in 2016 and 
beyond. The strip ratio for Invincible pit decreased from 20.5 to 8.7, 
while the strip ratio for Neptune pit was 58.2 for the six months 
ended 30 June 2016. There was no mining activity at Neptune during 
the first half of 2015.
Throughput at the Lefroy mill decreased by 5 per cent from 2.05 
million tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 1.95 million 
tonnes for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to low grade 
stockpiles used to supplement production for the six months ended 
June 2015. St Ives adopted a campaign milling strategy towards the 
end of the six months ended 30 June 2015. Yield decreased from 
2.84 grams per tonne to 2.81 grams per tonne in line with less 
underground production, offset by no longer feeding low grade 
stockpiled material. Gold production from the Lefroy mill decreased 
from 185,400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to
173,500 ounces for the six months ended 30 June 2016. In addition, 
93,000 tonnes of toll treatment produced 2,000 ounces for the six 
months to June 2016.
Residual leaching and irrigation of the existing heap leach pad 
produced a further 400 ounces for the six months ended 30 June
2016. This compared with 2,500 ounces produced for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015. The residual leaching has now ceased 
being economic and the heap leach is being closed. Since cessation 
of stacking activities, a total of 24,800 ounces was produced.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements 
decreased from A$164 million (US$129 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$108 million (US$79 million) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. The significant cost reduction is the 
result of:
·   the closure of the Cave Rocks and Athena underground mines;
·   efficiencies in the open pits with the cost per tonne of material
movement decreasing by 29 per cent on larger volumes and 
productivity improvements; and
·   the benefits of enhanced open pit production resulting in a credit
of A$16 million (US$12 million) due to a build-up of stockpiles 
compared with a cost of A$38 million (US$30 million) on 
drawdown of stockpiles in the six months ended 30 June 2015.
The benefits of the above cost reductions were partially offset by 
increased mining volumes.
Operating profit increased from A$125 million (US$98 million) for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$182 million (US$134 million) 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a higher Australian 
dollar gold price (A$1,651 per ounce vs A$1,542 per ounce) and 
significant net operating cost reductions, partially offset by lower 
production.
Capital expenditure increased by 22 per cent from A$77 million 
(US$60 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$94 
million (US$69 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 with 
an additional A$13 million (US$10 million) incurred on pre-stripping 
at Neptune and A5 pit.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 9 per cent 
from A$1,375 per ounce (US$1,079 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,247 per ounce (US$915 per ounce) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the significant reduction 
in net operating costs, partially offset by lower production and higher 
capital expenditure.

Gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 113,400 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 109,300 ounces for the six

completion and the focus on developing the Cinderella ore body in 
the six months ended June 2016. Ore mined at Waroonga 
decreased by 8 per cent from 277,000 tonnes to 254,000 tonnes due 
to more difficult ground conditions encountered in the six months to 
June 2016. Head grade mined increased by 7 per cent from 6.02 
grams per tonne to 6.44 grams per tonne mainly due to a larger 
concentration of ore sourced from the higher grade Kim ore body.
Tonnes processed decreased by 10 per cent from 625,700 tonnes 
for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 566,200 tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower tonnes available from the 
mines. The combined yield increased from 5.64 grams per tonne to 
6.00 grams per tonne mainly due to higher grades mined.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, 
increased by 2 per cent from A$93 million (US$73 million) for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 to A$95 million (US$70 million) for the 
six months ended 30 June 2016 due to a A$4 million (US$3 million)
drawdown of inventory for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared with a A$1 million (US$1 million) build-up of inventory for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015.
Operating profit increased from A$82 million (US$64 million) for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$84 million (US$61 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to the higher Australian 
dollar gold price (A$1,639 per ounce vs A$1,538 per ounce), 
partially offset by reduced production and higher net operating costs.
Capital expenditure increased by 23 per cent from A$44 million 
(US$34 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$54 
million (US$40 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The 
increase in capital expenditure was due to the decline development 
to the Cinderella ore body at New Holland, an exploration 
development drive towards Waroonga North at Waroonga mine and 
increased exploration expenditure across the lease.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 14 per cent 
from A$1,277 per ounce (US$1,001 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,456 per ounce (US$1,068 per ounce) 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to decreased gold sold, 
higher net operating costs and higher capital expenditure. All-in-
sustaining costs are expected to decrease in the second half of 2016 
as Cinderella moves into production and with the completion of the 
Waroonga North exploration development drive.

Gold production increased by 31 per cent from 28,500 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 37,200 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to increased tonnes and higher 
grade mined and processed from the Lords South Lower ore body.
Ore mined from underground increased by 5 per cent from 194,200 
tonnes to 204,800 tonnes. Head grade mined increased by 18 per 
cent from 4.96 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to 5.86 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 
2016. The increase in tonnes and grades was due to mining of 
higher grade remnant areas and extensions to the Lords South 
Lower ore body. A further 25,300 tonnes at 1.35 grams per tonne 
were sourced from a surface oxide trial during the six months ended 
June 2016 contributing approximately 1,000 ounces.
Tonnes processed increased by 7 per cent from 214,300 tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 230,100 tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. The yield increased from 4.14 grams 
per tonne to 5.02 grams per tonne due to higher grade ore mined, 
partially offset by the lower grade oxide trial.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, 
increased by 14 per cent from A$36 million (US$28 million) for the 
six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$41 million (US$30 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016. The increase reflects 
increased volumes mined and processed as well as a A$1 million 
(US$nil million) build-up for the six months ended 30 June 2016 
compared with A$2 million (US$2 million) for the six months ended 
30 June 2015.
Operating profit increased from A$8 million (US$6 million) to A$21 
million (US$15 million) due to the higher Australian dollar gold price 
(A$1,669 per ounce vs A$1,538 per ounce), partially offset by the 
higher net operating costs.
Capital expenditure increased by 8 per cent from A$13 million 
(US$10 million) to A$14 million (US$10 million). Capital expenditure 
in the six months ended 30 June 2016 was mainly incurred on 
exploration and the commencement of development to the Oval ore 
body. The Oval ore body is a recent discovery which is expected to 
provide the primary ore feed in 2017 and into 2018. The Oval ore 
body extends the life of mine allowing Darlot to maintain its strategy 
of self-funding exploration expenditure while it continues an 
aggressive exploration program to secure its future as a Gold Fields 
franchise asset.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 13 per cent 
from A$1,786 per ounce (US$1,400 per ounce) for the six months
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,554 per ounce (US$1,139 per ounce) 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due to higher gold sold, 
partially offset by higher net operating costs.

Gold production decreased by 2 per cent from 146,600 ounces for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 143,700 ounces for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016 due to lower grades mined in line with 
the mining sequence and as planned, as well as an increase in 
stockpiled ore as a consequence of the campaign milling.
Ore mined from underground increased by 13 per cent from 677,000 
tonnes to 763,000 tonnes. Head grade mined decreased by 4 per 
cent from 6.77 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 to 6.52 grams per tonne for the six months ended 30 June 
2016 in line with the mining plan.
Tonnes processed increased by 1 per cent from 731,000 tonnes for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to 741,300 tonnes for the six 
months ended 30 June 2016. The yield decreased from 6.23 grams 
per tonne to 6.03 grams per tonne due to lower head grades. The 
mill is not operating at capacity and the timing of the milling 
campaign results in variances between tonnes mined and milled in 
any given period which also impacts yield variances between head 
grade and yield.

Gold Fields H1 2016 Results
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements 
decreased by 2 per cent from A$94 million (US$73 million) to A$92 
million (US$67 million). Mining costs increased on the additional 
volumes, but was more than offset by the net gold in process credit 
associated with the respective timing of the milling campaigns, 
referred to above. The gold-in-process credit to cost of A$2 million 
(US$1 million) for the six months ended June 2016 compared with 
a charge of A$6 million (US$5 million) for the six months ended June 
2015. This A$8 million change in gold-in-process was mainly due to 
timing of the campaign milling.
Operating profit increased by 13 per cent from A$132 million 
(US$103 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$149 
million (US$109 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2016 due 
to the higher Australian gold price (A$1,674 per ounce vs A$1,539 
per ounce).
Capital expenditure increased from A$43 million (US$34 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2015 to A$51 million (US$38 million) 
for the six months ended 30 June 2016. The majority of the 
expenditure related to capital development, exploration and the 
establishment of the fresh air intake ventilation raise. The mine 
moved from diesel power to gas fired power in May 2016 with the 
completion of construction and the commissioning of the new power 
station. The new power station is expected to provide savings in 
power costs, lower maintenance costs and the risk of power 
interruptions. It is also expected to reduce carbon emissions.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 6 per cent 
from A$1,008 per ounce (US$789 per ounce) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 to A$1,068 per ounce (US$783 per ounce) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2016 mainly due to lower gold sold, 
higher capital expenditure, partially offset by the lower net operating 
costs. 
Corporate
GOLD FIELDS APPOINTS FOUR NEW NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTORS TO THE BOARD
Gold Fields has announcement the appointments of four new 
independent non-executive directors to its Board of Directors. 
Impala Platinum CEO Terence Goodlace joined the Board as a 
director on 1 July 2016, while Alhassan Andani, the Chief Executive 
and Executive Director of Stanbic Bank Ghana, joined on 1 August 
2016. Former KPMG Africa Chair, Yunus Suleman and Peter 
Bacchus, the Global Head of Mining and Metals and Joint Head of 
European Investment Banking at Investment Bank Jefferies, based 
in London, will join the Board on 1 September 2016.
Gold Fields Chairperson Cheryl Carolus said the four new directors 
will ensure continuity of the skills set of the Board as a number of 
the current directors were approaching retirement age over the next 
two years. Former director David Murray stepped down from the 
Board on 1 June 2016.
“The new directors provide the technical, financial, commercial and 
global mining experience necessary to help Gold Fields maintain 
and further strengthen its position as a global leader in sustainable 
gold mining,” Ms Carolus said. 
CREDIT FACILITIES SUCCESSFULLY REFINANCED
Gold Fields successfully refinanced its US$1,440 million credit 
facilities due in November 2017. The new facilities amount to 
US$1,290 million and comprise three tranches: 
·     US$380 million: 3 year term loan – margin 250 basis points (bps)
over Libor;
·     US$360 million: 3 year revolving credit facility (RCF) (with an
option to extend to up to 5 years) – margin 220bps over Libor; 
and
·     US$550 million: 5 year RCF – margin 245bps over Libor.
The new facilities were concluded with a syndicate of 15 banks. On 
average, the interest rate on the new facilities is similar to the 
interest rate on the existing facilities. A total of US$645 million was 
drawn down from the new facilities on 13 June 2016 to repay the 
group’s existing US$ facilities, with US$645 million remaining 
unutilised. The refinancing is a key milestone in Gold Fields’ balance 
sheet management and increases the maturity of its debt, with the 
first maturity now only in June 2019 (previously November 2017). 
CASH DIVIDEND
In line with the company’s dividend policy to pay out a dividend of 
between 25 and 35 per cent of its earnings, the Board has approved 
and declared an interim dividend number 84 of 50 SA cents per 
ordinary share (gross) in respect of the six months ended 30 June 
2016. This translates to 26 per cent of normalised earnings. The 
interim dividend will be subject to the Dividend Withholding Tax of 
15 per cent. In accordance with paragraphs 11.17(a)(i) and 11.17(c) 
of the JSE Listings Requirements, the following additional 
information is disclosed:
·   The dividend has been declared out of income reserves;
·   The local dividends withholding tax rate is 15 per cent (fifteen
per centum);
·   The gross local dividend amount is 50 SA cents per ordinary
share for shareholders exempt from dividends tax;
·   The Dividend Withholding Tax of 15 per cent (fifteen per centum)
will be applicable to this dividend;
·   The net local dividend amount is 42.500 SA cents per ordinary
share for shareholders liable to pay the dividends tax;
·   Gold Fields currently has 821,532,707 ordinary shares in issue
(included in this number are 856,330 treasury shares); and
·   Gold Fields’ income tax number is 9160035607. 
Shareholders are advised of the following dates in respect of the 
final dividend:
Interim dividend number 84: 50 SA cents per share
Last date to trade cum-dividend: Tuesday 6 September 2016
Sterling and US dollar conversion date: Wednesday 7 September 2016
Shares commence trading ex-dividend: Wednesday 7 September 2016
Record date: Friday 9 September 2016

Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised 
between Wednesday, 7 September 2016 and Friday, 
9 September 2016, both dates inclusive.
Outlook for 2016
As a result of the better than expected performance at South Deep, 
we have increased the 2016 production guidance for the mine to 
9,000 kilograms (289,000 ounces) from 8,000 kilograms (257,000 
ounces). However, we have also increased the AIC guidance for the 
year to R595,000 per kilogram (US$1,310 per ounce) from 
R575,000 per kilogram (US$1,265 per ounce). The higher AIC 
relates to increased capital expenditure of R211 million (US$15 
million) to R1,210 million (US$86 million) due to a change in strategy 
on housing (decision to build instead of rent) and the acquisition of 
additional new fleet. The remainder of the increase is due to higher 
working costs, which comprise higher bonuses due to higher gold 
production achieved relative to plan as well as the investment in 
additional resources in line with the strategy to sustainably improve 
all aspects of the operation.
For Tarkwa, we have increased the 2016 AIC guidance to US$980 
per ounce from US$940 per ounce, mainly due to a US$38 million 
increase in capital expenditure to US$166 million. The mine took 
advantage of the higher gold price and the benefits from the
Gold Fields H1 2016 Results
13
Development Agreement to increase capital stripping in order to 
increase flexibility for 2017 and beyond.
Based on the outperformance of the Australian operations relative 
to plan in the first half of 2016, we have increased the 2016 
production guidance for the region to 925,000 ounces from 905,000 
ounces.
Consequently, 2016 production guidance for the Group has been 
increased to 2.10 million ounces to 2.15 million ounces, from 2.05
million ounces to 2.10 million ounces. AISC and AIC guidance for 
the year remains unchanged at US$1,000 per ounce to US$1,010 
per ounce and US$1,035 per ounce to US$1,045 per ounce. AIC 
includes US$50 million for Salares Norte. Group capital expenditure 
has increased to US$655 million, from U$602 million. The cost 
guidance is based on unchanged exchange rate assumptions: 
US$0.73 = A$1.00 and R14.14 = US$1.00.
The above is subject to safety performance which limits the impact 
of safety-related stoppages and the forward looking statement on 
page 3. 
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The unaudited condensed consolidated six monthly financial 
statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standard, (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting, the 
SAICA Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting 
Practices Committee and Financial Pronouncements as issued by 
Financial Reporting Standards Council and the requirements of the 
Companies Act of South Africa.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these six 
monthly financial statements are in terms of International Financial 
Reporting Standards and are consistent with those applied in the 
previous annual financial statements. 
CERTIFICATION JUDGEMENT
As previously indicated, the Respondents in the Certification 
Application, including Gold Fields, all opposed the certification 
application, which was heard by the Gauteng Local Division of the 
High Court from 12 to 23 October 2015.
On 13 May 2016, the High Court ordered, amongst other things: (1) 
the certification of two classes: (a) a silicosis class comprising 
current and former mine workers who have contracted silicosis and 
the dependents of mine workers who have died of silicosis; and (b) 
a tuberculosis class comprising current and former mine workers 
who have worked on the mines for a period of not less than two 
years and who have contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and the 
dependents of deceased mine workers who died of pulmonary 
tuberculosis; and (2) that the common law be developed to provide 
that, where a claimant commences suing for general damages and 
subsequently dies before close of pleadings, the claim for general 
damages will transmit to the estate of the deceased claimant.
The progression of the classes certified will be done in two phases: 
(i) a determination of common issues, on an opt out basis, and (ii) 
the hearing and determination of individualized issues, on an opt in 
basis. In addition, costs were awarded in favour of the Claimants. 
The High Court ruling did not represent a ruling on the merits of the
cases brought by the Claimants. The amount of damages has not 
yet been quantified for any of the claimants in the Consolidated 
Class Application or for any other members of the classes.
Gold Fields and the other Respondents believe that the judgment 
addressed a number of highly complex and important issues, 
including a far reaching amendment of the common law, that have 
not previously been considered by other courts in South Africa. The 
High Court itself found that the scope and magnitude of the 
proposed claims is unprecedented in South Africa and that the class 
action would address novel and complex issues of fact and law. The
companies applied for leave to appeal against the judgement 
because they believed that the court’s ruling on some of these 
issues is incorrect and that another court may come to a different 
decision.
On 24 June 2016, the High Court granted the mining companies 
leave to appeal against the finding amending the common law in 
respect of the transmissibility of general damages claims. It refused 
leave to appeal on the certification of silicosis and tuberculosis 
classes.
On 15 July, the Gold Fields and the other Respondents each filed 
petitions to the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against 
the certification of the two separate classes for silicosis and 
tuberculosis. In an attempt to shorten any delay due to an appeal 
process, it is permissible to request that the appeals be dealt with 
on an expedited basis. The companies intend to do this, should 
leave to appeal be granted by the Supreme Court of Appeal. 
GOLD WORKING GROUP
The Occupational Lung Disease Working Group, made up of African 
Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American SA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold 
Fields, Harmony and Sibanye Gold, remains of the view that 
achieving a mutually acceptable comprehensive settlement which is 
both fair to past, present and future employees, and sustainable for 
the sector, is preferable to protracted litigation. Notwithstanding that 
the companies deny liability for the claims, the Working Group will 
continue with its efforts – which have been ongoing for more than a 
year – to find common ground with stakeholders, including the 
claimants’ legal representatives.

Hedging/Derivatives
The Group’s policy is to remain unhedged to the gold price. However, hedges are sometimes
undertaken on a project specific basis as follows:
·     to protect cash flows at times of significant expenditure; 
·     for specific debt servicing requirements; and 
·     to safeguard the viability of higher cost operations.
Gold Fields may from time to time establish currency financial instruments to protect underlying
cash flows.
South Africa Derivative Instrument*
On 25 February 2016, USD/ZAR forward exchange contracts (FEC’s) were entered into for a
total delivery of US$69.8 million starting July 2016 until December 
2016. The average forward rate achieved over the 6 month period is R16.8273, based off an
average spot rate of R16.0748.
At the reporting date, the marked-to-market value on the outstanding FEC is positive US$5.6
million.

Gold production increased by 20 per cent from 1,978 kilograms
(63,600 ounces) in the March quarter to 2,378 kilograms (76,500
ounces) in the June quarter due to higher volumes.
Underground tonnes milled increased by 26 per cent from 332,000
tonnes in the March quarter to 418,000 tonnes in the June quarter.
Total tonnes milled increased by 11 per cent from 543,000 tonnes
to 601,000 tonnes. Total tonnes milled in the June quarter included
24,000 tonnes of underground waste mined and 158,800 tonnes of
surface tailings material compared with 23,000 tonnes of
underground waste mined and 187,500 tonnes of surface tailings
material in the March quarter. Underground reef yield decreased by
4 per cent from 5.91 grams per tonne to 5.66 grams per tonne due
to higher development tonnes mined in lower grade areas.
Development increased by 38 per cent from 1,292 metres in the
March quarter to 1,786 metres in the June quarter. New mine capital
development (phase one, sub 95 level) increased by 6 per cent from
252 metres in the March quarter to 266 metres in the June quarter.
Development in the current mine areas in 95 level and above
increased by 46 per cent from 1,040 metres to 1,520 metres.
Destress mining decreased by 5 per cent from 10,158 square
metres in the March quarter to 9,687 square metres in the June
quarter. High profile destress mining improved by 35 per cent from
4,517 square metres to 6,082 square metres. Low profile destress
mining decreased by 36 per cent from 5,641 square metres to 3,605
square metres due to the strategic change in the mining method
from low to high profile destress which commenced in the
September 2015 quarter. The high profile and low profile methods
contributed 63 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively, to total
destress. All low profile destress was completed subsequent to
quarter-end.
The current mine (95 level and above) contributed 66 per cent of the
ore tonnes in the June quarter, while the new mine (below 95 level)
contributed 34 per cent. The long-hole stoping method accounted
for 39 per cent of total ore tonnes mined in the June quarter
compared with 46 per cent in the March quarter. The decrease is
due to the temporary loss of two drill rigs after a fall of ground
incident.
Operating costs increased by 12 per cent from R924 million (US$59
million) to R1,034 million (US$69 million) mainly due to higher
bonuses paid and consumable expenditure directly related to the
higher production achieved. The electricity expenditure was higher
than the previous quarter as a result of the start of the winter month
tariffs in June 2016 and higher consumption related to the higher
production achieved.
Capital expenditure increased by 60 per cent from R262 million
(US$17 million) to R420 million (US$28 million) as a result of higher
spending on fleet and the purchase of mining accommodation for
employees. As part of the fleet renewal strategy, 17 category 1 units
were commissioned during H1 2016, with an additional 11 units to
be commissioned during the remainder of 2016. In the past 18
months, we have commissioned 51 new category 1 units out of a
total of 114 units.
Sustaining capital expenditure increased by 71 per cent from R230
million (US$15 million) in the March quarter to R393 million (US$26
million) in the June quarter due to additional fleet and the purchase
of mining accommodation for employees. Non-sustaining capital
expenditure decreased by 16 per cent from R32 million (US$2
million) in the March quarter to R27 million (US$2 million) in the June
quarter.
All-in sustaining costs increased by 3 per cent from R600,563 per
kilogram (US$1,183 per ounce) in the March quarter to R615,697
per kilogram (US$1,268 per ounce) in the June quarter mainly due
to increased operating costs and higher sustaining capital
expenditure, partially offset by increased gold sold.
Total all-in cost increased by 2 per cent from R616,706 per kilogram
(US$1,215 per ounce) in the March quarter to R627,233 per
kilogram (US$1,293 per ounce) in the June quarter due to the same
reasons as for all-in-sustaining costs.

Gold production decreased by 4 per cent from 139,500 ounces in
the March quarter to 134,100 ounces in the June quarter due to
lower throughput as a result of unplanned downtime.
Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 3 per
cent from 25.3 million tonnes in the March quarter to 26.0 million
tonnes in the June quarter mainly due to improved equipment
utilisation. Ore tonnes mined decreased by 6 per cent from 3.4

mined was similar at 8.6 million tonnes while capital waste tonnes
mined increased by 7 per cent from 13.3 million tonnes to 14.2

million tonnes. Grade mined decreased from 1.41 grams per tonne
to 1.36 grams per tonne. The strip ratio increased from 6.6 to 7.0.
The CIL plant throughput decreased by 6 per cent from 3.50 million
tonnes in the March quarter to 3.30 million tonnes in the June quarter
due to unplanned downtime mainly due to power outages. Realised
yield increased by 2 per cent from 1.24 grams per tonne to 1.26
grams per tonne due to higher feed grades processed as a result of
blending.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, was
similar at US$78 million.
Capital expenditure decreased by 10 per cent from US$48 million to
US$43 million mainly due to expenditure on mining fleet in the March
quarter.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased marginally from
US$994 per ounce in the March quarter to US$991 per ounce in the
June quarter due to lower capital expenditure, partially offset by
lower gold sold.

Gold production decreased by 28 per cent from 41,700 ounces in
the March quarter to 30,200 ounces in the June quarter mainly due
to lower tonnes processed and lower grades mined and processed.
Total tonnes mined, including capital stripping, increased by 15 per
cent from 4.6 million tonnes in the March quarter to 5.3 million
tonnes in the June quarter due to capital waste strip at Amoanda pit.
Ore tonnes mined decreased by 25 per cent from 0.8 million tonnes
to 0.6 million tonnes. Total waste tonnes mined increased by 24 per
cent from 3.8 million tonnes in the March quarter to 4.7 million
tonnes in the June quarter. Head grade mined decreased by 6 per
cent from 1.46 grams per tonne to 1.37 grams per tonne. The strip
ratio increased from 4.5 to 8.1 due to capital waste strip at Amoanda
pit.
Yield decreased by 22 per cent from 1.25 grams per tonne to 0.97
grams per tonne due to more low grade stockpiles processed. For
the March quarter, 0.67 million tonnes of fresh ore and oxides were
milled at an average grade of 1.56 grams per tonne and 0.37 million
tonnes of stockpiles were milled at an average grade of 0.99 grams
per tonne. This compared with 0.48 million tonnes of fresh ore and
oxides milled at an average grade of 1.28 grams per tonne and 0.49
million tonnes of stockpiles milled at an average grade of 0.79 grams
per tonne for the June quarter.
Tonnes processed decreased by 7 per cent from 1.04 million tonnes
in the March quarter to 0.97 million tonnes in the June quarter mainly
due to a tails line blockage which impacted production for 10 days
caused by coarse grind and the fast settling nature of the ore.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased by 32 per cent from US$44 million to US$30 million, in
line with lower ore tonnes mined.
Capital expenditure increased by 900 per cent from US$1 million to
US$10 million with the majority spent on capital stripping at
Amoanda pit.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 25 per cent
from US$1,139 per ounce in the March quarter to US$1,427 per
ounce in the June quarter mainly due to higher capital expenditure
and lower gold sold, partially offset by lower net operating costs.

Gold production increased by 3 per cent from 34,800 ounces in the
March quarter to 35,700 ounces in the June quarter. Copper
production increased by 8 per cent from 7,051 tonnes to 7,642
tonnes. Equivalent gold production increased by 3 per cent from
62,900 ounces to 64,600 ounces. The increase in gold and copper
production was due to higher head grades treated, in line with the
mining sequence and the planned production schedule for the June
quarter. Gold head grade increased from 0.94 grams per tonne to
0.98 grams per tonne and copper head grade increased from 0.49
per cent to 0.51 per cent. Gold recoveries decreased from 68.5 per
cent to 66.3 per cent and copper recoveries increased from 85.4 per
cent to 88.0 per cent. As a result, gold yield increased from 0.64
grams per tonne to 0.65 grams per tonne and copper yield increased
from 0.42 per cent to 0.45 per cent.
In the June quarter, concentrate with a payable content of 32,900
ounces of gold was sold at an average price of US$1,252 per ounce
and 6,895 tonnes of copper was sold at an average price of
US$4,028 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges. This
compared with 33,939 ounces of gold sold at an average price of
US$1,133 per ounce and 6,982 tonnes of copper sold at an average
price of US$3,847 per tonne, net of treatment and refining charges,
in the March quarter.
Total tonnes mined decreased by 7 per cent from 3.91 million tonnes
in the March quarter to 3.65 million tonnes in the June quarter. The
Gold Fields H1 2016 Results

lower tonnes mined in the June quarter were as a result of the lower
waste mined in line with the mine sequence. Ore mined increased
by 2 per cent from 1.76 million tonnes to 1.80 million tonnes.
Operational waste tonnes mined decreased by 14 per cent from 2.15
million tonnes to 1.85 million tonnes. The strip ratio decreased from
1.23 to 1.03 due to lower waste mined in the June quarter.
Ore processed increased by 2 per cent from 1.75 million tonnes in
the March quarter to 1.78 million tonnes in the June quarter.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased by 9 per cent from US$33 million to US$30 million mainly
due to US$7 million gold-in-process credit to cost in the June quarter
compared with a US$1 million charge to cost in the March quarter.
Capital expenditure increased by 60 per cent from US$5 million to
US$8 million due to more construction activities at the tailings dam
as a result of the dry season.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 55 per cent
from US$386 per ounce in the March quarter to US$599 per ounce
in the June quarter mainly due to lower copper by-product credits
and higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net operating
costs. All-in sustaining costs and total all-in costs per equivalent
ounce increased by 6 per cent from US$709 per equivalent ounce
to US$750 per equivalent ounce mainly due to the same reasons as
above.

* Heap leach produced nil ounces, rinsed from inventory (400 ounces was rinsed in the
March quarter).
Gold production increased by 2 per cent from 87,000 ounces in the
March quarter to 88,800 ounces in the June quarter.
Total tonnes mined decreased by 1 per cent from 11.2 million tonnes
in the March quarter to 11.1 million tonnes in the June quarter.
At the underground operations, ore mined decreased by 15 per cent
from 178,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 151,000 tonnes in the
June quarter due to the Athena mine closure in February. The
reduced tonnes were partially offset by a 4 per cent increase in head
grade from 5.29 grams per tonne to 5.52 grams per tonne.
At the open pit operations, total ore tonnes mined increased by 23
per cent from 844,000 tonnes in the March quarter to 1,035,000
tonnes in the June quarter. Grade mined decreased by 16 per cent
from 2.72 grams per tonne to 2.29 grams per tonne. The increased
tonnes and lower grade were primarily due to increased ore from A5
open pit which is now complete. Mining at A5 was undertaken to
supplement production while the higher grade Neptune pit was
being stripped.
Operational waste tonnes mined increased by 94 per cent from 1.6
million tonnes in the March quarter to 3.1 million tonnes in the June
quarter. Capital waste tonnes mined decreased by 19 per cent from
8.6 million tonnes to 7.0 million tonnes. The strip ratio decreased
from 12.1 to 9.6. Total material movements at the open pits
remained consistent at 11.1 million tonnes with a move from capital
stripping to ore and waste movement as the A5 pit moved to
completion and the Neptune pit advanced into the early stages of
ore production.
Throughput at the Lefroy mill decreased by 5 per cent from 997,000
tonnes in the March quarter to 950,000 ounces in the June quarter
with the mill closed for the last week of the June quarter for the
installation of a new electrical control block for the Sag mill. Yield
increased from 2.70 grams per tonne to 2.91 grams per tonne due
to a drawdown of gold-in-circuit in the June quarter as opposed to a
build-up of gold-in-circuit in the March quarter. Gold production from
the Lefroy mill increased from 86,600 ounces to 88,800 ounces.
Residual leaching and irrigation of the heap leach pad contributed
400 ounces to production in the March quarter. Residual leaching
has now ceased being economic and the heap leach is being closed.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
increased by 20 per cent from A$49 million (US$35 million) to A$59
million (US$44 million) mainly due to the transition from primarily
pre-strip mining to operating waste and ore mining in the open pits.
Capital expenditure increased by 9 per cent from A$45 million
(US$33 million) to A$49 million (US$37 million) mainly due to
acceleration of the exploration programme with expenditure
increasing from A$9 million (US$6 million) in the March quarter to
A$13 million (US$10 million) in the June quarter.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 11 per cent
from A$1,182 per ounce (US$852 per ounce) in the March quarter
to A$1,311 per ounce (US$976 per ounce) in the June quarter due
to higher net operating costs and capital expenditure, partially offset
by increased gold sold.

Ore mined from underground increased by 11 per cent from 252,000
tonnes in the March quarter to 279,000 tonnes in the June quarter
due to higher tonnes mined from New Holland. Head grade mined
decreased marginally from 6.45 grams per tonne to 6.42 grams per

Gold Fields H1 2016 Results
Tonnes processed decreased by 1 per cent from 284,000 tonnes in
the March quarter to 282,000 tonnes in the June quarter. The March
quarter processing included net 32,000 tonnes of ore carried over
from the December quarter but processed in the March quarter. The
combined yield increased by 11 per cent from 5.70 grams per tonne
to 6.30 grams per tonne due to lower grade ore mined in the
December quarter, but processed in the March quarter (as
described in the preceding sentence) and a drawdown of 2,600
ounces produced in the March quarter during the June quarter.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased by 2 per cent from A$48 million (US$35 million) to A$47
million (US$35 million) mainly due the cost improvement initiatives
implemented across the site.
Capital expenditure was similar at A$27 million (US$20 million). The
capital expenditure was primarily on capital development associated
with opening up of the Fitzroy Bengal Hastings (FBH), Waroonga
North exploration drive and Cinderella ore body and on exploration
across the site.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost decreased by 10 per cent
from A$1,536 per ounce (US$1,106 per ounce) in the March quarter
to A$1,383 per ounce (US$1,034 per ounce) in the June quarter due
to increased gold sold and lower net operating costs.

Gold production decreased marginally from 18,700 ounces in the
March quarter to 18,500 ounces in the June quarter due to lower
grade mined.
Ore mined from underground increased by 4 per cent from 100,300 
tonnes to 104,500 tonnes. Head grade mined decreased from 5.94 
grams per tonne in the March quarter to 5.78 grams per tonne in the 
June quarter. A further 20,000 tonnes at 0.87 grams per tonne were 
sourced from a surface oxide trial during the June quarter 
contributing approximately 500 ounces to production. In the March 
quarter 5,600 tonnes of oxide material at 3.05 grams per tonne were 
processed adding approximately 500 ounces to production. 
Tonnes processed increased by 30 per cent from 100,000 tonnes in
the March quarter to 130,000 tonnes in the June quarter. The yield
decreased by 24 per cent from 5.84 grams per tonne to 4.42 grams
per tonne due to lower grade ore mined and a significantly larger but
lower grade trial treatment of surface oxide ore in the June quarter.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements,
decreased by 5 per cent from A$21 million (US$16 million) to A$20
million (US$15 million) mainly due to a decrease in mining costs.
Capital expenditure increased by 33 per cent from A$6 million (US$4
million) to A$8 million (US$6 million). Capital was mainly incurred
on exploration and the commencement of development to the Oval
ore body. The Oval ore body is a recent discovery which is expected
to provide the primary ore feed in 2017 and into 2018. The Oval ore
body extends the life of mine allowing Darlot to maintain its strategy
of at least breaking even while it continues an aggressive
exploration program to secure its future as a Gold Fields franchise
asset.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 3 per cent
from A$1,534 per ounce (US$1,105 per ounce) in the March quarter
to A$1,574 per ounce (US$1,167 per ounce) in the June quarter due
to higher capital expenditure, partially offset by lower net operating
costs.

Gold production increased by 13 per cent from 67,500 ounces in the
March quarter to 76,200 ounces in the June quarter.
Ore mined from underground increased by 2 per cent from 378,000
tonnes to 385,000 tonnes. Head grade mined increased from 5.99
grams per tonne in the March quarter to 7.04 grams per tonne in the
June quarter. The increased grade was due to stoping activity
returning to better grade areas of the mine with operating
development also advancing through higher grade zones than in the
March quarter.
Tonnes processed decreased by 4 per cent from 378,000 tonnes in
the March quarter to 363,000 tonnes in the June quarter. A net
21,000 tonnes of ore mined in the June quarter is planned to be
processed in the September quarter due to the campaign milling
schedule. The yield increased by 17 per cent from 5.56 grams per
tonne to 6.51 grams per tonne due to higher grades mined.
Net operating costs, including gold-in-process movements, were
similar at A$46 million (US$34 million).
Capital expenditure increased by 55 per cent from A$20 million
(US$15 million) in the March quarter to A$31 million (US$23 million)
in the June quarter. The higher expenditure related to mine capital
development, exploration and the sinking of the VR7 fresh air intake
raise which will provide ventilation down to 100 level, the newest
mining front. These projects accelerated during the June quarter
after a slow start to the year.
All-in sustaining costs and total all-in cost increased by 3 per cent
from A$1,054 per ounce (US$759 per ounce) in the March quarter
to A$1,081 per ounce (US$805 per ounce) in the June quarter
mainly due to higher capital expenditure, partially offset by increased
gold sold.
