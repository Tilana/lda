<p><b> I.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 16/32, reiterated its call upon all 
concerned parties, including United Nations bodies, to ensure the full and immediate 
implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the United Nations Fact-
Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), in accordance with their respective 
mandates. It also requested the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report on 
progress made in the implementation of the Mission&#8217;s recommendations, in accordance 
with its resolution S-12/1 B, paragraph 3, to the Council at its eighteenth session.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted pursuant to that request. It updates the information 
contained in the previous report of the Secretary-General on progress made in the 
implementation of the Mission&#8217;s recommendations in accordance with Human Rights 
Council resolution S-12/1 B, paragraph 3 (A/HRC/15/51). It contains information requested 
and received from States, organizations and other entities to which the Mission addressed 
its recommendations, as well as that gathered directly by the United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Status of the implementation of the recommendations of the 
Mission report  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Action by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>3. In paragraph 1968 of its report, the Mission addressed five recommendations to the 
Human Rights Council. In paragraph 1968 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that 
the Council should endorse the recommendations contained in the report, take appropriate 
action to implement them as recommended by the Mission and through other means as it 
may deem appropriate, and continue to review their implementation at future sessions.   
</p>
<p>4. As stated in the report of the Secretary-General on the status of implementation of 
paragraph 3 of Council resolution S-12/1 B (A/HRC/13/55, para. 4), the Human Rights 
Council, in paragraph 3 of that resolution, endorsed the Mission&#8217;s recommendations and 
called upon all concerned parties, including United Nations bodies, to ensure their 
implementation in accordance with their respective mandates. In paragraph 4 of its 
resolution 13/9, the Council reiterated this call and, in paragraph 17, decided to follow up 
on the implementation of that resolution at its fifteenth session. In paragraph 1 of its 
resolution 15/6, the Council requested the Secretary-General to follow up on the 
implementation of the recommendations contained in the Mission&#8217;s report, in accordance 
with its resolution S-12/1. In paragraph 3 of its resolution 16/32, the Council reiterated its 
call upon all concerned parties, including United Nations bodies, to ensure the full and 
immediate implementation of the Mission&#8217;s recommendations, in accordance with their 
respective mandates; and, in paragraph 12, it decided to follow up on the implementation of 
that resolution at its nineteenth session. 
</p>
<p>5. In paragraph 1968 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that, in view of the 
gravity of the violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and possible 
war crimes and crimes against humanity that it had reported, the Human Rights Council 
should request the Secretary-General to bring the report to the attention of the Security 
Council under Article 99 of the Charter of the United Nations in order that the Security 
Council might consider action according to the Mission&#8217;s relevant recommendations. </p>


<p>6. To date, the Human Rights Council has not directed any specific request to the 
Secretary-General to bring the Mission&#8217;s report to the attention of the Security Council 
under Article 99 of the Charter. 
</p>
<p>7. In paragraph 1968 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Human 
Rights Council should formally submit the report to the Prosecutor of the International 
Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>8. As stated in the report of the Secretary-General A/HRC/13/55, the report of the 
Mission was transmitted to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on 10 
December 2009. 
</p>
<p>9. In paragraph 1968 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Human 
Rights Council should submit the report to the General Assembly with a request that it 
should be considered.    
</p>
<p>10. In its resolution S-12/1 B, paragraph 4, the Human Rights Council recommended 
that the General Assembly should consider the report of the Mission during the main part of 
its sixty-fourth session.1 In paragraph 8 of its resolution 16/32, the Human Rights Council 
recommended that the General Assembly reconsider the report of the Mission at its sixty-
sixth session and urged the Assembly to submit the report to the Security Council for its 
consideration and appropriate action, including consideration of referral of the situation in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, 
pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute. 
</p>
<p>11. In paragraph 1968 (e) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Council 
should bring the Mission&#8217;s recommendations to the attention of relevant United Nations 
human rights treaty bodies so that they might include review of progress in their 
implementation, as might be relevant to their mandate and procedures, in their periodic 
review of compliance by Israel with its human rights obligations. The Mission also 
recommended that the Council should consider review of progress as part of its universal 
periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>12. As stated in the report of the Secretary-General A/HRC/13/55, paragraph 12, the 
Mission&#8217;s report was transmitted to the treaty bodies that monitor compliance by Israel with 
the human rights treaties to which it was party2 on 10 December 2009. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Action by the Security Council 
</b></p>
<p>13. In paragraph 1969 of its report, the Mission addressed a total of six 
recommendations to the Security Council.   
</p>
<p>14. In paragraph 1969 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Security 
Council should require the Government of Israel, under Article 40 of the Charter of the 
United Nations, to:  
</p>
<p> (a) Take all appropriate steps, within a period of three months, to launch 
appropriate investigations that are independent and in conformity with international 
standards, into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The General Assembly did so and adopted its resolution 64/10 of 5 November 2009. 
 2 The Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, the Committee against Torture and the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child. </p>


<p>rights law reported by the Mission, and any other serious allegations that might come to its 
attention;  
</p>
<p> (b) Inform the Security Council, within a further period of three months, of 
actions taken, or in the process of being taken, by the Government of Israel to inquire into, 
investigate and prosecute such serious violations. 
</p>
<p>15. To date, the Security Council has not directed such a request to the Government of 
Israel. 
</p>
<p>16. In paragraph 1969 (b) of its report, the Mission further recommended that the 
Security Council should at the same time establish an independent committee of experts in 
international humanitarian and human rights law to monitor and report on any domestic 
legal or other proceedings undertaken by the Government of Israel in relation to the above-
mentioned investigations. The Mission also recommended that such a committee should 
report at the end of its six-month period to the Security Council on its assessment of 
relevant domestic proceedings initiated by the Government of Israel, including their 
progress, effectiveness and genuineness, so that the Security Council may assess whether 
appropriate action to ensure justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators has been 
or is being taken at the domestic level; that the Security Council should request the 
committee to report to it at determined intervals, as may be necessary; and that the 
committee should be appropriately supported by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).  
</p>
<p>17. To date, the Security Council has not established such a committee.3 
</p>
<p>18. In paragraph 1969 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Security 
Council should require the said independent committee of experts to monitor and report on 
any domestic legal or other proceedings undertaken by the relevant authorities in the Gaza 
Strip in relation to the above-mentioned investigations and that the committee should report 
at the end of the six-month period to the Security Council on its assessment of relevant 
domestic proceedings initiated by the relevant authorities in Gaza, including their progress, 
effectiveness and genuineness, so that the Security Council might assess whether 
appropriate action to ensure justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators had been 
taken or was being taken at the domestic level. The Mission also recommended that the 
Security Council should request the committee to report to it at determined intervals, as 
might be necessary.   
</p>
<p>19. In paragraphs 1969 (c) and (e) of its report, the Mission further recommended that, 
upon receipt of the committee&#8217;s report, the Security Council should consider the situation 
and, in the absence of good-faith investigations that are independent and in conformity with 
international standards having been undertaken or being under way within six months of 
the date of its resolution under Article 40 by the appropriate authorities of Israel or the 
relevant authorities in Gaza, respectively acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>  
 3 The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 13/9, decided to establish a committee of independent 
</p>
<p>experts in international humanitarian and human rights laws to monitor and assess any domestic, legal 
or other proceedings undertaken by both the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side, in the 
light of General Assembly resolution 64/254, including the independence, effectiveness and 
genuineness of these investigations and their conformity with international standards. In accordance 
with that same resolution, the Committee of Independent Experts presented its report to Human 
Rights Council at its fifteenth session (A/HRC/15/50). In its resolution 15/6, the Council welcomed 
the Committee&#8217;s report and decided to renew and resume the mandate of the Committee. In 
accordance with that same resolution, the Committee of Independent Experts presented its report to 
the Council at its sixteenth session (A/HRC/16/24). In its resolution 16/32, the Council took note of 
the Committee&#8217;s two reports and called for the implementation of the conclusions contained therein. </p>


<p>United Nations, refer the situation in Gaza to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal 
Court pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  In 
paragraph 1969 (f) of its report, the Mission recommended that lack of cooperation by the 
Government of Israel or the Gaza authorities with the work of the committee should be 
regarded by the Security Council to be obstruction of the work of the committee.  
</p>
<p>20. As the Security Council has not established an independent committee of experts, 
none of these recommended actions has been carried out.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Action by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>21. In paragraph 1970 of its report, the Mission stated that, with reference to the 
declaration under article 12 (3) of the Rome Statute received by the Office of the 
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court from the Government of Palestine, it 
considered that accountability for victims and the interests of peace and justice in the 
region required that the Prosecutor should make the required legal determination as 
expeditiously as possible. 
</p>
<p>22. In a letter dated 28 June 2011 addressed to the Deputy High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court stated that, 
in accordance with articles 12 and 15 of the Rome Statute, the Office has continued its 
preliminary examination into whether the statutory requirements are fulfilled for the Court 
to exercise jurisdiction in respect of any crimes referred to in article 5 of the Rome Statute 
that may have been committed in the Gaza Strip between December 2008 and 22 January 
</p><p>2009. The Office of the Prosecutor noted that it has considered public reports and received 
legal submissions in this regard from experts and academics.4 It has also received a report 
from the Palestinian Authority on the issue of the statutory requirements for exercise of 
jurisdiction by the Court. The Office has also received and accepted requests from different 
parties involved in the conflict to present their views before it makes a determination. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Action by the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>23. In paragraph 1971 of its report, the Mission addressed four recommendations to the 
General Assembly. In paragraph 1971 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that the 
General Assembly should request the Security Council to report to it on measures taken 
with regard to ensuring accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian 
law and human rights in relation to the facts in its report and any other relevant facts in the 
context of the military operations in Gaza, including the implementation of the Mission&#8217;s 
recommendations. It stated that the Assembly could remain apprised of the matter until it 
was satisfied that appropriate action had been taken at the domestic or international level in 
order to ensure justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators and could also 
consider whether additional action within its powers was required in the interests of justice, 
including under its resolution 377 (V) on uniting for peace. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 An updated list of such submissions is available on the Court&#8217;s website, together with the summary of 
</p>
<p>submissions on whether the declaration lodged by the Palestinian Authority meets statutory 
requirements. Available from www.icc-
cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Comm+and+Ref/Palestine/. </p>


<p>24. To date, the General Assembly has not directed such a request to the Security 
Council.5  
</p>
<p>25. In paragraph 1971 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that the General 
Assembly should establish an escrow fund to be used to pay adequate compensation to 
Palestinians who have suffered loss and damage as a result of unlawful acts attributable to 
Israel during the December-January military operation and actions in connection with it, 
and that the Government of Israel should pay the required amounts into such fund. The 
Mission also recommended that the Assembly should ask OHCHR to provide expert advice 
on the appropriate modalities to establish the escrow fund.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>26. To date, the General Assembly has not established such a fund.6 
</p>
<p>27. In paragraph 1971 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that the General 
Assembly should ask the Government of Switzerland to convene a conference of the high 
contracting parties to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons 
in Time of War on measures to enforce the Convention in the occupied Palestinian territory 
and to ensure its respect in accordance with its article 1. 
</p>
<p>28. Steps taken by the General Assembly in furtherance of the implementation of this 
recommendation were outlined in the previous progress report of the Secretary-General 
(A/HRC/15/51, para. 26). Since then, the General Assembly has not taken any further 
action in this matter.7 
</p>
<p>29. In paragraph 1971 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that the General 
Assembly should promote an urgent discussion on the future legality of the use of certain 
munitions referred to in its report, and in particular white phosphorous, flechettes and 
heavy metal such as tungsten. In such a discussion, it recommended that the Assembly 
should draw on, inter alia, the expertise of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC). The Mission also recommended that the Government of Israel should undertake a 
</p>
<p>  
 5 The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 16/32, recommended that the General Assembly remain 
</p>
<p>apprised of the matter until it is satisfied that appropriate action has been taken at the domestic or 
international level to ensure justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators, and also remain 
ready to consider whether additional action within its powers is required in the interests of justice. 
</p>
<p> 6 By its resolution 13/9, the Human Rights Council called upon the High Commissioner to explore and 
determine the appropriate modalities for the establishment of such an escrow fund. The High 
Commissioner reported to the Council on this matter in the context of her report on follow-up to the 
report of the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict 
(A/HRC/15/52/Add.1). In paragraph 6 of its resolution 16/32, the Human Rights Council called upon 
the High Commissioner to follow up on the determination of appropriate modalities for the 
establishment of an escrow fund for the provision of reparations to Palestinians who suffered loss and 
damage as a result of unlawful acts attributable to the State of Israel during the military operations 
conducted from December 2008 to January 2009, also taking into consideration Israelis who suffered 
loss and damage as a result of unlawful acts attributable to the Palestinian side. The High 
Commissioner subsequently reported on this matter in the context of her progress report on the 
implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 16/32 (A/HRC/18/50). 
</p>
<p> 7 In paragraph 5 of its resolution 16/32, the Human Rights Council welcomed the efforts made by the 
Government of Switzerland, in its capacity as depositary of the Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian persons in Time of War, to reconvene, as soon as possible, a conference of 
High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention on measures to enforce the Convention in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to ensure respect in accordance 
with common article 1, bearing in mind the statement adopted on 15 July 1999, as well as the 
reconvening of the conference and the declaration adopted on 5 December 2001, and recommended 
that the Government of Switzerland continue to pursue its efforts with the aim of resuming the 
conference before September 2011. See also A/HRC/18/50. </p>


<p>moratorium on the use of such weapons in the light of the human suffering and damage 
they had caused in the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>30. To date, the General Assembly has not taken action to promote such a discussion.8  
</p>
<p><b> E. Action by the State of Israel 
</b></p>
<p>31. In paragraph 1972 of its report, the Mission addressed a total of nine 
recommendations to the State of Israel.   
</p>
<p>32. In paragraph 1972 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that Israel should 
immediately cease the border closures and restrictions on passage through border crossings 
with the Gaza Strip and allow the passage of goods necessary and sufficient to meet the 
needs of the population, for the recovery and reconstruction of housing and essential 
services, and for the resumption of meaningful economic activity in the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>33. The border closures and restrictions on passage through border crossings with the 
Gaza Strip continue to seriously negatively affect livelihoods and infrastructure.9 In light of 
restrictions on the importation of building materials, the vast majority of the 40,000 
housing units needed to replace homes destroyed during Operation Cast Lead and meet 
natural population growth have not been constructed. This housing shortage has especially 
affected families living in dilapidated and overcrowded housing conditions, and has 
disproportionately impacted women and children.10 Unemployment in the second half of 
2010 in Gaza reached 45.2 per cent, one of the highest rates in the world.11<b> </b>High 
unemployment levels and the demand for construction materials resulted in thousands of 
people risking their lives to work in tunnels along the border with Egypt, or in access-
restricted areas near the barrier surrounding Gaza.12 In December 2010, Israel allowed the 
export of a limited amount of cut flowers and strawberries.13 Israel announced in June 2011 
that it would allow the entry of material to construct new houses and schools to the value of 
$100 million, bringing the total of approved projects involving &#8220;dual use&#8221; material to $265 
million.14 
</p>
<p>  
 8 In paragraph 13 of its resolution 13/9, the Human Rights Council called upon the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>to promote an urgent discussion on the future legality of the use of certain munitions as referred to in 
the report of the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza 
Conflict, drawing on, inter alia, the expertise of ICRC. The Council reiterated this call in paragraph 7 
of its resolution 16/32.

<p>34. In paragraph 1972 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that Israel should 
cease the restrictions on access to the sea for fishing purposes imposed on the Gaza Strip 
and allow such fishing activities within the 20 nautical miles as provided for in the Oslo 
Accords. It also recommended that Israel should allow the resumption of agricultural 
activity within the Gaza Strip, including within areas in the vicinity of the borders with 
Israel. 
</p>
<p>35. There has been no change in the policies of Israel in response to this 
recommendation since the previous progress report of the Secretary-General 
(A/HRC/15/51, para. 33). The status and impact of these policies are addressed in detail in 
the most recent report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 
implementation of Human Rights Council resolutions S-9/1 and S-12/1 (A/HRC/16/71).15   
</p>
<p>36. In paragraph 1972 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that Israel should 
initiate a review of the rules of engagement, standard operating procedures, open fire 
regulations and other guidance for military and security personnel. It recommended that 
Israel should avail itself of the expertise of ICRC, OHCHR and other relevant bodies, and 
Israeli experts, civil society organizations with the relevant expertise and specialization, in 
order to ensure compliance in this respect with international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law. It recommended that, in particular, such rules of 
engagement should ensure that the principles of proportionality, distinction, precaution and 
non-discrimination were effectively integrated in all such guidance and in any oral 
briefings provided to officers, soldiers and security forces, so as to avoid the recurrence of 
Palestinian civilian deaths, destruction and affronts on human dignity in violation of 
international law. 
</p>
<p>37. Certain action taken by Israel in implementation of the above recommendation was 
outlined in the previous progress report of the Secretary-General (A/HRC/15/51, para. 35). 
The Secretary-General is not aware that any further action has been taken to implement the 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>38. In paragraph 1972 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that Israel should 
allow freedom of movement for Palestinians within the Occupied Palestinian Territory &#8211; 
within the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, between the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank, and between the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the outside world &#8211; in 
accordance with international human rights standards and international commitments 
entered into by Israel and the representatives of the Palestinian people. The Mission further 
recommended that Israel should forthwith lift travel bans currently placed on Palestinians 
by reason of their human rights or political activities. 
</p>
<p>39. Freedom of movement within the Occupied Palestinian Territory remains severely 
restricted. Although Israel began dismantling a section of the barrier near the West Bank 
village of Bil&#8217;in in June 2011 in compliance with the decision of the Israeli High Court of 
Justice in <i>Beit Sourik Village Council v. the Government of Israel </i>(HCJ 2056/04).16 There 
has been no significant improvement in access for Palestinians to areas to the west of the

<p>barrier, including East Jerusalem, or to land and rural communities in the Jordan Valley.17 
Freedom of movement for Palestinians between Gaza and the West Bank and abroad 
remains strictly limited.18 Palestinian human rights defenders continue to face difficulties 
travelling between the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the outside world due to the 
travel bans imposed by Israel.19   
</p>
<p>40. In paragraph 1972 (e) of its report, the Mission recommended that Israel should 
release Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons in connection with the occupation. The 
release of children should be an utmost priority. The Mission further recommended that 
Israel should cease the discriminatory treatment of Palestinian detainees and that family 
visits for prisoners from Gaza should resume. 
</p>
<p>41. As of June 2011 approximately 5,500 Palestinians remained in prisons in Israel and 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 211 children (38 between ages of 12 and 
15).20 More than 200 Palestinians were in administrative detention.21 Arrest and detention 
of children from East Jerusalem suspected of throwing stones at Israeli settlers and their 
private security personnel increased.22 Conditions of detention remain poor and ill-
treatment and abuse of detainees during arrest, interrogation and detention are reportedly 
routine.23 The Israeli authorities continue to bar family visits for prisoners from Gaza.24  
</p>
<p>42. In paragraph 1972 (f) of its report, the Mission recommended that Israel should 
forthwith cease interference with national political processes in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory and, as a first step, release all members of the Palestinian Legislative Council 
currently in detention and allow all members of the Council to move between Gaza and the 
West Bank so that it may resume functioning. 
</p>
<p>43. As of the date of writing, twelve members of the Palestinian Legislative Council 
(PLC) remain in Israeli detention. Three PLC members who had been in detention between 
2006 and June 2010, and who subsequently had their residency permits revoked by the 
Government of Israel on the basis of their lack of loyalty to the State, continued to seek 
refuge on ICRC premises in East Jerusalem (A/HRC/16/71, para. 23). A fourth PLC

</p>
<p>44. In paragraph 1972 (g) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Government 
of Israel should cease actions aimed at limiting the expression of criticism by civil society 
and members of the public concerning the policies and conduct of Israel during the military 
operations in the Gaza Strip. The Mission also recommended that Israel should set up an 
independent inquiry to assess whether the treatment by Israeli judicial authorities of 
Palestinian and Jewish Israelis expressing dissent in connection with the offensive was 
discriminatory, in terms of both charges and detention pending trial. The results of the 
inquiry should be made public and, subject to the findings, appropriate remedial action 
should be taken. 
</p>
<p>45. Israel has not established an independent inquiry to assess whether the treatment by 
Israeli judicial authorities of Palestinian and Jewish Israelis expressing dissent in 
connection with the offensive was discriminatory. Non-governmental organizations 
continue to report concerns regarding initiatives to curtail freedom of expression in Israel 
and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, reportedly as a reaction to their roles during the 
Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip. In November 2010 a bill was introduced 
proposing an amendment to the Associations Law26 to close organizations whose activities 
&#8220;harm the State of Israel as a Jewish state&#8221;, namely those that participate in filing lawsuits 
abroad against senior Israeli politicians and army officers. The bill is set to be debated in 
the Knesset later in 2011.27 On 21 February 2011 the Knesset enacted the NGO Funding 
Transparency Law,28 which requires Israeli non-profit organizations to disclose foreign 
sources of funding. Two bills amending legislation were also under consideration by the 
Knesset at the time of this report: one amending the Income Tax Order29 whereby funding 
from foreign states would be taxed at a rate of 45% and the other amending the 
Associations Act30<b> </b>limiting donations from a foreign entity to 20,000 NIS per year. The 
official explanation attached to the draft bill amending the Income Tax Order specifically 
references the &#8220;Goldstone Report&#8221;.31 <b>  
</b></p>
<p>46. In paragraph 1972 (h) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Government 
of Israel should refrain from any action of reprisal against Palestinian and Israeli 
individuals and organizations that have cooperated with the United Nations Fact-Finding

<p>Mission on the Gaza Conflict, in particular individuals who had appeared at the public 
hearings held by the Mission in Gaza and Geneva and expressed criticism of actions by 
Israel.  
</p>
<p>47. The Secretary-General is not aware of any reprisals taken by the Government of 
Israel against Palestinian or Israeli individuals that cooperated with the Mission. However, 
a proposal introduced in the Knesset in June 2011 would, if adopted, end the assignment of 
National Service civilian volunteers to the Israeli non-governmental organizations that 
cooperated with the Mission.32  
</p>
<p>48. In paragraph 1972 (i) of its report, the Mission recommended that Israel should 
reiterate its commitment to respecting the inviolability of United Nations premises and 
personnel and that it should undertake all appropriate measures to ensure that there was no 
repetition of violations in the future. It further recommended that reparations to the United 
Nations should be provided fully and without further delay by Israel, and that the General 
Assembly should consider the matter.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>49. To date, the United Nations has not received any formal communication from the 
Government of Israel reiterating a commitment to respecting the inviolability of United 
Nations premises and personnel. Information on the subject of reparations was included in 
A/HRC/13/55. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Action by Palestinian armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>50. In paragraph 1973 of its report, the Mission addressed two recommendations to 
Palestinian armed groups. </p>
<p>51. In paragraph 1973 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that Palestinian armed 
groups should undertake forthwith to respect international humanitarian law, in particular 
by renouncing attacks on Israeli civilians and civilian objects, and take all feasible 
precautionary measures to avoid harm to Palestinian civilians during hostilities. 
</p>
<p>52. Indiscriminate rocket and mortar attacks against Israel continue to be launched from 
Gaza.33 According to the United Nations Department of Safety and Security, from 1 
September 2010 to 21 June 2011 there were 32 incidents of rocket fire and 19 incidents of 
mortar shelling. The Secretary-General is unable to confirm whether Palestinian armed 
groups have taken all feasible precautionary measures to avoid harm to Palestinian civilians 
during hostilities.    
</p>
<p>53. In paragraph 1973 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Palestinian 
armed groups holding Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in detention should release him on 
humanitarian grounds; pending that release, they should recognize his status as prisoner of 
war, treat him as such, and allow him ICRC visits. 
</p>
<p>54. At the time of writing, Gilad Shalit was still in detention, had not been recognized as 
a prisoner of war and had not been not allowed any contact with ICRC.34

<p><b> G. Action by responsible Palestinian authorities 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Mission directed three recommendations to responsible Palestinian authorities 
in paragraph 1974 of its report.  </p>
<p>56. In paragraph 1974 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Palestinian 
Authority should issue clear instructions to security forces under its command to abide by 
human rights norms as enshrined in the Palestinian Basic Law and international 
instruments, ensure prompt and independent investigations of all allegations of serious 
human rights violations by security forces under its control, and end the resort to military 
justice to deal with cases involving civilians.  
</p>
<p>57. On 17 January 2011 the Palestinian Authority reportedly announced that civilians 
will no longer be tried by military courts.35   
</p>
<p>58. In paragraph 1974 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Palestinian 
Authority and the Gaza authorities should release without delay all political detainees 
currently in their power and refrain from further arrests on political grounds and in 
violation of international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>59. OHCHR is not aware of any developments in this regard. 
</p>
<p>60. In paragraph 1974 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that the Palestinian 
Authority and the Gaza authorities should continue to enable the free and independent 
operation of Palestinian non-governmental organizations, including human rights 
organizations, and of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>61. There is no indication that any action has been taken to implement the above-
mentioned recommendation. Repression of freedom of expression and attacks on civil 
society organizations continue in the West Bank and in Gaza. Palestinian security forces 
arrested a manager of a radio station on 15 November 2010, after the station reported on 
differences between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the Fatah Central 
Committee.36 Palestinian security forces also arrested a journalist working for al-Quds Press 
News Agency on charges of libel and slander against President Mahmoud Abbas.37 In 
October 2010 Hamas security forces shut down the Palestinian Journalists&#8217; Syndicate;38 and 
on 30 November Hamas security forces shut down all offices of the Sharek Youth Forum, 
on the basis of allegations of &#8220;moral misconduct&#8221;.39 In March 2011 Hamas security forces 
attacked journalists, including women, covering peaceful demonstrations, including

<p>beating, insulting, threatening and detaining journalists, and raiding several media agency 
offices.40 
</p>
<p><b> H. Action by the international community</b>41<b> 
</b></p>
<p>62. Paragraph 1975 of the Mission&#8217;s report contains five recommendations addressed to 
a range of actors and partners in the international community. 
</p>
<p>63. In paragraph 1975 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that the States parties 
to the Geneva Conventions relating to the protection of victims of international armed 
conflicts should start criminal investigations in national courts, using universal jurisdiction, 
where there is sufficient evidence of the commission of grave breaches of the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949. It also recommended that, where so warranted following 
investigations, alleged perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted in accordance with 
internationally recognized standards of justice.  
</p>
<p>64. The Secretary-General is not aware of any further action taken to implement the 
above recommendation since his previous progress report (A/HRC/15/51, para. 62). 
</p>
<p>65. In paragraph 1975 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that international aid 
providers should step up financial and technical assistance for organizations providing 
psychological support and mental health services to the Palestinian population.  
</p>
<p>66. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) reports that the impact of Operation 
Cast Lead and the blockade have greatly diminished family coping mechanisms and led to 
significant deterioration of services, thereby deeply affecting the well-being of children. In 
2011, it had received a total of $3.8 million from the Canadian International Development 
Agency and the European Commission Humanitarian Aid department, which is earmarked 
for emergency response for protection and psychosocial support. UNICEF also reports that, 
owing to extreme economic distress, many children are engaged in dangerous labour to 
support their families, including the collection of gravel and scrap metal in abandoned 
settlements and in the buffer zone near the barrier around Gaza, where they are at high risk 
of being shot by Israeli security forces. In addition, UNICEF states that, in collaboration 
with Columbia University and local partners, it is introducing standardized tools for 
monitoring and evaluating psychosocial interventions for children and caregivers. 
</p>
<p>67. UNRWA reports that children who suffered trauma after Operation Cast Lead were 
initially supported through a special initiative under the UNRWA Community Mental 
Health Programme. After completing targeted counselling in late 2009, children who 
continued to show symptoms were given additional care through existing counselling 
activities in UNRWA schools throughout Gaza. 
</p>
<p>68. In paragraph 1975 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that, in view of their 
crucial function, donor countries and assistance providers should continue to support the 
work of Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations in documenting and publicly 
reporting on violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and advising 
relevant authorities on their compliance with international law.  
</p>
<p>  
 40 International Freedom of Expression Exchange, &#8220;MADA demands investigation into attacks on 
</p>
<p>journalists covering protest&#8221;, 17 March 2011.<b> 
</b> 41 In order to gather information regarding the status of implementation of the recommendations 
</p>
<p>contained in paragraphs 1975, 1976 and 1977, OHCHR addressed letters to United Nations agencies 
working in the occupied Palestinian territory. The information regarding these recommendations is 
based on replies received. </p>


<p>69. In response to informal queries from OHCHR, neither Israeli nor Palestinian NGOs 
had reported any major changes in their funding at the time of publication of the present 
report.    
</p>
<p>70. OHCHR continues to lead the Protection Cluster Working Group and the 
Accountability Task Force within it. Both include Palestinian and Israeli non-governmental 
organizations and share information relating to documenting, developing reports and 
advocacy activities concerning violations of human rights and international humanitarian 
law.   
</p>
<p>71. UNICEF reports that it leads an inter-agency working group that regularly reports to 
the Working Group of the Security Council on Children and Armed Conflict. The Working 
Group has submitted four bi-monthly reports to the Security Council covering the time 
period from September 2010 to April 2011. The reports document grave violations42 against 
children in the Occupied Palestinian Territory by Israeli security forces, Palestinian armed 
groups and Israeli settlers. This includes reports of killing and injuries, detention, ill-
treatment and torture, use of children by armed forces, forced displacement, attacks on 
schools and impediments to humanitarian access, including health services and education.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>72. In paragraph 1975 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that States involved in 
peace negotiations between Israel and representatives of the Palestinian people, especially 
the Quartet, should ensure that respect for the rule of law, international law and human 
rights assumes a central role in internationally sponsored peace initiatives.  
</p>
<p>73. On 21 September 2010 the Quartet issued a statement that, among other things, 
urged a complete halt to all violence and reiterated its call on all parties to ensure the 
protection of civilians and to respect international humanitarian and human rights law.43   
</p>
<p>74. In paragraph 1975 (e) of its report, the Mission recommended that, in view of the 
allegations and reports about long-term environmental damage that may have been created 
by certain munitions or debris from munitions, a programme of environmental 
monitoring should be implemented under the auspices of the United Nations, for as long as 
deemed necessary; the programme should include the Gaza Strip and areas within southern 
Israel close to impact sites. The environmental monitoring programme should be in 
accordance with the recommendations of an independent body, and samples and analyses 
should be analysed by one or more independent expert institutions. Such recommendations, 
at least at the outset, should include measurement mechanisms that address the fears of the 
population of Gaza and southern Israel at that time and should at a minimum be in a 
position to determine the presences of heavy metals of all varieties, white phosphorous, 
tungsten micro-shrapnel and granules and such other chemicals as may be revealed by the 
investigation.  
</p>
<p>75. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) reports that, as part of a 
follow-up to its study <i>Environmental Assessment of the Gaza Strip following the escalation 
of hostilities in December 2008 &#8211; January 2009</i>,44 it has focused on restoring groundwater 
sustainability in Gaza, prepared a technical paper which proposes that a major

<p>desalinization plant or a series of smaller plants be established and noted that sewage 
systems in Gaza need to be upgraded to ensure connectivity and improved treatment. 
According to UNEP, this will require the establishment of a series of new sewage treatment 
plants, as the existing ones are overloaded and incapable of producing the quality of water 
needed for re-use in the Gaza Strip.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Action by the international community and responsible Palestinian 
authorities 
</b></p>
<p>76. In paragraph 1976 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that the international 
community and responsible Palestinian authorities should establish appropriate 
mechanisms to ensure that the funds pledged by international donors for reconstruction 
activities in the Gaza Strip were smoothly and effectively disbursed, and urgently put to use 
for the benefit of the population of Gaza.  
</p>
<p>77. To date, no mechanism has been established to track, receive and allow disbursal of 
funds for the reconstruction of Gaza. UNRWA reports that United Nations implementing 
agencies remain unable to effectively access and use funds pledged at the International 
Conference on the Palestinian Economy and Gaza Reconstruction in March 2009 for 
construction activities for the benefit of the civilian population. UNRWA also reports that it 
has proposed to Israeli authorities a streamlined process of project approvals and transfer of 
construction supplies through the crossings established under the Agreement on Movement 
and Access of 2005, with a view towards expediting the implementation of construction 
and reconstruction projects.  
</p>
<p>78. In paragraph 1976 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that, in view of the 
consequences of the military operations, responsible Palestinian authorities and 
international aid providers should pay special attention to the needs of persons with 
disabilities. In addition, the Mission recommended that medical follow-up should be 
ensured by relevant international and Palestinian structures with regard to patients who had 
suffered amputations or been otherwise injured by munitions, the nature of which had not 
been clarified, in order to monitor any possible long-term impact on their health. Financial 
and technical assistance should be provided to ensure adequate medical follow-up to 
Palestinian patients. 
</p>
<p>79. The Secretary-General noted in his previous progress report (A/HRC/15/51, para. 
77) that he was not aware of any action taken by responsible Palestinian authorities or 
Palestinian structures in response to the above recommendation. This continues to be the 
case. 
</p>
<p>80. In its submission to OHCHR, UNRWA reports that it continues to cooperate with 
local organizations to ensure that patients receive prosthetic devices and artificial limbs, 
and to provide physiotherapy for persons who sustained injuries during Operation Cast 
Lead. In addition, UNRWA is providing community-based organizations with financial 
assistance and technical advice to help them deliver services to their target groups. For 
example, UNRWA has provided financial subsidies to cover a portion of operating 
expenses and educational fees, covered salaries for employees through its job creation 
programme and assisted such organizations to provide basic goods to affected families. 
UNRWA also reports that it has delivered direct psychosocial support, physiotherapy, 
occupational therapy and assistive devices to individuals and families affected.   </p>


<p><b> J.  Action by the international community, Israel and Palestinian 
authorities 
</b></p>
<p>81. In paragraph 1977 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that Israel and 
representatives of the Palestinian people, and international actors involved in the peace 
process, should involve Israeli and Palestinian civil society in devising sustainable peace 
agreements based on respect for international law. The participation of women should be 
ensured in accordance with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).  
</p>
<p>82. As stated in A/HRC/13/55, paragraph 93, there are ongoing efforts to involve Israeli 
and Palestinian civil society groups in the peace process, including those led by United 
Nations bodies. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) supports a network of 20 
non-governmental organizations in Gaza that seek to combat violence against women, 
promote women&#8217;s protection, emphasize women&#8217;s issues and mainstream Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000).  
</p>
<p>83. In paragraph 1977 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that attention should 
be given to the position of women and steps be taken to ensure their access to 
compensation, legal assistance and economic security. 
</p>
<p>84. In its submission to OHCHR, UNRWA reports that it continues to provide women 
whose homes were damaged or demolished during Operation Cast Lead with cash 
assistance and rental fees. Cash subsidies have been disbursed to enable female-headed 
households who had their shelters damaged to pay for minor and major repairs. In cases 
where shelters have been destroyed completely, UNRWA continues to pay one-year rental 
fees. Women continue to account for approximately one third of employees under the 
UNRWA Job Creation Programme. Since Operation Cast Lead, a number of Gaza Women 
Programme Centres supported by UNRWA have offered psychosocial and legal support to 
women.  
</p>
<p>85. In its submission to OHCHR, UNFPA reports that it has, in partnership with two 
non-governmental organizations, supported centres for women in the Jabalia and Bureij 
areas. These centres provide a package of services, including reproductive health care such 
as family planning, antenatal and postnatal care, and psychosocial, legal and recreational 
services.  
</p>
<p><b> K. Action by the Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p>86. In paragraph 1978 of its report, the Mission recommended that the Secretary-
General should develop a policy to integrate human rights into peace initiatives in which 
the United Nations is involved, especially the Quartet, and request the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide expertise required to implement that recommendation.  
</p>
<p>87. As stated in his previous progress report (A/HRC/15/51, para. 85), the Secretary-
General has asked OHCHR, in cooperation with the United Nations Special Coordinator for 
the Middle East Peace Process, to devise proposals to ensure increased integration of
