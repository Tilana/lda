<p><b>Resolution 6/1. Protection of cultural rights and property  
in situations of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also</i> by the principles relating to economic, social and cultural rights 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 
</p>
<p>(A/CONF.157/23), the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution 
</p>
<p>60/1 of 16 September 2005) and Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 that 
</p>
<p>established the Human Rights Council all affirm that all human rights are universal, 
</p>
<p>indivisible, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and must be treated in a fair and 
</p>
<p>equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i> that the General Assembly acknowledged in its resolution 
</p>
<p>60/251 that peace and security, development and human rights are the pillars of the 
</p>

</p>
<p>and recognized that development, peace and security and human rights are interlinked 
</p>
<p>and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
</p>
<p>complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>

</p>
<p>detrimental impact on cultural rights and property, </p>

</p>
<p>of Armed Conflict and its Protocols, and stressing the importance of their 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that the destruction of or any other form of damage to cultural 
</p>

</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to respect human rights law and strongly urges all

</p>
<p>occupied territories; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Strongly condemns</i> any destruction of cultural property in violation of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, as applicable, during armed conflicts; 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>organizations to take all necessary measures at the national, regional and international 
</p>

<p>conflicts, paying particular attention to the situation in occupied territories, and to 
</p>

</p>
