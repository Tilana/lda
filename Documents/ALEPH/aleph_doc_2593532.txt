VOC ENERGY TRUST
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1.  Organization of the Trust
VOC Energy Trust (the “Trust”) is a statutory trust formed on November 3, 2010 (capitalized on December 17, 2010),
under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a Trust Agreement dated November 3, 2010 (as amended and
restated on May 10, 2011, the “Trust Agreement”) among VOC Brazos Energy Partners, L.P., a Texas limited
partnership (“VOC Brazos”), as trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the
“Trustee”), and Wilmington Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the “Delaware Trustee”).  The Trust was created to
acquire and hold a term net profits interest for the benefit of the Trust unitholders.
VOC Brazos is a privately-held limited partnership engaged in the production and development of oil and natural gas
from properties located in Texas. VOC Kansas Energy Partners, L.L.C., a Kansas limited liability company (“VOC
Kansas”), is a privately-held limited liability company engaged in the production and development of oil and natural
gas from properties primarily located in Kansas along with a limited number of Texas properties. In connection with
the closing of the initial public offering of units of beneficial interest in the Trust (“Trust Units”) in May 2011, VOC
Brazos acquired all of the membership interests in VOC Kansas in exchange for newly issued limited partner interests
in VOC Brazos pursuant to a Contribution and Exchange Agreement, dated August 30, 2010, as amended, by and
between VOC Brazos and VOC Kansas.  This resulted in VOC Kansas becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of VOC
Brazos.
In connection with the May 2011 closing of the initial public offering and in exchange for 17,000,000 Trust Units, VOC
Brazos and VOC Kansas conveyed a term net profits interest representing the right to receive 80% of the net
proceeds (calculated as described below in Note 6) from production from the underlying properties (as defined below)
(the “net profits interest”). The net profits interest consists of net interests in all of the oil and natural gas properties
held by VOC Brazos and VOC Kansas in the states of Kansas and Texas as of the date of the conveyance of the net
profits interest to the Trust.  We refer to the properties in which the Trust holds the net profits interest as the
“underlying properties.”
The net profits interest is passive in nature, and the Trustee has no management control over and no responsibility
relating to the operation of the underlying properties. The net profits interest entitles the Trust to receive 80% of the
net proceeds attributable to VOC Brazos’ interest from the sale of production from the underlying properties during the
term of the Trust. The net profits interest will terminate on the later to occur of (1) December 31, 2030 or (2) the time
when 10.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”) (which is the equivalent of 8.5 MMBoe in respect of the net
profits interest) have been produced from the underlying properties and sold, and the Trust will soon thereafter wind up
its affairs and terminate.
The Trustee can authorize the Trust to borrow money to pay administrative or incidental expenses of the Trust that
exceed cash held by the Trust. The Trustee may authorize the Trust to borrow from the Trustee or the Delaware
Trustee as a lender provided the terms of the loan are similar to the terms it would grant to a similarly situated
commercial customer with whom it did not have a fiduciary relationship. The Trustee may also deposit funds awaiting
distribution in an account with itself and make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust.
Note 2.  Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Condensed Statements of Assets and Trust Corpus as of December 31, 2015, which has been
derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim condensed financial statements as of June 30,
2016 and for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, have been prepared pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, certain information
and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
those rules and regulations.
The preparation of financial statements requires the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The Trustee believes such information includes all the disclosures necessary to make the
information presented not misleading. The information furnished reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of the
Trustee, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim period presented. The financial information
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Trust’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Note 3.  Trust Accounting Policies
The Trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting to report receipts by the Trust of the term net profits interest
and payments of expenses incurred. The term net profits interest represents the right to receive revenues (oil and
natural gas sales), less direct operating expenses (lease operating expenses and production and property taxes) and
an adjustment for lease equipment costs and lease development expenses (which are capitalized in financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“U.S. GAAP”)) of the underlying properties, times 80%. Actual cash receipts may vary due to timing delays of actual
cash receipts from the property operators or purchasers and due to wellhead and pipeline volume balancing
agreements or practices. The actual cash distributions of the Trust will be made based on the terms of the
conveyance creating the Trust’s net profits interest.  Expenses of the Trust, which include accounting, engineering,
legal and other professional fees, Trustee fees, an administrative fee paid to VOC Brazos and out-of-pocket
expenses, are recognized when paid. Under U.S. GAAP, revenues and expenses would be recognized on an accrual
basis. Amortization of the investment in net profits interest is recorded on a unit-of-production method in the period in
which the cash is received with respect to such production. Such amortization does not reduce distributable income,
rather it is charged directly to Trust corpus.
This comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty
trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts.
Investment in the net profits interest was recorded initially at the historical cost of VOC Brazos and is periodically
assessed to determine whether its aggregate value has been impaired below its total capitalized cost based on the
underlying properties. The Trust will provide a write-down to its investment in the net profits interest if and when total
capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization, exceed undiscounted future net revenues attributable to the proved
oil and gas reserves of the underlying properties.
No new accounting pronouncements have been adopted or issued during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that would
impact the financial statements of the Trust.
Note 4.  Investment in Net Profits Interest
The net profits interest was recorded at the historical cost of VOC Brazos on May 10, 2011, the date of the
conveyance of the net profits interest to the Trust, and was calculated as follows:

(1)         Excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development
costs reflect expenses and costs incurred by VOC Brazos during the December through
February production period for the three months ended June 30 and during the
September through February production period for the six months ended June 30. Pursuant to
the terms of the conveyance of the net profits interest, lease equipment and development costs
are to be deducted when calculating the distributable income to the Trust.  Included in the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2016 is $447,017 for a one-time event associated with
the collection of suspended funds from ten wells in Texas related to a working interest owner that
elected to go non-consent.
3
(2)         Pursuant to the terms of the conveyance of the net profits interest, VOC Brazos can reserve
up to $1.0 million for future development, maintenance or operating expenditures at any time. 
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, VOC Brazos increased its cash reserve
by $0 and $200,000, respectively.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, VOC
Brazos released and paid to the Trust $0 and $300,000, respectively, from the previously
established cash reserve.  The reserve balance was $1,000,000 and $200,000 at June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.
(3)         The income from net profits interest is based upon the cash receipts from VOC Brazos for
the oil and gas production. The revenues from oil production are typically received by VOC
Brazos one month after production; thus, the cash received by the Trust during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 substantially represents production by VOC Brazos from December 2015
through February 2016 and the cash received by the Trust during the three months ended
June 30, 2015 substantially represents production by VOC Brazos from December 2014 through
February 2015.  The cash received by the Trust during the six months ended June 30, 2016
substantially represents production by VOC Brazos from September 2015 through February 2016
and the cash received by the Trust during the six months ended June 30, 2015 substantially
represents production by VOC Brazos from September 2014 through February 2015.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, MV Purchasing, LLC, an affiliate of VOC Brazos,
purchased a significant portion of the production of the underlying properties.  Sales to MV Purchasing, LLC are under
short-term arrangements, ranging from one to six months, using market sensitive pricing.
Note 6.  Income Taxes
The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust and is not required to pay federal or state income taxes. Accordingly, no
provision for federal or state income taxes has been made.
Note 7.  Distributions to Unitholders
VOC Brazos makes quarterly payments of the net profits interest to the Trust. The Trustee determines for each
quarter the amount available for distribution to the Trust unitholders. This distribution is expected to be made on or
before the 45th day following the end of each quarter to the Trust unitholders of record on the 30th day of the month
following the end of each quarter (or the next succeeding business day). Such amounts will be equal to the excess, if
any, of the cash received by the Trust relating to the preceding quarter, over the expenses of the Trust paid for such
quarter, subject to adjustments for changes made by the Trustee during such quarter in any cash reserves
established for future expenses of the Trust.
The first quarterly distribution during 2016 was $765,000, or $0.045 per Trust Unit, and was made on February 12,
2016 to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of February 1, 2016. Such distribution included the net proceeds of
production collected by VOC Brazos from October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.
The second quarterly distribution during 2016 was $850,000, or $0.05 per Trust Unit, and was made on May 13, 2016
to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of May 2, 2016. Such distribution included the net proceeds of production
collected by VOC Brazos from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016.
The first quarterly distribution during 2015 was $1,700,000, or $0.10 per Trust Unit, and was made on February 14,
2015 to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of January 30, 2015. Such distribution included the net proceeds of
production collected by VOC Brazos from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014.
The second quarterly distribution during 2015 was $2,720,000, or $0.16 per Trust Unit, and was made on May 15,
2015 to Trust unitholders owning Trust Units as of April 30, 2015. Such distribution included the net proceeds of
production collected by VOC Brazos from January 1, 2015 through March 31, 2015.
Note 8.  Advance for Trust Expenses
Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is allowed to borrow money to pay Trust expenses. During the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no borrowings or amounts owed for money borrowed
in previous quarters. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, VOC Brazos has provided a letter of credit in the
amount of $1 million to the Trustee to protect the Trust against the risk that it does not have sufficient cash to pay
future expenses.
4
Note 9.  Subsequent Event
On July 20, 2016, the Trust announced a Trust distribution to unitholders of record on August 1, 2016 of $1,530,000,
or $0.09 per Trust Unit, which is to be paid on August 12, 2016.
Item 2.  Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion of the Trust’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with
the financial statements and notes thereto. The Trust’s purpose is, in general, to hold the net profits interest, to
distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect of the net profits interest and to perform
certain administrative functions in respect of the net profits interest and the Trust Units. The Trust derives
substantially all of its income and cash flows from the net profits interest.

The cash received by the Trust from VOC Brazos during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 substantially represents the
production by VOC Brazos from December 2015 through February 2016.  The cash received by the Trust from VOC
Brazos during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 substantially represents the production by VOC Brazos from
December 2014 through February 2015.  The revenues from oil production are typically received by VOC Brazos one
month after production.
Gross proceeds.  Oil and natural gas sales were $4,767,134 (including $438,179 as noted above for
a one-time event) for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $3,394,966 or 41.6%
from $8,162,100 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  Revenues are a function of oil and
natural gas sales prices and volumes sold.  The decrease in gross proceeds was due to
decreases in oil and natural gas sales volumes and lower market prices for oil and natural gas
during the first quarter of 2016.  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the average price
for oil decreased 35.9% to $30.46 per Bbl and the average price for natural gas decreased 45.1%
to $1.80 per Mcf. Oil sales volumes were 150,815 Bbls (including 4,502 BBls as noted above for
a one-time event) for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 12,859 Bbls or 7.9%
from 163,674 Bbls, while natural gas sales volumes were 96,212 Mcf (including 3,389 Mcf as
noted above for a one-time event), a decrease of 22,184 Mcf or 18.7%.
Costs.   Lease operating expenses were $3,070,932 (offset by a $27,906 reimbursement as noted
above for a one-time event) for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $420,470 or
12.0% from $3,491,402 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Production and property taxes
were $136,081 (including $19,068 as noted above for a one-time event) for the three months
ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $115,736 or 46.0% from $251,817 for the same period in
2015. Such decrease is primarily due to a 84.9% decrease in property taxes and a 44.1%
decrease in production taxes. Development expenses were $216,504 for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, a decrease of $417,359 or 65.8% from $633,863 for the same period in 2015.
Such decrease was primarily due to limited drilling activity and corresponding limited
development expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to development
expenses covering certain completion costs for one horizontal well and certain drilling costs for
one horizontal well that was abandoned during three months ended June 30, 2015.
Excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs.  The excess of
revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs from the
underlying properties was $1,343,617 (including $447,017 as noted above for a one-time event)
for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $2,441,401 or 64.5% from $3,785,018
for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  The Trust’s 80% net profits interest of these totals
were $1,074,894 and $3,028,014, respectively.  During the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, VOC Brazos increased its cash reserve by $0 and $200,000, respectively, for future
development, maintenance or operating expenditures, which resulted in income from the net
profits interest of $1,074,894 and $2,828,014 for such periods, respectively.  These amounts
were reduced by a Trust holdback for future expenses of $224,894 and $108,014 for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Trustee paid general and
administrative expenses of $116,279 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of
$8,329 from $124,608 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  These factors resulted in
distributable income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 of $850,000, a decrease of
$1,870,000 from $2,720,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015.

The cash received by the Trust from VOC Brazos during the six months ended June 30, 2016 substantially represents
the production by VOC Brazos from September 2015 through February 2016.  The cash received by the Trust from
VOC Brazos during the six months ended June 30, 2015 substantially represents the production by VOC Brazos from
September 2014 through February 2015.  The revenues from oil production are typically received by VOC Brazos one
month after production.
Gross proceeds.  Oil and natural gas sales were $10,819,330 (including $438,179 as noted above
for a one-time event) for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $11,456,657 or
51.4% from $22,275,987 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Revenues are a function of oil
and natural gas sales prices and volumes sold.  The decrease in gross proceeds was due to
lower market prices for oil and gas sales during the first six months of 2016 and a decrease in oil
sales volumes and gas sales volumes during the first six months of 2016.  During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, the average price for oil decreased 44.5% to $35.39 per Bbl and the
average price for natural gas decreased 51.3% to $1.93 per Mcf. Oil sales volumes were 295,236
Bbls (including 4,502 BBls as noted above for a one-time event) for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, a decrease of 38,256 Bbls or 11.5% from 333,492 Bbls,
7
while natural gas sales volumes were 192,833 Mcf (including 3,389 Mcf as noted above for a one-time event), a
decrease of 60,911 Mcf or 24.0% from 253,744 Mcf.
Costs.  Lease operating expenses were $6,148,667 (offset by a $27,906 reimbursement as noted
above for a one-time event) for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $1,273,882 or
17.2% from $7,422,549 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due
to decreases in the costs of oilfield goods and services. Production and property taxes were
$1,149,023 (including $19,068 as noted above for a one-time event) for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, a decrease of $1,281,992 or 52.7% from $2,431,015 for the same period in 2015.
Such decrease is primarily due to a 57.3% decrease in production taxes due to lower prices for
oil and gas as well as a 51.0% decrease in property taxes. Development expenses were
$933,224 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $6,086,481 or 86.7% from
$7,019,705 for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to limited drilling
activity and corresponding limited development expenses during the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to development expenses covering certain completion costs for one horizontal
well and certain drilling costs for one horizontal well in the lower EagleBine interval that was
abandoned during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Excess of revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs.  The excess of
revenues over direct operating expenses and lease equipment and development costs from the
underlying properties was $2,588,416 (including $447,017 as noted above for a one-time event)
for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $2,814,302 or 52.1% from $5,402,718 for
the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The Trust’s 80% net profits interest of these totals were
$2,070,733 and $4,322,174, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
VOC Brazos released and paid to the trust $0 and $300,000, respectively, from the previously
established cash reserve for future development, maintenance or operating expenditures, which
resulted in income from the net profits interest of $2,070,733 and $4,622,174 for such periods,
respectively.  These amounts were further reduced by a Trust holdback for future expenses of
$455,733 and $202,174 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
Trustee paid general and administrative expenses of $433,776 for the six months ended June 30,
2016, a decrease of $5,858 from $439,634 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  These
factors resulted in distributable income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $1,615,000, a
decrease of $2,805,000 from $4,420,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Other than Trust administrative expenses, including any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities, the
Trust’s only use of cash is for distributions to Trust unitholders. Administrative expenses include payments to the
Trustee as well as a quarterly administrative fee to VOC Brazos pursuant to an administrative services agreement. 
Each quarter, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution. Available funds are the excess
cash, if any, received by the Trust from the net profits interest and other sources (such as interest earned on any
amounts reserved by the Trustee) in that quarter, over the Trust’s expenses paid for that quarter.  Available funds are
reduced by any cash that the Trustee decides to reserve for future development, maintenance or operating expenses.
As of June 30, 2016, $273,494 was held by the Trustee as such a reserve.
The Trustee may cause the Trust to borrow funds required to pay expenses if the Trustee determines that the cash on
hand and the cash to be received are insufficient to cover the Trust’s expenses.  If the Trust borrows funds, the Trust
unitholders will not receive distributions until the borrowed funds are repaid.  During the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no such borrowings. VOC Brazos has provided a letter of credit in the amount of
$1 million to the Trustee to protect the Trust against the risk that it does not have sufficient cash to pay future
expenses.
Income to the Trust from the net profits interest is based on the calculation and definitions of “gross proceeds” and
“net proceeds” contained in the conveyance.
As substantially all of the underlying properties are located in mature fields, VOC Brazos does not expect future costs
for the underlying properties to change significantly compared to recent historical costs other than changes due to
fluctuations in the general cost of oilfield services.  VOC Brazos may establish a cash reserve of up to $1.0 million in
the aggregate at any given time from the dollar amount otherwise distributable to the Trust to reduce the impact on
distributions of uneven capital expenditure timing. VOC Brazos released $500,000  in January 2015,  withheld
$200,000 in April 2015 and withheld $800,000 in July 2015 in accordance with this cash reserve.
No amounts were released or withheld in 2016 as of June 30, 2016.  The cash reserve balance
was $1,000,000 and $200,000 at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Trust does not have any transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or persons
that could materially affect the Trust’s liquidity or the availability of capital resources.

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than
statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q, including without limitation the statements under “Trustee’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are forward-looking statements. Although
VOC Brazos advised the Trust that it believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements
contained herein are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations (“Cautionary Statements”) are
disclosed in this Form 10-Q and in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
(the “Form 10-K”), including under the section “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking
statements attributable to the Trust or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
Cautionary Statements.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Substantially all of the income to the Trust is derived from the net profits interest, which generally entitles the Trust to
receive 80% of the net proceeds from oil and gas production from the underlying properties. Consequently, the Trust
is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Although the Trust may borrow money to pay
expenses of the Trust, the amount of any such borrowings is unlikely to be material to the Trust. As a result, the
Trust is not subject to any material interest rate market risk.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  The Trustee maintains disclosure controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC.  Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust is
accumulated and communicated by VOC Brazos to the Trustee, as trustee of the Trust, and its
employees who participate in the preparation of the Trust’s periodic reports as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the Trust’s disclosure
controls and procedures. A Trust Officer of the Trustee has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of
the Trust are effective.
Due to the contractual arrangements of (i) the Trust Agreement and (ii) the conveyance of the net profits interest, the
Trustee relies on (A) information provided by VOC Brazos, including historical operating data, plans for future
operating and capital expenditures, reserve information and information relating to projected production, and
(B) conclusions and reports regarding reserves by the Trust’s independent reserve engineers.  See “Risk Factors—
Neither the Trust nor the Trust’s unitholders have the ability to influence VOC Brazos or control the operations or
development of the underlying properties” in the Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there was
no change in the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting.  The
Trustee notes for purposes of clarification that it has no authority over, and makes no statement
concerning, the internal control over financial reporting of VOC Brazos.
