International Tower Hill Mines Announces
Optimization Study Results Showing Improved Livengood Gold Project
Pre-Feasibility Study Completed for Optimized Project Configuration
Vancouver, British Columbia, September 8, 2016  –  International  Tower Hill  Mines  Ltd.  (“ITH”  or  the 
“Company”) (TSX: ITH; NYSE-MKT: THM) today announced the results of a Pre-Feasibility Study (the 
“PFS”) on an optimized configuration for its Livengood Gold Project (the “Project”) located near Fairbanks, 
Alaska.  The engineering optimization studies incorporated in the PFS evaluated several scenarios, ultimately 
selecting a project that will process 52,600 tons per day and produce 6.8 million ounces of gold over 23 years.  
This improved configuration has reduced the capital costs (“CAPEX”) by 34% or $950 million to $1.84 billion, 
the process operating cost (“process OPEX”) by 28% or $2.97 per ton to $7.48 per ton, and the all-in sustaining 
costs by 16% or $242 to $1,263 per ounce, all as compared to the 100,000 tons per day project evaluated in 
the September 2013 Feasibility Study (the “FS”).  All dollar figures in this news release are stated in US 
Dollars.  
 
“We are pleased that our Optimization Study has resulted in lower CAPEX and OPEX costs projected over a 
23  year  mine  life.    Livengood’s  fundamentals  are  compelling,  with  a  substantial  gold  resource,  favorable 
jurisdiction, proximity to infrastructure and great leverage to the gold price.  We are committed to advancing 
our basic engineering and metallurgical work to further de-risk the project and prepare for future permitting” 
said Tom Irwin, CEO. 
 
Pre-Feasibility Study Overview 
 
The Project configuration evaluated in the PFS remains a conventional, owner-operated surface mine that will 
utilize large-scale mining equipment in a blast/load/haul operation.  Mill feed would be processed in a 52,600 
tons per day comminution circuit consisting of primary and secondary crushing, wet grinding in a single semi-
autogenous (SAG) mill and single ball mill followed by a gravity gold circuit and a conventional carbon in leach 
(CIL) circuit. 
 
Lower CAPEX was achieved by a reduction in tonnage from 100,000 to 52,600 tons per day, elimination of two 
previously planned fresh water supply reservoirs due to the inclusion of a fresh water supply from a local aquifer, 
elimination of a permanent accommodations camp as a result of the planned daily transport of workers to the 
mine  site  during  operations,  changes  in  project  execution  strategy  for  the  placement  of  large  development 
earthworks using mine pre-production material by owner instead of contractor and design changes to focus on 
bulk fills instead of cut/fills during construction. 
 
Lower OPEX was achieved through mining, process, and G&A optimization as described below. 
 
Mine design changes that lowered costs include a more direct haul route to the primary crusher and steeper pit 
slopes in the early phases.  Changes that increased costs were higher drill and blast costs for enhanced blast 
fragmentation to optimize mill throughput.

Mill configuration changes that contributed to overall reduction in CAPEX and OPEX include the addition of 
secondary crushing ahead of the SAG mill for more efficient use of power, inclusion of a single line SAG/ball 
mill configuration, and simplification of the mill foundation and pebble re-grind circuit.  Metallurgical studies 
completed since 2013 support process OPEX reduction through a combination of increasing grind size from p80 
90 micron to p80 180 micron, reducing leach circuit retention time from 32 to 24 hours, and reducing reagent 
consumption per ton.  Lower power and reagent costs, based on updated data, also contributed to a reduction in 
OPEX. 
 
Total G&A costs went down due to reduced corporate overhead estimates based on current data, but went up on 
a unit basis due to lower throughput. 
 
Next Steps and Opportunities 
 
Results to date indicate that further  work is warranted  in order to continue to optimize  the Project,  such  as 
improved resource modeling that could potentially enhance head grades and improvement to the mine plan to 
reduce CAPEX and OPEX. 
 
The metallurgical tests completed to date indicate that there are further opportunities to improve overall gold 
recovery.  Subject to available financing, work will continue to optimize flowsheet and reagent consumption to 
maximize recovery, confirm the grind/recovery relationships, refine the process OPEX, and thereby further de-
risk the Project. 
 
The Company will also continue to advance environmental baseline work in support of future permitting in order 
to better position the Project for a construction decision when warranted by market conditions. 
 
Pre-Feasibility Study Summary 
 
The PFS was prepared by independent third party consultants and provides information on the optimized Project 
with lower throughput, updated resource estimate, and capital and operating cost estimates as compared to the 
project evaluated in the FS.  The final version of the NI 43-101 technical report containing the PFS will be filed 
on SEDAR within the next 45 days and investors are urged to review this report in its entirety.  As a result of the 
changes to the Project as evaluated in the PFS, including differences in the economic parameters applied to the 
geologic block model that resulted in a change in resources (gold price, recovery, CAPEX, and OPEX), the 
original project as evaluated in the FS is no longer considered current and the FS should therefore no longer be 
relied upon by investors. 
 
The Company cautions that the PFS is preliminary in nature, and is based on technical and economic assumptions 
which would be further refined and evaluated in a full feasibility study.  The PFS is based on an updated Project 
resource estimate effective as of August 26, 2016 using the same resource model as used in the FS.   
 
The following is a summary of the material aspects and assumptions of the PFS.  Investors are urged to review 
the complete NI 43-101 report following its filing on SEDAR for all details of the PFS. 
 
The engineering design to estimate capital costs used in the PFS are within a -20%/+25% accuracy. 
 
Project Location  
 
The Project is connected by an existing paved highway to the city of Fairbanks, 70 miles to the southwest in 
central Alaska.  The Project is located in an active mining district that has been mined for gold since 1914.  The 
State of Alaska land use plan designates mining as the primary surface land use for the area in which the Project 
is located.

Infrastructure 
 
The  Project  would  include  a  lined  tailings  management  facility,  an  administration  office/shop/warehouse 
complex, and would also include construction of a 50-mile 230kV electrical transmission line to the mine site 
from the existing grid power near Fairbanks, Alaska.  The total power demand is estimated to be 55MW. 
 
Environmental and Community Relations 
 
Eight continuous years of baseline environmental work continues to indicate that all aspects of the Project can 
be successfully and safely managed.  The design of the tailings facility incorporates best practices including a 
lined  rock  fill  structure  with  a  lined  tailings  basin.    The  Project  development  team  has  had  considerable 
experience working with Alaska’s large mine permitting process and has a proven and respected track record 
of developing mining projects safely and in an environmentally sound manner.  The Project has already and 
will continue to provide local economic opportunities with local access to a highly skilled and available work 
force. The Company is also working within Fairbanks and the nearby community of Minto to seek early input on 
the Project and to explore ways to maximize economic benefits to the local communities.

Project Mineral Resources  
 
The current resource estimate for the Project (effective as of August 26, 2016) is based on the statistical analysis 
of data from 783 drill holes totaling 717,435 feet (218,674 m) and 14 trenches totaling 1,678 feet (516 m) 
within a model area covering 3.1 square miles (7.9 sq. km). The three dimensional geology was modelled and 
the structural/stratigraphic units have been used to constrain the resource model. 
 
Multiple Indicator Kriging (MIK) was used to calculate the gold grades for the blocks (15 x 15 x 10 meters) 
in the model using the assay data composited to 10 meter lengths.  Statistical analysis indicated a significant 
relationship between the tenor of mineralization and the individual structural/stratigraphic units, consequently 
the resource interpolation for each individual geologic unit was restricted to: 1) the composite data within that 
unit, 2) contained within a 0.10 g/t gold grade shell, and 3) where data were available from a minimum of two 
octants  and  from  two  separate  drill  holes.  Spatial  statistics  indicate  that  the  mineralization  shows  very 
reasonable continuity within the range of anticipated operational cutoff grades. Bulk density for blocks within 
each of the structural stratigraphic units was assigned the mean value for density measurements of core and 
RC samples from that unit (total of 98 measurements for all the units). The resource model (15 x 15 x 10 meter 
blocks) was estimated using nine indicator thresholds, then a change-of-support correction was imposed on the 
model based on the assumption of 7.5 x 7.5 x 10 meter selectable mining units. Resource classification into 
measured, indicated, and inferred categories was based on estimation variance. 
 
To determine the quantities of materials with “reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction” by open 
pit methods, pit constraining limits were developed using the Lerchs-Grossman© economic algorithm which 
constructs lists of related blocks that could or could not be mined.  The final list defines a surface pit shell that 
has the highest possible total value, while honoring the required surface mine slope and economic parameters.  
The following table indicates the input parameters at a $1,230 per ounce gold price – the three year trailing 
average gold price at August 26, 2016.

The parameters listed in the table above define a realistic basis to estimate the Mineral Resources for the Project 
and are representative of similar mining operations throughout North America.  The Mineral Resource has 
been limited  to mineralized material that occurs within the pit shells and which could be scheduled to be 
processed based on the defined cut-off grade.  All other material within the defined pit shells was reported as 
non-mineralized material.

Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  Mineral resource 
estimates do not account for mineability, selectivity, mining loss and dilution.  These mineral resource estimates 
include  inferred  mineral  resources  that  are  normally  considered  too  speculative  geologically  to  have  economic 
considerations  applied to them that would  enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves.   There  is also no 
certainty  that  these  inferred  mineral  resources  will  be  converted  to  measured  and  indicated  categories  through 
further drilling, or into mineral reserves, once economic considerations are applied. 
 
Exploration Target 
 
Exploration work at the Project since 2006 has identified an exploration target of between 490 and 965 million 
tonnes at a gold grade between 0.36 and 0.48 g/t (between 7.5 million and 11.0 million ounces of gold), which 
lies outside of (and therefore does not include) the estimated Project resource stated above.  Identification of 
this exploration target is based upon 455 drill holes with aggregate footage outside the shell exceeding 182,000 
feet (55,470 m), which was drilled on a similar grid spacing as the drill holes defining the current estimated 
Project resource.  Investors should be aware that the potential quantity and grade of the exploration target noted 
above is conceptual in nature, that there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and that it 
is uncertain if further exploration will result in the noted exploration target ever being delineated as a mineral 
resource. 
 
Metallurgy Recovery by Rock Type  
 
The Company has completed extensive metallurgical test work on the five rock types that comprise 98% of the 
current estimated mineral resource.   Recovery rates by rock type using gravity and carbon-in-leach recovery of 
gravity tail are shown in the table below:

Derivative Liability Risk 
 
During 2011, the Company acquired certain mining claims and related rights in the vicinity of the Project (the 
“Purchased Claims”) located near Fairbanks, Alaska.  The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Claims 
was $13,500,000 in cash plus an additional contingent payment based on the five-year average daily gold price 
(“Average Gold Price”) from the date of the acquisition.  The contingent payment will equal $23,148 for every 
dollar that the Average Gold Price exceeds $720 per troy ounce.  If the Average Gold Price is less than $720, 
there will be no additional contingent payment.  As at June 30, 2016, the Company’s estimate of the amount 
of  the  contingent  payment  is  $14,700,000.    This  contingent  payment,  which  is  due  in  January  2017, 
significantly exceeds the Company’s available cash resources, and therefore the Company will be required to 
secure significant additional financing on or before January 2017 in order to be able to make this payment.  
The obligation to make the contingent payment is secured by a Deed of Trust over the rights of the Company 
in the Purchased Claims in favor of the vendors.  If the Company is unsuccessful in raising the required capital 
to make the contingent payment, the vendors of the Purchased Claims will have the right to enforce their rights 
under the Deed of Trust, including the power of sale thereunder, thereby resulting in the Company losing any 
rights to the Purchased Claims.  The vendors of the Purchased Claims may also seek to obtain a judgment 
against  the  Company  for  the  amount  of  the  contingent  payment,  including  any  portion  of  the  contingent

payment remaining following a sale of the Purchased Claims.  Any such loss or judgment could materially and 
adversely affect the ability of the Company to proceed with any development of, or mining at, the Project and 
the loss of the rights to the Purchased Claims could materially and adversely affect the results of the PFS and 
any subsequent feasibility study.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, “forward-looking 
statements”)  within  the  meaning  of  applicable  Canadian  and  US  securities  legislation.    All  statements,  other  than 
statements of historical  fact,  included herein,  including  statements  with  respect  to  the  mine plan,  economic analysis 
(including CAPEX and OPEX) and production and design details described in the Pre-Feasibility Study; the potential to 
convert mineral resources to mineral reserves; additional optimization and exploration efforts and the results thereof;

the ability of the Company to satisfy the derivative liability and the consequences of any failure to do so; the ability of the 
Company  to  potentially  include  refined  and  updated  results  in  a  subsequent  full  feasibility  study;  the  ability  of  the 
Company to advance environmental baseline work in support of future permitting; the ability of the Company to advance 
the Livengood Project either as projected or at all; the potential for the Company to make a construction decision, whether 
when warranted by market conditions or at all; the potential for market conditions to be such that they warrant the making 
of a production decision; the potential development of any mine at the Livengood Project; business and financing plans 
and business trends are forward-looking statements.  Information concerning mineral reserve/resource estimates and the 
economic analysis thereof contained in the Pre-Feasibility Study also may be deemed to be forward-looking statements 
in that it reflects a prediction of the mineralization that would be encountered, and the results of mining it, if a mineral 
deposit were developed and mined.  Although the Company believes that such statements are reasonable, it can give no 
assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.  Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words 
such as: believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, postulate, proposed, planned, potential and similar expressions, or 
are  those,  which,  by  their  nature,  refer  to  future  events.   The  Company  cautions  investors  that  any  forward-looking 
statements  by  the  Company  are  not  guarantees  of  future  results  or  performance,  and  that  actual  results  may  differ 
materially from those in forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, variations 
in the nature, quality and quantity of any mineral deposits that may be located, variations in the market price of any 
mineral products the Company may produce or plan to produce, the inability of the Company to obtain any necessary 
permits, consents or authorizations required for its activities, the inability of the Company to produce minerals from its 
properties  successfully  or  profitably,  to  continue  its  projected  growth,  to  raise  the  necessary  capital  (including,  as 
required, to satisfy the derivative liability) or to be fully able to implement its business strategies, and other risks and 
uncertainties disclosed in the Company’s Annual Information Form filed with certain securities commissions in Canada 
and the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
“SEC”), and other information released by the Company and filed with the appropriate regulatory agencies.  All of the 
Company’s  Canadian  public  disclosure  filings  may  be  accessed  via  www.sedar.com  and  its  United  States  public 
disclosure filings may be accessed via www.sec.gov, and readers are urged to review these materials, including the latest 
technical report filed with respect to the Company’s Livengood property. 
 
Cautionary Note Regarding References to Resources and Reserves 
 
National Instrument 43 101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) is a rule developed by the 
Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific 
and technical information concerning mineral projects.  Unless otherwise indicated, all resource and reserve estimates 
contained in or incorporated by reference in this news release have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the 
guidelines set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) Standards on Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014 (the “CIM Standards”) as they may be 
amended from time to time by the CIM. 
 
United States shareholders are cautioned that the requirements and terminology of NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards 
differ significantly from the requirements and terminology of the SEC set forth in the SEC’s Industry Guide 7 (“SEC 
Industry Guide 7”). Accordingly, the Company’s disclosures regarding mineralization may not be comparable to similar 
information disclosed by companies subject to SEC Industry Guide 7.  Without limiting the foregoing, while the terms 
“mineral resources”, “inferred mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and “measured mineral resources” 
are recognized and required by NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards, they are not recognized by the SEC and are not 
permitted to be used in documents filed with the SEC by companies subject to SEC Industry Guide 7.   
 
Mineral  resources  which  are  not  mineral  reserves  do  not  have  demonstrated  economic  viability,  and  investors  are 
cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a mineral resource will ever be converted into reserves.  The preliminary 
assessments on the Livengood Project are preliminary in nature and include “inferred mineral resources” that have a 
great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and are considered too speculative geologically to have economic 
considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves.  There is no certainty that 
such inferred mineral resources at the Livengood Project will ever be realized. Further, it cannot be assumed that all or 
any part of the inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher resource category. Under Canadian rules, estimates 
of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of a feasibility study or prefeasibility study, except in rare cases. 
Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or 
legally mineable.

The SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant 
“reserves”  as  in-place  tonnage  and  grade  without  reference  to  unit  amounts.    The  term  “contained  ounces”  is  not 
permitted  under  the  rules  of  SEC  Industry  Guide  7.    In addition,  the  NI  43-101  and  CIM  Standards  definition  of  a 
“reserve” differs from the definition in SEC Industry Guide 7.  In SEC Industry Guide 7, a mineral reserve is defined as 
a part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time the mineral reserve 
determination  is  made,  and  a  “final”  or  “bankable”  feasibility  study  is  required  to  report  reserves,  the  three-year 
historical price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis of designated reserves and the primary environmental analysis 
or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. 
 
This news release is not, and is not to be construed in any way as, an offer to buy or sell securities in the United States.
