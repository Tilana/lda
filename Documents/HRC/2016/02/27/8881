<p><i>Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution 63/303 of 9 July 2009, in which the 
Assembly endorsed by consensus the outcome document of the Conference on the World

to 30 June 2009, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>Council resolution S-10/1 of 24 February 2009, in which the 
Council expressed its serious concern at the negative impact of the global economic and 
financial crises on economic and social development and on the full enjoyment of all 
human rights in all countries, and recognized that developing countries, particularly least 
developed countries and small-island developing States, were in a more vulnerable situation 
when facing that impact, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reiterates </i>the fact that multiple and interrelated global economic and 
financial crises pose additional challenges to the universal realization and effective 
enjoyment of all human rights, and stresses the central importance of recognizing human 
dignity for all people when they are faced with economic circumstances beyond their 
control and that deprive them of their capacity to realize their rights fully; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reaffirms </i>the solemn commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to 
promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other 
instruments relating to human rights, and international law; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also reaffirms </i>that the enhancement of international cooperation in the field 
of human rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United Nations, 
and recalls its determination to take steps forward in the commitment of the international 
community with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an 
increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Recalls </i>that the crisis presents unique challenges to the efforts of all 
categories of developing countries and that strong and urgent actions are needed to counter 
the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable populations and to help restore strong 
growth and recover lost ground in their progress towards the internationally agreed 
development goals, including the Millennium development Goals, as recognized in the 
outcome document of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its 
Impact on Development; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Decides </i>to hold a panel discussion during the high-level segment of its 
thirteenth session, to discuss and evaluate the impact of the financial and economic crises to 
the realization of all human rights worldwide, with a view to contribute to the work of the 
Open-ended Working Group of the General Assembly to follow up on the issues contained 
in the outcome document of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis 
and its Impact on Development, and requests the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a summary of the panel to be submitted to the 
Open-ended Working Group; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to consult States Members of 
the United Nations and all other relevant stakeholders on the issue with a view to present to 
the Council, at its thirteenth session, a report on the impact of the crises to the realization of 
all human rights and on possible actions required to alleviate it; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages </i>all States Members of the United Nations and relevant 
stakeholders to engage fully in the panel discussion with a view to guarantee the 
appropriate balance and diversity of views on the issue; </p>
