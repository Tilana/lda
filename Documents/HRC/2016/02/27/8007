<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 7/13 
and 19/37. It describes the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur since her last 
report in March 2012 and provides a thematic study on sexual tourism involving children. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since her previous reports to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/19/63 and Corr.1 
and its addenda) in March 2012, the Special Rapporteur undertook visits to Guatemala from 
20 to 29 August 2012 and Honduras from 30 August to 7 September 2012. Her country 
visit to India, initially scheduled to take place from 16 to 27 April 2012, was postponed at 
the request of the Government. The reports on both visits are presented as addenda 
(A/HRC/22/54/Add.1 and 2, respectively) to this report.   
</p>
<p>3. Since her previous report to the Council, the Special Rapporteur received positive 
replies from Kyrgyzstan and Madagascar to her requests to conduct official visits. The 
Special Rapporteur is yet to receive replies to her requests for invitations from Cambodia, 
Canada, Gambia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Viet Nam and the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Conferences, seminars and engagement with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur participated in numerous conferences and seminars during 
the period under review. In January 2012, she took part in a dialogue between the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council and the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights in Addis Ababa, organized by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in cooperation with the African Commission 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the African Union Commission. In March 2012, she 
opened the General Assembly of the NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, held in Geneva. On 12 April, she participated in the International Day for Street 
Children, organized by the Consortium for Street Children and held in London. On 10 and 
11 May, she attended a conference on strengthening family and alternative care for children 
in Africa, held in Dakar and organized by Save the Children. On 29 and 30 May, she 
participated in the fifth International Policy Conference on the African Child, on the theme 
of intercountry adoption, organized by the African Child Policy Forum and held in Addis 
Ababa. In June, she attended an expert workshop aimed at elaborating guiding principles on 
international solidarity, organized by OHCHR and held in Geneva. On 6 and 7 August, she 
attended a workshop on human rights and technology at Stanford University, United States 
of America. From 9 to 11 August, she participated as a lecturer in a summer course on child 
rights organized by the University of Moncton, Canada. On 28 September, she participated 
to the day of general discussion of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on migrant 
children in Geneva. She delivered a keynote speech at the World Congress for the Rights of 
Children and Adolescents on 16 October, in San Juan, Argentina. She participated in the 
General Assembly of Plan International held in Brighton, United Kingdom, from 23 to 25 
October. She participated in the Fourth Regional Workshop on Police and Gendarmerie 
Training on Child Protection in Lom&#233;, organized by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund </p>


<p>(UNICEF), the International Bureau for Children&#8217;s Rights (IBCR) and Save the Children 
from 5 to 9 November. She participated in a conference on child protection systems 
organized by UNICEF, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), Save the Children and World Vision in New Delhi from 13 to 16 November. 
She delivered a keynote speech at the Virtual Global Taskforce Conference held in Abu

</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur sent questionnaires to all Member States of the United 
Nations, United Nations agencies, international organizations and civil society 
organizations to solicit their views on the issue of protection of children from sexual 
exploitation in travel and tourism.  
</p>
<p>7. Thirty-five States responded to the questionnaire.1 
</p>
<p>8. End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual 
Purposes (ECPAT), IBCR, World Vision, Terre des Hommes, The Code, the Women&#8217;s 
World Summit Foundation and Australia Intervida also provided valuable contributions.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank all those who responded to the 
questionnaire. Only some of the wealth of information received could be outlined in this 
report; responses received after the established deadline could not be included. 
</p>
<p>10. The present report was prepared on the basis of responses received to the 
questionnaire and information collected through various studies, including the work carried 
out by the Special Rapporteur and her predecessors. 
</p>

<p>(d) Make practical recommendations to protect children from sexual exploitation 
in travel and tourism  
</p>
<p><b> B. Commercial sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism: 
</b></p>
<p><b>analysis of the situation 
</b></p>
<p>12. The commercial sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism (child sex 
tourism, CST) is the exploitation of children for sexual purposes by people who travel 
locally or internationally to engage in sexual activities with children. CST often involves 
the use of travel agencies, transport, accommodation and other tourism-related services that 
facilitate contact with children. 
</p>
<p>13. CST is considered a worldwide, growing phenomenon, which seriously harms 
countless children around the world, often with irreparable consequences, although its 
illegal nature, it being considered a persisting taboo and a lack of understanding of the issue 
amongst key stakeholders make it difficult to obtain accurate figures. 
</p>
<p>14. First brought to the world&#8217;s attention in the early 1990s, CST has been an evolving 
and mobile issue. While it has been recorded as a persistent problem in several locations 
around the world since those days, it has also been identified as an emerging trend in 
numerous other destinations. As child protection laws, mechanisms and prevention efforts 
are strengthened by States, civil society and the tourism industry in some countries, 
neighbouring countries become obvious alternative destinations for travelling sex 
offenders. 
</p>
<p>15. Since the First World Congress against the Commercial and Sexual Exploitation of 
Children in Stockholm in 1996, where tourism was high on the agenda as a potential 
vehicle for the abuse of children worldwide, international commitments have been renewed 
through the Yokohama Global Commitment in 2001 and the Rio Declaration and Call for 
Action to Prevent and Stop Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents in 2008.  
</p>
<p>16. In spite of some recent progress worldwide in enacting measures to counter CST, 
including several projects in cooperation with civil society and the tourism and travel 
industry to raise awareness and take practical measures, the problem persists and highlights 
the challenges of an increasingly connected world with an expanding tourism industry.   
</p>
<p><b> 1. What is the current scope of child sex tourism? 
</b></p>
<p>17. Child sex tourism is a specific form of commercial sexual exploitation of children 
(CSEC), which has many overlaps with and can foster other forms of CSEC, including 
child prostitution, child trafficking,2 sale for the purpose of sexual exploitation and child 
pornography.3 
</p>
<p>18. Acknowledging the debates regarding the use of the term &#8220;child sex tourist&#8221;,  the 
term &#8220;tourism&#8221; is to include any form of travel, whether short or long term, for business or 
for leisure, including long-term residential stays.   
</p>
<p>  
 2 According to ECPAT International in its publication <i>Combating Child Sex Tourism: Questions and 
</i></p>
<p><i>Answers</i> (Bangkok, Saladaeng Printing Co. Ltd., 2008), children are trafficked internally and across 
borders to respond to the demand from travellers.  
</p>
<p> 3 Many travelling child sex offenders have produced images of abuse at their destinations, either for 
their personal records, or to be exchanged with or sold to others through the Internet. Child abuse 
material can therefore have a direct impact, attracting other child sex offenders to a particular 
destination, but also maintaining a very profitable criminal activity. </p>


<p>19. The sexual exploitation of children affects an estimated 2 million children 
worldwide each year.4 However the actual scale<b> </b>of CST is not known due to a lack of 
existing research and availability of data on the victims and perpetrators. For instance, out 
of the 35 State contributions received for this report, only four States were able to share 
some data on prosecutions. The information received was mainly on trafficking and 
violence. The lack of understanding and misperception of the issue by key actors also 
implies that CST cases are often not classified as such, which contributes to the shortage of 
information. The criminal nature of the activity and the fear of the negative repercussions 
that such disclosures may have on the tourism development also represent major challenges 
in accessing information.5 The large majority of cases are undoubtedly never reported.  </p>
<p>20. In addition, no thorough and comprehensive study on the scope and impact of child 
sex tourism has been undertaken at national levels. The sporadic information on victims 
and perpetrators obtained by the Special Rapporteur through NGOs or United Nations 
entities was outdated, concerned only some particular regions of a country or referred to 
some isolated cases. These data could not be used to illustrate the current scope of the 
phenomenon at the global level.  
</p>
<p>21. Some law enforcement agencies provide information on perpetrators. The Child 
Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) reported, for example, that between 
2008 and 2012 a total of 457 United Kingdom nationals were arrested overseas.6 At the 
beginning of 2011, CEOP received 61 notifications regarding British nationals arrested 
abroad for offences related to child sexual abuse in 2011.7 Interpol has overall noted an 
increase in travelling child sex offenders.8 </p>
<p><i>  Origin and destination countries  
</i></p>
<p>22. Although CST tends to occur more commonly in developing countries, this 
phenomenon can occur anywhere in the world and no country or tourism destination is 
exempt. Between the supply generated by low income countries and the demand from 
industrialized countries, the choice of the destination depends on languages and 
connections, but also preferences and tastes. While Western Europeans would tend to travel 
to Eastern Europe to exploit children, 18 out of 50 (36 per cent) American CST cases 
between 2003 and 2006 involved crimes committed in Mexico.9 According to ECPAT, as a 
result of the closer contact with Western European countries and the increase in tourism, 
Estonia has had to contend with the major problem of human trafficking to the West and 
the growing issue of sexual exploitation of children in tourism. Child sex tourists are 
particularly attracted to places where their activities will go unnoticed and their motives 
unsuspected, like countries or communities in crisis, and where the risk is small.10 
</p>
<p>23. Countries of origin of international child sex tourists vary depending on the regions, 
but the demand is usually recognized as coming from the industrialized countries, including 
the richer countries of Europe, North America, the Russian Federation, Japan, Australia and

<p>New Zealand.11 Australians, for instance, have been identified as the largest group of sex 
tourists prosecuted in Thailand (31 per cent of the total).12 Of the 146 cases investigated by 
Action Pour Les Enfants (APLE) in Cambodia between 2003 and April 2012, 32 were 
American, 24 French and 20 Vietnamese.13 In the coastal regions of Kenya, for example, 30 
per cent were residents and 70 per cent of the abusers were foreign: Italians (18 per cent), 
Germans (14 per cent), Swiss (12 per cent), with tourists coming from Uganda and the 
United Republic of Tanzania fifth and sixth on the list. In Costa Rica, according to 
available information, between the 1999 and 2005, the Child Exploitation Unit had arrested 
a total of 74 persons on suspicion of commercial sexual exploitation of children. Of those 
arrested, 56 were Costa Rican nationals and 18 foreign nationals.14  
</p>
<p>24. CST destinations evolve quickly and frequently, as a result of the development of 
new tourism destinations and economic, social and political developments. As soon as 
prevention and protection efforts are intensified in a particular country, sex tourists seeking 
children seem to move on to a neighbouring country. Cambodia and Viet Nam, for instance, 
seem to have suffered an influx of abusers as a result of increased efforts in Thailand to 
combat CST. Countries such as Mongolia have also witnessed a growth in the abuse of 
children by tourists.15  </p>
<p>25. Different maps and lists of origin, transit and destination countries have been 
produced &#8211; by ECPAT and the Protection Project, for example.16 It is important to note that 
these lists are not static or exhaustive. More research and information is needed for these 
maps to reflect reality more accurately &#8211; to the extent possible. Sex tourism involving 
children is not confined to a few exotic destinations but rampant around the world.  </p>
<p><b> 2. Who are the offenders? 
</b></p>
<p>26. Despite the common misconception that travelling child sex offenders are mostly 
middle-aged men, they can have many different profiles. The majority is male, with less 
than 5 per cent believed to be female.17 Offenders may be married or single, wealthy or not, 
and of all ages.  
</p>
<p>27. Over the years, classifications of different profiles have been made to facilitate the 
development of appropriate interventions. A distinction was therefore made between 
&#8220;situational&#8221; and &#8220;preferential&#8221; child sex tourists. The situational sex tourist was described 
as not travelling with the intention of being a sex tourist, who is tempted by an opportunity 
to have sex with children in a country, not usually having a preference for children, abusing 
children who are pre-pubescent or not, driven by the search for new experiences and 
justifying their acts on the basis of cultural or economic grounds. The preferential sex 
tourist travels specifically with the aim of abusing children, can experience sexual attraction 
for adults, but tends to search for pubescent or adolescent children. In addition, the 
paedophile, usually considered as someone suffering from a clinical disorder, with an 
exclusive inclination for pre-pubescent children, who may not show any preference for the

(Washington, D.C., 2012) includes a map of occurrence and routes of child sex tourism: 186 countries

destination countries

<p>gender of the child and may not view sexual contact with children as harmful.18 In contrast 
to the situational offender, they are notorious reoffenders, seeking out vulnerable children.  </p>
<p>28. It has, however, been noted that individuals do not usually fit clearly into one 
category or another and there may be a real danger in trying to simplify their profiles given 
the complexity of the issue. Most importantly, one must bear in mind that the exploitation 
taking place may have different facets. CEOP, for example, has started using the following 
behavioural typologies, which were developed  on the basis of first-hand research and 
practical work with travelling child sex offenders:<b> </b>&#8220;opportunity instigation&#8221; (taking 
advantage of holiday environments to abuse children),  &#8220;self-contained abuse&#8221;  (travelling 
abroad in the company of intended child victims), &#8220;speculative exploring&#8221; (travelling 
abroad to locations where children are reported to be available for sex), &#8220;informed 
networking&#8221; (arranging in advance to abuse children at a specific location), &#8220;resident 
foreigner abuse&#8221;(abuse by foreigner resident in developing countries), &#8220;pseudo-care 
work&#8221;(professionals and volunteers abusing the children with whom they work),19 
&#8220;Internet-facilitated offending overseas&#8221; (using the Internet to abuse children in foreign 
countries).20 </p>
<p><i>  How do these offenders obtain access to children? 
</i></p>
<p>29. The abusers can gain access to children in a variety of ways: directly approaching 
the child on the streets, the beach, in schools or centres for children, through the child&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>family and relatives or through an intermediary on the beach, in hotels and guesthouses, 
karaoke clubs and brothels. A more recent phenomenon is accessing children via the 
Internet, either directly through online chat forums (&#8220;grooming&#8221;), or through 
intermediaries. These intermediaries facilitating the contact with children on the ground are 
often connected to tourism services, including transport and accommodation. Others may 
be holding a child in a situation of exploitation and make the child available to the tourist in 
exchange of payment or may themselves be offenders sharing their access or practical 
information. 
</p>
<p>30. The process will depend on the length of the stay, the type of accommodation that 
the abuser is using, the local context and the situation in which the child is at that time. 
When the abuser is a foreign resident or long-term visitor, he can engage directly in a long 
grooming process to befriend a child, thereby obtaining his or her trust before exploiting the 
child sexually. The grooming process can include the family, whereby the abuser either 
gains their trust or negotiates a mutually agreeable arrangement, whereby the parents may 
either sell or rent their child.  
</p>
<p>31. Significant progress has been made in combating CST and, in this regard, big hotel 
chains are no longer a concern in many locations compared to smaller hotels and 
guesthouses. In addition, an increasing number of tourists are renting or owning property, 
thereby having access to a private venue in which to exploit children, reducing the risk of 
being detected by hotel staff, other tourists or concerned locals.21 Case studies also show 
that paedophiles seem to operate mostly from private homes. Abusers and facilitators will 
continue to find alternative solutions when hindered in their undertakings.

</p>
<p>cent of the cases between 2006-2011 (CEOP, &#8220;CEOP launch a new way to prevent UK child sex 
offenders from abusing children overseas&#8221;, press release, 18 October 2012)..  
</p>
<p> 20 See Mentor Forensic Services established by Joe Sullivan, 2011. 
 21  ECPAT International, <i>Sexual exploitation</i>,  p. 17. </p>


<p>32. In some cases this phenomenon may be veiled in a &#8220;culturally acceptable&#8221; practice 
through, for instance, child marriage. In countries where early marriage is still a common 
practice, money can be offered to families to marry young girls, despite the marriage only 
lasting for the length of the stay.22 Visitors may also take the minor back to their country, 
where the child will be subjected to continual sexual exploitation.23 
</p>
<p>33. Illegal &#8220;adoptions&#8221; or temporary custody obtained by foreigners through bribery of 
both authorities and the child&#8217;s family has also provided child sex offenders with a locally 
</p>
<p>acceptable arrangement giving them full access to the child.   </p>
<p><b> 3. What are the root causes and risk factors?   
</b></p>
<p>34. In spite of the lack of detailed data on cases of CST, globalization, increasing social 
inequalities, vulnerability of children, the lack of a global legal framework prohibiting CST 
and ensuring extraterritoriality allow the expansion of CST. If abusers relied on travel 
agents or tour operators to arrange the logistics of their travels in the past, today they can 
plan and book discretely online. The ever-expanding availability of cheap travel has 
certainly contributed to the continuous growth of international tourism, which, despite a 
recession, still grew by 4.6 per cent in 2011.  With international tourist arrivals predicted to 
reach 1.8 billion by 2030 (982 million in 2011) and emerging economies like Africa, Asia 
and the Pacific tipped to see the strongest growth,24 the number of tourists with easy access 
to vulnerable children will certainly increase, thus expanding the risk of children being 
sexually exploited. 
</p>
<p>35. In addition to easier travel, advances in technology and means of communication 
(including social networking, video-sharing and instant messaging) have opened up new 
doors increasing the risks of children falling victim to sexual exploitation. Children can end 
up chatting online with sexual predators, which may have disastrous consequences. Recent 
reports from professionals in the field have highlighted the disturbing trend of &#8220;self-
produced&#8221; child pornography, i.e., explicit images produced by children themselves.25   
</p>
<p>36. Another contributing factor is the sheer profit made by these criminal activities. It is 
estimated that CSEC is worth 20 billion USD a year, according to ECPAT. Child abuse 
images were estimated being worth $3 billion annually in 2006. In 2009, they were 
estimated to be worth around $20 billion, showing thus a very worrying escalation.26 Case 
studies have also illustrated how some travelling child sex offenders have funded 
themselves through the sales of their photos and videos.27 
</p>
<p>37. Numerous risk factors determine the occurrence of CST and can be in relation to the 
child, the families or the local and national environment. Children who are most at risk are 
the most vulnerable ones: they may already be victims of abuse, exploited in brothels, in 
street situations, out-of-school, orphans, victims of sale and trafficking, without papers, 
from a minority group or working children. Their age may be a determining factor for 
children exploited in the sex industry: the younger they are, the easier it is to control them 
</p>
<p>  
 22 Law enforcement authorities in Hyderabad, for example, estimate that there may be 35 marriages of 
</p>
<p>this kind taking place every month (ECPAT International, <i>Combating Child Sex Tourism</i>, p. 23)  
 23 This has been noted in South Asia and the Middle East, but also observed in countries in South 
</p>
<p>America (ECPAT International, ibid., p. 23).

<p>and the cheaper it is to support their upkeep.28 While a young child is also seen as less 
likely to carry an infectious disease, there are beliefs in some cultures that one may be 
cured of one&#8217;s illness by having sexual relations with a virgin.  
</p>
<p>38. Families most at risk include those living in extreme poverty with no access to 
health care, education and the labour market, those dependent on seasonal economies or 
those from minority groups. Push factors within the family may include alcoholism and 
other addictions, unemployment, illnesses, domestic violence, single parent families, debts 
and migration from rural to city areas. Families may themselves promote the exploitation of 
the child, expecting him/her to help provide for the family, while both exploiters and 
paedophiles may easily deceive them by offering quick money and a supposedly better 
future for their children. In the worst cases, neighbours, friends and even close relatives 
consciously sell these children to be exploited.  
</p>
<p>39. Risk factors linked to the environment include the lack of understanding and respect 
for human rights (women and children in particular), dependency on international tourism 
as income source, the high number of vulnerable children and consumerism. These factors 
create a foundation for this type of abuse. More specific risk factors include the<b> </b>demand 
(including from locals), existing infrastructure providing sexual services, weakness or 
insufficiency of national legislation regarding the prohibition and prevention of and the 
protection of children from all forms of sexual exploitation (including CST). The fact that 
extraterritoriality is not established, the lack of prosecutions because of corruption and 
impunity and the low pay and lack of training of police also have a negative impact. The 
weakness or insufficient regulation and monitoring of travel and tourism, the lack of 
involvement of tourism and travel services, the fear of HIV/AIDS, weak legal frameworks, 
implicit social tolerance on the issue and the existence of criminal networks also 
considerably increase the risks of sexual exploitation of children.   </p>
<p><b> C. Responses to combat child sex tourism 
</b></p>
<p>40. Efforts have been made by Governments, international agencies, the travel and 
tourism industry, national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 
research centres to prevent and combat the issue. While few countries openly tackling the 
issue provided feedback for this report, it can be noted that most elements provided by 
States related to the fight against trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Legislative and regulatory framework   
</b></p>
<p>41. While all but two States29 have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, an 
instrument which provides legal accountability for the protection of children from all forms 
of sexual exploitation, their commitment applies to all children, not just those within their 
jurisdiction. By ratifying the Convention, States commit to undertaking national, bilateral 
and multilateral measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in prostitution and 
other unlawful sexual practices.  
</p>
<p>42. By ratifying the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
child pornography, 161 States have strengthened this commitment. Sex tourism involving 
children is directly linked to the offences covered by the Optional Protocol, since it 
involves child prostitution and child pornography and may also involve the sale of children. 
</p>
<p>  
 28  ECPAT International, <i>Sexual Exploitation</i>, p. 8. 
 29 The United States of America and Somalia have not yet ratified the Convention. </p>


<p>Sex tourism involving children is specifically mentioned in the preamble and in article 10 
of the Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p>43. Other main international legal instruments providing a legal basis to combat child 
sexual exploitation include the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime and International Labour Organization Convention 
No. 105 (1957) concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour and Convention No. 182 (1999) 
concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of 
Child Labour. 
</p>
<p>44. Relevant regional legislation in this regard includes the Council of Europe 
Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, 
the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, the African Charter on the Rights and 
Welfare of the Child, the American Convention on Human Rights, and the Inter-American 
Convention on International Traffic in Minors. The European Union has also taken a 
number of directives in order to reinforce the protection of children against sexual 
exploitation, including directive 2011/92/EU on combating the sexual abuse and sexual 
exploitation of children and child pornography. 
</p>
<p>45. Most countries that submitted a response to the questionnaire of the Special 
Rapporteur sent in the preparation of the present report have provisions in their legislation 
to protect children from commercial sexual exploitation. While in most countries there is no 
specific legislation against travelling child sex offences, most national laws contain a range 
of provisions which are relevant to address sexual exploitation of children in travel and 
tourism.30 These laws provide a list of offences relating to sexual abuse of children, child 
prostitution, child abuse images and trafficking of children for sexual purposes. These 
elements can be used to tackle the issue and provide a base for further legislative 
developments to strengthen the fight against CST.  
</p>
<p>46. Extraterritorial legislation is one of the key tools in combating CST, as it allows 
legal authorities to hold nationals and citizens accountable for crimes committed abroad 
and undertake prosecution in their country of origin. It decreases the likelihood of offenders 
escaping legal punishment while sending a clear message to all potential offenders. In 2011, 
44 countries had implemented extraterritorial legislation enabling them to prosecute their 
nationals for crimes against children committed abroad.31 The use of extraterritorial 
legislation however can be challenging, labour-intensive and expensive, often requiring the 
police, the evidence and witnesses to travel in one direction or another. For these reasons, 
few countries that have adopted extraterritorial legislation have actually used it to stop 
citizens from exploiting children abroad.  
</p>
<p>47. For extraterritoriality to be of real value, however, it also requires the abolition of 
the double-criminality requirement, ensuring thus that a person is liable for the crime of 
CST regardless of whether that offence is punishable in the country where the act has been 
committed.32  
</p>
<p>48. The clear naming of this offence within the legislation is of primary importance. 
Bearing in mind that for linguistic or cultural reasons many languages may not have a 
</p>
<p>  
 30  Most countries that submitted a response to the questionnaire of the Special Rapporteur in preparation 
</p>
<p>to this report have in their legislation provisions to protect children against commercial sexual 
exploitation. 
</p>

</i></p>
<p><i>Studies</i> (2007), p 188. </p>


<p>specific term describing CST in the local context, clear descriptions of the offences offer a 
better chance of prosecution. Offences to be included in specific legislation should not only 
cover travelling and engaging in illicit sexual acts with a child, but also travelling with the 
intent to do so and attempts or conspiracy to commit such a crime. The United States 
Protect Act, for example, amended existing legislation and thereby made it significantly 
easier for United States prosecutors to bring convictions against United States citizens 
committing sexual crimes against children abroad.33 
</p>
<p>49. The Penal Codes of Peru, Honduras and Costa Rica have, for instance, clear 
provisions for the prohibition of child sex tourism. In Australia, for example, the 
Commonwealth sex tourism offences were incorporated into the Criminal Code in April 
2010 as part of a package of reforms undertaken by the Government of Australia to 
strengthen its child sex tourism laws. Under the reforms, Australians who sexually abuse 
children overseas or benefit from or encourage child sex tourism offences can be jailed for 
up to 20 years. A new preparatory offence was also introduced, making it a crime, 
punishable by 10 years&#8217; imprisonment, for Australians to prepare for or plan to commit a 
child sex tourism offence.34 
</p>
<p>50. For their full protection, all victims of CST should be considered as victims up to the 
age of 18. The use of the age of consent to sexual activity or criminal responsibility, which 
may vary between 12 and 17, may, depending on the context, lead to criminalization of the 
victim. In some countries, the sexual exploitation of children who have reached the age of 
consent is not considered an offence and such children are therefore not identified as 
victims. On the other hand, children who have reached the age of criminal responsibility 
and who are not found to have been victims of pimps or traffickers are treated as offenders.  
</p>
<p>51. In Thailand, the Ministry of Justice has established practice guidelines for 
organizations related to the prosecution of foreign offenders who have allegedly committed 
acts of sexual harassment against children in Thailand are based on existing practices of 
each organization, and prescribe cooperation for effective law enforcement. Significant 
aspects of these guidelines are: (a) coordination with foreign Governments, in relation to 
the arrest and prosecution of foreigners, whereby a notice shall be sent to the embassy, 
consulate and the national central office of Interpol of the country in which the alleged 
offender is a national, for the purpose of exchanging information and the creation of a 
network; (b) prevention of absconding on bail, whereby the inquiry officer or the public 
prosecutor shall prepare complete and precise information for the opposition to the bail 
request, and may suggest an increase in the amount of bail; and (c) close coordination 
between the inquiry officer and the Department of Social Development and Welfare under 
the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, for the care and protection of 
child victims, and for compliance with the law governing inquiries and the taking of 
evidence from child witnesses. 
</p>
<p>52. Most countries, however, have not taken such measures and the few existing laws to 
combat child sex tourism still contain inconsistencies and some difficulties have been 
encountered in their implementation. The differences between national legislation still 
represent a considerable challenge in combating of CST, i.e., a cross-border crime.  The 
proper harmonization of national legislation with international standards will increase the 
effective protection of children from commercial sexual exploitation and the chances of 
prosecutions taking place in cases of CST. <b> </b></p>
<p>  
 33 Ibid., p. 11. 
 34  Response from Australia to the questionnaire of the Special Rapporteur. </p>


<p><b> 2. Prosecution and sanctions against sex tourists  
</b></p>
<p>53. It is a fact that only a low number of cases are reported and very few are prosecuted. </p>
<p>The prosecuted offenders are often paedophiles and images often constitute part of the 
evidence. Lessons learned from case studies show how time-consuming it is to convict 
travelling child sex offenders, how convictions depend on effective collaboration and the 
role the media can play when authorities may be reluctant to open a case.35 
</p>
<p>54. As highlighted above, voluntary reporting is an essential first step towards 
increasing the numbers of prosecutions. In Switzerland, for example, the Federal Police, in 
collaboration with ECPAT Switzerland, launched a campaign and website including online 
reporting forms accessible in different languages. Since October 2008, 26 denunciations 
have been made, which include cases of CST. Similar work was done in Germany and 
Austria, while European Union funding was secured to implement the same in other 
countries.36 Another campaign was launched by ECPAT Netherlands on the 24 October 
2012, with a first flyer distributed at passport control of Dutch airports, aimed at 
encouraging reporting by travellers. Large posters have been displayed at the airport, while 
collaborators of travel companies have received guidelines on how to follow up when 
tourists approach them with information.37 
</p>
<p>55. One legislative measure that encourages voluntary reporting is the recognition of the 
confidentiality of the identity of persons who report violence.38 It remains a challenge, 
however, that the law does not necessarily protect persons who make a report 
(A/HRC/16/56, para. 62).  
</p>
<p>56. In addition to reporting by individuals, law enforcement agencies can undertake 
targeted interventions. Europol&#8217;s Project HAVEN (Halting Europeans Abusing Victims in 
Every Nation), for example, was launched in November 2010 to detect and disrupt 
travelling child sex offenders originating from the European Union and ultimately establish 
a permanent and proactive notification system on travelling European sex offenders. In 
January 2012, the second joint action day of Project HAVEN took place in cooperation 
with national police, customs and border authorities at key airports across Europe. The 
authorities targeted persons primarily arriving from destinations known for CST, checking 
and profiling returning passengers and conducting interviews.39  
</p>
<p>57. The importance of gathering the right evidence cannot be overstated. Pictures and 
videos, victim and witness testimonies, items of clothing, medical examinations and written 
and online communications or records all need to be considered. In most cases, however, 
collecting this kind of evidence requires specific expertise, particularly when it needs to 
meet the standards required by the countries of origin. Many countries do have, however, 
law enforcement agents in their embassies who can play a determining role in this process.  </p>
<p>58. In addition, as the lack of human resources and technical expertise, possible lack of 
political will and sometimes corruption &#8211; in many destination countries &#8211; jeopardizes 
prosecution processes against travelling child sex offenders, NGOs are often critical 
partners of law enforcement officers. NGOs like APLE in Cambodia or the International

<p>Justice Mission in several countries,40 for instance, continue to provide support in reporting, 
investigating and prosecuting cases where security forces do not currently have the 
necessary capacity.  
</p>
<p>59. Bribery and release on bail are two major risk factors that can lead to offenders 
escaping any form of prosecution, thereby putting more children at risk. Bribery can happen 
at every step and every level connected to the investigation and prosecution of offenders.  
</p>
<p>60. The wide spectrum of different sentences for CST crimes reflects the different 
approaches that States have taken in dealing with offenders, ranging from long-term 
imprisonment to risk management within the community through the provision of 
treatment, control and supervision. While it has been argued that long sentences are not 
enough to put people off, large numbers of offenders having served short sentences have 
also reoffended, often in nearby countries.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Protection and support of child victims  
</b></p>
<p>61. All child victims of CST experience serious emotional, psychological and physical 
consequences, including physical injury, pain and fear, and psychological distress resulting 
in guilt, low self-esteem, depression and, in some cases, suicide and put children at risk of 
sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>62. Access to a child-sensitive complaint, reporting and counselling mechanism is 
essential to promptly detect child victims. In many countries, hotlines have been established 
to allow for easier reporting of child sexual exploitation or abuse and trafficking. Some 
countries provide a specific space to combating sex tourism. The Danish Police&#8217;s webpage 
(www.politi.dk), for example, has a section dedicated to combating sex tourism, which 
contains relevant information on sex tourism and includes an electronic form for reporting 
possible sex tourism and a link to the Danish National Police&#8217;s sex tourism hotline which is 
a 24/7 hotline. They also launched the campaign &#8220;Stop Sex Tourism&#8221; in 2008 to raise 
</p>
<p>awareness of sex tourism involving children and encourage the public to report such cases 
to the police.  
</p>
<p>63. Access to safety and medical and psychosocial support is of primary importance. 
Children need individualized support that takes into consideration their particular 
circumstances. Children have been known to run away from shelters back to brothels, as 
they had not believed the &#8220;rescue mission&#8221; to really be a rescue or were scared to testify 
against the perpetrator. Currently, as the Special Rapporteur has noted throughout her 
various country missions, victim support services are mostly provided by NGOs. Very few 
care and rehabilitation centres are run by States.   
</p>
<p>64. In some countries, where detention is still being regarded as an appropriate way of 
protecting child victims of sexual abuse, children under 18 involved in prostitution or 
pornography cases are considered delinquent and put in detention centres. In some 
countries where homosexuality is an offence, a sexually exploited boy under 18 may also 
be punished by law for homosexual relations (A/65/221, para. 57). Providing child victims 
of CST with legal support is therefore crucial. 
</p>
<p>65. Many challenges, however, exist in obtaining child victim and witness testimonies, 
including not only fear and the risk of running away, but also bribing of the child or his/her 
family by the perpetrator, emotional trauma, mental or other infirmity, or even the difficulty 
in identifying the victims due to lack or inaccuracy of birth certificates. Video testimonies 
</p>
<p>  
 40  Cambodia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Philippines, India, Kenya, Peru, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, 
</p>
<p>Rwanda, Thailand, Uganda and Zambia. </p>


<p>can overcome some of these challenges, but skilled, efficient and immediate investigation 
of the case and support to the victim/witness are key. To this purpose, the Australian 
Federal Police is developing a child witness support programme, which will include a 
dedicated liaison officer focusing on the welfare of the witness. This process will ensure 
that child witnesses are adequately supported and that there is a degree of separation 
between the investigative and prosecution processes.41 
</p>
<p>66. The consequences of CST on children are not just severe on their health and well-
being but also on their future prospects. They are often stigmatized by their communities, 
not given the support they need and often struggle to access education and job 
opportunities. Family and community mediation is therefore a critical element in the 
reintegration of child victims of CST. The follow-up of children until their full recovery 
and proper compensation is still generally very weak in all countries. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Prevention, awareness-raising and training  
</b></p>
<p>67. Throughout the world, preventive actions have been undertaken at local, national, 
regional and international level. Examples include World Vision&#8217;s Child Sex Tourism 
Prevention Project and the ECPAT Offenders Beware project.  
</p>
<p>68. The Child Sex Tourism Prevention Project, launched in 2004, included an 
awareness-raising campaign in the United States and in some of the most significant 
countries of destination for United States citizens (Cambodia, Thailand, Costa Rica, 
Mexico and Brazil). High-visibility publicity materials were strategically placed. The 
broadcaster CNN aired anti-child sex messages in 39 of the most frequented airports in the 
United States and for over 20 months in-flight videos on this topic were shown on United 
Airlines flights to Asia and Latin America. World Vision also led a number of workshops 
to combat child sex tourism in Cambodia, Thailand and Costa Rica. Other efforts 
implemented included working with Yahoo and MSN to place banners and pop-up ads on 
the Internet, making it more difficult to access websites designed to promote children for 
sex.  
</p>
<p>69. In the framework of the 2011 Offenders Beware project five European ECPAT 
groups and six southern partners joined forces and implemented a three-year project aimed 
at increasing awareness and knowledge on sexual exploitation of children in tourism and 
building up the capacity for preventive actions among tourism professionals, students, 
security forces and governmental authorities. The project included the development of a 
free e-learning course on child sex tourism, the production of a comprehensive brochure 
and consultation and expert meeting reports. ECPAT also launched the campaign &#8220;Stop Sex 
Tourism&#8221; in 2008 to raise awareness regarding sex tourism involving children and 
</p>
<p>encourage the public to report cases to the police. 
</p>
<p>70. The Child Wise Tourism programme is Child Wise&#8217;s longest running overseas 
programme operating across South-East Asia. The goal of the project is to support regional 
Governments, tourism authorities and police to take the lead in establishing policy and 
practices which prevent child sex tourism and other forms of child sexual exploitation. It 
also aims to ensure a protective environment for children in tourism destinations, which 
assists in preventing child sex tourism. Over the last 12 years, Child Wise has implemented 
the programme in Thailand, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Cambodia, Viet Nam, 
Myanmar, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei Darussalam and Indonesia. It has 
fostered action through a country-specific approach that is grounded in unified regional 
goals enabling regional level comparison, cooperation and collaboration. Stakeholders have 
</p>
<p>  
 41 Contribution of Australia. </p>


<p>come together in regional education campaigns, forums, meetings and follow-ups to work 
to ensure the sustainability of programmes to prevent child sex tourism in the region.42 In 
October 2010, ECPAT Netherlands, Plan Nederland, the travel agents TUI Netherlands, the 
Dutch Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (ANVR), Fly Brazil, the travel 
agents Travel Counsellors, Plan Brazil, RESPOSTA and the World Childhood Foundation 
Brazil embarked on a three-year project offering vocational training to girls, motivating the 
tourism sector, reminding the Dutch and Brazilian authorities of their duties, raising 
awareness amongst travellers and providing training for travel professionals. IBCR, in 
collaboration with Fundaci&#243;n Paniomor and with the support of World Vision Canada, is 
beginning a new project in Costa Rica, which will aim to improve collaboration and the 
prosecution of these kinds of crimes against children. Moreover, the project will focus on 
working directly with children, families and communities of the most affected areas in 
Costa Rica, providing information, tools and the creation of a support network for the 
victims of this exploitation. Adolescents will receive information about the mechanisms of 
self-protection and income-generating alternatives to commercial sexual exploitation.43 
</p>
<p>71. Recognizing that child participation must be an integral part of any prevention 
strategy, Movimiento Para el Autodesarrollo Internacional de la Solidaridad, an ECPAT 
affiliate group in the Dominican Republic, coordinated a series of youth mobilization and 
advocacy activities in Puerto Plata, to promote child participation in the Youth Network 
against CSEC. Activities included a street drawing and poster workshop, face-to-face 
mobilization and a municipal encounter coordinated and run by the youth network.44   
</p>
<p>72. Highlighting the role of communities in preventing and combating CST, ECPAT 
Philippines set up a community-based initiative against CST in Borocay, based on a 
comprehensive response strategy which included: efforts to prevent denial, preventive 
actions and early interventions, capacity-building of stakeholders and programme 
localization to guarantee the sustainability of the project. ECPAT Brazil, in an effort to 
prevent CSEC during the 2012 carnival in Rio De Janeiro, launched a campaign called 
&#8220;CSEC is not samba&#8221;, partnering the Bus Terminal of Rio de Janeiro, where 12,000 tourists 
were expected to arrive. The campaign logo was featured on bandanas, posters, banners and 
paper fans to encourage the public to report any suspicions by dialling 100 or contacting the 
local children&#8217;s protection unit. Alongside the campaign, ECPAT Brazil conducted a two-
day course prior to the carnival.45  
</p>
<p>73. A new initiative aimed at preventing child sex offenders from abusing children 
abroad under the cover of their employment was launched by CEOP in October 2012. The 
International Child Protection Certificate was set up to respond to the fact that teaching and 
employment in roles that provide access to children accounted for 7&#8211;19 per cent of the 
cases of British child sex offenders who abused children overseas between 2006&#8211;2011. The 
Certificate, a police check for British nationals who are travelling and working overseas, 
allows international schools and other organizations who work directly with children 
abroad to access the criminal conviction history of British citizens and those who have 
resided in the United Kingdom for any period of time.46

<p>74. With regard to awareness-raising, tour operators, travel agencies, airlines and other 
travel and tourism companies have developed information materials to inform their 
customers that CST is a problem which not only does exist in multiple tourist destinations, 
but is also illegal and has dire consequences for children. Information materials include 
travel brochures, ticket-holders, luggage tags, video clips and public service 
announcements. Recognizing the importance of having informed and skilled human 
resources to implement prevention and protection initiatives, both travel/tourism companies 
and law enforcement agencies have also developed specific training programmes on the 
issue of CST.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>75. Despite all the positive and promising actions undertaken, no comprehensive 
initiative which is sufficiently multidimensional and takes into account all risk factors has 
yet been developed that is working both at national and transnational level and most 
importantly aimed at being sustainable.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Corporate social responsibility  
</b></p>
<p>76. In addition to Governments, the private sector also has legal and moral 
responsibilities to ensure that child protection becomes fully incorporated into the tourism 
development agenda. The Global Code of Ethics for Tourism developed by the World 
Tourism Organization, although not legally binding, provides a comprehensive set of 
principles for ethical, sustainable and responsible tourism, including specific mention of 
combating the sexual exploitation of children in tourism, for Governments to adapt into a 
national regulatory framework for the tourism industry.47 Bulgaria, for example, has 
developed a code of ethics for the prevention of trafficking and sexual exploitation of 
children in tourism.48  
</p>
<p>77. With the mainstreaming of responsible and sustainable tourism and corporate social 
responsibility, companies have realized the importance of their role in protecting children 
from CST.49 Organizations such as the International Hotel and Restaurant Association or 
the International Association of Travel and Tourism Professionals have made public 
declarations condemning sexual exploitation of children in tourism and promoting action by 
NGOs and travel companies to ensure that tourists are not involved in such exploitation. 
Additional public declarations have been made by the International Air Transport 
Association, the Federation of International Youth Travel Organizations and the Group of 
National Tour Operators&#8217; Associations within the European Union.50  
</p>
<p>78. Most significant, however, in the area of CSR has been the development of the Code 
of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism, 
an industry-driven, multi-stakeholder initiative which seeks to increase protection of 
children from sexual exploitation in travel and tourism. All members of the tourism 
industry can join the Code and commit themselves to implementing six practical criteria: to 
establish an ethical policy regarding commercial sexual exploitation of children; to train the 
personnel in the country of origin and travel destinations; to introduce clauses in contracts 
with suppliers, stating a common repudiating of sexual exploitation of children; to provide 
information to travellers by means of awareness materials (catalogues, brochures, in-flight 
films, ticket-slips, home pages, etc); to provide information to local &#8220;key persons&#8221; in 
tourism destinations; and to report annually. The implementation is flexible, depending on 
the profile, scale of operation, type of company and applicable national legislation.

<p>79. The Code has become the leading tool for companies to integrate into their 
responsible tourism/corporate responsibility programmes for child protection. To date, the 
Code has a membership of over 1,000 companies in over 42 countries around the world. Its 
strength lies in it aims to institutionalize child protection within its member companies, 
making child protection sustainable. 
</p>
<p>80. NGOs have played a particularly important role in implementing The Code by 
providing training and expertise. In France, for example, ECPAT has delivered campaigns 
in partnership with professionals from the tourism sector including Air France, the 
guidebooks Petit Fut&#233;, the holiday company Club M&#233;diterran&#233;e, the F&#233;d&#233;ration francaise 
des techniciens et scientifiques du tourisme , the Syndicat national des agencies de voyages 
and the Accor hotel group (A/HRC/19/63/Add.2, para. 97). In June 2012, the Accor group, 
the police and ECPAT France also came to an agreement on signalling cases of CST more 
speedily. The agreement institutes the training of group&#8217;s professionals on sex tourism 
destination countries so that they can help prevent the abuse of children by tourists and 
better collaborate with the authorities to report abuse.51  
</p>
<p>81. It is important to note that the Code has been assessed and evaluated on a periodic 
base throughout the initiative to ensure and strengthen its impact. A 2011 independent 
evaluation by UNICEF identified the Code&#8217;s strengths, weaknesses, gaps and lessons 
learned. A key strength highlighted by the report was the positive impact on staff of the 
training provided on the Code. Challenges, on the other hand, included members&#8217; limited 
progress in implementing a clause with suppliers, providing information to key local 
persons at destinations and prioritizing reporting their activities.52  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Coordinated transnational cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>82. With a view to sharing information and providing legal support, memoranda of 
understanding and bilateral agreements have been drafted between different countries. In 
July 2012, for example, the Austrian Federal Minister of the Interior concluded a police 
cooperation agreement with Thailand, which facilitates the cooperation between the two 
countries inter alia in the fight against human trafficking, child pornography and sex 
tourism. Since 2011, a police attach&#233; to the Austrian Embassy in Bangkok has been 
assisting in the investigation and prosecution of alleged perpetrators.53  
</p>
<p>83. An international alert system has also been established in order to report and 
communicate information on individuals who have committed infractions of the law and 
are capable of reoffending in other countries. Interpol&#8217;s main tool for dealing with 
travelling sex offenders is the Green Notice, which is issued to provide warnings and 
criminal intelligence. It is an effective way to share key police intelligence on a global scale 
and prevent offenders from crossing borders. As well as working to prevent these crimes 
from taking place in the first place, Interpol also coordinates joint operations between 
multiple countries to track down offenders. Support given to these operations includes 
training, briefings, sharing of data, intelligence analysis and technical advice.54 To enhance 
international collaboration, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CEOP and Europol have also provided training for 
law enforcement units around the world. However, this training is not sustainable for or 
fully integrated into police training academies.

<p>84. In addition, Interpol assists with the identification of victims, particularly through 
the use of the International Child Sexual Exploitation Image Database. The Interpol 
Specialists Group on Crimes against Children has a full sub-group dealing with the 
identification of victims.  This brings together experts, drawn from all parts of the world, to 
share best practice and information on the many facets of the problem, such as the 
apprehension of sex offenders, their treatment and management within the community. 
</p>
<p>85. Many countries, including France, Switzerland and Australia, have police attach&#233;s 
posted to their embassies, who can play a key role not only in the collection of information 
but also in building the capacity of  local law enforcement officers.  Switzerland, for 
example, has attach&#233;s of the Federal Police in Thailand, Brazil, Italy, Kosovo, Serbia, the 
Czech Republic and the United States who help with investigations and collecting 
information. The deployment of Australian Federal Police officers as part of the 
International Liaison Network further enhances intelligence-gathering about the 
methodologies being used by foreign child sex offenders and helps explore effective ways 
to investigate child sex offences committed overseas. Officers do not have police powers in 
foreign countries, but assist in helping to guide foreign police investigations, including 
procedures for interviewing victims, crime scene examination and taking witness 
statements.55  
</p>
<p>86. As means of access have changed, the sharing of information gathered from online 
monitoring has become increasingly important. The Virtual Global Taskforce is an 
international alliance of dedicated law enforcement agencies and industry partners working 
together to make the Internet a safer place, identify, locate and help children at risk, and 
hold perpetrators appropriately to account.56 The FBI &#8220;Innocent Images&#8221; initiative is 
another example of an international task force consisting of online child sexual exploitation 
investigators from around the world, including more than 100 task force officers from 44 
different countries. In addition to member training sessions, the initiative also conducts 
annual case coordination meetings to share best practices and coordinate transnational 
investigations between members.  
</p>
<p>87. Given extreme complexity of crimes of child sex tourism, Interpol works closely 
with other agencies and NGOs in this area. Project Childhood for example brought together 
Interpol, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and World Vision to address and 
combat the issue of sexual exploitation and trafficking in the Greater Mekong region. The 
Project takes a dual approach to fighting the sources of child exploitation in the travel and 
tourism sectors, working both on prevention and protection by: providing capacity-building 
of law enforcement agencies, technical assistance responding to key legislative, training 
and cooperation gaps and needs, raising awareness, promoting tourism alternatives that do 
not exploit children and supporting victims.57 
</p>
<p>88. Great attention has been given to the problem of child sex tourism by the United 
States Department of State&#8217;s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, 
especially in its 2006 edition of the <i>Trafficking in Persons Report</i>. References to origin and 
destination countries in the report indicate that the Office is evaluating foreign 
Governments&#8217; efforts against child sex tourism as part of its reporting mechanism, thereby 
sending a string message to countries on the issue. The Office also works to combat the 
problem of child sex tourism via its grant-making initiatives. <b>

<p>89. Despite these numerous cooperation actions, many challenges remain in 
communicating and providing assistance in the prosecution of CST cases owing to 
disparities in legislations, procedures and working methods and, in some cases, a lack of 
willingness to share information and provide legal support.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> While many efforts have been made at global and national levels to set 
standards and develop policies and laws in view of preventing and combating child 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual exploitation in travel and tourism, challenges still remain due to: the lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>available data; the legal gaps persisting in many countries and legal disparities 
</b></p>
<p><b>between countries; insufficient awareness-raising and training; the weakness of child-
</b></p>
<p><b>sensitive complaint mechanism, care and protection services owing partly to scarce 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources and duly trained staff; the weak consideration of </b>children&#8217;s input<b>s and 
participation; the insufficiency of transnational cooperation facilitating the sharing of 
</b></p>
<p><b>information and technical expertise; the lack of prosecution of offenders and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>extraterritorial jurisdiction; and the lack of cooperation from some business operators. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> In order to ensure an effective protection of all the children from sexual 
exploitation in travel and tourism the Special Rapporteur recommends the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>actions. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> States should demonstrate a strong political commitment in preventing and 
combating child sex tourism, taking into account that such policies would not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>detrimental to the tourism industry, while ensuring the fulfilment of their legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> All States should ratify the relevant international legal instruments and 
efficiently implement domestic legislation to protect children against sex tourism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commercial sexual exploitation. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b>  Comprehensive legal frameworks should be established or strengthened to 
address all forms of children sexual exploitation, including in travel and tourism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>encompassing prevention, protection of victims and prosecution of offenders:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) National legislation must be harmonized with the ratified instruments 
</b></p>
<p><b>and therefore comply with international legal standards. In this process, a 
</b></p>
<p><b>standardized legislative framework should be developed to be adopted by all 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries, containing common definitions (age of the child, offences and guaranteeing 
</b></p>
<p><b>the best interest of the child); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Extraterritorial laws must prohibit all forms of child sex tourism and be 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforced with sentences reflecting the heinous nature of the crime;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Legislation should include the abolition of double criminality, the clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>naming of the specific offences and the protection of children up to the age of 18; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Effective mechanisms should be established to fight corruption and 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity. </b></p>


<p>95.<b> Ministries of Tourism or relevant State departments designated to develop 
tourism and national tourism associations should be encouraged to prioritize and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement child protection initiatives, such as: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Adopting  the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism which defines the 
</b></p>
<p><b>principles of ethical, sustainable and responsible tourism, and adapting it into a 
</b></p>
<p><b>national regulatory framework for the tourism industry, where the Government is 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible for granting licences and control of the tourism industry (transport, 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies and tour operators, hotels, guesthouses, clubs etc.);  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Make the Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>Exploitation in Travel and Tourism a legal obligation. All concerned businesses in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>travel and tourism sector should sign up to the Code and strengthen their efforts for 
</b></p>
<p><b>its implementation. The travel and tourism industry must play a key role to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>CST and reduce demand by informing and sensitizing the target groups, protecting 
</b></p>
<p><b>children in tourist destinations and reporting to the competent authorities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Create incentives for tourism companies to actively prioritize child 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection and take clear action to combat the sexual exploitation of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure regular monitoring of tourist areas by law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities.   
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> A standardized and centralized information-gathering system capable of 
disaggregating data (by gender, age) should be established and research undertaken 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the occurrence of CST, the behaviour of offenders and effectiveness of both 
</b></p>
<p><b>sentences and risk management, to facilitate the development of more evidence-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes and interventions. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> It should be ensured that child-sensitive services are available and regulated by 
quality standards (implemented by knowledgeable, well-trained staff and with 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate resources) and easily accessible to all children, by strengthening: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Child-sensitive complaints, reporting and counselling mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Child-friendly justice providing special and prompt protection and 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance to  child victims that is appropriate to prevent further hardship and 
</b></p>
<p><b>trauma; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The provision of appropriate medical and psychosocial support for 
</b></p>
<p><b>children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Compensation for damages from those legally responsible for a violation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and reparations, taking into account the long-term reintegration, psychosocial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>physical issues potentially faced by victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Regular follow-up of the child until full recovery is achieved. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> Sustainable and effective preventive measures should be established:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Awareness-raising must be ongoing and tailored to the different target 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups: children, families and communities in destination countries; travel and 
</b></p>
<p><b>tourism professionals, and travellers, including potential offenders; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Child participation aimed at empowering children to protect themselves 
</b></p>
<p><b>and others from sexual exploitation at the hands of travelling offenders should be an 
</b></p>
<p><b>integral part of any prevention initiative; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Community-based initiatives must be tailored to the specific local 
</b></p>
<p><b>reality; </b></p>


<p><b>(d) Both existing and emerging tourist destinations should be monitored and 
</b></p>
<p><b>partners from the private sector developing tourist services worked with proactively, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in order to elaborate measures to prevent the sexual exploitation of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Reporting by informing people of the issue and empowering them to act 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be encouraged; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Efforts to address the root causes and the risk factors that perpetuate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>phenomenon should be strengthened;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Prevention strategies aimed at potential or registered offenders must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>adapted to different behavioural typologies and based on reliable research. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Child Protection Certificate model, launched by CEOP, should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>reproduced throughout the world to prevent registered child sex offenders from 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessing work with children abroad. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> Sustainable and adapted training (intervention levels) and training of trainers 
for a common understanding and harmonization of practices should be established:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Students and staff from the travel and tourism industry must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequately trained and equipped with methodological guides; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b)  Law enforcement officers must be provided with the necessary technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>equipment and have the required skills, including how to deal with child sex 
</b></p>
<p><b>offenders, evidence collection, use of video testimonies. etc.; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The quality of this training should be evaluated on an on-going basis. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> Sustainable and coordinated transnational cooperation should be established, 
though:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Sustainable police and judiciary cooperation,  including  the exchange of 
</b></p>
<p><b>information, investigations, prosecution of every case where a person is suspected or 
</b></p>
<p><b>accused of having sexually exploited a child in another country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Informing travellers of the legal sanctions linked to the sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation of children abroad; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Developing and sharing reliable and standardized databases of cases at 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional and international level; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Strengthening and expanding the international alert system to inform 
</b></p>
<p><b>and communicate information about individuals having committed criminal offenses 
</b></p>
<p><b>and likely to reoffend in other countries; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e)  Establishing an international and regularly updated registration system 
</b></p>
<p><b>of people convicted of sex crimes against children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Supporting multi-stakeholder events which disseminate good practices, 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategies and practical actions for the tourism industry on child protection as part of 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible tourism; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Providing sustainable technical and financial support to developing 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries, both in existing and emerging tourist destinations in view to ensure a better 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention and protection of all the children from sexual exploitation in travel and 
</b></p>
<p><b>tourism.
