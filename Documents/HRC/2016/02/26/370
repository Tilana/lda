<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and recalling relevant 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Convention on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007 on institution-
</p>
<p>building of the Council, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 8/13 of 18 June 2008, 12/7 of 1

</p>
<p>21 December 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and 
</p>
<p>interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that leprosy is curable and that the human rights of persons with leprosy 
</p>
<p>could be better protected by treatment provided in the early stages that can prevent 
</p>
<p>disability, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that, in various parts of the world, persons affected by leprosy and 
</p>
<p>their family members continue to face barriers to their participation as equal members of 
</p>
<p>society and violations and abuses of their human rights, and conscious that greater attention 
</p>
<p>is needed to address these challenges, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that persons affected by leprosy and their family members, including 
</p>
<p>women and children, should be treated with dignity and are entitled to the enjoyment of all 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms under customary international law, relevant 
</p>
<p>conventions and national constitutions and laws, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> that persons affected by leprosy and their family members still face 
</p>
<p>multiple forms of prejudice and discrimination stemming from misinformation about and 
</p>
<p>misunderstanding of the disease throughout the world, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that specific attention is needed to address all forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the need to intensify efforts to eliminate all forms of prejudice and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members throughout the 
</p>
<p>world, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> <i>the importance</i> of implementing the principles and guidelines for the 
</p>
<p>elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, 
</p>

</p>
<p>together with the obstacles thereto, and to submit a report containing practical suggestions 
</p>
<p>for the wider dissemination and more effective implementation of the principles and 
</p>
<p>guidelines in order to eliminate discrimination and the stigma associated with leprosy and 
</p>
<p>to promote, protect and respect the human rights of those affected by leprosy and their 
</p>
