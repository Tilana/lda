<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and 
other business enterprises, as part of the mandate given by the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 17/4, conducted two pilot surveys on the uptake and implementation of the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: one of States and one of corporations. 
The results of the surveys are presented in the present report in aggregate form and do not 
identify individual States or corporations. 
</p>
<p> The objective of the pilot surveys was to build the methodological foundations for a 
tool that can be used annually to identify global uptake trends, enablers and challenges of 
implementation, while simultaneously signalling the Working Group&#8216;s expectations that all 
States and all corporations implement the Guiding Principles. The long-term objective is to 
generate reliable, evidence-based information to track systemic progress, encourage 
accountability and inform the Working Group and other stakeholders involved in 
developing guidance on business and human rights.

<p> A total of 26 States responded to the State survey. Owing to the relatively low 
response rate, no clear conclusions may be drawn. The responses received, however, 
generally indicated that Governments were still in the initial stage of implementing the 
Guiding Principles, and that the process of initiating implementation can be lengthy. 
Identifying key entry points for integrating the Guiding Principles into existing due 
diligence requirements for business is likely to mark the next stage of implementation. 
</p>
<p> A total of 117 individuals from the business sector completed the pilot corporate 
online survey. Replies spanned all industry sectors, enterprise sizes, private and State-
owned companies, and most regions. Such diversity indicates the ongoing globalization of 
the Guiding Principles. The survey results indicated that companies were considering and 
actively working to address human rights with reference to the Guiding Principles. Efforts 
were focused on developing human rights policy commitments, finding the right tools to 
identify, assess and address adverse human rights impact, communicating with stakeholders 
and updating complaints offices.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Resolution 17/4 of the Human Rights Council established the Working Group on 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises (the Working Group) and 
requested it to, inter alia: promote the effective and comprehensive implementation of the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the Guiding Principles); identify, 
exchange and promote good practices and lessons learned; and guide the work of the annual 
Forum on Business and Human Rights aimed at discussing trends and challenges in the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles.1 In implementing these mandated requests, the 
Working Group undertook two pilot surveys on the uptake and implementation of the 
Guiding Principles, one to States and one to corporations. 
</p>
<p>2. The Guiding Principles, endorsed by the Human Rights Council in June 2011, are 
the authoritative global reference point for preventing and addressing adverse impacts on 
human rights arising from business-related activity.2 They rest on the UN &#8213;Protect, Respect 
and Remedy&#8214; Framework, which identifies and clarifies that States and corporations have 
</p>
<p>differentiated but complementary duties and responsibilities for preventing and addressing 
business-related human rights impacts. The Guiding Principles do not create new 
international law obligations for either States or businesses, but provide guidance by 
elaborating on the implications of existing standards under the international human rights 
framework. The 31 principles spell out concrete action items with recommendations to 
States as well as business under three &#8213;Pillars&#8214;: the State duty to protect against business-
related human rights abuse, the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, and the 
need for increased access to effective remedy for victims of business-related human rights 
abuse. All pillars, however, are meant to work as a dynamic system; the effective 
implementation of a given pillar will be inter-related to the effective implementation of the 
other pillars. The Guiding Principles have been widely endorsed by both States and 
businesses.  
</p>
<p>3. In undertaking the pilot surveys on the Guiding Principles, the Working Group&#8216;s 
specific objectives and expected outcomes were to: build the methodological foundations 
for a tool that can be used annually to identify global uptake trends, enablers and challenges 
of implementation, as well as existing practices and innovations, in order to inform the 
annual Forum discussions; use such annual surveys as a way to disseminate information 
about the Guiding Principles globally; and to raise awareness among States and businesses 
while signaling the Working Group&#8216;s expectations in regard to implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>4. The long-term vision is to generate reliable evidence-based information to track 
systemic progress and inform the work of the Working Group and other interested 
institutions. The Working Group expects the surveys to complement and inform its other 
activities, including country visits and the development of a Working Group country visit 
template, in-depth case studies, expert workshops, and consultations. Depending on the 
availability of resources, the Working Group aims to conduct annual surveys to maximize 
the utility of comparative data gathered through longitudinal research. The initial pilot 
surveys have helped the Working Group identify what type of questions can best identify 
the general policy direction and challenges of States and businesses with regards to the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles. Lessons from these pilot surveys will thus

form and do not identify individual States or corporations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. State survey 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>5. The discussion surrounding a State&#8216;s duty to protect against human rights abuses 
within their territory and/or jurisdiction by business actors has developed substantially. 
Today, policymakers, business and civil society focus not on whether States have a duty to 
protect against abuse by business enterprises, but on the means by which States could and 
should fulfill this duty through preventive and remedial measures. The Guiding Principles 
provide a common language, based on universal principles, to translate such expectations 
into practice. They provide concrete guidance to States in the form of fourteen principles 
explicitly directed at the States (principles 1 through 10 of Pillar One, the State Duty to 
Protect, and principles 25 through 28 of Pillar Three, Access to Remedy).3 The Guiding 
Principles recognize that &#8215;one size does not fit all&#8216;: States have the discretion to design the 
</p>
<p>legislation, policies and programs that adjust to their specific needs and unique historical 
contexts. Still, as stipulated in the Guiding Principles (see Guiding Principle 3), States are 
expected to provide explicit guidance to businesses with regards to the implementation of 
the Guiding Principles; ensure that non-judicial and judicial remedy options are available to 
those communities, workers, consumers, clients and shareholders whose rights have been 
negatively impacted by business enterprises; and strive to address any potential regulatory 
or policy gaps that may hinder the fulfillment of their duty to protect against corporate 
human rights abuses.  
</p>
<p>6. In 2006 and 2007, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights sent 
questionnaires to States on behalf of the former Special Representative of the UN Secretary 
General on Business and Human Rights (SRSG). The surveys, respectively, asked States to 
identify the range of tools they used to address corporate human rights abuses and the role 
of the State in Corporate Social Responsibility policies. Response rates were too low for the 
data to be statistically representative, but the results provided the mandate with useful 
information on existing practices.4 At the time, the Guiding Principles had not been 
formulated. The purpose of the surveys was to identify practices in the area of business and 
human rights, to clarify the roles of States and corporations, and to formulate a standard. 
Now that the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights exist, the current mandate 
decided to conduct a new survey on this topic, but with a different purpose: to identify State 
trends and innovations in the implementation of the Guiding Principles and to foster a 
culture of reporting and communication by States in a manner consistent with the concepts 
and intent of the Guiding Principles. The survey was developed in cooperation with Denver 
University and the University of Minnesota.

<p>7. With the goal of increasing its understanding of the varying forms that State 
implementation of the Guiding Principles might take, the Working Group complemented 
the State pilot survey with selected interviews of government representatives and examples 
of implementation that were presented at the Forum and/or announced publicly on 
government agencies&#8216; websites. These concrete examples of implementation are presented 
</p>
<p>in this report along with the aggregate survey results. It is important to note that the list of 
examples do not constitute an exhaustive global compendium of practices or an indication 
that these actions constitute best practice. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Survey methodology and overview of responses 
</b></p>
<p>8. Of the 193 Member States of the United Nations, 24 answered the pilot survey and 
two provided relevant information in the form of a letter. One of these States made its letter 
public.5 The responding States were: Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, 
Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Greece, Guatemala, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russian 
Federation, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, and Yemen. The 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which provides the Secretariat support 
for the Working Group, distributed the questionnaire to States via the Geneva-based 
Permanent Missions and, with the help of the research team, did follow-up calls and sent 
reminder notes to encourage as many responses before and after the 2012 Forum.6 The 
questionnaire was sent to States in October 2012. The initial deadline for replies was 
November 10, 2012; this was later extended to January 30, 2013. The UN Working Group 
thanks the States who responded. 
</p>
<p>9. The questionnaire comprised four sections, the first of which asked for general 
contact information. The second section sought to identify trends in States&#8216; areas of focus, 
</p>
<p>whether related to industries, impacts or population groups. The third section was divided 
into five sub-sections and asked about a) general guidance, policies and programs in place, 
in addition to reporting requirements on companies; b) laws and regulation; c) policy 
coherence and integration in State agencies beyond those responsible on human rights; d) 
integration in the areas of trade and investment; and e) access to remedy. The fourth section 
asked States to provide any comments or recommendations to the Working Group. The 
survey comprised a variety of question types. Some questions used a Likert, or rating, scale 
(from one to seven) to measure a State&#8216;s relative focus on a particular industry, issue, or 
</p>
<p>population. An answer of &#8213;one&#8214; indicated less focus and &#8213;seven&#8214; indicated a strong focus. 
</p>
<p>Other questions simply asked States to mark &#8213;Yes&#8214; or &#8213;No,&#8214; and requested States to also 
provide qualitative information to expand upon their answer. Some inquired into the types 
of challenges States face and provided multiple choice options as well as space to expand 
upon their answers. 
</p>
<p>10. Care should be taken in interpreting the results. Similar to previous state surveys, no 
robust conclusions can be drawn due to the low response rate. This small sample size 
means that the trends and practices included in this report are not representative of all 
States. While some countries responded to the entire survey, other countries only responded

<p>to a few questions. The response rate per question, in other words, varied substantially. 
Time constraints or uncertainty with regards to the answer might explain, in some cases, the 
absence of an answer. Thus, the report states the number of States that provided a given 
response rather than providing percentages. Some States found the questionnaire to be long, 
and some questions to be too general. Other States found the survey helpful to kick-start or 
guide ongoing discussions in government on how to implement the Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Issues 
</b></p>
<p>11. The first section of the survey included a series of questions that aim to understand 
whether States have a particular focus on certain issue areas, types of impacts, industries or 
population groups. States were asked to rank focus areas. A response of a &#8213;low focus&#8214; does 
</p>
<p>not necessarily mean the absence of policies or neglect of the issue area, but that it is not a 
priority area for policymakers at this time. There are many reasons why States might have a 
certain policy focus at a given time. A State&#8216;s focus on a particular area might be the result 
</p>
<p>of the country&#8216;s economic activities, national constituents&#8216; priorities, seeking to address a 
</p>
<p>regulatory gap or responding to a new set of problems arising from new or increasing 
investments in a region or an industry. A high degree of focus can also be a response to new 
societal demands. The survey did not inquire on the rationale behind the focus, but simply 
sought to identify whether any regional or global patterns existed to inform, for example, 
transnational-level policy coordination.  
</p>
<p>12. Key issue areas vary by State and this section highlights only those that were 
frequently noted as a priority for a large number of respondents. Twenty-one States 
indicated that issues associated with gender, namely equal opportunities and discrimination 
at the workplace were key for them. Next, 16 States reported a focus on issues related to 
migrant workers, including fair wages, health, safety and mobility; 16 States also reported a 
focus on freedom of association. Fifteen states reported a focus on the following issue 
areas: child labor, environmental pollution or degradation, especially in cases that impact 
workers or specific communities, and a general focus on challenges associated with 
violence, armed conflict, piracy, or criminal activity. Thirteen States reported a focus on 
business activities that reduce access to water or raise food prices while 11 states noted a 
focus on competition for land use and/or land acquisition, displacement or resettlement of 
populations. Eleven states also stated a focus on the perceived or actual lack of stakeholder 
engagement dialogue and/or consultation by civil society.  
</p>
<p>13. Twelve States indicated a focus on the following industries: oil and gas; consumer 
products and retail; and food and beverage. Eleven States indicated a focus on 
manufacturing; infrastructure and utilities; and transportation. Finally, ten States indicated a 
focus on mining; financial services; and IT and communications. Two States listed Private 
Security Providers when asked to list other industries of interest. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Implementation 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) General guidance and reporting 
</i></p>
<p>14. The Guiding Principles say that States should clearly set out the expectation that 
businesses domiciled in their territory or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their 
operations. This not only helps States fulfil their duty to protect and promote the rule of 
law, but also provides predictability to business, and to business-society relations with 
regards to addressing human rights impacts. Such guidance can come in many different 
forms, including regulation, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies, specific issue-
area guidance, industry programs, or performance standards by institutions that support </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>overseas investments. The first three questions of the &#8213;Implementation&#8214; portion of the 
</p>
<p>survey aimed at identifying the extent to which States were explicitly communicating such 
expectations to businesses&#8212;including referencing the Guiding Principles&#8212;in government 
directives, resolutions, policies, or legislation, via business-government and multi-
stakeholder dialogues, and/or through other government outreach mechanisms. The survey 
also sought to understand the degree to which addressing human rights impacts constituted 
a baseline or minimal expectation of companies that was incorporated into Corporate Social 
Responsibility instruments.  
</p>
<p>15. Seventeen States replied they had CSR policies; two had none. Of those, ten 
reported in this section or elsewhere in the survey that they used ISO 26000, the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises or the UN Global Compact Principles as 
references on human rights. States mentioned the UN Global Compact Principles with the 
greatest frequency.7 Two States reported that their CSR policies explicitly mentioned the 
Guiding Principles, and one referred specifically to the UN &#8213;Protect, Respect, Remedy 
Framework.&#8214; Two States stated to have issued its CSR policy before the endorsement of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles and has not yet updated its policy.  
</p>
<p>16. Why should it matter whether government CSR policies refer to the Guiding 
Principles explicitly? In part, this is relevant to the effort to achieve coherence among 
global CSR standards. For example, a company that follows the OECD Guidelines or ISO 
26000 can be expected to have a solid base for the implementation of the Guiding 
Principles. Still, explicit reference helps unambiguous messaging and promotes more 
concrete dialogues and implementation efforts. In general, integrating the Guiding 
Principles into CSR policies contributes to avoiding the compartmentalization between 
human rights experts and sustainability experts in government agencies. Further, such 
integration ensures that government CSR policies target the potentially negative impacts of 
business activities, and thus avoids the reduction of the concept of CSR to only a 
philanthropic endeavor. Finally, explicit mention of these standards helps increase national 
ownership of the implementation of the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>17. Seventeen States reported to be working with particular industry groups, such as 
agribusiness and biofuels, extractives, telecommunication, consumer and retail, and private 
security to promote respect for human rights. Some States referred to international multi-
stakeholder initiatives they supported. One State mentioned the added value of multi-
stakeholder approaches to &#8213;address difficult issues no one party could solve on their own.&#8214; 
Several States touched on different issues and initiatives related to extractive sector, such as 
the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, the Kimberly Process and the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights. Two States mentioned the International Code of 
Conduct for Private Security Providers. In agribusiness, one State mentioned their support 
for initiatives addressing business and human rights, such as the Roundtables on 
Sustainable Soy and Sustainable Biofuels, the Better Cotton Initiative, and Bonsucro.  
</p>
<p>18. In addition to industry-specific initiatives, the survey also sought to examine the 
extent to which State policies mandated or encouraged high-level corporate oversight over 
human rights due diligence and corporate board involvement in the monitoring of the 
company&#8216;s human rights performance. These actions were understood in the survey as 
</p>
<p>constituting relevant general guidance in the domain of corporate governance and linked to 
the range of accountability tools available to encourage the effective integration of the 
Guiding Principle into company&#8216;s management systems. Eleven States reported that high-

</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>level oversight was mandated and 12 States indicated that corporate board involvement in 
the monitoring of corporate human rights performance is outlined in State polices.  
</p>
<p>19. Finally, this portion of the survey inquired whether the State encouraged corporate 
reporting of respect for human rights. Such reporting can take various forms. States may, 
for example, request or require due diligence reporting of a specific set of corporations that 
have a high likelihood of being involved directly in, or contributing to, human rights 
impacts. Likewise, States may request or require corporations to include information 
regarding human rights impacts and performance in their sustainability or integrated 
reporting. Sixteen States indicated they encourage businesses to report on human rights. Of 
those; ten noted such reports were mandatory; five noted such reports were voluntary; and 
one State indicated both mandatory and voluntary reporting requirements. Because the 
question asked about human rights reporting more generally and not on the expectation of 
companies to report specifically on the implementation of the Guiding Principles, these 
replies do not indicate whether States accept general CSR and sustainability reporting by 
companies as reporting on human rights due diligence as defined in the Guiding Principles. 
Seven States replied they have follow-up protocols to assess the reports issued by 
companies while seven States noted they did not.  
</p>
<p>20. The challenge most frequently mentioned by States (eight total) with regards to 
providing general guidance on business and human rights was the public dissemination of 
laws to the general citizenry and targeted actors. Several States also indicated that certain 
types of challenges did not apply to them: ten States reported that they did not have 
capacity challenges, nine said they did not lack resources for the effective promotion of 
policies and nine said they did not encounter opposition (lack of willingness) by actors.  
</p>
<p>21. The interviews of State representatives served to elicit further qualitative 
information on how implementation occurs in practice, with the goal of gaining particular 
insight from those striving to steer the process inside a state bureaucracy. The qualitative 
surveys showed that some States have usefully harnessed existing multi-stakeholder 
institutional capacities or networks to introduce the Guiding Principles and identify 
concrete actions to be pursued. Existing actor networks or platforms for dialogue may 
already be generating trust, knowledge and action on specific issues (transparency, 
environment, security and human rights, labour rights, among others) or within specific 
sectors (oil, gas and mining, agroindustry, food and beverages, apparel, etc.) Some States 
have identified these existing structures not only as opportunities to disseminate the 
Guiding Principles but also to spark new ideas and interest for joint action in their 
implementation. These types of actors and platforms already committed to the issue may 
sometimes need &#8213;coaching&#8214; training on the specifics of the Guiding Principles and how 
</p>
<p>they relate to previous initiatives. Some misunderstand the Guiding Principles and see them 
as yet another code of conduct competing with existing frameworks&#8212;ranging from the 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to very specific issue-area implementation 
codes and processes such as the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights for 
extractive multinationals. Instead, the Guiding Principles are meant as a &#8213;single, logically 
</p>
<p>coherent template&#8214; for all States and all businesses in every part of the world, an approach 
which draws on existing international law, standards and practice, and formulates, after 
taking into account the gaps in such body of hard and soft law, a series of comprehensive 
principles.8 In addition, the Guiding Principles provide substantial clarification on the role 
of States and corporations with regards to business impacts that was not present in previous 
standards.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Respect and Remedy&#8214; Framework (A/HRC/17/31), 21 March 2011, page 5. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/32/Add.2

</p>
<p>22. An accepted aspect of modern global governance is multi-stakeholder participation 
in the making and implementation of rules. The formulation of the Guiding Principles was 
anchored on a multi-stakeholder approach while at the same time clarifying the 
differentiated roles of each actor&#8212;States, business and civil society. In section three of the 
survey, States were asked the extent to which they interacted with domestic and 
international non-governmental organizations when designing policies on business and 
human rights. Nine States said they engaged international non-governmental organizations, 
two did not; eight States reported they reached out to domestic non-governmental 
organizations, while one State noted it did not. It is important to note that not all affected 
persons choose to interact in policy formulation or seek redress of grievances via third 
parties such as non-governmental organizations, so interaction with non-governmental 
organizations does not necessarily replace dialogue with affected persons.  
</p>
<p>23. States have also started to consult with external stakeholders as they design their 
action plans for implementation of the Guiding Principles.<b> </b>Some States mentioned this was 
a direct lesson learned from the process led by the former SRSG. States recognize that 
national implementation plans will only be legitimate, comprehensive and ultimately 
effective if they are developed in an inclusive manner. This involves consulting not only 
with internal government audiences but also with relevant external stakeholders. To this 
end, many States have chosen to liaise with civil society organizations, trade unions and 
academia, in addition to corporate actors, as they formulate ways to move the business and 
human rights agenda forward. There are different approaches or steps to this type of 
consultation. Some States, for example, have held large public meetings with numerous 
actors at which States share initial ideas and elicit feedback from the audience. Other States 
have conducted more intimate meetings with several actors to the same end, prior to 
holding larger public sessions. Some States have carried out consultations directly through 
their staff, while other States with limited capacity have relied on external experts. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Policy coherence 
</i></p>
<p>24. The Guiding Principles identify at least three areas where States are expected to 
strive towards greater policy coherence across their efforts to protect human rights and their 
decisions and practices related to businesses in the economic realm. One, States need to 
ensure horizontal integration between human rights and other policy decisions involving 
business (across departments and issue areas) and vertical integration (having the necessary 
policy and legal tools to implement international human rights obligations). Two, States 
should maintain adequate domestic policy space when pursuing business-related objectives, 
including investment treaties or contracts. And three, States should incorporate the Guiding 
Principles into the policies and action plans of the multilateral institutions of which they are 
part.  
</p>
<p>25. Early lessons indicate that a basic step that can help achieve this coherence would be 
to ensure that the Guiding Principles do not exclusively reside within those State 
departments and agencies traditionally focused on international human rights standards 
(e.g., human rights sections of Foreign Affairs ministries or national human rights 
institutions). Instead, the Guiding Principles are most effective when they are 
communicated to and integrated into the daily work of those departments and agencies that 
interact directly with business and with other States on issues such as trade and investment.  
</p>
<p>26. The interdisciplinary character of the business and human rights field is both a 
challenge and potential strength. Implementation of the Guiding Principles ideally would 
require practitioners and policy-makers in the areas of&#8212;for example&#8212;production, 
economic development, infrastructure, trade and finance, to understand and incorporate 
human rights into their practices, policies, and into the regulatory frameworks that shape 
and determine how business operate. Likewise, human rights practitioners and those </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>familiar with the protection of victims and litigation ideally would also know and 
understand business operations and their regulatory environment, whether public or private, 
State or market-based.  
</p>
<p>27. The State survey showed 11 States had offered dissemination and training on the 
Guiding Principles across its departments, six had not. As expected, given the global nature 
of the creation of the Guiding Principles, the State agency most frequently noted as having 
a role or mandate relating to business and human rights was Foreign Affairs (11 States). 
The next most frequent State agencies or departments indicated were national human rights 
institutions (9), Trade and Commerce (9), and Ministries of Industry (8). States could opt 
not to choose a given agency from a list provided in the survey. Fourteen States did not 
mark the Stock Exchange authority, 12 States did not choose Vice-presidencies, Attorney 
General&#8216;s Offices and Sovereign Wealth Funds, and 11 States did not chose Export Credit 
</p>
<p>Agencies, while five did. Eight did not choose Ministries of Defense, while only four did.  
</p>
<p>28. In this section, the survey also asked whether States had specifically adopted 
policies on public procurement, had developed specific industry guidelines or were 
developing national action plans. Nine States reported they were specifically fostering 
business respect for human rights in public procurement, and nine had issued/adopted 
industry specific guidelines. Eleven reported to be developing Guiding Principles &#8213;national 
actions plans&#8214;, of which eight were not European or North American States. At the 2012 
</p>
<p>Annual Forum it was reported that approximately 19 European States were developing 
national action plans to implement the Guiding Principles. This means that, in total, at least 
30 States have reported to be developing national action plans. At the February 2013 
Working Group consultation with the UN member states that attended the regular Geneva-
based &#8213;Group of Friends of the Guiding Principles&#8214; session, the Working Group invited 
Member States to create their own implementation plans for the Guiding Principles, and 
suggested the creation of a global repository of &#8213;national action plans&#8214; and other State 
</p>
<p>implementation plans, that could enable and promote the exchange of best practices and 
lessons learned on State implementation. 
</p>
<p><i> (c)  Legislation and regulation 
</i></p>
<p>29. States can provide general guidance to corporations on business and human rights 
through the dissemination of the Guiding Principles and implementation tools as well as 
guidance through laws and other types of administrative regulation. According to the 
survey results, many States declared to have laws that explicitly obligate businesses to 
respect human rights in the areas of non-discrimination (16 States), labour (15), the 
environment (12), corporate liability (10), property and access to land (10), privacy law 
(10), consumer protection (14), anti-bribery (12), and other due diligence requirements on 
business and human rights (4). States developing National Action Plans and other initiatives 
aimed at formulating overarching policies on the implementation of the Guiding Principles 
have embarked in legislative gap analyses or mapping exercises to determine, among 
others, the extent to which existing laws are adequate to address corporate human rights 
impacts. This section of the survey also asked States whether they required companies to 
respect human rights at incorporation or when companies are listed in stock exchanges. 
Eight replied they did so.  
</p>
<p>30. Between five and eight States reported encountering challenges in the enforcement 
of business and human rights-related laws or anticipate encountering challenges in the 
future. Challenges referred to dissemination, the lack of effective sanctions in the law, 
capacity to implement the law, judicial capacity, resources, and willingness of corporate 
actors to comply. Most of the States that reported encountering such challenges were non<b>-
</b>OECD countries. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><i> (d) International trade and investment agreements 
</i></p>
<p>31. The survey aimed at identifying the degree to which the Guiding Principles are 
informing State regulatory frameworks and policies in the area of trade and investment 
activities. This is indeed a key aspect of policy coherence and integration of the Guiding 
Principles into the function of States that shape markets, corporate conduct and incentives. 
In 2012 the World Investment Report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD) noted the &#8213;more prominent role&#8214; of &#8213;sustainable development&#8214; 
</p>
<p>in investment policies. That reference to &#8213;sustainable development&#8214;&#8212;depending on how it 
is interpreted&#8212;can be a potential entry-point for States and business to address the concrete 
issue of adverse corporate human rights impacts in the context of international investment. 
This trend is reflected in the Commonwealth&#8216;s new guide, issued in 2013, for developing 
</p>
<p>country negotiators on international investment agreements. The guide explicitly refers to 
corporations&#8216; responsibility to respect human rights according to the Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights.9 In 2012, UNCTAD also issued a new Investment Policy 
Framework for Sustainable Development that begins to examine possible ways to 
incorporate aspects of the Guiding Principles into trade and investment agreements, for 
example, by adjusting the balance between the rights and obligations of States and 
investors. This issue speaks specifically to Guiding Principle nine, which urges States to 
maintain adequate domestic policy space to meet their human rights obligations in 
business-related policies (e.g. investment treaties or contracts). In order to provide practical 
guidance for States and investors in this policy area, the former SRSG developed ten 
principles for responsible State-investor contracts and a checklist for how management of 
human rights risks could be integrated into such contract negotiations.10 Both Government 
and business participants at the 2012 Forum concluded that this guide is a useful tool in the 
context of contract negotiations.  
</p>
<p>32. Ten States declared there was coordination between agencies directly involved in 
human rights and those responsible for trade and investment, which indicates an 
opportunity to continue integrating human rights into trade and investment policies. This 
does not necessarily imply that all States have integrated the Guiding Principles into such 
policies. However, 14 States said they had explicit human rights provisions (including 
provisions related to environmental issues and labour) in their international trade and 
investment agreements. Four States said such coordination was not in place. In 2006, the 
former SRSG on Business and Human Rights asked the same question in a State survey and 
found that three countries reported including such provisions for public procurement, but 
that a majority of States did not have trade and investment policies that specifically address 
human rights.11 The most recent survey illustrates an upward trend in the adoption of such 
policies. 
</p>
<p>33. The most recent survey also inquired whether States required incoming investment 
to undertake human rights impact assessments. The questions aimed at probing whether 
human rights impact assessments, on their own or part of broader environmental and social 
impact assessments, were being incorporated into investment agreements and regulatory 
frameworks. Four States answered they did, eight did not. With regards to outgoing 
investment, five States said their export and foreign promotion policies included human

<p>rights specific provisions, six States declared not to have such provisions. These trends, 
when compared with the 2006 survey, are largely unchanged.12 It is worth noting that in 
2012 the OECD reviewed its Common Approaches on Export Credit Agencies asking 
agencies to examine how &#8213;project-related human rights impacts are being addressed and/or 
might be further addressed&#8214; in relation to their adverse impacts.13 
</p>
<p><i> (e) Access to remedy 
</i></p>
<p>34. When adverse human rights impacts exist, victims must be able to seek redress. The 
Guiding Principles affirm that ensuring access to remedy forms part of the State duty to 
protect against human rights abuse and generally emphasize the need for increased access 
to appropriate grievance mechanisms, both judicial and non-judicial, all of which should be 
consistent with international human rights standards with regards to their procedures and 
outcomes. Effective State-based judicial mechanisms are at the core of ensuring access to 
remedy, and should be complemented by other State-based and non-State-based non-
judicial mechanisms. The Guiding Principles define a set of &#8213;effectiveness criteria&#8214; for the 
operation of non-judicial grievance mechanisms, which should incorporate principles of 
legitimacy, accessibility, predictability, rights-compatibility, equitability and transparency. 
The survey inquired how States were meeting their duty to ensure victims&#8216; access to both 
</p>
<p>judicial and non-judicial remedy.  
</p>
<p>35. The survey asked whether a State&#8216;s legal system allows for the prosecution of legal 
persons accused of committing or participating in human rights violations related to the 
conduct of business activities within the State&#8216;s borders. Fourteen States replied to this 
</p>
<p>question and all provided affirmative responses. Even so, commentary and further 
explanations by respondents do not provide conclusive information either on the actual 
practice or the extent to which human rights impacts are being adequately identified, 
understood and/or, if necessary, codified as a criminal offence. Some States referred to 
terrorism, money-laundering and bribery as areas in which companies can be considered 
liable.  
</p>
<p>36. When asked whether a State&#8216;s legal system allows for the prosecution of legal 
persons accused of committing or participating in human rights violations related to the 
conduct of business activities beyond the State&#8216;s borders, ten States provided affirmative 
answers. Only three States indicated that their legal system would not support 
extraterritorial jurisdiction. Limitations to the prosecution of corporate human rights abuses 
beyond national borders, as they appear in the narrative explanations provided by some 
States, depend first, on how national legislation addresses corporate human rights violations 
and second, on the separate legal personality<b> </b>of subsidiary companies with respect to the 
parent company. Respondents that offered further information referred to rules in 
international law, which determine the circumstances under which such prosecution would 
be possible (such as nationality, protective and passive personality principles, etc.).  
</p>
<p>37. Eleven States confirmed they had non-judicial grievance mechanisms to address 
business-related impacts, four States noted they did not. Three of the States that have non-
judicial grievance mechanisms are non-OECD countries. The survey asked States to 
indicate, from a list of judicial and non-judicial tools, which mechanisms the State uses to 
redress business-related human rights impacts and abuses in the country. Nine States

<p>indicated they used sanctions while six noted using compensation of some kind (whether 
financial or non-financial). Six States also reported using environmental rehabilitation 
while five confirmed they use injunctions or guarantees of non-repetition to ensure 
prevention of harm. Six States also reported public or private apologies. Only two States 
indicated they have utilized land restitution.  
</p>
<p>38. Finally, in order to understand the degree of awareness of grievance mechanisms 
managed by international public financial institutions, the survey asked States to indicate 
whether such institutions mediated or provided for remedy to people residing in their 
territory/jurisdiction who had been impacted by projects financed by such organizations. 
Five States indicated they were not aware of such grievance mechanisms; the rest of the 
respondents did not answer the question. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Examples of implementation of the Guiding Principles 
</b></p>
<p>39. The following examples of State implementation of the Guiding Principles include 
some of those that were shared by representatives of State and regional organizations at the 
2012 Annual Geneva Forum. This is not a comprehensive list of all efforts by all States to 
the implement the Guiding Principles. Further evidence is needed to understand the 
effectiveness and potential areas of improvement of these efforts. However, the examples 
below represent today&#8216;s trends in terms of innovation or reforms of early initiatives on 
</p>
<p>business and human rights. Information for this section has been retrieved from the Forum 
summary documents and video archive that is publicly available,14 and direct reference has 
been made to existing online documentation when available. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Incorporating the Guiding Principles into corporate social responsibility policies 
</b></p>
<p>40. Notions of Corporate Social Responsibility have changed over the past decades. 
States and regional organizations can help stakeholders converge around a notion of CSR 
that places the Guiding Principles at its core, and ultimately helps businesses operate on a 
level playing field. Managing adverse human rights impacts should be a base expectation, 
complemented by other standards and by expectations of positive social contributions by 
business, such as the promotion of sustainable and equitable development. 
</p>
<p>41. In October 2011, the European Commission issued a new strategy on CSR based on 
a new definition of the term: &#8213;the responsibility of enterprises for their impacts on 
</p>
<p>society.&#8214;15 This definition allowed the European Commission to capture both positive and 
negative impacts by businesses and move beyond philanthropy-centered notions of CSR. 
The Communication explicitly referred to a &#8213;core set of internationally recognized 
</p>
<p>guidelines and principles&#8214; that companies should use as authoritative guidance. These 
principles included the Guiding Principles: the European Commission &#8213;expects all

Member States to develop their own national action plans for implementation.17 
Approximately 19 EU States are in the process of elaborating or concluding their national 
action plans for implementing the Guiding Principles.18 In June 2012, European Member 
States embraced that commitment by including it in the European Union&#8216;s Framework and 
Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy.19  
</p>
<p>42. As a complement to incorporating the Guiding Principles in the EU&#8216;s CSR policies, 
the European Commission set out to develop, through a consultative process, an 
introductory guide to human rights for Small and Medium Enterprises, as well sector-
specific guidance for oil and gas companies, telecommunications companies and 
employment and recruitment agencies.20 The UN Working Group submitted comments to 
the draft guidelines encouraging the European Commission, among others, to strengthen its 
recommendations to companies on how to embed the Guiding Principles into their 
management systems.21

<p>have a bearing on [private military and security companies] and that there is no legal 
vacuum for their activities.&#8214; 22 The rationale for the initiative is the fact that a new binding 
instrument in this area would take time to be negotiated and come into effect; in the 
meantime, action and results are needed to protect people and provide clear guidance to 
business, especially in zones of weak governance or conflict. Progress can be achieved 
through complementary approaches. The Code of Conduct was launched on November 9, 
2010, and the Charter for the Oversight Mechanism of the ICoC was drafted through a 
consultative process in 2010-2012 that culminated in the successful negotiation of its final 
text in February 2013. To obtain contracts, companies would be asked by clients&#8212;both 
State and non-State&#8212;to follow the ICoC. The UN Working Group on Business and Human 
Rights made a submission calling for consistency with the Guiding Principles, in particular 
with respect to the duties of States, business due diligence mechanisms, and effectiveness 
criteria for grievance mechanisms.23 To date, more than 600 companies have signed up to 
the ICoC.  
</p>
<p>44. A key reference guide related to the initiative is the Montreux Document, directed at 
States. This document was produced in 2008, after three years of consultations 
cooperatively led by the Swiss government and the International Committee of the Red 
Cross. The new Charter of the Oversight Mechanisms references this document, which 
&#8213;reaffirms the obligation on States to ensure that private military and security companies 
</p>
<p>operating in armed conflicts comply with international humanitarian and human rights 
law,&#8214; and contains 70 recommendations, derived from good State practice.24  
</p>
<p><b> 3. State mandatory human rights due diligence and reporting 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Integrating human rights due diligence into the financial sector 
</i></p>
<p>45. The Peruvian chief financial regulator, the Superintendency for Banks, Insurance 
Companies and Pension Funds, put out for comment in early 2013 new social and human 
rights due diligence requirements for banks lending to extractive (and other) projects. The 
measure was taken to prevent and abate negative financial impacts on the local banking 
sector as well as corporate human rights abuses that conflicts related to mining projects 
were causing or contributing to. In some instances, local businessmen, such as truckers, 
local hotels and restaurateurs were losing business because social conflict pushed clients 
away. These local businesses in turn were having difficulty servicing their loans from local 
financial institutions, such as municipal banks or home loan associations. Social conflict 
was reflecting on banks&#8216; balance sheets. Local financial institutions were provisioning for 
</p>
<p>this risk and for potential loss.  
</p>
<p>46. An opportunity for risk mitigation arose with human rights diligence and a conflict-
sensitive approach to lending. The Superintendency thus proposed to put in place 
requirements that financiers ask extractive business customers to have a base line on 
conflict risk, a risk assessment&#8212;if need be conducted by a third party&#8212;and a mechanism

<p>for conflict resolution and mitigation. The Peruvian Superintendency would require of the 
board of directors of banks at least three actions: to ensure that they have policies and 
procedures in place to ask of their costumers&#8216; human rights and conflict prevention 
</p>
<p>measures; that outside and inside auditors of financial institutions ensure that the boards of 
the bank enforce the rules with regard to the requirements on costumers&#8216; human rights due 
</p>
<p>diligence and conflict prevention; and that such policies and procedures and the results 
thereof be reported to the Superintendency. The Superintendency&#8216;s inspection activities will 
</p>
<p>examine compliance and penalize non-compliance (with fines). The measure provides a 
level playing field for all large financial institutions registered in Peru.25 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Risk management 
</i></p>
<p>47. In 2012, the United States of America introduced draft reporting requirements that 
requested US businesses persons with aggregate investment in Myanmar exceeding 
US$500,000 to submit an annual report to the US State Department. A key purpose of the 
Reporting Requirements is to ensure that, as companies seek investment in Myanmar, they 
do so responsibly in a way that minimizes adverse impacts on human rights. Businesses 
must report annually, among other items, on the &#8213;due diligence policies and procedures that 
address operational impacts on human rights, worker rights, and/or the environment;&#8214; on 
</p>
<p>&#8213;policies and procedures for community and stakeholder engagement;&#8214; on &#8213;policies and 
</p>
<p>procedures related to hearing grievances from employees and local communities, including 
whether grievance processes provide access to remedies, and how employees and local 
communities [in Myanmar] are made aware of said processes;&#8214; on the security providers 
</p>
<p>they are using; and on land and real property acquisition.26   
</p>
<p>48. Another business and human rights reporting and due diligence requirement by the 
United States that is related to business and human rights is mandated in section 1502 of the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In August 2012, the 
Securities Exchange Commission issued rules to implement the legislative act on conflict 
minerals. These rules apply to a company that files reports with the Securities Exchange 
Commission for which the use of minerals defined as &#8213;conflict minerals&#8214; in section 1502&#8212;
</p>
<p>gold, tin, tantalum, or tungsten&#8212;is &#8213;necessary to the functionality or production&#8214; of a 
product manufactured by the company or contracted by the company to be manufactured.

<p>context of extractive industries, in September 2012, the Government of Norway and the 
Working group on Indigenous Peoples in the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, in cooperation 
with the Centre for Sami Studies at the University of Troms&#248;, organized a multi-
stakeholder seminar entitled &#8215;Extractive Industries and Indigenous Peoples&#8216;. Three 
</p>
<p>Norwegian ministries were involved in the organization of the event; the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of Government 
Administration, Reform and Church Affairs (which coordinates indigenous affairs), 
representing the Government&#8216;s efforts to achieve policy coherence.   
</p>
<p>50. The event sought to foster &#8213;consultation and open debate between governments, 
indigenous peoples and the extractive industries&#8214; in light of both the opportunities and 
</p>
<p>threats associated with increased mineral extraction for the indigenous peoples living in the 
Barents region. The 28 participants included government representatives of Finland, 
Norway, Sweden and Russia. In some cases national delegations involved more than one 
agency/department &#8211; for example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the agency in charge 
of licenses of mineral extraction and industry regulation. The event also involved local and 
national level authorities, which opened opportunities for greater vertical coordination on 
the issue of business and human rights. The seminar introduced relevant international 
standards and law with implications on business and human rights in the context of 
indigenous peoples, with the Guiding Principles as a focal point. Multiple speakers at the 
seminar aimed to explore how the Guiding Principles could facilitate meaningful discussion 
and a course of action for State representatives, the extractive industry, and traditional 
communities. The Guiding Principles were introduced by the Working Group (Mandate 
holder Alexandra Gu&#225;queta) and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya.

<p><b> 5. Multilateral state-based organizations and further review to identify potential gaps 
</b></p>
<p>51. In 2011, the OECD reformed its Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to 
introduce the UN &#8213;Protect, Respect, Remedy&#8214; Framework, extend the concept of human 
rights due diligence to all other areas of business ethics considered in the Guidelines and 
increase the effectiveness of National Contact Points. In 2011, the OECD also revised its 
&#8213;Recommendation of the Council on Common Approaches for Officially Supported Export 
Credits and Environmental and Social Due Diligence&#8214;.29  In 2012, the process continued 
and the so-called &#8213;Investment Committee&#8214; of the OECD set out to investigate the 
implications on environmental and social issues, including human rights, for financial 
institutions in relation to the financial products and services they provide. Results will be 
communicated in 2013.

<p><b> III. Corporate survey 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Sample 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Guiding Principles state that businesses have a responsibility to respect human 
rights, independently of whether States fulfill their own responsibilities. This responsibility 
applies to all businesses throughout their operations, regardless of their size, sector or 
context. To know and show that they respect human rights, businesses must take a number 
of steps, as specified in the Guiding Principles in &#8213;Pillar Two&#8214;, on the business 
</p>
<p>responsibility to respect human rights. The Guiding Principles have been widely endorsed 
by businesses from across regions and sectors. By undertaking this pilot survey of corporate 
actors, the Working Group sought to identify trends and challenges among companies in 
implementing the Principles in practice.  
</p>
<p>53. The Corporate Survey was developed and disseminated in cooperation with the 
Global Business Initiative on Human Rights, the International Chamber of Commerce, the 
International Organisation of Employers and the Corporations and Human Rights Project at 
the University of Denver. The organizations promoted the survey through their networks. 
Over an eight-week period, a total of 117 individuals from the business sector completed 
the survey. The online survey was disseminated via email and the networks were asked to 
send the survey link to their own members. The survey team did not target the survey to 
specific recipients, in favour of seeking responses from firms from diverse geographies, 
sizes and sectors. The sample is not random; it is highly likely that respondents were, by 
definition, familiar with or interested in the business and human rights agenda prior to 
completing the survey. Even so, the data are telling in terms of the extent to which 
businesses currently address human rights and the challenges they face. The following 
paragraphs provide a breakdown of the sample.  
</p>
<p>54. In terms of industry sector, roughly one in five companies that answered the survey 
was in the extractive sector (22 per cent); while one in ten came from the utilities, 
infrastructure and energy sector (10 per cent). Other sectors were also represented: 
information communication technology (9 per cent), transport and logistics (9 per cent), 
financial services (9 per cent), manufacturing (9 per cent), retail (5 per cent), food and 
beverage (4 per cent), agriculture (4 per cent), pharmaceutical (4 per cent), fast moving 
consumer goods (3 per cent), tourism (1 per cent) and &#8215;other&#8216; or not specified (11 per cent).  
</p>
<p>55. The sample is also geographically diverse. Companies headquartered in Europe 
comprised 53 per cent of the sample and were based in 11 different countries. North 
American companies represented 15 per cent of the sample and were based in two 
countries. Sixteen per cent of the sample had their headquarters in Latin America and the 
Caribbean and were headquartered in six countries. Asia-Pacific represented 6 per cent of 
the sample across six countries. Five per cent of the sample is headquartered in the Middle 
East, representing two countries from that region.  
</p>
<p>56. The respondents represent companies of diverse sizes. Large companies (employing 
over 100,000 people) made up 21 per cent of the sample while those employing between 
30,000 and 100,000 made up 23 per cent. Twenty-five per cent employed between 5,000 
and 30,000 individuals. Companies that employed between 1,000 and 5,000 employees 
represented 12 per cent of the sample; companies with fewer than 1,000 employees 
represented 16 per cent of the sample.  
</p>
<p>57. Over half (58 per cent) of the respondents represented privately owned enterprises 
(ranging from publicly listed to cooperative organizations). Ten per cent were state-owned 
enterprises while 32 per cent of respondents selected &#8213;other.&#8214; </p>

</b></p>

</p>
<p><b> B. Structure 
</b></p>
<p>58. The pilot survey included a variety of question types such as multiple choice, yes/no 
answers, rating of a list of options, and open ended questions. The questions were 
structured into three main sections. Section one included questions regarding the company 
and respondent. This section was designed to develop a nuanced understanding of the 
sample. Some of the data from this section were used to describe the sample in the section 
above. Further information was asked regarding how the respondent&#8216;s company is 
</p>
<p>organized in terms of their approach to responsible business (see below). Section two 
sought to understand businesses&#8216; current approaches and practices. This section asked 
participants questions across the following categories: awareness and familiarity with the 
business and human rights agenda; internal framing and orientation; policy commitment; 
capacity development; understanding impacts; integrating actions and responses; 
communicating and reporting; and finally, complaints, grievances and remedy. The third 
section of the survey sought to uncover information about operational challenges for 
business. This section asked companies to select from a range of operational challenges 
described in the survey. Respondents selected those challenges that were most relevant to 
their business practices at the time of completing the survey. This section was structured 
around the same headings as Section two, listed above.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Findings 
</b></p>
<p>59. In line with the purpose of the corporate survey, the information included here 
outlines general trends of the businesses surveyed and relevant challenges those businesses 
face today. Regarding businesses&#8216; awareness and familiarization of the Business and 
Human Rights agenda, the survey results illustrated that half of respondents (50 per cent) 
had engaged with the work of the former UN SRSG on Business and Human Rights 
between 2005 and 2011. Companies with fewer than 1,000 employees appear to have 
engaged less, though a few still reported that they did so. Likewise, not all large companies 
engaged in this process.  
</p>
<p>60. When asked if respondents envisage future or on-going engagement and support for 
business and human rights at the United Nations and in other forums, 86 per cent of 
respondents answered in the affirmative. Nearly all respondents&#8212;96 per cent&#8212;reported 
they had heard of the Guiding Principles. It should be noted, however, that these high 
percentages may be a function of the survey dissemination method (i.e. it is not perhaps 
surprising that those who completed the survey had heard of the Guiding Principles). 
Regarding challenges in this area, the most frequently selected response was that there are 
too many competing responsible business agendas and initiatives.  
</p>
<p>61. When asked to indicate the drivers behind their company&#8216;s attention to human rights 
across ten categories&#61630;including CEO leadership, NGO campaigns, customer requirements, 
competitor practice, investor questioning and employee interest&#61630;there was close to zero 
variation based on company size. The absence of any size, geographic and industry-sector 
patterns on this and all other issues is worthy of future exploration and dialogue.  
</p>
<p>62. In terms of company orientation, framing, and training, this section began by asking 
about the utility of the term &#8213;human rights.&#8214; While one in five (20 per cent) agreed or 
</p>
<p>strongly agreed that the term is difficult for their company to work with, nearly three in four 
(72 per cent) said they disagree or strongly disagree; 8 per cent were unsure. Four in five 
respondents said that their company trains employees on social issues and impacts relevant 
to their function. When asked if their company has organized internal training sessions on 
human rights tailored to the industry and company, 22 per cent strongly agreed; 45 per cent 
agreed; 23 per cent disagreed or strongly disagreed; and 10 per cent reported that they were </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>unsure. Regarding challenges in this area, the most frequently selected responses were first, 
the challenge of accessing resources and second, the time needed to conduct effective 
training, and finally, the lack of examples of good practice case studies. Another, less 
frequent, but still common, response was the lack of templates or public information to 
guide awareness and training efforts.  
</p>
<p>63. The survey also asked a series of questions surrounding responsible business 
structures and governance. When asked, for example, which department(s) takes the lead on 
addressing their company&#8216;s social responsibilities and impact, the most common answer&#8212;
by far&#8212;was &#8213;corporate responsibility/sustainability.&#8214; Though less frequent, other 
respondents indicated the following departments were tasked with these responsibilities: 
legal, compliance, audit, procurement, human resources, public affairs and 
communications. When asked if their company has a committee or group that oversees 
progress on responsible business, four in five respondents (81 per cent) answered yes and 
17 per cent answered no. Of those who answered yes, nine in ten (91 per cent) responded 
that this committee/group addresses human and labour rights. The survey also sought to 
understand the extent to which there is cross-departmental dialogue and leadership and 
whether relevant senior leaders and governance/oversight bodies pay attention to 
developments in the field of business and human rights. Thirty-one per cent said they 
strongly agreed, 44 per cent said they agreed; 13 said they disagreed or strongly disagreed; 
12 per cent were unsure.  
</p>
<p>64. In terms of a company&#8216;s policy commitment, nearly all&#8212;96 per cent&#8212;reported that 
in addition to abiding by national laws where they operate, they also engage in corporate 
philanthropy and volunteering that contributes to society. Over four in five respondents (83 
per cent) said that their company has made a public commitment to respect human rights. 
When asked if their company had signed onto voluntary initiatives addressing respect for 
human rights, 86 per cent agreed or strongly agreed. Three in four (74 per cent) of 
respondents stated that they have a statement of policy to respect human rights while over 
half (57 per cent) of respondents stated that they had a standalone statement setting out their 
policy commitment to respect human rights.   
</p>
<p>65. Respondents were also asked to which international standards to their human rights 
policy refers. The most common responses included: the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, ILO Core Conventions, the UN Global Compact and the UN Guiding Principles 
and, to a lesser extent, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Though far less 
frequent, other standards selected included the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and UN Conventions concerning specific 
groups (such as children, persons with disabilities, and migrant workers). Of those whose 
company has a human rights policy, 93 per cent report that the policy has been 
communicated within the company and 92 per cent that the policy has been made publicly 
available. If companies target particular stakeholders, it appears that they share their policy 
with suppliers and contractors and, to a lesser extent, to other business partners.  
</p>
<p>66. Regarding challenges for policy commitment, the most frequently selected responses 
were that, first, it is difficult to communicate the policy in a clear way to all relevant 
external parties and, second, it is difficult to translate a policy commitment into relevant 
operational procedures.   
</p>
<p>67. The next portion of the survey sought to identify how companies understand their 
impact. When asked to respond to the statement, &#8213;My company is aware that we can have 
</p>
<p>negative social impacts on individuals and communities but we do not actively assess 
these,&#8214; two in five (41 per cent) agreed or strongly agreed while half (51 per cent) of 
</p>
<p>respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed; 8 per cent were unsure. When asked if their 
company engages human rights experts and external stakeholders to understand their </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/32/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>human rights impact, 66 per cent strongly agreed or agreed while 23 per cent disagreed or 
strongly disagreed; 11 per cent were unsure. When asked if their company pays special 
attention to the most vulnerable individuals and groups that they can and do impact, 30 per 
cent strongly agreed, 47 per cent agreed, seven per cent disagreed and 16 per cent were 
unsure.  
</p>
<p>68. Regarding challenges in this area, the most frequently selected responses were: 1) 
&#8213;We are unsure how far into the supply chain we need to go in understanding impacts&#8214;; 2) 
</p>
<p>&#8213;It is a challenge to access credible information&#8214;; 3) &#8213;There is a lack of proven 
</p>
<p>methodologies and frameworks to help assess impacts&#8214;; and 4) &#8213;There is a lack of 
understanding as to how to engage with stakeholders where governments restrict dialogue.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>69. The next section aimed to understand companies&#8216; ability to address impact, track 
responses and communicate, more broadly, about business and human rights. When asked 
to respond to the statement, &#8213;When an actual or potential human rights impact is identified, 
</p>
<p>we allocate responsibility to the relevant business unit and/or department to resolve the 
issue and report on progress when necessary&#8214;, four in five (82 per cent) agreed or strongly 
agreed, while only 8 per cent disagreed or strongly disagreed; 10 per cent were unsure. 
When then asked whether their company tracks progress through developing &#8213;qualitative 
</p>
<p>and quantitative indicators, informed by experts and relevant stakeholders,&#8214; over half (54 
per cent) agreed or strongly agreed, one in four (27 per cent) disagreed or strongly 
disagreed; 19 per cent were unsure. Nearly seven in ten (67 per cent) of respondents stated 
that their company has an internal committee/group to track progress in addressing the 
human rights impacts of their business, especially on high-risk issues. Nearly nine in ten 
(89 per cent) of respondents said that their company has an annual sustainability or 
corporate responsibility report that mentions human rights. When asked to respond to the 
statement, &#8213;When my company is faced with human rights challenges we often speak to 
</p>
<p>human rights experts, NGOS and the individuals/groups at risk,&#8214; nearly seven in ten (68 per 
</p>
<p>cent) agreed or strongly agreed, 15 per cent disagreed or strongly disagreed; 18 per cent 
were unsure.  
</p>
<p>70. Regarding challenges in this area, the most frequently selected responses were: 1) &#8213;It 
is difficult to manage situations where our leverage over business partners is limited, and 
we find it difficult to build leverage&#8214;; 2) &#8213;It is difficult to operate in situations where human 
</p>
<p>rights are not part of local law or not applied in practice&#8214;; and 3) &#8213;There is a lack of 
</p>
<p>understanding of our responsibilities in situations where government institutions are 
lacking.&#8214;  
</p>
<p>71. Regarding complaints, grievances, and access to remedy nine in ten (91 per cent) 
respondents expressed that they had feedback mechanisms such as employee hotlines that 
allow employees to submit issues of concern to management. Nearly four in five (76 per 
cent) stated they are considering how to address grievances raised by all stakeholders. 
When asked to respond to the statement, &#8213;My company is using grievance data for 
</p>
<p>management systems review and continuous learning,&#8214; 21 per cent strongly agreed, 34 per 
cent agreed, 22 per cent disagreed and 23 per cent were unsure. When asked to respond to 
the statement, &#8213;My company provides for remediation in cases where we cause or 
</p>
<p>contribute to human rights abuses,&#8214; 22 per cent strongly agreed, 42 per cent agreed, 9 per 
cent disagreed or strongly disagreed, and 27 per cent were unsure. Nearly seven in ten 
respondents (67 per cent) said that they are reviewing their approaches to remedy against 
the effectiveness criteria set out in the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>72. Regarding challenges associated with this area, the most frequently selected 
responses were: 1) &#8213;Adapting a grievance mechanism to a cultural context&#8214;; 2) &#8213;It is 
</p>
<p>difficult to build trust in the mechanism&#8214;; 3) &#8213;How to move from a complaints hotline to an 
effective grievance mechanism&#8214;; and 4) &#8213;Incorporating mechanisms into stakeholder 
</p>
<p>management.&#8214;  </p>

<p><b> IV. Concluding observations of the pilot surveys 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The State and Corporate surveys confirm the global uptake of the Guiding 
Principles. Response rates, while higher in the Western European and Others Group, 
</b></p>
<p><b>spanned from across the world. This global participation in the development of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>business and human rights regime was clearly visible during the First UN Forum on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Business and Human Rights in December 2012. However, there is still little or no 
</b></p>
<p><b>information regarding the efforts in many countries, including strategic emerging 
</b></p>
<p><b>markets.  
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The State survey indicates that governments are still in the initial phase of the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles and the process to get started can take 
</b></p>
<p><b>several months. Such processes include information meetings with different 
</b></p>
<p><b>government agencies and multi-stakeholder consultations with the participation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>business and civil society to identify responsibilities, priorities and needs. It is possible 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the process of identifying the key entry points for the Guiding Principles into 
</b></p>
<p><b>existing due diligence requirements for businesses (for example, environmental impact 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessments and licenses, national and subnational level procurement, financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulation, corporate law, trade and investment policies, among others) could mark 
</b></p>
<p><b>the next phase. So far, some States have chosen to focus in this phase on transparency 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures in the form of reporting requirements for a specific set of companies or 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations. Understanding how reporting requirements work and how they can shape 
</b></p>
<p><b>corporate conduct to introduce both the prevention and remedy elements of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles should be a focus for further research.  
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> Some information on expected implementation steps by States was absent in the 
replies. In general, States did not provide information on their efforts to ensure policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>coherence in multilateral institutions (for example the World Bank), international 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups (for example the G20) or regional organizations (with the exception of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>OECD and the EU).  
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The survey results suggest that companies <i>are </i>considering and actively working 
to address human rights with reference to international human rights standards and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Guiding Principles. In the short time span of 18 months after the endorsement of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Guiding Principles, there appears to be a strong trend in awareness and 
</b></p>
<p><b>engagement by business with the Principles and dialogue at the international level, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the United Nations. According to survey results, there is effort being put 
</b></p>
<p><b>into human rights policy commitments; finding the right tools to identify, assess and 
</b></p>
<p><b>address adverse human rights impacts; communicating with a range of stakeholders; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and updating complaints offices. But a deepening and more nuanced notion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>business action may be necessary, as well as tools to measure the degree to which the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles are effectively being implemented so that companies know where 
</b></p>
<p><b>they stand. One of the most striking patterns of the survey results is that a when asked 
</b></p>
<p><b>general questions about the components of the <i>responsibility to respect </i>(policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment, addressing impacts, communication and reporting) a high number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies (often around 80 per cent and above) were confident that their company 
</b></p>
<p><b>had some form of practice in place. However, when respondents were asked questions 
</b></p>
<p>pertaining to how mature or embedded practices were, the number of &#8220;unsure&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>responses spiked considerably.</b>
