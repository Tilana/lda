<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 23/13, the Human Rights Council expressed concern about attacks 
against persons with albinism1 and the widespread discrimination, stigma and social 
exclusion they suffer. The Council requested the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to submit a preliminary report at its twenty-
fourth session. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report provides an overview of the most serious human rights violations 
faced by persons with albinism, primarily focusing on the ritual killings and attacks to 
which they are subjected. It also highlights the multiple forms of discrimination, stigma and 
social exclusion faced by persons with albinism which occur across the globe. 
</p>
<p>3. The report generates some preliminary conclusions to guide further work and 
address attacks and discrimination against persons with albinism. It also contains a number 
of recommendations to Member States and the international community aimed at ensuring 
the protection of the rights of persons with albinism.  
</p>
<p>4. OHCHR welcomes the adoption of resolution 23/13 by the Council, which 
constitutes the first global decision on this issue.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology  
</b></p>
<p>5. On 17 June 2013, for the purpose of preparing the present preliminary report, 
OHCHR addressed a note verbale to all Permanent Missions to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva and to all United Nations agencies, funds and programmes to solicit: (a) detailed 
data disaggregated by sex and age of persons with albinism; (b) information on attacks 
against persons with albinism and measures taken to ensure they and their family members 
are effectively protected; and (c) information on any type of discrimination against persons 
with albinism and measures taken to combat it. 
</p>
<p>6. In addition, OHCHR requested input to the report from special procedures mandate 
holders, national human rights institutions, human rights mechanisms of the African Union, 
and various non-governmental organizations, including associations of persons with 
albinism.  
</p>
<p>7. OHCHR is grateful for the 38 replies received, which have informed the present 
preliminary report.2 Written submissions were received from seven States,3 four United 
Nations entities,4 three special procedures mandate holders,5 the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, three national human rights institutions6 and 20 civil society 
organizations.7 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The term &#8220;persons with albinism&#8221; refers to person before it mentions the condition and is preferred to 
</p>
<p>the term &#8220;albino&#8221;, which is often used in a derogatory way.

<p>8. The present report contains a compilation and review of information from different 
sources, including those mentioned above, as well as information from OHCHR field 
presences. The particular focus on Africa is explained by the fact that, according to the 
information received, all the cases of ritual attacks against persons with albinism have 
occurred in African countries. The written submissions and information gathered, including 
from United Nations sources, refer mainly to this region. 
</p>
<p>9. The collection and verification of cases of ritual attacks is a challenge due to the 
secret nature of witchcraft rituals, the inability and/or fear of victims&#8217; relatives to report 
such incidents, as well as the limited capacity of associations of persons with albinism to 
monitor human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Definition 
</b></p>
<p>10. Albinism is a rare, non-contagious, genetically inherited condition present at birth. 
In almost all types of albinism,8 both parents must carry the gene for it to be passed on, 
even if they do not have albinism themselves. The condition is found in both genders, 
regardless of ethnicity and in all countries of the world.  
</p>
<p>11. Albinism results in a lack of pigmentation (melanin) in the hair, skin and eyes, 
causing vulnerability to the sun and bright light. As a result, almost all people with albinism 
are visually impaired and are prone developing skin cancer. There is no cure for the 
absence of melanin. 
</p>
<p>12. Many types of albinism exist: the most common form is known as oculocutaneous 
albinism (OCA) and affects the skin, the hair and the eyes. There are different types and 
subtypes of OCA, with varying degrees of melanin deficiency. The main ones are 
tyrosinase negative (OCA1) and tyrosinase positive (OCA2). In OCA1, there is little or no 
melanin production. In the more prevalent &#8211; particularly in African countries &#8211; OCA2 type, 
some melanin is produced, giving rise to sandy-coloured hair and light brown irises in those 
affected. 
</p>
<p>13. Another less common form is ocular albinism (OA), which only affects the eyes. A 
more rare form of albinism is known as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) and is 
accompanied by bleeding disorders and large bowel (colitis) and lung diseases.  
</p>
<p>14. The prevalence of albinism varies across the world. Reports suggest that in North 
America9 and Europe an estimated 1 in every 20,000 persons have some form of albinism.10

<p>Epidemiologic data on albinism from a public survey in African countries, published by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006, mentions that: &#8220;Epidemiologic data on 
albinism, such as prevalence, were available for South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and 
Nigeria. Prevalence as high as 1 in 1,000 were reported for selected populations in 
Zimbabwe and other specific ethnic groups in Southern Africa. An overall estimate of 
albinism prevalence ranges from 1/5,000 &#8211; 1/15,000&#8221;.11 According to WHO, the estimated 
prevalence of albinism suggests the existence of tens of thousands of people living with 
albinism in Africa. OHCHR did not receive detailed data on the prevalence of albinism 
from any country or region. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Attacks against persons with albinism 
</b></p>
<p>15. In some communities, erroneous beliefs and myths, heavily influenced by 
superstition, put the security and lives of persons with albinism at constant risk. These 
beliefs and myths are centuries old12 and are present in cultural attitudes and practices 
around the world. 
</p>
<p>16. As mentioned by six special procedures mandate holders: &#8220;They are regarded as 
ghosts and not human beings who can be wiped off the global map. They are people living 
with albinism, the target of many false and harmful myths in several countries, especially in 
the African region&#8221;.13 In some countries, persons with albinism are considered to simply 
vanish. In other countries, they are referred to as apes and a source of money. They are seen 
as sorcerers, devils or persons suffering from a curse and, in some communities, it is 
believed that contact with them will bring bad luck, sickness or death.14 
</p>
<p>17. Other frequent myths that threaten the life and physical integrity of persons with 
albinism include: that sexual intercourse with a woman or a girl with albinism can cure 
HIV/AIDS; that the sacrifice of persons with albinism can appease &#8220;the god of the 
mountain&#8221; when a volcano starts to erupt; or that pulling out the hair of a person with 
albinism brings good luck. It has been reported that miners use the bones of persons with 
albinism as amulets or bury them where they are drilling for gold,15 and that fishermen 
weave the hair of persons with albinism into their nets to improve their catches.16 Civil

derogatory terms used towards persons with albinism.

p. 369, cited in the UTSS submission. 
</p>
<p> 16 This phenomenon was reported to occur in Lake Victoria in the United Republic of Tanzania (UTSS 
submission). Similar practices were reported in the submission from the Association pour la 
promotion des Albinos au Cameroun and WHRIN.    </p>


<p>society organizations denounce the role the film industry plays in promoting and 
maintaining superstitious beliefs.17 
</p>
<p>18. This range of beliefs and superstitions leads to various forms of attacks against 
persons with albinism in many communities. These include ritual attacks, which usually 
result in death and which in some cases involve trade in organs, trafficking in persons and 
sale of children, infanticide and abandonment of children. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Ritual attacks 
</b></p>
<p>19. The present report considers as ritual attacks those which reportedly aim to use the 
body parts of persons with albinism for the purposes of witchcraft.  
</p>
<p>20. There are beliefs according to which the body parts of persons with albinism possess 
magical powers capable of bringing riches and power if used in potions produced by local 
witchdoctors. As noted in a recent report by the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Violence against Children, persons with albinism are &#8220;perceived as a curse from 
the gods and a charm made from their body parts is considered to have magical powers that 
bring wealth, success and good luck&#8221;.18  
</p>
<p>21. Some even believe that the witchcraft ritual is more powerful if the victim screams 
during the amputation, so body parts are often cut from live victims, especially children. 
The use of children is likely linked to the pursuit of innocence which, it is believed, 
enhances the potency of the witchcraft ritual. Moreover, children are more vulnerable to 
attacks as they are easy to find and capture and do not have the physical strength to fend off 
attackers.  
</p>
<p>22. To date, OHCHR has received information about more than 200 cases of ritual 
attacks against persons with albinism in 15 countries between 2000 and 2013. Owing to the 
secret nature of witchcraft-related rituals and the vulnerability and stigmatization of the 
target population, it is believed that many attacks remain undocumented and unreported.  
</p>
<p>23. The attacks are committed in particularly horrifying circumstances, severely 
traumatizing survivors and families of the victims. The following examples provide an idea 
of the nature of these attacks.  
</p>
<p>24. On 11 February 2013, a 38-year-old woman with albinism was attacked with 
machetes by her husband and four other men while she was sleeping, and had her left arm 
chopped off. Her 8-year-old daughter witnessed the attack and saw her father coming out of 
the bedroom carrying the arm of her mother. The woman survived the attack. 
</p>
<p>25. On 31 January 2013, a 7-year-old boy with albinism was attacked while he was 
asleep. The attackers slashed his forehead, right arm, left shoulder and chopped off his left 
arm above the elbow, using machetes. The child did not survive the attack. His grandfather, 
a 95-year-old man, was killed while trying to protect his grandson. The child&#8217;s father and 
grandmother were also attacked and survived with serious injuries. 
</p>
<p>26. In most of the cases documented, the attacks involved dismembering the victim&#8217;s 
limbs and resulted in death. In a few other cases, the victims were beheaded; genitals, ears, 
and bits of skin were removed; tongues were cut out and the eyes and the heart gouged out. 
Other types of attacks reported included rape for healing purposes. 
</p>
<p>  
 17 Reference is made in the submissions from UTSS and WHRIN to the portrayal of albinism in 
</p>
<p>Hollywood and Nollywood (Nigeria) movies.  
 18 Special Representative and Plan International, <i>Protecting children from harmful practices in plural 
</i></p>
<p><i>legal systems with a special emphasis on Africa</i> (New York, 2012).  </p>


<p>27. The information on the various cases collected by OHCHR came from multiple 
sources, but the level of verification varies in each case. In most cases, the information was 
received by national and international non-governmental organizations working for the 
promotion and protection of the rights of persons with albinism, gathered through field 
work and contacts with family members. Some cases could be confirmed through police 
records and court verdicts, and a few were verified by OHCHR field presences. 
</p>
<p>28. According to civil society organizations working on the issue, in countries where 
witchcraft is practised, the demand for human body parts tends to increase in the lead-up to 
and during elections, thereby generating greater risks for persons with albinism during these 
periods.19 
</p>
<p>29. As the body parts of persons with albinism are traded for high prices, it is reported 
that business people and wealthy members of society foment these ritual attacks.20 It is also 
reported that law enforcement authorities fail to properly investigate and prosecute, and 
sometimes cover up, such crimes. In one of the cases reported to OHCHR, four high- and 
middle-ranking police officers were arrested on suspicion of accepting bribes from 
witchdoctors wishing to escape prosecution.21  
</p>
<p>30. The killing of and attacks against &#8211; including mutilation of &#8211; persons with albinism 
violate the right to life, the right to security of person and the prohibition of torture and ill-
treatment22 as enshrined in various international human rights treaties.23 While attacks 
against persons with albinism are &#8220;manifestations of the worst forms of cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment and can never be justified&#8221;,24 they also could qualify as torture, both 
physical and mental, if the authorities fail to provide the necessary preventive and 
protection measures. 
</p>
<p>31. Whether any particular ritual killing or attack against persons with albinism is 
attributable to a State agent needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. In addition to 
cases of direct liability, the State violates its obligation to ensure the right to life and the 
prohibition of torture and ill-treatment by failing to take appropriate measures to prevent, 
investigate, prosecute, punish or redress25 the harm caused by the attacks on persons with

<p>albinism committed by non-State actors.26 The responsibility to protect and prevent is 
particularly relevant in cases of persons in vulnerable situations, such as persons with 
albinism, and in circumstances where the authorities are aware of the real and imminent 
danger faced by such persons and communities.  
</p>
<p>32. Measures taken by some States to address the issue of attacks and discrimination 
against persons with albinism are analysed in section D of the present chapter. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Trade in organs, trafficking in persons and sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>33. The killing of and attacks against persons with albinism with a view to using their 
body parts for ritual purposes is often related to the trade in organs and, in some cases, 
linked to trafficking in persons and the sale of children. 
</p>
<p>34. The secrecy surrounding witchcraft and the underground nature of its associated 
market make it difficult to find evidence about trafficking of persons and organs. However, 
the issue has been reported by organizations working with persons with albinism, as well as 
United Nations agencies and bodies.  
</p>
<p>35. A 2010 UNICEF anthropological study of contemporary practices in Africa 
mentioned that the body parts of persons with albinism were commercially traded.27 In 
November 2009, in its concluding observations on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressed deep concern that 
persons with albinism had been killed and their organs used or trafficked for witchcraft 
ceremonies (E/C.12/COD/CO/4, para. 19).  
</p>
<p>36. The demand for the body parts of persons with albinism appears to be sustained by 
the high prices that some are willing to pay to obtain them. A 2009 report of the 
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies noted that the market for 
body parts of persons with albinism was &#8220;generated by big-money buyers who use them as 
talismans to bring luck and above all wealth&#8221; and that, according to senior police officers in 
Dar es Salaam, &#8220;a complete set of albino body parts &#8211; including all four limbs, genitals, 
ears, tongue and nose &#8211; was fetching the equivalent of 75,000 US dollars&#8221;.28  
</p>
<p>37. There are concerns that the market is an incentive for the desecration of graves and 
subsequent robbery of body parts. To date, OHCHR has received reliable information on 19 
cases of grave robberies in two countries. The cases were reported by organizations 
working with persons with albinism, through contacts with family members. Some cases 
were confirmed by police records. 
</p>
<p>38. Associations of persons with albinism have alleged that the body parts of persons 
with albinism are traded across borders between some countries in Africa and that, in some 
cases, the trade in organs is linked to trafficking in persons. However, data are scarce on the 
subject and difficult to verify.  
</p>
<p>39. In the review of the third periodic report of Kenya submitted to it in 2012, the 
Human Rights Committee expressed concern at continuing reports of trafficking in persons

<p>for labour, sexual exploitation and body parts, particularly of persons with albinism 
(CCPR/C/KEN/CO/3, para. 17). In 2010, a court in the United Republic of Tanzania 
sentenced a national from another country for kidnapping and trafficking in persons, for 
trying to sell a man with albinism for US$ 250,000.29 The arrest of a man crossing the 
border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, carrying the head of a child with 
albinism in his suitcase, was mentioned in a UNICEF report.30 Other cases of cross-border 
trade and trafficking in persons were reported to OHCHR by multiple sources.  
</p>
<p>40. In relation to the sale of children, the Special Representative on Violence against 
Children has noted that: &#8220;In some cases, acts of violence and killings have been committed 
by members of the family, and children have been known to have been &#8216;sold&#8217; by their 
families to outsiders. The absence of adequate registration of vital statistics, such as 
information on birth and death, further enhances the likelihood of cases going unreported 
and failing to be investigated&#8221;.31 
</p>
<p>41. In its review of the United Republic of Tanzania under the Optional Protocol on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child expressed its deep concern about reports of the sale of children for ritual 
purposes, including ritual killings of children with albinism (CRC/C/OPSC/TZA/CO/1, 
paras. 20 and 21).  
</p>
<p>42. While article 3 (a) of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime, refers to trafficking in person for the purposes of 
exploitation, including removal of organs, it does not apply to cases of trade in organs.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Infanticide and abandonment of children 
</b></p>
<p>43. As mentioned by the Special Representative on Violence against Children, &#8220;children 
with albinism are at high risk of abandonment, discrimination and exclusion as a result of 
the appearance of their skin, and due to disability factors such as impaired eyesight and 
high susceptibility to skin cancer and other health risks associated with albinism&#8221;.32 
</p>
<p>44. Harmful traditional practices of infanticide of children with albinism have been 
reported in a few East African tribes.33 Written submissions received by OHCHR from civil 
society organizations in African countries refer to persistent beliefs that children with 
albinism are a potential source of misfortune and/or the proof of unfaithful wives. As a 
result, sporadic instances of infanticide still occur and the abandonment of children seems 
to be a common practice.34

 32 Ibid. 
 33 The Sukuma tribe traditionally killed their babies with albinism as soon as they were born. Over time, 
</p>
<p>the child with albinism was spared from the infanticide and allowed to grow to adulthood but would 
be buried alive with the Sukuma Chief when the latter died. In the Chagga tribe, newborns with 
albinism were traditionally left in the forests to die. In the Digo and Maasai tribes, newborn children 
with albinism were killed after a trial by ordeal. See <i>Children with Albinism in Africa: Murder, 
Mutilation and Violence</i>, report submitted to the Special Representative on Violence against Children 
by UTSS (2012).  
</p>
<p> 34 Most of the submissions from civil society refer to the abandonment of children. Submissions from 
Albinos Sans Fronti&#232;res, Bien-&#234;tre des Albinos de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Association nationale des 
Albinos du S&#233;n&#233;gal and the Association pour la promotion des Albinos au Cameroun refer to 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>45. The documentation of these cases is difficult as, like in other births considered as 
&#8220;abnormal&#8221;, the death of a child considered a curse is perceived as a beneficial act for the 
family and the community. Thus, the killing is often done in secret and the birth is often 
unreported.35 In some cases, a midwife assists in killing the child, announcing that the child 
is stillborn and burying the child immediately, without the parents seeing it.36  
</p>
<p>46. As mentioned earlier, the general absence of adequate registration of births and 
deaths of persons with albinism hinders the reporting and investigation of cases of 
infanticide. A few such cases have been reported to OHCHR by different sources. 
</p>
<p>47. Article 6 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child consecrates as an inherent 
right of the child the right to life, survival and development and article 19, paragraph 1, 
requests States parties to take all appropriate measures to protect the child from all forms of 
physical or mental violence. States parties are obliged to protect all children from 
infanticide and abandonment, and should take steps towards the abolition of practices 
which put the life of children under threat, including through the adoption of appropriate 
criminal legislation.37  
</p>
<p><b> D. Measures taken by States concerned 
</b></p>
<p>48. The State&#8217;s obligations to take the necessary measures to prevent attacks and 
discrimination against persons with albinism are particularly critical due to the vulnerable 
situation of this group. These measures include the appropriate criminalization of such acts, 
their investigation and the prosecution of perpetrators. They also include preventive 
measures to protect persons with albinism and measures to ensure the access of survivors 
and their families to effective remedies, redress and rehabilitation, including health care, 
shelters and other services.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Legal response and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>49. In its resolution 23/13, the Human Rights Council expressed concern about the 
impunity associated with attacks against persons with albinism.  
</p>
<p>50. Very little information was available as to the legal status of the cases of ritual 
attacks recounted to OHCHR. While some investigation and prosecution seems to take 
place, sentencing appears to be extremely rare: of the 72 murders of people with albinism 
documented in the United Republic of Tanzania since 2000, only five cases are known to 
have resulted in successful prosecutions.38 While noting the State party&#8217;s commitment to 
prevent, investigate and prosecute cases of mutilation and killing of persons with albinism, 
the Human Rights Committee expressed concern about the high number of reported 
incidents in the United Republic of Tanzania and the limited number of court cases and 
slow proceedings in this regard (CCPR/C/TZA/CO/4, para. 15). In relation to four reported 
cases in 2013 in the country, the Attorney General&#8217;s Chambers informed OHCHR that a 
significant number of suspects had been apprehended and charged and that a special task

<p>force was assisting law enforcement authorities in the investigation and prosecution of 
these cases.39  
</p>
<p>51. From the information gathered from OHCHR in Burundi, since 2008 11 people have 
been arrested in relation to attacks against persons with albinism, of whom six escaped and 
one was convicted. In 2010, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, two persons were 
sentenced for the murder of a person with albinism. According to available information 
from C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and Nigeria, two cases have resulted in convictions in each country. 
</p>
<p>52. The monitoring of court proceedings concerning these crimes by civil society actors 
is very rare, and associations of persons with albinism often lack the financial means and 
expertise to conduct legal monitoring activities. 
</p>
<p>53. According to information received by OHCHR, persons with albinism face 
significant difficulties in having their cases brought to justice for the following reasons: the 
fear of further attacks, reprisals or further stigmatization; difficulties in finding witnesses 
owing to the ostracism they face within their community and, frequently, the involvement 
of family and community members in the attacks; the lack of awareness of legal rights; the 
lack of financial resources; the inadequate capacity of the judicial system to address such 
cases; the lack of legal aid and adequate legal representation; and the lack of knowledge of 
or confidence in the law enforcement and justice systems. 
</p>
<p>54. As noted by the Special Representative on Violence against Children, &#8220;The human 
rights violations committed against children with albinism are of the highest severity. 
Discrimination, harassment and violence, including cases of mutilation and murder, are 
often met with passivity and are rarely reported, as they take place in remote areas and 
because such children are perceived as bringing bad luck and being a source of shame to 
even their own families and communities ... Mutilation and murders of children with 
albinism are mostly met by social silence and indifference&#8221;.40 
</p>
<p>55. The information available to OHCHR indicates that access by persons with albinism 
to justice, remedies and redress is extremely limited. The right of victims of human right 
violations to claim redress and reparation is enshrined in most universal41 and regional 
human rights instruments.42 Under this right, States not only have the duty to provide 
redress for the harm suffered but also need to guarantee equal and effective access to 
justice.43 Reparations should be proportional to the gravity of the violation and the harm 
suffered and could take the form of restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, 
and guarantees of non-repetition.44  
</p>
<p>56.  Further work is required in collecting legal data, including the analysis of criminal 
laws in the countries concerned. This should be done in close cooperation with Member 
States.

<p><b> 2. Preventive measures 
</b></p>
<p>57. OHCHR received examples of a number of preventive measures taken by those 
States in which the highest number of attacks on and killings of persons with albinism have 
been reported. These measures include the public condemnation of attacks and killings; the 
appointment of a person with albinism as Member of Parliament or Cabinet; the banning of 
witchdoctor licences; public awareness-raising campaigns and the provision of temporary 
shelter to persons under the threat of attacks. 
</p>
<p>58. While the effectiveness of these measures is to be evaluated, concerns were 
expressed in relation to poor living conditions in temporary shelters, particularly the 
sanitary conditions, overcrowding and food.45 There is also concern that these shelters 
reinforce the marginalization of persons with albinism and keep children separated from 
their families.  
</p>
<p>59. It was reported that important initiatives are under way, such as the instruction to 
register disaggregated data on persons with albinism in the United Republic of Tanzania 
and the elaboration of a national policy to promote and protect the rights of persons with 
albinism in Burundi. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Action by international and regional human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>60. Overall, the human rights situation of persons with albinism has received little 
attention from Member States, the international community and human rights advocates. 
International and regional human right mechanisms have only sporadically raised the issue. 
</p>
<p>61. Specific mention of the situation of persons with albinism has been made in a few 
concluding observations from the Human Rights Committee,46 the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,47 the Committee on the Rights of the Child48 and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.49 
</p>
<p>62. On 4 May 2013, a joint press statement was issued by six United Nations special 
procedures mandate holders, highlighting the gravity of attacks against persons with 
albinism and the profound discrimination they face.50 The then Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions included a brief reference to the killings of 
persons with albinism in his 2009 report (A/HRC/11/2, para. 49), as did the current Special 
Rapporteur in his oral statement at the twenty-third session of the Human Rights Council.51 
As part of the universal periodic review, recommendations were made to the Governments 
of Burundi,52 Uganda53 and the United Republic of Tanzania54 and to take preventive and 
protection actions to address attacks and discrimination against persons with albinism.  
</p>
<p>  
 45 According to information gathered by OHCHR in Burundi, persons with albinism used to be 
</p>
<p>accommodated in police stations and houses near communes. In the United Republic of Tanzania, 
they are sheltered in boarding schools for children with special needs.

<p>63. In its thirty-fourth activity report submitted to the African Union Assembly of Heads 
of State and Government, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights 
identified the situation of persons with albinism in Kenya and the United Republic of 
Tanzania as a matter of concern, highlighting some initiatives taken by the concerned 
States, such as the provision of free sunscreen and education campaigns.55 
</p>
<p><b> V. Discrimination against persons with albinism 
</b></p>
<p>64. The right to equality and non-discrimination is enshrined in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (art. 2) and is at the core of the main international human 
rights treaties56 and regional human rights instruments.57 The Universal Declaration and the 
two Covenants refer to discrimination on the basis of &#8220;colour&#8221; and the open-ended category 
&#8220;other status&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Main forms of discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>65. Structural discrimination against and marginalization and social exclusion of persons 
with albinism have been reported as a global phenomenon. According to submissions 
received by OHCHR, persons with albinism have difficulties getting the health care they 
require and accessing education, employment, legal protection and redress. This situation is 
compounded by deeply entrenched societal prejudices against and stereotypes of persons 
with albinism. 
</p>
<p>66. The following testimony illustrates the nature and scope of discrimination suffered 
by persons with albinism throughout their lifetime:  
</p>
<p>I have never known happiness in my life, and every time I think about my future 
tears flow in my eyes, I wonder if I would be happy one day? I still remember my 
difficult childhood, my father has always rejected me because I am an &#8220;albino&#8221;. One 
</p>
<p>day he told my brothers that I represented the devil, that I was not his daughter. He 
refused to send me to school. My maternal uncle enrolled me in a public school 
where I studied until third grade. Teachers and students made fun of me because I 
could not see the class-board. I could not endure all these insults, so I dropped out of 
school. This is how I found myself on the street, helpless. When I tried to sell some 
goods on the market nobody wanted to buy what I was selling. I was raped by a man 
and have a 15-month-old child. I feel desperate and lost.58 
</p>
<p>67. As noted by the Independent Expert on minority issues, &#8220;one of the major challenges 
for people living with albinism is that they are often rejected and abandoned by their own 
families under the societies&#8217; pressure&#8221;.59

Discrimination prohibits discrimination on the ground of race and the Convention on the Elimination

<p>68. As noted earlier, children with albinism are at high risk of abandonment, and women 
giving birth to children with albinism are often repudiated by their husband and families. 
Families frequently neglect the education of children with albinism as they believe their 
education is a waste of resources. Those who attend school often suffer from teasing and 
bullying from classmates. In some cases, their inability to see the blackboard, owing to 
significant vision impairment, forces them to drop out of school.60 As a result, many have 
low education levels and do not have all the necessary social or economic tools to live 
productive lives. This marginalization can be a contributing factor to a shorter life 
expectancy than for other members of the same society.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health noted that &#8220;people living with albinism 
often do not receive the necessary special attention, health care or treatment that 
corresponds to their health needs&#8221;.61 Many cannot, for example, afford simple remedies, 
such as sun cream, that would protect them from the elevated risk of developing skin 
cancer.  
</p>
<p>70. Without effective and affordable access to justice, persons with albinism are denied 
the possibility of claiming their rights and contesting the abuses or human rights violations 
to which they are exposed.62  
</p>
<p>71. All these forms of discrimination are interrelated, and the principle of the 
indivisibility and interdependence of human rights should be highlighted.63 The right to 
education of persons with albinism, for instance, is adversely affected due to the vision 
impairment they suffer. A poor education, in turn, affects the right to an adequate standard 
of living, consigning many persons with albinism to poverty.  
</p>
<p>72. The right to work is provided for in article 6 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which thus prohibits discrimination in access to and 
maintenance of employment, including on the basis of colour and on the ground of &#8220;other 
status&#8221;. It also prohibits denying or limiting equal access to decent work to all persons, 
especially disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups.64 Reference is also made 
to the ILO Convention No. 111 (1958) concerning Discrimination in Respect of 
Employment and Occupation. The right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health is recognized by article 12, paragraph 1, 
of the Covenant. According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
&#8220;health facilities, goods and services must be accessible to all, especially the most 
</p>
<p>vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, in law and in fact, without 
discrimination on any of the prohibited grounds&#8221;.65 Article 26 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>  
 60 The Special Rapporteur on the right to education has referred to dropout rates of children with 
</p>
<p>albinism and ways to reduce them (press statement, &#8220;Not ghosts&#8221;). All the written submissions 
received from civil society referred to discrimination in education and/or incessant bullying and 
name-calling.  
</p>
<p> 61 See press statement, &#8220;Not ghosts&#8221;. 
 62 See paragraphs 49&#8211;56 of the present report describing the challenges persons with albinism face in 
</p>
<p>accessing justice.  
 63 See for instance, Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 14 
</p>
<p>(2000) on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, paragraph 3, referring to how the right 
to health is closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human rights, including the 
rights to food, work, education, human dignity, life, non-discrimination and the prohibition against 
torture.  
</p>
<p> 64 Ibid., general comment No. 18 (2005) on the right to work, paragraphs 12 (b) (i) and 23.  
 65 General comment No. 14, paragraph 12 (b).  </p>


<p>All Forms of Racial Discrimination and article 15 of the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women similarly enshrine the right of everyone to 
equality before the law. 
</p>
<p>73. The right to freedom from discrimination would require that States ensure that 
persons with albinism are afforded equal protection under the law and in practice.66 States 
are obliged to ensure that their laws, policies and practices address the specific needs of 
persons with albinism.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Discrimination against women and children 
</b></p>
<p>74. Women and children with albinism are particularly vulnerable as they are exposed to 
intersecting and multiple forms of discrimination. In addition, children are particularly 
targeted for ritual killings (see para. 21 above) and women with albinism are sometimes 
victims of sexual violence.67  
</p>
<p>75. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has referred to 
women with albinism as a group of women in a vulnerable situation, meaning that they are 
at risk of being victims of multiple discrimination.68 According to the Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women, its causes and consequences, violence against women is deeply 
rooted in multiple layers of discrimination and inequality. As these layers of discrimination 
intersect, violence against women intensifies. Addressing systematic discrimination and 
marginalization is crucial to ending violence against women (see A/HRC/17/26). In her 
2012 report to the Council, the Special Rapporteur included witchcraft-related killings 
under gender-related killings (A/HRC/20/16, paras. 14 and 16). 
</p>
<p>76. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has also expressed serious concerns at 
reports of killings of and attacks against children with albinism, addressing this issue under 
the right to equality and non-discrimination (art. 2 of the Convention), among other rights. 
In the case of Burundi, the Committee expressed concern in its concluding observations 
that &#8220;de facto discrimination of children prevails [in the country] and is tolerated in the 
State party vis-&#224;-vis &#8230; albino children&#8221; (CRC/C/BDI/CO/2, paras. 29 and 30). The 
Committee encouraged the State party to review legislative instruments and adopt a 
comprehensive strategy, including awareness-raising, to eliminate discrimination on any 
grounds and against all vulnerable groups, particularly children with albinism (ibid.). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Areas requiring further study 
</b></p>
<p>77. Further analysis and consultations are required to determine the category into which 
persons with albinism may fall and the basis for discrimination against them. In some of the 
written submissions received from associations working with persons with albinism they 
are considered persons with disabilities.69 Others refer to discrimination on the ground of 
skin colour.70

</p>
<p>at reports that women and girls with albinism had been targeted in ritual killings, recommending that 
the State party protect them (A/63/38, paras. 142&#8211;143). See also Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, general comments Nos. 12, 19 and 28.

<p>78. Under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, persons with 
albinism could be considered persons with disabilities. According to article 1 of the 
Convention, persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, 
intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder 
their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. However, the 
Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has not dealt with the issue so far. 
According to the information received, some national legislation recognizes albinism and 
associated visual impairment as a disability.71 Additional review of national legislation on 
disability needs to be conducted. Moreover, consultations with persons with albinism are 
required on the issue of self-identification.  
</p>
<p>79.  With regard to disabilities, the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action urges 
States and international and regional organizations to address the situation of persons with 
disabilities who are also subject to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance; and to take necessary measures to ensure their full enjoyment of all human 
rights (para. 57). 
</p>
<p>80. Similarly, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has not yet 
examined the issue of discrimination on the basis of colour with respect to persons with 
albinism. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, referring to people living with albinism, has noted that: 
&#8220;Regardless of whether one has a lighter or a darker skin compared to the majority 
population in a country or a community, everyone is entitled to the same rights, dignity and 
treatment &#8230; [and] the same opportunities as anyone else.&#8221; On the other hand, the 
Independent Expert on minority issues has stated that: &#8220;People living with albinism do not 
fall under the internationally accepted definition of minorities &#8230; However, their stigma, the 
lifelong social exclusion and general discrimination they face is a similar experience to 
those vulnerable racial minorities because of their different skin colour&#8221;.72 
</p>
<p>82. The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, while not addressing specifically 
the situation faced by persons with albinism, recognizes that racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance occur on the grounds of race, colour, descent or national 
or ethnic origin, and that victims can suffer multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination 
based on other related grounds (including &#8220;other status&#8221;). It notes that these practices may 
be aggravated by inequitable distribution of wealth, marginalization and social exclusion. 
</p>
<p>83. Organizations working with persons with albinism advocate for considering them as 
a group requiring special attention, as the discrimination and attacks they are exposed to are 
mainly rooted in erroneous beliefs and myths that must be addressed.73

<p> 71 For instance, the amended version of the Persons with Disabilities Act in Kenya recognizes albinism 
as a disability. Discrimination laws in Australia protect the rights of people with disabilities, including 
albinism (Albinism Fellowship of Australia submission). In Canada and the United States, persons

<p>84. <b>OHCHR expresses its grave concern at the severity of the human rights 
violations committed against persons with albinism in many countries, including at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination they, and particularly children

<p> 74 See press release, &#8220;Pillay condemns &#8216;abhorrent&#8217; attacks&#8221;. 
 75 The present recommendation is part of a set of recommendations resulting from the international 
</p>
<p>expert&#8217;s consultation on the protection from harmful practices in plural legal systems (Special

<p><b>national action plans or action plans to combat discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. To international and regional human rights mechanisms

<p>87. <b>It is recommended that:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) The United Nations treaty bodies conduct a more systematic review of

</b></p>
<p><b>with their international obligations arising from the relevant treaty provisions;

</b></p>
<p><b>albinism during their country visits, and consider the submission of thematic reports 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the situation of persons with albinism, as relevant;

</b></p>
