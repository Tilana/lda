IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT SUVA
MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL MISC. ACTION NO: HAM0020 OF 2003S

Between:

JONE LUTUI
Applicant

And:

THE STATE
Respondent

Applicant in Person
Ms L. Chandra for State

RULING

The Applicant has not given adequate reasons for the late filing of this appeal. However the total of 8 years imprisonment for one count of incest and one count of indecent assault may be high according to guidelines sentences issued on these cases. This appeal may therefore be meritorious and I grant leave to enlarge time.

The Magistrates Court is ordered to prepare the record and submit it to the High Court for the appeal to be heard.

Application granted.
