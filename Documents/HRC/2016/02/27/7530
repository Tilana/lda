<p><b>  Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
  Addendum 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mission to Hungary</b>*  **<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention conducted a country mission to 
Hungary between 23 September and 2 October 2013 at the invitation of the Government. 
During the entire visit, the Working Group enjoyed the fullest cooperation of the 
Government. The delegation was able to visit all the detention facilities and interview in 
confidence all the detainees that it had requested. 
</p>
<p> In its report, the Working Group notes that Hungary has been facing many 
difficulties and challenges, and a series of legislative changes and reforms have been 
made to respond to them. Some of these changes have various degrees of impact on the 
issue of deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p> Regarding institutions that assist in the protection against arbitrary deprivation of 
liberty, the Working Group notes as positive the existence of an Ombudsman&#8217;s Office 
as a national human rights institution in Hungary. It also considers it a good practice to 
allow civil society organizations to visit detention facilities for monitoring purposes 
and to speak with detainees who require legal assistance. The report also considers the 
amendments currently being discussed in relation to the criminal procedure code, 
which could have positive impacts on the rights of those deprived of their liberty in the 
criminal justice system.

</p>
<p> However, the Working Group draws the Government&#8217;s attention to several issues 
that need to be considered and effectively addressed. 
</p>
<p> The report observes with concern the high number of pretrial detainees, an 
increased number of pretrial detentions lasting for longer than a year, and arbitrary 
court decisions ordering pretrial detention. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recalls that under international human rights law, detention 
in custody of persons awaiting trial is to be the exception rather than the rule. 
</p>
<p> Hungary has a prison population of 18,238 persons, 28 per cent of whom are 
pretrial detainees. The prison population of Hungary is currently at a 140 per cent 
overcrowding ratio, much of which can also be attributed to the common use of 
detention for those in the pretrial regime. The principle of proportionality is not often 
respected. 
</p>
<p> The report further notes the inequality of power between defence lawyers and 
prosecutors in criminal proceedings. Over 90 per cent of cases brought before the court 
in relation to pretrial detention are approved in favour of the prosecution.  
</p>
<p> Of similar and grave concern is the lack or absence of effective legal assistance 
for arrested persons. During its discussions with government authorities, the Working 
Group reiterated that the obligation to provide free legal assistance belongs to the State. 
One of the main problems affecting the defence counsel system is the way in which 
defence counsels are appointed. The authorities (including the investigative authorities, 
i.e., in most cases, the police) are completely free to choose the lawyer to be appointed. 
They are not obliged in any way to consider the wishes of the defendant. The report 
observes that some attorneys base their law practice principally on <i>ex officio 
</i>appointments, and may thus become financially dependent on the member of the police 
force who decides appointments. 
</p>
<p> The report further notes that under international human rights law, the pretrial 
detention of minors should be avoided whenever possible. The Working Group was 
informed, however, that 499 minors are juvenile offenders and that 320 minors are in 
reformatory institutions. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group was able to visit two detention facilities for irregular 
migrants and asylum seekers in Ny&#237;rb&#225;tor and B&#233;k&#233;scsaba. The regime for asylum 
seekers in places such as Ny&#237;rb&#225;tor seemed to be harsher than the regime in 
neighbouring cities for alien policing detention and migrants awaiting deportation. It 
was often unclear how persons were selected as asylum seekers and who would be 
placed in the alien policing jail.  
 Although the Working Group understands the difficulties faced by the 
Government in dealing with the rapid rise of border crossings, the situation of asylum 
seekers and migrants in an irregular situation needs robust improvements and attention 
to ensure against arbitrary deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p> Other issues considered in the report are the deprivation of liberty under the Law 
on Misdemeanours, the detention of Roma people and detention in psychiatric 
institutions. 
</p>
<p> In its conclusions, the Working Group invites the authorities of Hungary to 
review the situation of misdemeanour offenders in police holding facilities and the 
practice of holding remand prisoners in police establishments, and calls on the 
authorities to take steps, including at the legislative level, to ensure that all detained 
persons have access to a lawyer from the very outset of their deprivation of liberty. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group recommends that the Government, <i>inter alia</i>, assure that 
decisions on expulsion, return or extradition are dealt with expeditiously and follow the 
due process of the law; make certain that detention of asylum seekers and other non-
citizens is only used in exceptional circumstances or as a last resort, and then only for 
the shortest possible time; and take all necessary measures to ensure that persons under 
the age of 18 are only deprived of liberty as a last resort and that children, if detained, 
remain separated from adults and protected from any form of ill-treatment.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, established pursuant to resolution 
1991/42 of the former Commission on Human Rights, conducted a country mission to 
Hungary from 23 September to 2 October 2013 at the invitation of its Government. The 
Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group at the time of the visit, El Hadji Malick Sow 
(Senegal), and Vladimir Tochilovsky (Ukraine), member of the Working Group, were part 
of the delegation. They were accompanied by the Secretary of the Working Group and a 
staff member of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as 
well as by local interpreters. The Working Group expresses its appreciation to the 
Government for the full cooperation extended to it in the conduct of its mission. 
</p>
<p>2. During the entire visit and in all respects, the Working Group enjoyed the fullest 
cooperation of the Government of Hungary and of all authorities it dealt with throughout 
the various stages of the visit. The Working Group would like to extend its gratitude and 
appreciation to the Government for its quick and prompt response to the Working Group&#8217;s 
request to visit the country. This is indeed something that needs to be highlighted as it 
displays the willingness of this Government to cooperate with and facilitate the Working 
Group&#8217;s mandate.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group also thanks the Government for the support it provided in 
organizing the meetings the Working Group requested and in ensuring unhindered access to 
the detention facilities that the Working Group wished to visit. The Working Group was 
able to meet and interview detainees confidentially, as required by its mandate.  
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group would also like to thank the representatives of Hungarian civil 
society for its support during the mission, particularly representatives of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), human rights defenders, lawyers, academics and jurists who met the 
delegation and provided the Working Group with important information and assistance. 
Additionally, the Working Group wishes to thank its colleagues at the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for their valuable assistance.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Working Group met with senior authorities from the executive, legislative and 
judicial branches of the State, including members of the Parliament Committee on Youth, 
Social, Family and Housing Affairs; members of the Parliament Committee on Human 
Rights, Minority, Civic and Religious Affairs; the State Secretary of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs; the Deputy State Secretary and Political Director of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs; the Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice and Administration; 
the Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior; the Deputy State Secretary for 
Social and Family Affairs and the Deputy State Secretary for Healthcare at the Ministry of 
Human Resources; the General Director of the Office of Immigration and Nationality; the 
Deputy National Police Chief; and the Independent Police Complaints Board.  
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group was also able to meet with members of the judiciary, including 
judges from the Constitutional Court, the Curia (Supreme Court) and representatives from 
the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s Office in Budapest. In Szeged, it was able to meet with judges and 
the Chief County Prosecutor. The Working Group also had the opportunity to meet 
representatives from the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, and the President and members of the 
Hungarian Bar Association.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group visited detention facilities, including facilities for asylum 
seekers and migrants in an irregular situation (see Appendix I). Confidential interviews 
were held with detainees in these facilities.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of the institutional and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political system 
</b></p>
<p>8. Hungary is a multiparty republic. In January 2012, a new Fundamental Law 
(Constitution) came into force. Supreme power is vested in the unicameral Parliament, 
composed of 199 members. 
</p>
<p>9. Article Q(2) of the 2012 Constitution establishes that &#8220;Hungary shall ensure 
harmony between international law and Hungarian law in order to fulfil its obligations 
under international law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. The President of the Republic is elected by Parliament for a five-year term and is 
eligible for a second term. The President is the Commander in Chief of the armed forces. 
The Prime Minister is also elected by Parliament on the recommendation of the President of 
the Republic.  
</p>
<p>11. The Curia or Supreme Court is the supreme judicial authority. It consists of the 
president of the Curia and eight judges. The president of the Curia is elected from among its 
members for nine years by Parliament on the recommendation of the President of the 
Republic. The other judges are appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the 
National Council of Justice, a separate 15-member administrative body. All judges serve 
until the normal retirement age. 
</p>
<p>12. The Constitutional Court of Hungary supervises the constitutionality of legal acts. 
The Constitutional Court consists of 15 members elected by Parliament, which reviews the 
constitutionality of legislation and may annul laws. It also provides for a Commissioner for 
Fundamental Rights and a Deputy-Commissioner/Ombudsperson for the Rights of National 
Minorities. The members of the Constitutional Court are elected by a two-thirds vote of 
Parliament. Members serve 12-year terms.  
</p>
<p>13. In international comparison, the Constitutional Court of Hungary has a remarkably 
wide and extensive jurisdiction. In the first years following the democratic transition of 
1989&#8211;1990, the jurisprudence developed by the Constitutional Court had a particularly 
dynamic effect on the development of Parliament&#8217;s legislation. 
</p>
<p>14. In January 2013, a new law on the Constitutional Court entered into force. The 
Working Group received complaints that the new law has introduced unreasonable 
obstacles &#8211; including mandatory legal representation &#8211; which would make access difficult 
for citizens complaining of human rights. The law also removed the provision for collective 
complaints. 
</p>
<p>15. Regional courts of appeal, county courts (including the Municipal Court of 
Budapest) and local courts are subordinate courts. 
</p><p>16.  Under the new Constitution, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Rights of 
National and Ethnic Minorities (Minority Ombudsperson) has been replaced by the 
Commissioner for Fundamental Rights.  
</p>
<p>17. The Commissioner for Fundamental Rights protects fundamental rights and acts at 
the request of any person. The Commissioner examines or causes to be examined any 
abuses of fundamental rights of which he or she becomes aware, and proposes general or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>special measures for their remedy. The Deputy-Commissioners seek to defend the interests 
of future generations and the rights of national minorities living in Hungary.  
</p>
<p>18. Protection of fundamental human rights is a substantial aspect of the new 
Constitution, also reflected by its structure, whereby the chapter on fundamental rights and 
obligations now immediately follows the general provisions. The Constitution declares that 
Hungary respects the human rights of all persons in the country without discrimination on 
the basis of race, colour, gender, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origins, financial situation, birth or on any other grounds whatsoever, and the law 
provides for strict punishment of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>19. According to the information received, the new Constitution leaves many areas to be 
governed by supplementary laws, which require a two-thirds majority. These areas include 
electoral rules; party financing; the Central Bank; the tax and pension regime; and the 
country&#8217;s municipal system. The governmental party, Fidesz, currently has a two-thirds 
majority in Parliament, enabling it to pass measures in these areas.  
</p><p>20. On 1 January 2013, new laws on the organization and administration of courts and 
on the status and remuneration of judges entered into effect. The new law assigns court 
management to the president of the National Judiciary Office (OBH) while leaving 
oversight of the uniform administration of justice with the president of the Curia. The 
authority of the president of the OBH includes the budgetary and financial management of 
courts; staffing, appointment and distribution of caseload; and the ability to transfer cases to 
different courts. The new law also establishes the National Judicial Council (OBT), a 
consultative body of 15 judges. 
21. The Government has passed several laws allegedly extending its influence and 
weakening independent institutions. On 2 July 2012, Parliament amended the laws on the 
judiciary effective 17 July 2012, stipulating judicial review of the decisions of the president 
of the OBH, including changes of venue; prohibiting the extension of his or her mandate 
beyond its expiration; and protecting judges from dismissal if they refuse transfer to another 
court. The amendment also transferred some of the power of the president of OBH to the 
OBT, providing veto rights regarding judicial recommendations and court leadership 
appointments under certain conditions. On 16 July 2012, the Constitutional Court annulled 
provisions of the Act on the Legal Status and Remuneration of Judges that lowered the 
mandatory retirement age of judges. However, the court decision did not reinstate the 
retired judges to their former positions. 
22. In 2012, approximately 160 retired judges filed individual cases in the Hungarian 
labour courts for unlawful dismissal. On 28 December 2012, the Constitutional Court 
retroactively annulled the provision on the mandatory early retirement of judges stipulated 
by the transitional provisions. Despite this decision by the Constitutional Court, the 
Government did not reinstate the judges nor adopt new legislation on the retirement of 
judges. 
23. Since 1 January 2013, citizens and human rights groups no longer have the right to 
petition the Constitutional Court to review the constitutionality of legal norms. Under the 
new Constitution, only the Government, one quarter of the members of Parliament and the 
Commissioner for Fundamental Rights have the right to initiate such proceedings. It seems 
that the new rules regarding the Constitutional Court have weakend the system of checks 
and balances and constitutional protection. 
</p>
<p>24. During 2013, the Prosecutor-General did not exercise his authority to instruct that 
charges be brought at a specific court. In March, the fourth amendment to the Fundamental 
Law was adopted by the Parliament of Hungary without proper public discussion on issues 
that may affect the population&#8217;s human rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>25. The 2013 fifth amendment to the Constitution includes tweaking of rules on election 
campaigning, religious freedom and the independence of the judiciary, among others. The 
amendment also upholds the President&#8217;s right to reassign cases to a different court &#8211; a 
provision that was previously adopted as a transitional measure and was subsequently 
struck down as unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>26. Victims of lesser police abuses may complain to either the alleged violator&#8217;s unit or 
the Independent Police Complaints Board, which investigates violations and omissions by 
police that affect fundamental rights. The five-member body, appointed by Parliament, 
functions independently of police authorities. The authority of the Independent Police 
Complaints Board is limited to making recommendations to the National Police 
Headquarters and reporting its findings to Parliament. 
</p>
<p>27. The Equal Treatment Authority is an independent administrative body that was 
established in 2005 to protect, enforce and promote equality and the right to equal treatment 
by monitoring the observance of Act CXXV of 2003 on Equal Treatment and the 
Promotion of Equal Opportunities (&#8220;Equal Treatment Act&#8221;).  
</p><p>28. The National Police Headquarters, which operate under the direction of the Ministry 
of Interior, is responsible for maintaining order nationwide. City police are subordinate to 
the county police and have local jurisdiction. 
29. Penalties for police officers found guilty of wrongdoing include reprimand, 
dismissal and criminal prosecution.  
</p>
<p>30. The Hungarian Defence Force is subordinate to the Ministry of Defence and is 
responsible for external security as well as aspects of domestic security and disaster 
response. 
</p>
<p>31.  The law penalizes the organization of unauthorized law enforcement activity with 
up to two years in prison.  
</p>
<p>32. However, far-right extremists have continued to form vigilante groups and conduct 
patrols in smaller towns in eastern Hungary, apparently to intimidate the local Romani 
population. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Judicial guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>33. Hungary is a party to the international human rights instruments listed in 
A/HRC/WG.6/11/HUN/2, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and its First and Second Optional Protocols, as well as the Convention relating to the 
Status of Refugees. On 12 January 2012, Hungary acceded to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and made a declaration regarding article 24. 
</p>
<p>34. The Constitution and the laws provide for the right to a fair trial within a reasonable 
amount of time. An independent judiciary enforces this right. Defendants are presumed 
innocent until proven guilty. Suspects have the right to be informed promptly of the nature 
of charges against them and the applicable legal regulations at the start of questioning. Any 
changes to the charges shall also be communicated to the suspect as the investigation 
develops. Trial procedures are public as a rule; however, the judge may minimize public 
attendance and can order closed procedures under certain conditions. 
</p>
<p>35. According to Article IV of the Constitution:  
</p>
<p>(1) Every person shall have the right to freedom and personal safety; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>(2) No person shall be deprived of his or her liberty except for statutory reasons or 
as a result of a statutory procedure. Life imprisonment without parole shall only be 
imposed in relation to the commission of wilful and violent offences; 
</p>
<p>(3) Any person suspected of and arrested for committing any offence shall either be 
released or brought before a court as soon as possible. The court shall be obliged to 
give such person a hearing and to immediately make a decision with a written 
justification on his or her acquittal or conviction; 
(4) A person whose liberty has been restricted without a well-founded reason or in 
an unlawful manner shall be entitled to indemnity. 
</p>
<p>36. According to Section 92 of the new Criminal Code, the entire duration of 
preliminary detention shall be included in the final sentence, whether it is a term of 
imprisonment, community service or fine.  
</p>
<p>37. The new Criminal Code considers juvenile a person who has completed her/his 
twelfth year when committing the crime, but has not yet completed her/his eighteenth year. 
Children between 12 and 14 years can only be brought to justice for the most serious crimes 
and only if they have the capacity to judge the consequences of their actions.  
</p><p>38. The new Criminal Code, which entered into force on 1 July 2013, introduces 
changes in the provisions protecting persons from hate-motivated assaults due to their real 
or perceived identity. Whereas the old Criminal Code (Act IV of 1978) explicitly prohibited 
assaults only on the ground of nationality, ethnicity, race or religion, the new law also 
includes a non-exhaustive list (i.e. sexual orientation, gender identity and disability). 
39. However, the Working Group received allegations that despite these legislative 
changes, there has been a systemic problem in their implementation due to a lack of 
procedures and guidelines on the investigation of such crimes for police and prosecution 
services. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General remarks 
</b></p>
<p>40. Hungary has been facing many difficulties and challenges, and a series of legislative 
changes and reforms have been made to respond to them. Some of these changes have 
various degrees of impact on the issue of deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>41. The new Constitution of Hungary provides for the protection of the right to freedom 
where it stipulates that &#8220;every person shall have the right to freedom &#8230; and no person shall 
be deprived of his or her liberty&#8221; except when it is in accordance to law (article IV). It goes 
further to provide that a person suspected and/or arrested for committing an offence shall 
either be released or brought before a court as soon as possible and thereafter the court shall 
be obliged to give such person a hearing and immediately make a decision with a written 
justification on his or her acquittal or conviction (<i>ibid.</i>). Hence, the right to be free from 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty is enshrined in the highest law of the land. 
</p>
<p>42. Regarding institutions that assist in the protection against arbitrary deprivation of 
liberty, it is positive to see the existence of the Office of the Commissioner for 
Fundamental Rights as a national human rights institution in Hungary. It is also good 
practice to allow civil society organizations access to visit detention facilities for 
monitoring purposes and to also speak with detainees who require legal assistance, 
something the Working Group observed in existence in the country. Amendments were 
introduced in relation to the Criminal Procedure Code that could have positive impacts on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>the rights of those deprived of their liberty in the criminal justice system. Act CLXXXVI of 
2013 amended the rules of pretrial detention. Currently, if the defendant is in pretrial 
detention, then the procedure must be conducted as a priority. In addition, the maximum 
period of pretrial detention must be in proportion to the nature of the offence committed.  
</p>
<p>43. However, the Working Group would like to draw the attention of the Government to 
several issues that need to be considered and effectively addressed. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Excessive use of pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p>44. Police may take individuals into short-term arrest if they are caught committing a 
crime, suspected of having committed a crime, subject to an arrest warrant or unable or 
unwilling to identify themselves. Individuals who cannot prove their identity with 
identification documents may be charged with a petty offense.  
</p>
<p>45. Short-term arrests generally last up to eight hours, but may last up to 12 hours in 
exceptional cases. The police may detain for 24 hours suspects whom they consider to pose 
a security threat. The police and the prosecutor&#8217;s office may order the 72-hour detention of 
suspects if there is a well-founded suspicion of an offense punishable with imprisonment or 
if the subsequent pretrial detention of the defendant appears likely. If the investigation 
judge at court rejects the prosecutor&#8217;s motion and does not order pretrial detention within 
72 hours, the police must release the detainee. The defendant may appeal a pretrial 
detention order. 
</p>
<p>46. Under certain conditions (such as the risk of escape or hindrance of an 
investigation), a prosecutor can file a motion for pretrial detention with the local court 
where the accused is taken into custody. Pretrial detention ordered by the court lasts until 
the issuance of a trial court ruling. The defendant may appeal pretrial detention. Detention 
ordered by an appeals court lasts until the delivery of the final binding decision but no 
longer than the length of imprisonment imposed by the trial court&#8217;s sentence. In Hungary, 
28 per cent of the prison population is in pretrial detention.  
</p>
<p>47. The police must inform suspects of the charges against them at the beginning of 
their first interrogation, which must be within 24 hours of detention. Authorities generally 
respect this right. 
</p>
<p>48. There is a functioning bail system. However, bail is restricted in cases when there is 
a flight risk. Bail and other alternatives to pretrial detention were underused. In cases of 
prohibition of leaving domicile and house arrest, the court can order the supervision of the 
defendant&#8217;s compliance by an electronic remote monitor tool to follow the defendant&#8217;s 
movements. Since 1 January 2014, the agreement of the defendant is no longer required.  
</p>
<p>49. According to the law, the police must inform suspects of their right to counsel before 
questioning them. Representation by defence counsel is mandatory in the investigation 
phase when suspects are: facing a charge punishable by more than five years&#8217; 
imprisonment; detained; deaf, blind, unable to speak or suffering from a mental disorder; 
unfamiliar with the Hungarian language or the language of the procedure; unable to defend 
themselves in person for any reason; juveniles; or indigent and request the appointment of 
defence counsel. In the judicial phase, defence counsel is also mandatory at the hearing if: it 
takes place at the county court acting as the trial court; a supplementary private prosecutor 
presses charges; the hearing is expedited (fast-track simplified procedure for minor 
offenses); the hearing is carried out <i>in absentia</i>; the defendant so requests; or <i>ex officio</i> 
legal representation is necessary in the interest of the defendant. 
</p>
<p>50. When defence counsel is required, suspects have three days to hire an attorney; 
otherwise, the police or the prosecutor appoints one. If suspects make clear their </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>unwillingness to retain counsel, the police or the prosecutor are required to appoint counsel 
immediately by choosing a lawyer from a list kept by the competent bar association. 
However, neither the police nor the prosecutor is obligated to wait for counsel to arrive 
before interrogating the suspect. According to human rights NGOs, the police routinely 
proceeded with interrogation immediately after notifying suspects of their right to counsel. 
</p>
<p>51. The law permits short-term detainees to notify relatives or others of their detention 
within eight hours, unless the notification would jeopardize the investigation. The 
investigative authorities must notify relatives of a detainee who is under 72-hour detention 
of the detention and of the detainee&#8217;s location within 24 hours. The Working Group was 
told that, in practice, police did not fully comply with this requirement. 
</p>
<p>52. The law on petty offenses permits the incarceration of juveniles (defined as 
individuals from 14 to 18 years of age) in cases when the juvenile has no income or 
property and thus cannot be fined as a way of punishment. Alternative sanctions, such as 
community service, do not apply in such cases. Human rights NGOs expressed concern that 
the law left no alternative to the incarceration of juveniles convicted of minor offenses. 
</p><p>53. The Working Group received reports regarding the high number of pretrial 
detainees, an increased number of pretrial detentions lasting for longer than a year and 
arbitrary court decisions ordering pretrial detention. Some court decisions ordering pretrial 
detention were not adequately substantiated by facts, and courts approved prosecution 
requests for pretrial detention without taking into consideration objections by the defence. 
54. The law provides that persons held in pretrial detention and later acquitted may 
receive monetary compensation. 
</p>
<p>55. Under international human rights law, detention in custody of persons awaiting trial 
is to be the exception rather than the rule. However, the Working Group consistently 
received information that the excessive use of pretrial detention is prevalent throughout the 
criminal justice system in Hungary.  
</p><p>56. On 18 October 2013, Hungary had a prison population of 18,238 persons, 28 per 
cent of whom were pretrial detainees. The Working Group observes that even with 
legislation providing for alternative measures to detention, the recourse detention as a first 
resort rather than a last has been commonplace.  
</p>
<p>57. The prison population in Hungary is currently at a 140 per cent overcrowding ratio, 
much of which can also be attributed to the common use of detention for those in the 
pretrial regime. In addition to the overuse of pretrial detention, the prolongation process of 
the detention also raises serious questions in that it often leads to unnecessary and lengthy 
periods of detention. The principle of proportionality was not often respected. Since 2010, 
741 new spaces have been built. 3,600 new spaces are slotted for completion before 2017, 
and alternative measures to confinement are to be developed more intensely. 
</p>
<p>58. In its interviews with detainees, the Working Group was informed of pretrial 
detention periods that ranged from a few months to 18 months and, in one case, a person 
had been in pretrial detention for over three years. Although alternatives to detention are 
stipulated in the relevant legislation, a &#8220;culture of detaining&#8221; a person pending trial seemed 
to be evident throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>59. Even though Hungarian law provides specific grounds for when a person can be 
subjected to pretrial detention, the Working Group observed that many of the detainees it 
interviewed would have benefitted from alternatives to detention, also prescribed by law, 
because they did not meet the criteria that rendered pretrial detention necessary.  
</p>
<p>60. The Working Group also observed that some of those interviewed were not 
knowledgeable about their rights in the criminal justice system nor aware of basic legal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>rights, such as the right to have a lawyer present during the initial interrogation at the police 
station. In fact, quite often, it is a police officer who recommends a lawyer that he or she 
may know from a list of lawyers in the community. Some of the detainees also stated that 
they were taken into police custody, and what they thought was a simple interrogation 
resulted in months of pretrial detention.  
</p>
<p>61. Adding further concerns to the problems faced by persons who are arrested and 
placed in pretrial detention, the Working Group was consistently informed of the inequality 
of power between defence lawyers and prosecutors in criminal proceedings. Over 90 per 
cent of cases brought before the courts in relation to pretrial detention were decided in 
favour of the prosecution.  
</p>
<p>62. Pretrial detention must be based on an individualized determination that it is 
reasonable and necessary. However, the Working Group observed that the lack of 
individual assessments of cases has often meant that those in pretrial detention find it 
overwhelmingly difficult to challenge the legality of their detention. Several interviewees 
stated that the motions of prosecutors enjoyed a system of almost automatic approval, 
whereas defence lawyers did not achieve the same results. This was also worsened by the 
fact that the defence has limited right to access the material on the basis of which the 
detention is ordered. A defence lawyer, even one who is working hard to effectively 
represent his or her client, finds it enormously difficult to successfully challenge a pretrial 
detention or prevent it from being prolonged, because often he or she is not privy to the 
relevant investigation material. However, since 1 January 2014, the investigation material 
on which the motion filed was based must be attached to the motion sent to the defence 
counsel.  
</p>
<p>63. These disparities have raised concerns for the Working Group because of the many 
detainees with whom it has met who have been in pretrial detention for too long or who 
could clearly benefit from other legal alternatives to detention.  
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group has been informed that the use of electronic devices as a means 
to assist with home arrest measures is currently being implemented. The Working Group 
would like to emphasize the importance of exploring the use of such alternative measures. 
</p>
<p>65. The excessive use of pretrial detention continues to be one of the most serious 
problems of the criminal justice system of Hungary. Since 2005, pretrial detainees are held 
in penitentiary institutions, leading to problems deriving from the critical overcrowding in 
prison facilities mentioned above. Reflecting the general trend of stricter criminal policy, 
the number of pretrial detainees is also rising.1 
</p>
<p>66. The average number of people held in pretrial detention increased by more than 7 
per cent in only two years after 2009, and currently almost 30 per cent of the prison 
population consists of persons who have not been convicted by any court for any crime. 
Courts continue to approve prosecution motions to order or uphold pretrial detention almost 
automatically, failing to examine the individual circumstances of the suspect in many cases. 
</p>
<p>67. The other serious problem is the excessive length of pretrial detention in a 
considerable number of cases: suspects often remain in detention for several months, or 
even years.  
</p>
<p>68. The most problematic issue pertaining police detentions remains the short-term 
arrest (<i>el</i>&#337;<i>&#225;ll&#237;t&#225;s</i>). Under article 33 of Act XXXIV of 1994 on the Police, a person may be 
taken into short-term arrest if, <i>inter alia</i>, he or she is caught in the act of committing a 
crime; is under an arrest warrant; is suspected of having committed a crime; cannot identify

<p>himself/herself or refuses to do so; is required to give a blood or urine sample in order to 
prove a criminal or a petty offence; or fails to stop a petty offence when called upon to do 
so.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Detention of minors 
</b></p>
<p>69. Juvenile offenders should only be confined as a last resort. In their case, the central 
focus of the criminal justice system should be education and reintegration. According to 
international legal rules, individuals under 18 are considered children. Article 37 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that the arrest, detention or imprisonment of 
a child should only be applied as a measure of the last resort, and only for the shortest 
possible period of time. The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Administration of Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules) also state that in the case of juvenile 
offenders, the criminal justice system needs to avoid a retributive approach.  
</p><p>70. According to Act II of 2012 on Misdemeanours, the Misdemeanour Procedure and 
the Misdemeanour Registry System (&#8220;Law on Misdemeanours&#8221;), the confinement of 
juveniles is carried out in a penitentiary institution; the possibility of implementing the 
confinement in a juvenile correctional facility is excluded.  
71. According to the new Criminal Code, the minimum age of criminal responsibility 
has been lowered in case of certain offenses. Children over 12 and under 14 can be charged 
with homicide, voluntary manslaughter, bodily harm, robbery and plunder, if the child can 
judge the consequences of his/her actions. Children under 14 cannot be sent to 
penitentiaries. However, they can be sent to juvenile reformatory centres to follow special 
education programmes if they have committed some of the above-mentioned offenses.  
</p>
<p>72. Under international human rights law, the pretrial detention of minors should be 
avoided whenever possible. The Working Group was informed, however, that there were 
499 juvenile offenders in penitentiary institutions and 320 minors in reformatory 
institutions. One minor was interned in a psychiatric institution.  
</p>
<p>73. The delegation visited the Juvenile Prison in T&#246;k&#246;l where there were 240 minors 
detained. One of these minors was 15 years old. 50 minors were in pretrial detention and 24 
had been detained for more than six months. The delegation also visited the Correctional 
Facility for Young Offenders in Budapest where there were 80 children aged between 14 
and 18 submitted to a regime of re-education. Minors spent an average of 10 months in this 
facility. However, the Working Group found that 20 minors had been detained there for 
more than 20 months.  
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group recalls that the Committee on the Rights of the Child stated in 
2007 in its General Comment No. 10 that the reaction to the violation of a law by a child is 
to be proportional to the age, maturity, necessities and circumstances of the child and has to 
take into account the long-term interests of society in education and reintegration and not 
mere punishment. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Lack of effective legal assistance 
</b></p>
<p>75. Of similar and grave concern as the overuse of pretrial detention is the lack or 
absence of effective legal assistance for arrested persons. During its discussions with 
government authorities, the Working Group reiterated that the obligation to provide free 
legal assistance belongs to the State. A number of detainees reported that they were 
interrogated without a lawyer present, as they did not realize the importance of legal advice 
at the time of the interrogation and the evidentiary character of the written statements, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>which could later be used at trial against them. Some of those that did have lawyers did not 
feel that their cases were effectively defended.  
</p>
<p>76. Legal assistance may be received from the Legal Aid Services. Under Act LXXX of 
2003 on Legal Aid, the mandate of the Legal Aid Services is to provide free legal aid to 
indigent persons with legal problems, which may also include the violation of the right of 
equal treatment. The entitlement to free legal support depends on whether the applicant 
meets the criteria based on social or financial status. The Legal Aid Services of the regional 
offices of the Ministry of Justice decide on the requests for legal aid. If the decision is 
positive, the client may choose his or her legal aid provider from the list of registered legal 
aid providers.  
</p>
<p>77. One of the main problems affecting the defence counsel system is the way in which 
defence counsels are appointed. The authorities (including the investigative authorities, i.e. 
in most cases the police) are completely free to choose the lawyer to be appointed. They are 
not obliged in any way to consider the wishes of the defendant. The competent bar 
association keeps a register of those attorneys who can be appointed as defence counsel, 
and the authority conducting the actual phase of the procedure chooses a defence lawyer 
from this list. Some attorneys base their law practice principally on <i>ex officio</i> appointments, 
so they may become financially dependent on the member of the police force who makes 
decisions on appointments.  
</p>
<p>78. Under Hungarian law, defence is mandatory: if the defendant is detained, he or she 
must either retain a lawyer or an <i>ex officio</i> defence counsel is appointed. If the suspect&#8217;s 
detention is ordered, it shall be guaranteed that he or she can retain a lawyer before the first 
interrogation.2  
</p>
<p>79. The counsel shall be notified in due course, at least 24 hours beforehand, of all the 
investigative acts where he or she may be present. The notice given to lawyers is often very 
short, or sent in a way that the chances of the lawyer receiving the notification are 
practically non-existent.  
</p>
<p>80. According to statistics obtained by the Working Group during its visit, it is not 
uncommon for police investigators to select a lawyer for the detainee. In some 
municipalities, the police investigators select the same lawyer in 50&#8211;70 per cent of cases. In 
some instances, the defence lawyers did not show up for the interrogation because the 
police would wait for the last possible minute to notify the lawyer, knowing that it was the 
evening or the weekend, thus making the lawyer&#8217;s presence difficult or impossible.  
</p>
<p>81. As one of the experienced lawyers put it, the first 72 hours of arrest is a crucial 
period for the arrested person and yet lawyers are often not present. The absence of a 
lawyer provides opportunities for the detainees&#8217; rights to be violated.  
</p>
<p>82. The Working Group was informed that defence lawyers assigned and paid by the 
Government earn around 4,000 Ft. per hour (approximately 13 EUR). Defence lawyers 
often have to travel long distances to provide assistance to clients and to deal with the 
inequalities mentioned in the access to case materials compared to prosecutors. These 
factors create a difficult environment in which effective legal assistance cannot be 
guaranteed, and the Working Group notes this as a contributor to the high number of those 
in pretrial detention.  
</p>
<p>83. In the context of all these difficulties and without the proper safeguards, an arrested 
person is under serious risk of being arbitrarily detained.

<p>84. The Working Group is pleased, however, that there is legal assistance being offered 
by certain civil society organizations and that their legal advisors can be present. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Detention of asylum seekers and migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p>85. Hungary has become a key transit country for migrants attempting to reach Western 
Europe. According to article XIV of the Constitution, paragraph 3, 
</p>
<p>Hungary shall grant asylum to all non-Hungarian citizens as requested if they are 
being persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution in their native countries 
or in the countries of their usual residence due to their racial or national identities, 
affiliation to a particular social group, or to their religious or political persuasions, 
unless they receive protection from their countries of origin or any other country. 
</p>
<p>86. On 1 July 2013, following the adoption of Act XCIII of 2013, new amendments to 
the Asylum Act entered into force. The transposition of the Directive 2013/33/EU of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 laying down standards for the 
reception of applicants for international protection (recast), which had not even been 
formally adopted at the time the amendments were drafted, provided a legal background for 
the adopted changes. The amendments to the Asylum Act offer extensive grounds for the 
detention of asylum seekers under a separate legal regime (separate from immigration 
detention), so-called &#8220;asylum detention&#8221;. 
</p><p>87. The relevant immigration and asylum norms of Hungary, which have been amended 
several times since the 1990s, are contained in the following: Act II of 2007 on the 
Admission and Right of Residence of Third-Country Nationals 
</p>
<p>88. ; Government Decree 114/2007 (V.24.) on the Implementation of Act II of 2007 on 
the Admission and Right of Residence of Third-Country Nationals; and Act LXXX of 2007 
on Asylum.  
</p>
<p>89. Act II of 2007 provides for two types of migration-related detention: &#8220;detention in 
preparation for expulsion,&#8221; which is aimed at detaining non-citizens whose identities or 
legal grounds of residence cannot be conclusively established (section 55, Act II of 2007); 
and &#8220;alien policing detention&#8221;, which can be ordered to ensure the implementation of an 
expulsion order. Both detention in preparation for expulsion and alien policing detention 
can be ordered by the National Police and by the Office of Immigration and Nationality of 
Hungary (OIN).  
</p><p>90. Foreigners have the right to file a complaint challenging their detention. However, 
complaints can only be lodged after an initial court review of the detention. Complaints 
cannot be filed after a non-citizen has entered alien policing proceedings. In addition, 
complaints must be filed within 72 hours of a detention order being issued (section 57, Act 
II of 2007).  
91. The Border Guard, which was integrated into the National Police in January 2008, is 
authorized to apprehend and detain non-citizens for both types of detention.3 The OIN is 
responsible for housing asylum seekers at the secure and open reception centres. It must be 
notified by the police when an asylum claim is made.4 Both the police and the OIN fall 
under the Ministry of the Interior.

</p>
<p>92. Authorities can detain non-citizens for an initial period of up to 72 hours without 
judicial review. For detention in preparation for expulsion, this period can be extended by 
court order to a maximum of 30 days (section 55, Act II of 2007). In the case of alien 
policing detention, the court can extend detention of a non-citizen for 30 days at a time, 
provided a request is made eight days before the due date for each extension, up to a 
maximum of six months (sections 54 and 58, Act II of 2007). If it is clear that an expulsion 
order cannot be executed within six months, detention must be terminated (section 54 
(6)(c), Act II of 2007).  
</p><p>93. If there are still grounds for detention after six months have passed, the individual 
must be transferred to one of the country&#8217;s three community shelters, or to another 
appropriate place of accommodation (section 62 (3), Act II of 2007).5 However, individuals 
who violate the rules of the community shelter or attempt to cross the border illegally can 
be subject to additional six months in alien policing detention.6  
94. Asylum applicants can be subjected to asylum detention. When an asylum request is 
made at the border, the police transfers the applicant to the OIN where the applicant will 
have his or her first asylum interview. The OIN will decide if the applicant should be 
accommodated in one of the open reception centres in Debrecen, Bicske or V&#225;mosszabadi 
(in 75 per cent of cases) or in a closed asylum reception centre in Ny&#237;rb&#225;tor, B&#233;k&#233;scsaba or 
Debrecen. The OIN can order asylum detention for a maximum of 72 hours. The 
prolongation of the detention is subjected to a judicial decision. Judicial authorities are 
entitled to prolong the asylum detention each time by a maximum of 60 days for up to six 
months.  
</p>
<p>95. In 2013, detention was ordered in less than 25 per cent of all asylum cases. The 
duration of the preliminary assessment is of 30 days. If an asylum seeker&#8217;s request is 
considered to have merit, &#8220;the alien policing authority shall, at the initiative of the refugee 
authority, terminate his/her detention&#8221; (section 54, Act II of 2007). In practice, however, 
asylum seekers in alien policing detention often find themselves in situations of prolonged 
detention.  
</p>
<p>96. There have also been cases in which asylum seekers remain in prolonged detention 
as authorities determine whether, under the Dublin II Regulation (European<b> </b>Council 
Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the criteria and 
mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum 
application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national), Hungary is the 
correct country for a person to file an asylum claim. This procedure can result in people 
being detained in a reception centre for up to six months. 
</p>
<p>97. The Working Group was able to visit two detention facilities for irregular migrants 
and asylum seekers in Ny&#237;rb&#225;tor and B&#233;k&#233;scsaba. 
</p>
<p>98. The Working Group understands the pressure and challenges faced by Hungary as a 
transit country having seen a radical increase in the numbers of asylum seekers in 2012 
alone. In that year, a total of 2,157 applications for asylum were registered, and from 
January to August 2013, an estimated 15,000 were registered. The huge wave of border 
crossings has created a sense of urgency within the Government.

</b></p>
<p>99. The Working Group was able to meet with immigrants of different nationalities to 
assess the situation in relation to its mandate.  
</p>
<p>100. From the outset, the Working Group notes that the Government of Hungary has 
responded during the last few years with different approaches to the influx of people 
crossing its borders. Legislative changes and policies have been initiated to manage the 
situation. The legislative changes to the Asylum Act that came into effect in July 2013 have 
some positive changes, such as asylum detention having to be based on individual 
assessment; the introduction of alternatives to detention such as bail; and benefits such as 
the availability of social workers to assist those in detention.  
</p>
<p>101. Unaccompanied minors remain exempt from detention.  
</p>
<p>102. In practical terms, there are many issues raising concern of various violations despite 
the current legislation providing for certain positive measures. The issue of prolonging the 
detention of an asylum seeker and the lack of proper judicial review were consistently 
raised during interviews.  
</p>
<p>103. Three information sheets on general information on the asylum procedure and 
asylum detention in the 13 most commonly-used languages are given to the applicants 
before the interview. Although the law provides that a complaint or an objection can be 
submitted against a detention order &#8211; an important tool against challenging a potentially 
arbitrary detention &#8211; this right is not often explicitly communicated to those who are being 
detained. This is further complicated by the language difficulties faced by detainees, who 
are of different nationalities. Furthermore, when the lawyer representing the detainee filed a 
complaint against the detention, there was a system of extending the detention without 
proper regard for the lawyer&#8217;s submission and the individual circumstances of the detainee. 
</p>
<p>104. Concerning alien policing detention (and not asylum detention), 6,174 persons were 
in detention in 2012. Only three requests for release were successful. Hence, the lack of 
effective legal remedy against detention orders and their prolongation is worrying, as it has 
resulted in detentions for periods of up to 12 months.  
</p>
<p>105. The regime for asylum seekers in places such as Ny&#237;rb&#225;tor seemed to be tougher 
than the regime in neighbouring cities for alien policing detention and migrants awaiting 
deportation. It was often unclear how persons were selected as asylum seekers and who 
would be placed in the alien policing jail. In some instances, an asylum seeker was placed 
in the alien policing jail without proper reasoning or justification. According to the 
authorities, first-time asylum applicants could not be placed in alien policing detention, but 
persons who submitted their second asylum application after a final and binding negative 
decision did not have the right to stay in the country.  
</p>
<p>106. The Working Group would like to point out that in situations where a delay in a case 
is not attributable to the detainee, the person should not be unduly detained for a prolonged 
period. This is the case where certain persons were held in detention and clarifications were 
necessary with regard to issues such as identity, the difficulties were due to the authorities 
involved in the case, and the person was not given any other option but to remain in 
detention.  
</p>
<p>107. The Working Group notes with concern that for acts that are not considered a crime, 
persons who have entered the country without authorization find themselves in situations 
similar to a penitentiary system and equally without proper guarantees of their rights.  
</p>
<p>108. Although the Working Group understands the difficulties faced by the Government 
in dealing with the rapid rise of border crossings, the situation of asylum seekers and 
migrants in irregular situations needs robust improvements and attention to ensure against 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The positive measures introduced by the recent law should 
be implemented in a clear and defined manner.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>109. Detention should not be the common and first resort and should be for the shortest 
possible duration, especially when genuine asylum seekers may be overlooked or detained 
unnecessarily without proper justification. The presence of a legal representative appointed 
by the court is mandatory in asylum detention cases. In practice, however, the problem 
relating to effective legal remedy is worsened by the severe lack of effective legal 
assistance to these vulnerable persons. Most of those that the Working Group interviewed 
stated that they did not have legal assistance, and those that did have a lawyer stated that it 
was someone from a civil society organization rather than one provided by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Deprivation of liberty under the Law on Misdemeanours 
</b></p>
<p>110. The range of misdemeanours (petty offences) punishable with confinement was 
broadened already in 2010 by Act LXXXVI of 2010 on Amendments Necessary in Order to 
Improve Public Security, extending the possibility of confinement to misdemeanours 
against property. The Law on Misdemeanours upheld the extended list of offences 
punishable with confinement and made it possible to apply confinement for the third 
misdemeanour within a six-month period to any petty offence, even if none of the 
misdemeanours committed would be otherwise punishable by confinement. Each case of 
conversion must be decided by a judge, but a trial is held at the defendant&#8217;s request. The 
Law on Misdemeanours allows for changing a fine or community service to confinement 
without hearing the offender if he or she fails to pay the fine or carry out the work, which is 
a violation of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>111. It may be added that the Law on Misdemeanours also criminalizes homelessness: it 
provides that living on public premises and storing related personal property on public 
premises constitutes a petty offence, and those living in public premises may be punished 
with a fine or with confinement.  
</p>
<p>112. The Working Group interviewed a number of detainees who were serving time in 
confinement for offences such as not wearing a seatbelt, having a broken bicycle light, 
jaywalking and walking across the street under the influence of alcohol. (Since 1 July 2011, 
the omission of wearing a seatbelt is only subject to an administrative procedure). The 
Working Group noted that most of these offenders were also unemployed or without 
regular work. A common reason for not being able to pay a fine was financial limitations. 
The time being served in confinement ranged from 10 to 38 days and, when questioned 
about having a lawyer, the Working Group received similar information that it was not easy 
to obtain one or that the detainees were sentenced to confinement without having been able 
to challenge this decision in court. 
</p>
<p>113. It seemed that an automatic conversion of a fine to confinement took place without 
the offender being in court to challenge the confinement. This automatic system of 
conversion concerns the Working Group, as a person should be able to challenge any 
deprivation of liberty in light of one&#8217;s own and unique circumstance, for instance where 
family or financial situations can be explained to a judicial authority to shed light on the 
inability to pay a fine. This situation is aggravated by the fact that only a particular section 
of the population is unfairly disadvantaged: those who are poor or who may not have the 
means to provide financial assurance against confinement.  
</p>
<p>114. The Working Group notes that in 2012, there was a drastic increase in the 
conversion of non-payment of fines to confinement. The principle of proportionality should 
be applied in these situations and, importantly, alternative measures to confinement such as 
community work should be utilized.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>115. With regard to juvenile offenders, the Working Group notes that this is a grave issue 
that needs to be assessed, as confinement of this group is also provided for, and the 
possibility of converting a fine into confinement exists.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Detention in psychiatric institutions 
</b></p>
<p>116. According to a recent government resolution, the Judicial and Observational 
Psychiatric Institution is to be placed in another building, in a former hospital. Compulsory 
psychiatric treatment is the involuntary psychiatric treatment of mentally ill offenders, 
ordered and supervised by the criminal system. According to the new Criminal Code, as of 
1 July 2013 the length of the treatment will be indefinite, possibly lifelong. The time of the 
eventual release is not prescribed by law; it is subject to periodical judicial review. 
Detainees in psychiatric institutions may remain institutionalized for a period of time longer 
than the prison term they would have served. 
</p>
<p>117. Detainees in psychiatric institutions are forced to take psychiatric medication. 
Detainees interviewed were often asleep during discussions and could not communicate.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Detention of Roma people 
</b></p>
<p>118. No official data disaggregated by ethnicity exists concerning the representation of 
various groups within the criminal justice system, and the authorities have pointed out that 
there is no obligation at any stage for any individuals involved in the criminal justice 
system to identify themselves as belonging to a particular ethnic group. However, empirical 
studies indicate that Roma are overrepresented in the criminal justice system in Hungary.  
</p><p>119. Three major Roma groups exist in Hungary; the &#8220;Magyar Cigany&#8221; or Hungarian 
Roma, the Vlachs and the Beash. The Magyar Cigany constitute probably around 80 per 
cent or more of the total Roma population of Hungary. The Vlachs, originally from 
Romania, number around 100,000 and are considered culturally very different. The Beash 
are the smallest Roma community, estimated to number around 40,000 to 50,000.  
</p>
<p>120. Roma are more often subjected to police stop and search operations, which increases 
the likelihood that they will end up in the criminal justice system. It has also been pointed 
out that, because Roma are often amongst the poorest members of society, they are more 
likely to need to rely on officially appointed defence counsel, who are poorly paid and tend 
to be less active in defending their clients. 
</p>
<p>121. Due to the lack of available data disaggregated by ethnicity, information as to trends 
in convictions and sentencing patterns of Roma is not available. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>122. <b>The Working Group expresses its appreciation to the Government for its 
willingness to engage in open and frank discussions regarding its mandate and its 
concerns. It notes the positive efforts the Government has made, particularly through 
legislative reforms, to improve the situation of deprivation of liberty in Hungary.  
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>The Working Group notes that Hungary has achieved some improvements in 
political effectiveness over the past decade through reform of the judiciary and the 
civil service, and its efforts to increase the transparency of public spending and to 
limit corruption.  </b></p>

</p>
<p>124. <b>The Working Group considers that the concerns expressed about the prolonged 
periods of administrative detention of asylum seekers and immigrants in an irregular 
situation deserved to be addressed as a matter of priority. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>The Working Group invites the Hungarian authorities to review the situation 
of misdemeanour offenders in police holding facilities and the practice of holding 
remand prisoners in police establishments. 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>The Working Group notes that detainees are provided with an information 
leaflet on their rights and obligations. It calls upon the Hungarian authorities to take 
steps, including at the legislative level, to ensure that all detained persons have access 
to a lawyer as from the very outset of their deprivation of liberty. Further steps should 
be taken to ensure that all persons detained by the police are fully informed of their 
rights. Clear information about access to legal aid should be made available to 
detained foreign nationals. The regular presence of a legal advisor should be arranged 
at holding facilities for aliens. 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>Short-terms arrests of up to 12 hours without charge remain possible; the legal 
basis remains unclear and the length of police detention (up to 72 hours) has not been 
revised. There are still lapses in the system to guarantee access to legal counsel. 
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>The Working Group expresses its concern at the length of the initial pretrial 
detention phase (up to 72 hours), ongoing pretrial detention on police premises and 
the high risk of ill-treatment. 
</b></p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>The Working Group encourages the Government to continue in its efforts to 
ensure that its institutional and legal framework regarding deprivation of liberty fully 
conforms to the human rights standards enshrined in international human rights 
standards and in its legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>On the basis of its findings, the Working Group makes the following 
recommendations to the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The authorities should review the practice on short-term arrests and 
legislation on pretrial detention to ensure that these are in line with article 9 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and that the domestic regulations 
on short-term arrests are sufficiently clear and have a clear legal basis; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Access to legal counsel to all persons deprived of their liberty should be 
assured; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Asylum seekers and refugees should never be held in penal conditions. 
The State party should fully comply with the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i> and ensure 
that all persons in need of international protection receive appropriate and fair 
treatment at all stages; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Authorities should assure that decisions on expulsion, return or 
extradition are dealt with expeditiously and follow the due process of the law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Authorities should adopt specific measures to raise awareness in order to 
promote tolerance and diversity in society and ensure that judges, magistrates, 
prosecutors and all law enforcement officials are trained to be able to detect hate and 
racially motivated crimes;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Authorities should take appropriate measures to ensure that pretrial 
detention policy meets international standards, including by reducing pretrial </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention on police premises, further reducing the period of pretrial detention and 
using alternative measures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Authorities should take effective measures to ensure that the 
fundamental legal safeguards for persons detained by the police or Border Guard 
staff are respected, including access to a lawyer as well as to an independent medical 
examination or a doctor of their own choice, the right to receive information about 
their rights and their right to inform their relatives about their detention; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Detention of asylum seekers and other non-citizens should only be used 
in exceptional circumstances or as a last resort, and then only for the shortest possible 
time; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Authorities should also ensure that courts carry out a more effective 
judicial review of the detention of these groups. They should have an effective, 
independent and impartial review of decisions on expulsion, return or extradition; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) The Government should continue its efforts to alleviate the 
overcrowding of penitentiary institutions, including through the wider application and 
use of alternative sentencing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) The Government should intensify its efforts to combat discrimination 
against and ill-treatment of the Roma, persons belonging to national minorities and 
non-citizens by law enforcement officials, especially the police, including through the 
strict application of relevant legislation and regulations providing for sanctions, 
adequate training and instructions to be given to law enforcement bodies, and the 
sensitization of the judiciary;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) All necessary measures should be taken to ensure that persons below 18 
are only deprived of liberty as a last resort and that children, if detained, remain 
separated from adults and protected from any form of ill-treatment; and to 
implement alternative measures to deprivation of liberty, such as probation, 
community service and suspended sentences; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) The Government should continue to revise the criminal law to bring it 
fully in line with relevant international and regional obligations and in particular to 
ensure the protection of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) The Government should continue to be committed, via its Equal 
Treatment Authority, to implement and provide training on its policies of non-
discrimination. </b></p>
