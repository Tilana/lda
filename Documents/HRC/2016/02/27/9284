<p><b>Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
on the question of human rights in Cyprus 
</b></p>
<p><b>Note by the Secretary-General* 
</b></p>
<p> In its decision 2/102, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General 
and the High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with the fulfilment of their 
activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on 
Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies. On the current issue of the 
question of human rights in Cyprus, a comprehensive annual report (A/HRC/4/59) was 
submitted to the Council at its fourth session in March 2007. The Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) understands decision 2/102 to 
preserve the previous annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise 
decided by the Council. The present report accordingly addresses developments with 
regard to the question of human rights in Cyprus over the past year.

 The present report was submitted late in order to reflect the most recent information. 
</p>
<p>GE.08-11115 (E)</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> The report (see annex), prepared by OHCHR, is herewith transmitted to the 
Council pursuant to that decision.  It covers the period up to 20 December 2007 and 
provides an overview of human rights issues in Cyprus based on available information. 
</p>
<p> In the absence of an OHCHR field presence in Cyprus or any specific monitoring 
mechanism, OHCHR relied on a variety of sources with particular knowledge of the 
human rights situation on Cyprus for the purposes of the present report.  </p>

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>REPORT OF THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS  
HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE QUESTION OF 
</b></p>
<p><b>HUMAN RIGHTS IN CYPRUS 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  Overview 
</b></p>
<p>1. As at December 2007, Cyprus remained divided, with a buffer zone maintained 
by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). The UNFICYP 
mandate, which dates back to 1964, has been extended by successive Security Council 
resolutions. By its resolution 1789 (2007), the Council extended the mandate for a 
further period ending 15 June 2008. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>II. Human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p>2. The persisting division of Cyprus has consequences in relation to a number of 
human rights issues on the whole island, including freedom of movement, human 
trafficking activities, discrimination, property rights, human rights pertaining to the 
question of missing persons, the right to education, economic rights and freedom of 
religion.  
</p>
<p>3. With regard to freedom of movement, Cypriots on both sides continued to use the 
crossing points for various activities, including trade, religious and bicommunal events, 
without major incidents. UNFICYP has recorded approximately 14 million crossings 
since the opening of the crossing points on 23 April 2003.<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p>4.  No agreement was reached on the opening of additional crossing points. While 
both sides proposed further openings across the buffer zone, including Ledra street, 
lack of trust between the communities continued to pose a problem. Both leaders 
recently presented confidence-building proposals, which attached priority to the 
opening of Ledra street and also their respective approaches on the opening of a 
crossing in the western part of the buffer zone. 
</p>
<p>5. Restrictions on the freedom of movement persist, in particular with regard to the 
military zones in the northern part of the island. Since the previous reporting period, 
there has been no positive change with regard to increased access to a number of 
villages located in these zones, including the Maronite villages of Ayia Marina and 
Asomatos. 
</p>
<p>6.  In general, there has been a greater appreciation for the work of bicommunal 
groups to promote collaboration between the two sides and for the bicommunal 
contacts made by civil society organizations. The institutional environment in the 
Republic of Cyprus, however, continues to pose constraints on the functioning of these 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b> The figure does not include crossings in Pergamos since 1 September 2006, when the Turkish Cypriot side 
</p>
<p>discontinued sharing statistics on the movement of people at that crossing.   </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>organizations, which has had particularly negative consequences for advocacy and 
human rights groups. Examples include administrative delays in processing 
applications for the registration of non-governmental organizations and in effecting 
modifications to their status, and a lack of clear criteria for obtaining charitable or tax 
status. It is encouraging that the Government of the Republic of Cyprus is reviewing 
the situation to ensure that the rights and responsibilities of civil society organizations 
are better defined and understood in Cyprus. Meanwhile, consultations are understood 
to be ongoing in the Turkish Cypriot community to promote a more enabling 
environment for Turkish Cypriot non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>7.  No further progress was reported in bringing the two sides together on issues 
related to law enforcement.<b> </b>Although encouraged by reports concerning the arrest of 
persons involved in human trafficking, the Secretary-General has called for greater 
cooperation between the two sides on this matter.<b>2</b>  
</p>
<p>8.  The Turkish Cypriot community in Limassol continues to make complaints of 
discrimination principally related to the lack of social services and adequate housing 
and the difficulty in obtaining identity documents. The Municipality of Limassol has 
opened a bicommunal social centre to address some of these concerns. Although there 
have been some notable improvements in the availability of official documents and 
forms of the Republic of Cyprus in the Turkish language, the majority remain in Greek 
only.<b>3</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>9.  Property continues to be an extremely sensitive issue on both sides, increasingly 
characterized by cases of litigations, with the situation in Varosha<b> </b>remaining 
unchanged. Hundreds of Greek Cypriot claims against Turkey for loss of property 
rights in the north are still pending before the European Court of Human Rights. The 
Court has in several cases concluded a continuing violation of property rights of 
displaced persons, stating that these persons have remained legal owners in the north. 
The pilot case dealing with this issue, <i>Xenides-Arestis</i>, became final on 23 May 2007, 
when the appeal by both parties to take the case to the Grand Chamber was refused by 
the Court. Noting with concern the reticence of the Turkish authorities to pay the 
amount awarded in respect of pecuniary damage, the Committee of Ministers of the 
Council of Europe once again stressed that, in any event, and without prejudice to 
further clarifications, the amounts awarded by the court were due.<b>4</b> In an earlier 
meeting, noting the information provided by the Turkish authorities on the functioning

</b> Examples of documents available in Turkish include the oath of citizenship in the Republic of Cyprus, which one 
</p>
<p>must make in order to receive an identity card and the official form for the adoption of children. Also, both the 
Koran and the Bible are now on hand in all district courts in the Republic of Cyprus.

</p>
<p>2007. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the Immovable Property Commission established in the north of Cyprus, the 
Committee asked to be kept informed on this subject.<b>5</b> 
10.  In the case of <i>Loizidou v. Turkey </i>(1996), in which the European Court of Human 
Rights found that Ms. Loizidou had been continuously denied access to her property 
situated in the north of Cyprus and consequently lost control thereof, the Committee of 
Ministers welcomed the fact that an offer had been made to the applicant by the 
Turkish authorities concerning the property in question. Taking note of the response by 
the applicant on the merits of that offer, the Turkish authorities were invited to respond 
without undue delay and to keep the Committee informed of any developments in this 
context.<b>4</b>  On the issue of the enclaved persons, and in the context of the <i>Cyprus v. 
Turkey</i> (2001) case, the Committee of Ministers noted at their 1007th meeting (October 
2007) that an unjustified interference in the property rights of these persons still 
subsisted. Taking note of information subsequently provided by the Turkish authorities, 
the Committee remarked that several issues relating to the regulation of these property 
rights and available remedies needed to be clarified, inviting the Turkish authorities to 
provide further information on these issues.<b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>11. In the case of <i>Orams-Apostolides,</i> upon examining the appeal lodged by Mr. 
Meletis Apostolides against the judgement of the High Court dated 6 September 2006, 
which held that the judgement of the District Court of Nicosia could not be enforced in 
England, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales decided, on 13 September 2007, 
to refer a number of questions to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary 
ruling.  
</p>
<p>12. Considering the need to ensure respect of ownership rights, also in cases where 
properties remain unoccupied, reports regarding the ongoing demolition of Greek 
Cypriot houses in the Karpas, including residences of those who had indicated their 
desire to return permanently, are alarming.<b>6</b> In his report of 4 June 2007, the Secretary-
General noted that the trend towards increased construction on the Turkish Cypriot side 
continues to be a cause for concern, as it may complicate efforts towards a 
comprehensive settlement (S/2007/328, para. 28).  
</p>
<p>13.  Concerning Turkish Cypriot property south of the buffer zone, the applicable 
law continues to stipulate that Turkish Cypriots are obliged to reside for six months in 
the south prior to reclaiming any abandoned property, either by return or 
compensation. Concerns continue to be received in respect of restrictions imposed on 
Greek Cypriots by the Turkish Cypriot side in bequeathing their property to their heirs. <b>  
</b></p>
<p>14.  The Committee on Missing Persons continued to work on its project on the 
exhumation and identification of the remains of missing persons, which it considers an 
integral part of the investigation process. It will resume further investigations into the

 <p> 
</p>
<p>fate of the missing persons as soon as it is in a position to do so. In its resolution 1758 
(2007), reiterating its call to the parties to assess and address the humanitarian issue of 
missing persons with due urgency and seriousness, the Security Council welcomed the 
progress and continuation of the important activities of the Committee on Missing 
Persons.  
</p>
<p>15.  As at December 2007, the remains of over 350 individuals had been exhumed 
from sites on both sides of the buffer zone. Over 250 remains have undergone 
examination at the Committee&#8217;s bicommunal anthropological laboratory in the United 
Nations Protected Area in Nicosia. During July and August, following genetic analysis, 
the first sets of identifications were concluded. As a result, 57 families received the 
remains of their missing relatives (S/2007/699, para. 35).  
</p>
<p>16.  In relation to <i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i>, the Committee of Ministers noted with 
satisfaction the progress achieved by the Committee on Missing Persons, and, in 
particular, the first returns to the families of the remains of their relatives. It has also 
invited the Turkish authorities to provide additional information on certain data which 
the families can obtain when the remains of their relatives are returned. The Committee 
reiterated, however, its repeated invitation to the Turkish authorities to provide 
information on the additional measures required to ensure the effective investigations 
needed for the full execution of the Court&#8217;s judgement.<b>7</b>  <b> 
</b>17.  In relation to the right to education of Greek Cypriots living in the north, the 
Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe welcomed the continued functioning 
of the secondary school in Rizokarpasso, as well as the fact that, since September 2005, 
full secondary education for Greek Cypriot children is ensured. The Committee also 
noted that censorship of schoolbooks no longer takes place, having been replaced by a 
simple screening procedure which only results in a report containing 
recommendations.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>18.  Regarding the revision of history books, and in the context of Council of Europe 
recommendation (2001) 15 on history teaching in twenty first-century Europe, history 
books of the Republic of Cyprus have yet to be revised in accordance with the 
principles therein. In February 2007, the Minister for Education of the Republic of 
Cyprus decided to appoint a committee to revise history books on Cyprus used in the 
Greek Cypriot educational system, a process still to be completed. Significant changes 
were reported to have been made to Turkish Cypriot schoolbooks, on the whole

</b> Interim resolution CM/ResDH (2007) 25 concerning the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights of 10 
</p>
<p>May 2001 on the case of Cyprus against Turkey. In that interim resolution, it is decided to close the examination of 
the issues relating to the violations found under Article 2 Protocol 1 and Article 10 of the European Convention on 
Human Rights.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>representing a positive move away from the old model, though some general 
weaknesses remained.<b>9</b>  
</p>
<p>19.  Despite being regarded as citizens of the European Union and therefore in 
principle entitled to participate in European Union exchange and educational 
programmes, Turkish Cypriot students continue to be confronted with lack of access to 
these programmes owing to the non-recognition by the Republic of Cyprus of the 
universities in the north. While the participation of a very small number of Turkish 
Cypriots in the European Union Youth Programme has been facilitated by the Cypriot 
National Youth Agency, this is not the case for the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci 
programmes. The European Commission has yet to receive a final reply from the 
Government of the Republic of Cyprus on the issue of eligibility of Turkish Cypriots to 
take part in the Erasmus programme, and has on several occasions unsuccessfully 
urged the Government to take on a more flexible approach to the issue of participation 
of Turkish Cypriots in this programme.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>20.  Although full membership by northern Cyprus of the Bologna Process was 
rejected at the ministerial summit on the Bologna Process in May 2007, the creation of 
a European higher education area by 2010 implies that diplomas or studies from the 
north may nevertheless be considered in the future. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>21.  A Turkish-language primary school in Limassol is still not operational. The 
formal proceedings of a lawsuit filed by the Cyprus Turkish Teachers Trade Union at 
the Supreme Court of the Republic of Cyprus to guarantee the right of Turkish Cypriots 
to an education in their mother tongue are ongoing. The latest hearing, on 6 December 
2007, was adjourned to 31 January 2008. In the meantime, over 60 Turkish-speaking 
children in Limassol attend the existing Greek Cypriot school, which provides Turkish-
language instruction (S/2007/699, para. 26). <b> 
</b></p>
<p>22.  With regard to freedom of movement and worship, UNFICYP continued to 
facilitate religious and commemorative events in the buffer zone on both sides of the 
island.<b>11</b> A second priest has been installed in the Karpas region in the north, which has 
been a standing demand of the Greek Cypriot community in the Karpas region for 
several years. He was sent by the Greek Cypriot Orthodox Church and permission was 
granted by the Turkish Cypriot authorities.  
</p>
<p>

History teaching in 21st century Europe</i> adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 31 October 2001.

<p><b>10
</b> The European Union Youth programme consists of youth exchanges, European Voluntary service and 
</p>
<p>accompanying measures. Both part of the European Union Lifelong Learning Programme, the Leonardo da Vinci 
programme focuses on the teaching and training needs of those involved in vocational education and training, whilst 
the Erasmus programme supports the academic mobility of higher education students and teachers.

<p>S/2007/699, para. 31). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>23.  Difficulties persist in finding an agreement on issues involving religious sites and 
buildings. Following a meeting on 21 February 2007 between H.E. Chrysostomos II, 
Archbishop of Nova Justina and All Cyprus and Ahmet Y&#246;nl&#252;er, the head of religious 
affairs in the north, where mutual commitment was expressed to take practical steps to 
promote respect and efforts towards restoration of sites of religious significance of the 
other community, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General engaged with the 
two sides to establish lists of sites of religious significance to the other community 
which were in need of restoration and repair. Regrettably, the Secretary-General noted 
that those efforts had failed to yield concrete results (S/2007/699, para.30).  </p>
<p>24.  In southern Nicosia Central Prison, Turkish Cypriot prisoners alleged to have 
been subject to collective punishment following the attempted breakout of two Turkish 
Cypriot prisoners in May 2007. Pending an independent investigation by the Cyprus 
Police, all Turkish Cypriot prisoners in the open prison regime were transferred back to 
the higher security regime on the grounds of potential involvement in the attempted 
escape. Three out of five prisoners have since been returned to the open prison regime.  
</p>
<p>25. In the area of economic rights, a positive development was the start of the 
implementation of the European Council regulation of February 2006, establishing an 
instrument of financial support for encouraging economic development in the northern 
part of the island, where overall economic opportunities remain comparatively limited. 
Its implementation, however, has faced challenges owing to the difficulty in ensuring 
cooperation between the two communities.<b>12</b>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p><b>26. The persisting de facto partition of the island of Cyprus continues to constitute 
an obstacle to the enjoyment of human rights. The situation of human rights in 
Cyprus would therefore greatly benefit from the achievement of a comprehensive 
settlement of the Cyprus problem.
