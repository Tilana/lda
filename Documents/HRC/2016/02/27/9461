<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 2/102, 
covers developments concerning minorities and activities undertaken by the United Nations 
and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in the light of Commission 
resolution 2005/79 in which the Commission requested the Secretary-General to review the 
performance and effectiveness of the independent expert on minority issues and the Working 
Group on Minorities after two years and to report to the Commission on the matter.

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  This document is submitted late so as to include the most up-to-date information possible. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251, all mandates, mechanisms, functions 
and responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights were assumed as of 19 June 2006 by 
the Human Rights Council.  In accordance with the same resolution, the Council is in the process 
of reviewing all mandates and mechanisms.  The present report is submitted in accordance with 
that resolution and Council decision 2/102 and pursuant to Commission resolution 2005/79 in 
which the Commission requested the Secretary-General to review the performance and 
effectiveness of the independent expert on minority issues and the Working Group on Minorities 
after two years and to report to the Commission on the matter (para. 14). 
</p>
<p>2. The report covers developments concerning minorities and activities undertaken by the 
United Nations, with a particular focus on the work of the two mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>3. With respect to recent developments, the 2005 World Summit Outcome reaffirmed the 
importance of minority rights&#8217; protection and promotion to the work of the United Nations, 
stating that &#8220;the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or 
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities contribute to political and social stability and peace and 
enrich the cultural diversity and heritage of society&#8221; (para. 130).  This reiterates global positions 
enunciated in previous statements of global commitment.  For example, States resolved in the 
Millennium Declaration &#8220;[t]o strengthen the capacity of all our countries to implement the 
principles and practices of democracy and respect for human rights, including minority rights&#8221; 
(para. 25).  The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action of the World Conference against 
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance &#8220;[u]rges States to protect 
the national or ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic identity of minorities within their 
respective territories and to develop appropriate legislative and other measures to encourage 
conditions for the promotion of that identity, in order to protect them from any form of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  In this context, forms of multiple 
discrimination should be fully taken into account;&#8221; (Programme of Action, para. 172). 
</p>
<p>4. Calls for the promotion of intra- and inter-ethnic, religious and community dialogue 
and the sharing of experiences to meet the challenges to the integration of diversity and 
counter exclusive ideologies and extremism have also moved higher on the international 
agenda, following the reference in paragraph 144 of the World Summit Outcome to the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s Alliance of Civilizations initiative and the release of the report of the 
High-level Group under the initiative.  The report notes in its paragraph 6.22 that &#8220;[e]stablishing 
coherent integration strategies requires regular dialogue among representatives of government 
and immigrant communities, civil society representatives, religious organizations and employers, 
engaging at local, regional, national and international levels.  While informal and ad hoc engagement is valuable, institutional structures that support dialogue on a regular ongoing basis 
can ensure the efficacy of such approaches in promoting greater integration.  Such efforts help 
achieve a balance between the demands of integration and the need to maintain one&#8217;s cultural 
and religious identity&#8221; (see www.unaoc.org).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>5. As Member States have recognized at the 2005 World Summit and other recent forums, 
the inclusion and full participation of minorities and other disadvantaged and marginalized 
groups in local, national and international affairs is of direct importance to global efforts to 
address the challenges of development and peace and security.  The efforts of Member States </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and of the mechanisms of the Council in this regard are essential contributions to the integration 
of minority concerns into the work of the Organization to reduce poverty, establish stable and 
socially inclusive societies and address systematic and long-standing discrimination against 
specific minority communities. 
</p>
<p>6. The present report outlines some of the principal interventions undertaken under the aegis 
of OHCHR aimed at strengthening the promotion and protection of the rights of persons 
belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities.  These include efforts to 
promote dialogue and mutual understanding on thematic issues and to support through 
capacity-building States that request such assistance. 
</p>
<p><b>II. INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF 
STANDARDS AND MECHANISMS </b></p>
<p><b>A. The international framework of standards 
</b></p>
<p>7. Although the 1992 Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, 
Religious and Linguistic Minorities (the Minorities Declaration) is the only United Nations 
instrument addressing exclusively the rights of persons belonging to minorities, minority rights 
are recognized in several core international human rights instruments.  Particular reference can 
be made to the provisions of articles 21 and 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
relating to, inter alia, participation in public and political life and participation in cultural life, 
respectively, which are not the subject of separate mandates under the Human Rights Council.  
Provisions of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also 
provide protection for persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p>8. The Minorities Declaration lays down a number of purposes and principles as well as the 
rights of claim holders and the responsibilities of duty bearers.  The purposes of the Declaration 
are to recognize plural identities and promote inclusive and stable societies.  It reaffirms the 
rights of persons belonging to minorities to enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms in 
accordance with the principles of non-discrimination and equality before the law.  Three 
additional pillars or principles contained in the Declaration relate to protection of existence, 
promotion and protection of identity, and the right to effective participation.  Several of the 
Declaration&#8217;s provisions reaffirm and emphasize the right to effective participation of persons 
belonging to minorities and the duty of States to ensure the effective participation of minorities 
in decisions affecting them. 
</p>
<p>9.<b> </b>The United Nations has met the challenge of setting out the rights of persons belonging to 
minorities.  States Members of the United Nations have enshrined special protections and rights 
for persons belonging to minorities in international and domestic law.  Thus, the Commission, 
whose mandates are now under the purview of the Council, focused attention on efforts to raise 
further awareness and promote implementation of those rights and on the establishment of 
mechanisms for promoting and protecting those rights, including through the work of the 
Working Group on Minorities and the independent expert on minority issues. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Charter-based mechanisms dealing with minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Working Group on Minorities was established in 1995 pursuant to Economic and 
Social Council resolution 1995/31 with a threefold mandate:  to review the promotion and 
practical realization of the Declaration; to examine possible solutions to problems involving 
minorities, including the promotion of mutual understanding between and among minorities and 
Governments; and to recommend further measures, as appropriate, for the promotion and 
protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p>11. The Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/79, commended the role of the 
Working Group on Minorities as a forum for dialogue with non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) and affirmed the importance of retaining such a forum on this thematic issue for 
examining solutions to problems involving minorities.  It amended the mandate of the Working 
Group and decided that at its annual sessions it should focus its work on interactive dialogue 
with NGOs and on conceptual support to and dialogue with the independent expert (para. 9). 
</p>
<p>12. In accordance with the same resolution, the mandate of the independent expert on 
minority issues was established for two years with the mandate (a) to promote the 
implementation of the Minorities Declaration; (b) to identify best practices and possibilities for 
technical cooperation by OHCHR at the request of Governments; (c) to apply a gender 
perspective in his/her work; (d) to cooperate closely with relevant United Nations bodies, 
mandates and mechanisms as well as regional organizations; and (e) to take into account the 
views of NGOs on matters pertaining to the mandate.  The independent expert was requested to 
submit annual reports including recommendations for effective strategies for the better 
implementation of minority rights.  On 29 July 2005, the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
appointed Gay McDougall (United States of America) as independent expert on minority issues. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Working Group on Minorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>Promotion of dialogue and mutual understanding 
</b></p>
<p>13. One of the challenges faced by the United Nations is to provide a space for 
representatives of civil society from all parts of the world to speak in international forums, to 
raise issues with experts and have direct contact with government representatives. 
</p>
<p>14. The Working Group on Minorities has provided an annual venue for examining possible 
solutions to problems involving minorities, including for the promotion of mutual understanding 
between and among minorities and Governments.  It offers the only space within the 
United Nations for minority representatives to engage directly in a dialogue and consultation 
with Governments on these matters in an international setting.  Participation in the meetings of 
the Working Group is open to minority representation at the community and grass-roots levels 
and, unlike some other forums, there is no requirement that only representatives of international 
NGOs may speak at these meetings. 
</p>
<p>15. Minority representatives, in their assessments of the impact of their participation in the 
Working Group, have stated that it has led to improved dialogue with the authorities in their</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>country, led to their being taken more seriously, helped them establish links with other minority 
NGOs, helped with their advocacy work domestically and increased their own confidence in 
non-violent channels to express their grievances. 
</p>
<p><b>Thematic advice 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Working Group on Minorities, with its broad five-member composition representing 
the different regions of the world, has contributed to a better understanding of the variety of 
minority situations globally and given added recognition to activities on minority issues. 
</p>
<p>17. The implementation of the rights contained in the Minorities Declaration has highlighted 
the need not only to understand and redress inequality but also to accommodate difference and 
diversity.  Best and good practices for managing diversity and supporting the integration of 
minorities in the life of the country in which they live have been the focus of papers prepared or 
solicited by OHCHR or submitted by minority experts to the Working Group.  (Papers prepared 
for the Working Group are available on the OHCHR website.)  Such efforts have aimed at 
achieving a balance between the demands of integration and the need to respect different 
cultural, religious and linguistic identities. 
</p>
<p>18. Expert papers on thematic minority issues considered at the Working Group have placed 
particular emphasis on measures to develop intercultural education, mainstream minority rights 
in programmes and strategies to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and facilitate the 
participation of minorities in public life.  Thus, consideration has been given to lessons learned 
and practical policy measures aimed at achieving the effective participation of minority 
representatives through the establishment of advisory and consultative bodies on issues of 
particular concern to minorities, cultural and regional forms of autonomy, as well as affirmative 
action measures to support access to public services and public office. 
</p>
<p>19. Minority representatives have raised in the Working Group concerns about their 
treatment by police and security forces and about discrimination in the criminal justice system, 
and have discussed the importance of greater integration of members of minorities in the 
agencies responsible for law and order and criminal justice.  With a view to offering guidance for 
technical assistance, and pursuant to paragraph 74 (a) of the Durban Programme of Action, 
which &#8220;[u]rges States and invites non-governmental organizations and the private sector &#8230; [t]o 
create and implement policies that promote a high-quality and diverse police force free from 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and recruit actively all groups, 
including minorities, into public employment, including the police force and other agencies 
within the criminal justice system (such as prosecutors)&#8221;, OHCHR commissioned a paper for 
discussion with Governments and other partners on &#8220;integration with diversity in policing, 
security and criminal justice&#8221;.  The paper (E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2006/WP.1), submitted to the 
Working Group at its twelfth session, aims to provide practical guidance and examples of good 
practices to assist Governments, United Nations officials, NGOs and others in ensuring that 
agencies of the criminal justice system and law enforcement agencies are representative of, 
responsive to and accountable to the community as a whole. 
</p>
<p>20. Tools for better understanding the provisions and principles contained in the Minorities 
Declaration and related human rights standards have been prepared, submitted or considered 
under the aegis of the Working Group on Minorities.  Particular mention should be made </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the commentary of the Working Group on Minorities on the Minorities Declaration 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2005/2) and the Profile and Matrix on the Human Rights Situation of 
Persons Belonging to Minorities (hereafter the Minority Profile and Matrix).  The Minority 
Profile and Matrix (E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.5/2006/3) is an outcome of the OHCHR Minority 
Fellowship Programme and arose from the need identified by the Minority Fellows to better 
understand the content and scope of the Minorities Declaration, the commentary on the 
Declaration and other international standards and jurisprudence relating to minorities. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Independent expert on minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>21. The new mandate of independent expert is giving added visibility to minority issues.  The 
mandate has drawn on the conceptual groundwork undertaken by the Working Group on 
Minorities, by reaffirming the need to focus on minority issues in the context of poverty 
alleviation, social inclusion and stability.  Particular attention in the independent expert&#8217;s 
forthcoming report is given to the question of the incorporation of minority concerns into 
strategies for achieving poverty reduction.  In her report, the independent expert indicates that 
minorities are often neglected or excluded from efforts to achieve the Millennium Development 
Goals and therefore urges Governments, in the contexts of country reporting on the Goals and in 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), to provide a detailed examination of the situations 
of minority groups and statistical data that help to reveal the status of minorities in relation to 
other groups. 
</p>
<p>22. As part of her work, the independent expert has also issued statements, letters and other 
appeals, including jointly with other special procedures mandate holders, where the situation of 
minorities is a matter of concern.  She has also indicated her intention to integrate minority 
concerns in citizenship issues, promote the mainstreaming of minority concerns in the work of 
the United Nations, and devote greater attention to the situation of women and children 
belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p>23. Additionally, the independent expert has visited Hungary and Ethiopia.  
Recommendations in reports on country visits may include suggestions for the provision of 
technical cooperation and advice from OHCHR.  As a special procedure of the Council, the 
independent expert has also proposed to study and, when appropriate, take initiatives on the 
specific minority situations brought to the attention of the Working Group by minority 
representatives and Governments. 
</p>
<p>24. The working methods of the independent expert are filling some of the gaps in the 
protection of minority rights identified in past reports submitted to the Commission on Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Cooperation between the Working Group on Minorities and the independent expert on 
minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 2005/79, not only commended the 
role of the Working Group, but also decided that it should provide conceptual support of, and 
dialogue with, the independent expert. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. Given the importance of strengthening cooperation between various mandates and the 
complementary aspects of their work, the Working Group on Minorities, at its twelfth session in 
2006, proposed a two-year programme of work, drawn up jointly with the independent expert, 
which would include the organization of a series of regional seminars on the application of 
integration with diversity in policing, security and criminal justice, and the preparation of three 
thematic studies:  on positive country experiences in self-government for minorities; on ways 
and means of strengthening the application of the Minorities Declaration; and on double 
discrimination against women belonging to minorities (see A/HRC/Sub.1/58/19). 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE WORK OF THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER 
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>27. OHCHR presented a Plan of Action in May 2005 (A/59/2005/Add.3, annex) setting out 
the vision for the future work of the Office, which identified non-discrimination, equality and the 
protection of specific groups such as minorities as being at the core of its mandate.  It was 
proposed that the leadership, capacity and activities of OHCHR should be enhanced in the 
sphere of equality, non-discrimination and the promotion and protection of the rights of 
marginalized groups, in particular through the mainstreaming of human rights in the work of the 
United Nations and the development of more focused and realistic country engagement strategies 
and closer partnerships with civil society.  Additionally, OHCHR services the mandates of the 
Working Group on Minorities and the independent expert on minority issues.  Further 
information is contained in the reports on the eleventh and twelfth sessions of the Working 
Group on Minorities (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/27 and A/HRC/Sub.1/58/19) and the reports of the 
independent expert on minority issues (E/CN.4/2006/74 and A/HRC/4/9 and addenda). 
</p>
<p>28. Regional or subregional meetings organized by OHCHR and the Working Group on 
Minorities have played an important role in identifying problems and areas for United Nations 
action on minority issues and situations.  Moreover, the regional consultations of human rights 
presences of OHCHR have identified efforts to combat discrimination and exclusion of 
particular groups such as minorities as a specific area requiring further action.  In August 2006 a 
needs assessment mission was undertaken to Nepal with a view to assisting the OHCHR office 
there in developing its programmes and activities for combating the social exclusion of Dalits, 
indigenous peoples, and ethnic and religious minorities, and particularly in addressing the 
situation of women belonging to these communities.  Various issues were raised including with 
respect to improving access to justice for all sectors of the population. 
</p><p>29. United Nations organizations can contribute to policies and programmes addressing the 
economic, political or social exclusion of persons belonging to minorities.  A common 
understanding and a consolidated approach across the United Nations system for promoting and 
protecting minority rights are needed to fulfil the rights contained in the Minorities Declaration.  
Reaffirmation of the central principles to minority rights, i.e. the right to existence, plural 
identities, participation and non-discrimination, is key to developing a common understanding of 
work on minority issues and meeting the challenge of integrating minority issues not only into 
human rights work, but also in the work of the United Nations on development, peace and 
security.  OHCHR currently supports training on minority issues and strengthening of thematic 
expertise so that it is better placed to give advice on non-discrimination and minority issues in 
the work of the United Nations, including in the context of staffing of country and regional 
offices. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>30. Article 9 of the Minorities Declaration is a cornerstone for pursuing the inclusion of 
minority issues into the work of members of the United Nations family, as it stipulates that &#8220;[t]he 
specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system shall contribute to the 
full realization of the rights and principles set forth in the present Declaration, within their 
respective fields&#8221;.  Efforts need to be directed towards integrating minority issues into the work 
of United Nations country teams, activities under Action 2, and the Common Country 
Assessment/United Nations Development Assistance Framework and PRSPs.  The 
United Nations development agencies, including UNDP, are well placed to influence and work 
on the multidisciplinary dimensions of minority issues and to focus on disparities and 
inequalities.  In this regard, note may be taken of the most recent consultation organized by 
UNDP in cooperation with the independent expert on minority issues and OHCHR to consider 
the question of engaging with minorities in development processes.  The conclusions and 
recommendations emanating from this meeting concerned possible steps for the future 
incorporation of minority issues into the work of UNDP on democratic governance, social 
inclusion, conflict prevention and resolution, and civil society partnerships.  As a follow-up to 
the consultation, the Democratic Governance Group within the UNDP Bureau for Development 
Policy has prioritized further work on &#8220;Minorities in Development&#8221; in its workplan for 2007. 
</p>
<p>31. OHCHR established the Minority Fellowship Programme in 2005 with a view to building 
the capacity of civil society and empowering representatives of minorities to know their rights 
and to use United Nations human rights mechanisms.  A total of 21 persons have benefited from 
the Programme since its inception:  5 in 2005, 6 in spring and, exceptionally, 10 in August 2006, 
to coincide with the twelfth session of the Working Group on Minorities.  The participants have 
come from different ethnic, religious and linguistic communities from all regions of the world:  
representatives of the community of Copts in Egypt, Palestinian Arabs in Israel, Turkmen in 
Iraq, Muslim women in Canada, Uzbeks in Kyrgyzstan, Roma in Kosovo, Bulgaria and 
Hungary, Afro-descendants in Uruguay, Dalits in India and Nepal, Kurds in the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, Khasi in India, Kachin in Myanmar, Terik in Kenya, Ogoni in Nigeria, Karamoja in 
Uganda, Wayeyi in Botswana and Anywa in Ethiopia.  Thus, the majority of participants in the 
Minority Fellowship Programme come from non-European countries. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>32.<b> The present report identifies some of the principal interventions undertaken 
under the aegis of the OHCHR that aim at strengthening the promotion and protection 
of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities.  
The report notes the efforts that are being made to promote dialogue and mutual 
understanding on thematic issues and to support capacity-building of States that request 
such assistance for the implementation of human rights, including minority rights, through 
the complementary mechanisms of the Working Group and the independent expert.  The 
Human Rights Council is mandated to serve as a forum for dialogue on thematic issues on 
all human rights and, therefore, may wish to consider how it can maintain and improve 
existing mechanisms, including a forum on minority issues offering opportunities for the 
meaningful participation of civil society and a special procedure of the Council.
