<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 
</p>
<p>27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of Italy was held at the 1st meeting on 27 
</p>
<p>October 2014. The delegation of Italy was headed by Lapo Pistelli, Deputy Minister for 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. At its 10th meeting, held on 31 October 
</p>
<p>2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Italy. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Italy: Ethiopia, Ireland and the former 
</p>
<p>Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Italy: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/ITA/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/ITA/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/ITA/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
</p>
<p>Norway, Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and 
</p>
<p>the United States of America was transmitted to Italy through the troika. The questions are 
</p>
<p>available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Lapo Pistelli, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, 
</p>
<p>introduced the national report of Italy. The delegation highlighted that the action Italy had 
</p>
<p>taken within the United Nations system and in other international and regional 
</p>
<p>organizations had been characterized in recent years by a number of initiatives on specific 
</p>
<p>issues. They had included promoting a moratorium on the death penalty, safeguarding and 
</p>
<p>protecting migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, and promoting dialogue among cultures 
</p>
<p>and religions.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation then addressed the advance questions.  
</p>
<p>7. On the issue of the participation of civil society in the preparation of the national 
</p>
<p>report, the Inter-ministerial Committee for Human Rights had held several consultative 
</p>
<p>meetings with civil society organizations and members of the Italian parliament to discuss 
</p>
<p>the contents of the national report. In particular, the implementation of recommendation 
</p>
<p>No. 92 from the first UPR cycle had been ensured by publishing the draft national report on 
</p>
<p>the Committee&#8217;s website in order to give civil society at large the opportunity to comment 
</p>
<p>on the contents. Italy had implemented 74 out of the 78 recommendations it had accepted in 
</p>
<p>the first cycle, and had implemented several recommendations that had been not accepted. 
</p>
<p>In particular, the Italian Senate had recently approved a bill introducing the crime of </p>


<p>torture, which was before the Chamber of Deputies, and in 2010, the Constitutional Court 
</p>
<p>had removed illegal immigration status from the list of aggravating circumstances.  
</p>
<p>8. As for enacting domestic legislation, following the ratification of the Rome Statute 
</p>
<p>of the International Criminal Court, the parliament had been working on legislative 
</p>
<p>measures to bring domestic legislation into line with international humanitarian law and the 
</p>
<p>Rome Statute.  
</p>
<p>9. There had been continuing engagement in a domestic process aimed at establishing 
</p>
<p>an independent national commission for the promotion and protection of human rights, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles). The parliament was 
</p>
<p>debating the best way to establish the commission and the best tool for implementation. 
</p>
<p>Since June 2014, the Inter-ministerial Committee for Human Rights had been promoting 
</p>
<p>consultation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and representatives of civil 
</p>
<p>society, and at the time of the meeting of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
</p>
<p>Review in October, was finalizing a paper containing suggestions about which model of 
</p>
<p>institution would best reflect the Paris Principles in Italy. 
</p>
<p>10. In 2013, Italy had presented &#8220;The Foundations of the Italian Action Plan on the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights&#8221; to the European Commission, and 
</p>
<p>work was under way to finalize the Italian Action Plan by the end of 2015. 
</p>
<p>11. Owing to its geographic situation, Italy had been exposed over the previous two 
</p>
<p>years to massive inflows of migrants<b> </b>and the country was at the forefront of an 
</p>
<p>extraordinary effort to save human lives at sea. The principle of non-refoulement had 
</p>
<p>always been respected, in compliance with international norms. Italy was strongly 
</p>
<p>committed to search and rescue (SAR) activities at sea, ensuring migrants were brought to 
</p>
<p>Italian territory. After the Lampedusa tragedy in 2013, it had intensified those activities by 
</p>
<p>launching the Mare Nostrum operation in October 2013 in order to deal with the 
</p>
<p>humanitarian emergency resulting from the exceptional arrival of migrants on the Central 
</p>
<p>Mediterranean route.  
</p>
<p>12. As for the registration of migrants, according to the Dublin and EURODAC 
</p>
<p>regulations of the European Union, forensic police and immigration officers were tasked 
</p>
<p>with identification procedures. In September 2014, the Ministry of the Interior had issued 
</p>
<p>guidelines to improve the efficiency of the migrant registration system. 
</p>
<p>13. After an initial period in reception centres for asylum seekers, which could last from 
</p>
<p>20 to 35 days depending on the inflow, refugees and asylum seekers were accommodated 
</p>
<p>under the asylum seekers and refugees protection system network, which was managed by 
</p>
<p>local authorities and financed through the National Fund for Asylum Policies and Services. 
</p>
<p>14. The System for the Protection of Asylum Seekers and Refugees (SPRAR) was 
</p>
<p>tasked with managing the allocation of applicants on the basis of burden-sharing among 
</p>
<p>regions, provinces and municipalities. Details were provided on measures taken for the 
</p>
<p>optimization of the reception system.  
</p>
<p>15. As for the allocation and use of the new European Asylum, Migration and 
</p>
<p>Integration Fund for 2014&#8211;2020, the national programme had been financed with &#8364;500 
</p>
<p>million, &#8364;310 million of which were funded by the European Union. Additional funding 
</p>
<p>had been provided in 2013 and 2014 to tackle the unprecedented migrant flows. 
</p>
<p>16. Since 2006, residence permits in Italy had been issued in the form of smart cards. 
</p>
<p>That system facilitated monitoring and processing applications for the first release and the 
</p>
<p>renewal of the residence permit. The delegation provided details regarding the system. </p>


<p>17. It was noted that, from 1 January to 23 October 2014, some 151,126 migrants had 
</p>
<p>arrived by sea, including 12,164 unaccompanied minors. Unaccompanied minors were 
</p>
<p>entitled to a residence permit until they reached the age of 18. Upon coming of age, they 
</p>
<p>could obtain a residence permit either for study or work reasons. Unaccompanied minors 
</p>
<p>benefited from the protection of numerous rights, including education, health care, 
</p>
<p>accommodation in a safe place, and guardianship. In addition, Italian law prohibited the 
</p>
<p>deportation of minors as a general rule. 
</p>
<p>18. The stigmatization of certain ethnic or social groups<b> </b>remained a matter of serious 
</p>
<p>concern for the central Government and local authorities and the country was strongly 
</p>
<p>committed to eradicating racist and xenophobic attitudes within society. 
</p>
<p>19. The Italian legal framework contained a wide range of criminal, civil and 
</p>
<p>administrative law provisions to combat racism. Information on those provisions was 
</p>
<p>provided. 
</p>
<p>20. Responding to the advance questions regarding anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, the 
</p>
<p>delegation noted that the Government was strongly committed to countering all forms of 
</p>
<p>religious discrimination and social prejudices. Fresh impetus had been given to 
</p>
<p>interreligious dialogue since 2012, when the Government had convened a Committee for 
</p>
<p>Interreligious Dialogue. 
</p>
<p>21. The Italian Government was also committed to gender equality and to preventing 
</p>
<p>and eliminating discrimination based directly or indirectly on sex, racial or ethnic origin, 
</p>
<p>religion or belief, age or gender identity.  
</p>
<p>22. Regarding the practice of having workers sign an undated letter of resignation at the 
</p>
<p>time of hiring for future use by the employer (so-called &#8220;blank resignations&#8221;), in 
compliance with Act No. 92/2012, the resignations became effective only after a procedure 
</p>
<p>involving multiple stages with local job centres, trade unions and the Ministry of Labour, 
</p>
<p>among others. Fines in cases of violation had been increased, in addition to criminal 
</p>
<p>proceedings. 
</p>
<p>23. Concerning the promotion of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
</p>
<p>(LGBT) persons, the LGBT National Strategy 2013&#8211;2015 had been adopted. The four main 
</p>
<p>areas of intervention were education and training; employment; security and prisons; media 
</p>
<p>and communication. Each area included goals to promote equality and combat 
</p>
<p>discrimination against LGBT persons.  
</p>
<p>24. Roma, Sinti and Caminanti communities had been living in Italy for a long time. 
</p>
<p>With regard to their integration, the National Strategy for the Inclusion of Roma, Sinti and 
</p>
<p>Caminanti Communities 2012&#8211;2020 had been adopted, in accordance with communication 
</p>
<p>No. 173/2011 of the European Commission. 
</p>
<p>25. No constitutional reforms would affect Slovenian-speaking communities living in 
</p>
<p>Friuli Venezia Giulia. As pointed out in the national report, several measures had been 
</p>
<p>implemented since the enactment of Act No. 38/2001 including the use of minority 
</p>
<p>languages in joint bodies and in public administration. 
</p>
<p>26. A bill was under discussion in the Italian parliament to amend the Criminal Code 
</p>
<p>and the Code of Criminal Procedure and to revise the legal definition of defamation,<b> 
</b></p>
<p>including defamation through the press and any other means of publicity, insult and libel, 
</p>
<p>and related sanctions, excluding any reference to detention. 
</p>
<p>27. The 17,309 proceedings pending at the European Court of Human Rights<b> </b>mainly 
</p>
<p>concerned the length of trials and the delays in the payment of compensation. Italy had 
</p>
<p>agreed with the European Court on a two-year action plan for the final settlement of about 
</p>
<p>7,000 complaints regarding compensation. A similar solution was expected for the </p>


<p>remaining 3,000 applications regarding excessively long proceedings, which had not been 
</p>
<p>included in the action plan as they had been filed after the plan had been established. 
</p>
<p>28. Approximately 3,500 more complaints concerning prison conditions had been filed 
</p>
<p>by prison inmates. Following the pilot decisions in the cases of <i>Stella v. Italy</i> and <i>Rexhepi v. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Italy</i> in 2014, it could be expected that the European Court would invite prison inmates to 
</p>
<p>apply to the domestic courts as the decisions clearly stated that the new domestic remedies 
</p>
<p>available to detainees were fully in line with the European Convention on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>29. The national action plan against trafficking in human beings, provided for under 
</p>
<p>Legislative Decree No. 24/14, would be adopted by the Council of Ministers by the end of 
</p>
<p>2014, together with the single programme for the assistance and social integration of 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>30. In order to reduce prison overcrowding, Italy had adopted several measures, and had 
</p>
<p>in particular extended recourse to house arrest as an alternative to imprisonment. Following 
</p>
<p>the ratification in 2012 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OP-
</p>
<p>CAT), recent legislation had provided for the establishment by the Ministry of Justice of a 
</p>
<p>national authority for the rights of detainees. 
</p>
<p>31. In Italy, national interventions in the area of social assistance were mainly addressed 
</p>
<p>to people who were not in the labour market, in particular elderly people and persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. In 2008, a &#8220;social card&#8221; had been introduced to provide additional assistance to 
</p>
<p>some sectors of society. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>32. During the interactive dialogue, 92 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>33. Chad welcomed the efforts Italy had made to implement the recommendations

</p>
<p>Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. 
</p>
<p>44. Egypt expressed confidence that the increasing efforts of Italy in sea rescue 
</p>
<p>operations and its migration management agreements with neighbouring countries, 
</p>
<p>including Egypt, would effectively address existing challenges. 
</p>
<p>45. Eritrea noted with appreciation the commitment of Italy to discharging its national 
</p>
<p>and international obligations, its efforts to promote and protect human rights and its strong 
</p>
<p>support for the universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>46. Estonia noted the ratification of OP-CAT, the establishment of an acting children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>ombudsman, and rescue efforts to address the exceptional arrival of irregular migrants. 
</p>
<p>47. Ethiopia welcomed ongoing efforts to combat trafficking and discrimination,  
</p>
<p>support female entrepreneurs and persons with disabilities, and promote minority 
</p>
<p>languages. 
</p>
<p>48. Finland commended the adoption of the National Strategy for the Inclusion of 
</p>
<p>Roma, Sinti and Travellers Communities in Italy 2012&#8211;2020 and asked how it would be 
</p>
<p>implemented. 
</p>
<p>49. Greece welcomed positive developments in human rights, including the

</p>
<p>68. Libya commended the ratification of OP-CAT, the adoption of the National Action

</p>
<p>rights and the National Action Plan against Racism, Xenophobia and Intolerance.

<p>72. Mauritania welcomed the measures taken to respect the rights of migrants and to 
</p>
<p>combat racial discrimination. However, greater efforts were required to address the 
</p>
<p>remaining challenges. 
</p>
<p>73. Mexico noted measures addressing discrimination, gender-based violence and the 
</p>
<p>integration of minorities, which should result in fewer children from those communities 
</p>
<p>living on the street. 
</p>
<p>74. Montenegro commended the ratification of OP-CAT and the establishment of the

</p>
<p>addressed. 
</p>
<p>75. The delegation responded to the questions on cooperation and foreign aid, the Mare 
</p>
<p>Nostrum operation, migration, the ratification of several international instruments and the 
</p>
<p>Slovenian-speaking minority. 
</p>
<p>76. The title of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation had 
</p>
<p>changed because of a reform that had been passed in 2014, after 27 years. One of the main 
</p>
<p>tasks of the Ministry was to try to increase Italian ODA. Some progress had been achieved; 
</p>
<p>for the third year in a row, Italy had increased the budget allocated to cooperation and 
</p>
<p>foreign aid by 10 per cent. 
</p>
<p>77. Italy was facing an extraordinary burden vis-&#224;-vis the central Mediterranean route 
</p>
<p>and the number of migrants that were arriving, which was linked to a historical 
</p>
<p>phenomenon. According to data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 
</p>
<p>while 3 per cent of the global population was made up of migrants, 90 per cent of that 
</p>
<p>movement was intra-continental. The issue was not only an Italian matter, it was a 
</p>
<p>European issue. The long-term scenario that Europe had to face vis-&#224;-vis migration would 
</p>
<p>need to take into account that in 1950, the European population had been double that of the 
</p>
<p>African population and that, according to the average forecast of United Nations 
</p>
<p>demographics, in 2050, two generations&#8217; time, the population of Africa would be three 
</p>
<p>times that of Europe. 
</p>
<p>78. Migration had to be managed and migrants&#8217; conditions improved, but that could not 
</p>
<p>be reduced solely to an issue of border control or border management. Efforts made would 
</p>
<p>need to be combined with international development and foreign aid and a model for the 
</p>
<p>future of Africa. A new conversation about the post-2015 development agenda should be 
</p>
<p>able to provide a common grammar to deal with that issue, which would be one of the 
</p>
<p>legacies of the Italian presidency of the Council of the European Union. 
</p>
<p>79. When referring to migrants, many delegations were talking about migrants and 
</p>
<p>potentially, asylum seekers. Formerly, 80 per cent of the people coming from African or 
</p>
<p>Asian countries had been seeking a better future in Europe. In 2013/2014, almost 75 per 
</p>
<p>cent of those arriving were coming from countries at war, countries in post-conflict 
</p>
<p>situations and fragile countries. The issue of migration could not be considered as a stand-
</p>
<p>alone issue and should encompass the broader picture that linked migrants, asylum seekers, 
</p>
<p>political fragility and instability and the crises that were taking place in 2014. Italy was not, 
</p>
<p>politically or geopolitically, in a position to deal with that. 
</p>
<p>80. Previously, the process for the ratification of international instruments had been 
</p>
<p>somewhat protracted. However, the Government now intended to ratify many pending 
</p>
<p>instruments quickly. Indeed, the ratification process of a number of pending treaties was 
</p>
<p>already under way. The ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR) had been completed and the 
</p>
<p>ratification instrument would be deposited in the near future. Additionally, the ratification 
</p>
<p>process of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a 
</p>
<p>communications procedure had been initiated. Despite the fact that Italy had not ratified the </p>


<p>International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
</p>
<p>Members of Their Families (ICRMW), the Italian legislative framework already guaranteed 
</p>
<p>the rights of regular and irregular migrants. Moreover, Italy was committed to promoting a 
</p>
<p>debate at the European level on that topic. 
</p>
<p>81. Italy was committed to combating racism and working for successful interaction 
</p>
<p>among cultures, traditions and beliefs. At the national level, the country would continue to 
</p>
<p>make all efforts to ensure that the global challenges posed by racism were met in the most 
</p>
<p>appropriate ways. 
</p>
<p>82. Some 31 per cent of the Members of Parliament were women. Furthermore, a recent 
</p>
<p>law had paved the way for an increase in female representation on boards of publicly listed 
</p>
<p>and State-owned companies. 
</p>
<p>83. The Government was strongly committed to countering all forms of religious 
</p>
<p>discrimination.

</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>recommendations from the first cycle that it had not been able to implement by the second

</p>
<p>with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>89. Norway commended Italy for its efforts to save migrants at sea. However, it noted

</p>
