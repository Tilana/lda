LONDON—August 3, 2016—Transocean Partners LLC (NYSE: RIGP) today reported net
income attributable to controlling interest for the three months ended June 30, 2016, of $36
million, or $0.52 per unit.
For the three months ended June 30, 2015, the company reported net income attributable to
controlling interest of $35 million, or $0.51 per unit.
Distributable cash flow attributable to controlling interest was $36 million, compared with $34
million in the first quarter of 2016. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, a quarterly
distribution of $0.3625 per unit, or approximately $25 million based upon the number of currently
outstanding units, has been declared.
Revenues increased $11 million sequentially to $155 million due primarily to higher revenue
efficiency on the Discoverer Clear Leader and the Discoverer Inspiration.
Operating and maintenance expense decreased $2 million sequentially to $53 million due
largely to the expiration of the non-cash patent royalty expense that was scheduled to expire
during the quarter. This decrease was partially offset by higher overhead costs.
General and administrative expense was $7 million, compared to $6 million in the prior quarter.
The company’s Effective Tax Rate (4) was 5.7 percent, compared to 5.8 percent in the first
quarter of 2016. The Annual Effective Tax Rate was 5.4 percent, unchanged from the previous
quarter.
Earnings Conference Call Cancelled
The second quarter 2016 earnings conference call previously scheduled for Thursday, August, 4,
2016, was cancelled following the August 1, 2016 announcement of the merger agreement with
Transocean.
