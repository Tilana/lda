<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>Following an official country visit to Belize, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges 
</p>
<p>the positive steps taken by the Government to combat trafficking in persons, as reflected by 
</p>
<p>the ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
</p>
<p>Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Transnational Organized Crime, alongside other relevant international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the enactment of new and improved 
</p>
<p>domestic legislation on trafficking in persons, as well as the establishment by law of the 
</p>
<p>Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council. 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur raises a number of concerns, including: the 
</p>
<p>absence of comprehensive identification protocols, coupled with important capacity gaps; 
</p>
<p>the absence of reliable statistical data and assessment of the phenomenon at the national 
</p>
<p>level; and the rampant and indiscriminate criminalization of irregular migrants, leading to 
</p>
<p>the detention and deportation of potential victims. She further expresses concern that a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive victim protection and assistance programme has still to become 
</p>
<p>institutionalized. 
</p>
<p>She makes various recommendations to the Government in order to enhance its 
</p>
<p>capacity to address trafficking in persons in Belize and provide adequate support to the 
</p>
<p>victims.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p>conducted an official visit to Belize from 12 to 16 December 2013, at the invitation of the 
</p>
<p>Government. 
</p>
<p>2. During the visit, which took her to Belize City and Belmopan, she met with various 
</p>
<p>officials including from the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office, the Special Envoy for Women and 
</p>
<p>Children, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chief Justice, the Ministry of National 
</p>
<p>Security, the Belize Police Department, the Ministry of Human Development, Social 
</p>
<p>Transformation and Poverty Alleviation, the Ministry of Labour, Local Government, Rural 
</p>
<p>Development, National Emergency Management, Immigration and Nationality as well as 
</p>
<p>the Ministries of Health, Education and Tourism. She held meetings with the Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>and the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council as well as civil society organizations and 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking, including potential victims,  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses her sincere gratitude to the Government for its 
</p>
<p>support before and during the mission, as well as for welcoming her as the first United 
</p>
<p>Nations special rapporteur to visit the country. She hopes that the visit will pave the road 
</p>
<p>for further engagement with other special procedures mandate holders, as well as with the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. She also thanks the 
</p>
<p>United Nations country team as well as civil society partners for the support provided 
</p>
<p>during the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons  
</b></p>
<p>4. Belize is a destination and transit country for victims of trafficking, mainly from 
</p>
<p>Central America, but also from Asia, as well as a source country. The strategic geographic 
</p>
<p>location of Belize and its permeable borders, linking Central America to North America, 
</p>
<p>make it a transit route for migrants en route to the United States of America, creating an 
</p>
<p>environment prone to a migratory flux including trafficking in persons for sexual and 
</p>
<p>labour exploitation.  
</p>
<p>5. Trafficking in persons in Belize disproportionately affects women, who are mainly 
</p>
<p>trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation; particularly women and girl children from 
</p>
<p>the neighbouring countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras who are forced into 
</p>
<p>dancing and offering sexual services in bars. Information was provided on the increasing 
</p>
<p>number of bars offering exotic dancing in border communities in the southern and northern 
</p>
<p>parts of Belize, and the increasing number of women believed to be brought from El 
</p>
<p>Salvador and Honduras to work informally as prostitutes. The 2010 population census of 
</p>
<p>Belize revealed that the top four countries of origin of migrants were El Salvador (7,067), 
</p>
<p>Guatemala (18,876), Honduras (6,904) and Mexico (2,305). In 2012 migration authorities 
</p>
<p>in Belize reported that over 250 undocumented migrants had been intercepted and detained, 
</p>
<p>while 50 had been refused entry. 
</p>
<p>6. Sexual exploitation also affects Belizean women and especially teenage girls 
</p>
<p>trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation by family members. This phenomenon is said 
</p>
<p>to be prevalent within the Creole communities, whereas the Mayan and Hispanic girls 
</p>
<p>affected have been subjected to the <i>fichera</i> phenomenon, especially in border towns. It was 
</p>
<p>reported that Belizean women and girls are trafficked internally to work in bars, nightclubs 
</p>
<p>and brothels, primarily in the areas of San Pedro, Cayo District and Belize City. This </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>phenomenon seems to be concentrated in areas where tourism is important and where 
</p>
<p>reports indicate that Belizean girls are made to provide sexual services to tourists. A study 
</p>
<p>conducted by the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the commercial sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation of children and adolescents in Belize (2006) reported on a phenomenon 
</p>
<p>commonly called &#8220;Hit me on the hip&#8221; which consists in soliciting young girls to become 
</p>
<p>commercial sex providers in the tourist industry. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern 
</p>
<p>with regard to the growing problem of crimes against children, especially sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation of young girls from poor families. The <i>fichera</i> phenomenon was brought to the 
</p>
<p>attention of the Special Rapporteur; it refers to a practice whereby men pay a higher price 
</p>
<p>to drink in the company of adolescent girls or young women who work in bars. The practice 
</p>
<p>has been identified as a gateway to prostitution. <i>Fichera</i> has been found by investigators to 
</p>
<p>be a common thread in many suspected cases of trafficking in persons. Information 
</p>
<p>received suggests that adolescent migrants working in bars as waitresses or dancers are 
</p>
<p>often victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>7. On the other hand, Belize, a middle-income country, has been perceived as offering 
</p>
<p>many economic opportunities in the subregion. It thus favours an influx of smuggled 
</p>
<p>migrants, as well as trafficking for labour exploitation in the agricultural, fishing, 
</p>
<p>construction and service sectors, migrant workers being lured by the promise of better job 
</p>
<p>opportunities. Men and children from neighbouring Central American countries are most 
</p>
<p>often trafficked for exploitation in the banana industry, while Chinese, Indian and Nepalese 
</p>
<p>migrants have been identified as victims of trafficking for labour exploitation in restaurants, 
</p>
<p>shops and construction companies owned by persons of the same nationalities as those 
</p>
<p>trafficked. Women from Central America are also reportedly exploited as domestic 
</p>
<p>workers.  
</p>
<p>8. The traffickers&#8217; modus operandi includes moving victims mainly by land routes, but 
</p>
<p>also by sea, confiscation of \their identification documents, debt bondage to repay the cost 
</p>
<p>of travel, sequestration, psychological and physical threats and violence. Some victims are 
</p>
<p>brought to Belize on tourist visas or temporary work visas and end up falling into irregular 
</p>
<p>status after their documents are confiscated. Traffickers are usually women, reportedly 
</p>
<p>acting alone rather than as part of organized networks. They travel with their victims and 
</p>
<p>upon arrival they act as &#8220;madams&#8221;, monitoring and coordinating the delivery of sexual 
</p>
<p>services. The average fee for sexual services is 150 Belize dollars (US$ 75) of which 
</p>
<p>50 dollars automatically goes to the owner of the premises. 
</p>
<p>9. One of the victims that the Special Rapporteur met, a girl from Guatemala, now 18 
</p>
<p>years old, was smuggled into Belize when she was 13 on a promise of a babysitting job. 
</p>
<p>Instead, her trafficker, a woman originally from Guatemala who grew up in Belize, took her 
</p>
<p>to work in a bar in a small village where she was made to provide sexual services, was 
</p>
<p>never paid, was deprived of her freedom for one year, threatened with detention for 
</p>
<p>entering the country irregularly and mistreated with the complicity of a local police officer 
</p>
<p>who also abused her sexually. The Special Rapporteur also received information about a 
</p>
<p>woman from El Salvador who was promised domestic work. Upon arrival in Belize, her 
</p>
<p>passport was withheld on the promise of regularizing her situation; instead, she was kept 
</p>
<p>hostage for two months and made to work in a bar in a small village. Her trafficker 
</p>
<p>exercised control over her by withholding her small child. Those two victims were both 
</p>
<p>able to escape with the help of local inhabitants who alerted law enforcement officers. 
</p>
<p>10. The scale of trafficking in Belize seems to be more pronounced than that reflected in 
</p>
<p>the limited data readily available. The phenomenon remains difficult to quantify, given the 
</p>
<p>lack of capacity and will to identify victims. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
</p>
<p>reliable statistical data remain unavailable as she was provided with very few data with 
</p>
<p>regard to the number of victims identified and their characteristics, the number of cases 
</p>
<p>prosecuted, convictions or sentencing. This underlines a serious gap as data collection is </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>paramount to determine the magnitude of the problem of trafficking and, especially, to 
</p>
<p>understand the trends, forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons in order to design 
</p>
<p>and implement informed policies.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal, policy and institutional frameworks for combating trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>in persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>  International and regional framework  
</b></p>
<p>11. At the international level, the Government of Belize has signed and ratified 
</p>
<p>international instruments, including the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention on Transnational Organized Crime (hereafter the Trafficking in Persons 
</p>
<p>Protocol); the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women; the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol on the sale of 
</p>
<p>children, child prostitution and child pornography; ILO Conventions No. 29 (1930) 
</p>
<p>concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour and No. 182 (1999) concerning the Prohibition 
</p>
<p>and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour; the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their 
</p>
<p>Families; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Belize 
</p>
<p>has not yet ratified ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning Decent Work for Domestic 
</p>
<p>Workers. 
</p>
<p>12. Belize is a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 
</p>
<p>1967 Protocol and acceded to the 1954 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness in 
</p>
<p>2006. However, the mechanism in place to process the cases of people in need of 
</p>
<p>international protection has not been active since 1997, which has had a negative impact on 
</p>
<p>the provision of assistance to all persons in need of humanitarian protection.  
</p>
<p>13. At the regional level, Belize is a member of the Organization of American States and 
</p>
<p>has ratified the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication 
</p>
<p>of Violence against Women as well as the Inter-American Convention on International 
</p>
<p>Traffic in Minors. 
</p>
<p><b>  National framework  
</b></p>
<p>14. The Constitution of Belize guarantees to all persons the rights to life, liberty and 
</p>
<p>security of the person, and the protection of the law.1 Trafficking in persons was first 
</p>
<p>defined and criminalized in the national legal framework by the Prohibition of Trafficking 
</p>
<p>in Persons Act 18/2003 which adopted, verbatim, the definition contained in article 3 of the 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons Protocol. That Act was repealed by the Trafficking in Persons 
</p>
<p>(Prohibition) Act 2013, a stronger piece of legislation which improved on the previous one 
</p>
<p>in that it (a) specifically provides that the law applies to both national and international 
</p>
<p>trafficking, and covers violations carried out by individuals or criminal groups; (b) gives 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial jurisdiction if trafficking is committed by a Belizean national or a person 
</p>
<p>who is resident in Belize; (c) establishes the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council with wide 
</p>
<p>powers, including the formulation of policies for the protection of victims and the 
</p>
<p>establishment of committees to carry out specific activities; (d) defines a number of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1  Belize Constitution Act, chap. 4 of the Laws of Belize, R.E. 2000&#8211;2003. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>trafficking-related offences, such as trafficking in children for the purposes of adoption, 
</p>
<p>child prostitution or exploitation, as well as profiteering from and advertising trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons; and (e) empowers the court to impose higher sentences in aggravated cases. The 
</p>
<p>new legal provisions raised the offence of trafficking from a &#8220;summary offence&#8221; tried in the 
</p>
<p>lower courts to an indictable offence tried before the Supreme Court. The new law 
</p>
<p>criminalizes the prostitution of children as well as the utilization of children or images of 
</p>
<p>children in, and the distribution of, child pornography. It also criminalizes the practice of 
</p>
<p>using adolescents in <i>fichera</i> activities.  
</p>
<p>15. The Office of the Special Envoy for Women and Children has developed and 
</p>
<p>implemented several initiatives to address the issue of the commercial sexual exploitation 
</p>
<p>of children in Belize, resulting in the adoption of the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of 
</p>
<p>Children (Prohibition) Act 2013. The Act defines a child as a person below the age of 
</p>
<p>18 years and spells out a large array of offences, among others child prostitution, child 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation, child pornography and trafficking of children, together with associated 
</p>
<p>penalties. The Act includes several references to the provisions of the Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013, relating to assistance and protection for victims, as well as 
</p>
<p>sentencing. 
</p>
<p>16. Other relevant legislation may be invoked to prosecute trafficking-related offences. 
</p>
<p>The Criminal Code2 defines carnal knowledge offences, rape, procurement, defilement by 
</p>
<p>force or fraud or administration of drugs, assault and battery, unlawful imprisonment, child 
</p>
<p>stealing, abduction, kidnapping and forcible marriage. With regard to the sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation of minors, the Code sets the age limit for sexual consent at 16, and makes a 
</p>
<p>distinction between children of less than 12 years of age and those between 14 and 16 years 
</p>
<p>of age when prescribing sentencing. In the days preceding the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, 
</p>
<p>the Code was amended to increase penalties for perpetrators of sexual violence against 
</p>
<p>children and to define rape for both genders. 
</p>
<p>17. The Summary Jurisdiction (Offences) Act3 establishes the offences of keeping a 
</p>
<p>brothel, trading on prostitution, loitering for prostitution and also provides that:  
</p>
<p>where it is made to appear to a magistrate by information on the oath &#8230; that any woman or 
girl is unlawfully being detained for immoral purposes by any person in any place within his 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction, the magistrate may issue a warrant empowering and authorising any member of 
</p>
<p>the Police Department to enter the said place &#8230; search &#8230; and detain in a place of safety, such 
woman or girl until she can be brought before a magistrate. (17 (1))  
</p>
<p>18. The Act criminalizes any acts causing, procuring or encouraging any child to beg or 
</p>
<p>gather alms (4 (1) (xxxi)), a provision which could also be used to prosecute potential cases 
</p>
<p>of trafficking of children for the purpose of forced begging.  
</p>
<p>19. The Labour Act sets out minimum labour protection standards, including: minimum 
</p>
<p>wages, the limitation of working hours, the provision of paid leave and overtime. It 
</p>
<p>criminalizes forced labour and defines it as work or service which is extracted from any 
</p>
<p>person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not consented to 
</p>
<p>voluntarily. The Act also provides for the protection of domestic workers. With regard to 
</p>
<p>child labour, it defines a child as any person who is under the age of 14 and prohibits the 
</p>
<p>employment of children under the age of 12 (art. 169 (a)) as well as the employment of 
</p>
<p>children under the age of 15 on a maritime vessel. However, the Special Rapporteur notes 
</p>
<p>with concern that the legislation does not provide a consistent definition of a &#8220;child&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>other legislation presents different ages.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Families and Children Act (art. 2.1) defines the offence of child abuse to 
</p>
<p>include, but not be limited to, the infliction on a child of physical, psychological, emotional 
</p>
<p>or sexual harm, injury, abuse or exploitation, and the ill-treatment or neglect of a child.  
</p>
<p>21. The Immigration Act (2000) criminalizes irregular migrants and stipulates that 
</p>
<p>punishment for the first offence shall not be less than a fine of 1,000 Belize dollars 
</p>
<p>(US$ 500) and the punishment for a second or subsequent offence shall not be less than a 
</p>
<p>fine of 3,000 Belize dollars (US$ 1,500) or imprisonment for one year (art. 34 (3)). 
</p>
<p>According to testimonies gathered by the Special Rapporteur during her visit to the Kolbe 
</p>
<p>Foundation, Belize Central Prison, the country&#8217;s sole penitentiary facility where irregular 
</p>
<p>migrants are detained with criminals, first immigration offenders have systematically been 
</p>
<p>made to pay fines of between 1,000 and 2,000 Belize dollars (US$ 500&#8211;1,000) and/or 
</p>
<p>sentenced to six months&#8217; imprisonment. Most detained irregular migrants that the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur interviewed declared that they had paid a fine and had also been sentenced to 
</p>
<p>between 6 and 12 months detention for first-time offences. They also reported that all their 
</p>
<p>belongings, including identification papers, had been confiscated by immigration officers 
</p>
<p>and had never been returned.  
</p>
<p>22. At the time of the visit, there were 171 foreigners detained in the prison, of whom 66 
</p>
<p>were being held for the offence of irregular entry (24 Hondurans, 17 Salvadorians, 
</p>
<p>14 Guatemalans, 5 Indians, 3 Cubans, 2 Mexicans and 1 Italian).4 The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>also received information that repeat offenders may find their sentences doubled or tripled. 
</p>
<p>Upon completion of their prison terms, Guatemalan and Mexican nationals are often taken 
</p>
<p>to the border with an Order to Leave without any resources to make their way home; while 
</p>
<p>other nationals are kept in prison until funds are available to finance their return to their 
</p>
<p>home countries, which has in some cases proven to take a long time. This is all the more 
</p>
<p>alarming considering that unaccompanied minors are also detained in the prison: underage 
</p>
<p>males are kept with juvenile offenders, while underage females are housed in the quarters 
</p>
<p>reserved for female inmates.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern with regard to the indiscriminate 
</p>
<p>criminalization of irregular migrants, as the routine practice of immigration officers is to 
</p>
<p>strictly apply the immigration law, that is to say to prosecute, convict and/or fine 
</p>
<p>immigrants even before giving them an opportunity to tell their stories or be identified as 
</p>
<p>victims or potential victims of trafficking. This is all the more unjustified considering that 
</p>
<p>the Immigration Act (art. 27 (1)) stipulates that an immigration officer may order an 
</p>
<p>irregular migrant (a) to leave Belize and proceed immediately in the same vessel in which 
</p>
<p>he arrived; or (b) leave Belize within 60 days of entering Belize and, if an immigration 
</p>
<p>officer thinks fit, by a specified vessel; or (c) arrest and bring such a person before a 
</p>
<p>magistrate&#8217;s court so that a removal order is issued. However, the policy in place has 
</p>
<p>mainly favoured the implementation of clause (c) of the said article. In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur warns that the criminalization of irregular immigrants is not in line with 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards and practices, especially given the inhumane 
</p>
<p>conditions of detention that prevail at the Belize Central Prison which is overcrowded and 
</p>
<p>has very poor sanitary conditions and facilities. The Special Rapporteur also notes with 
</p>
<p>concern the absence of basic assistance to inmates, including the possibility of making 
</p>
<p>phone calls to contact their families, embassies and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of a functioning asylum system, 
</p>
<p>as persons in need of international protection, including potential victims of trafficking, 
</p>
<p>might not be identified and might be subjected to refoulement. Moreover, existing

<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>memorandums of understanding, such as the one between the Governments of Belize and 
</p>
<p>Cuba requiring the return of all Cubans who enter Belize without a visa, might also put 
</p>
<p>potential asylum seekers and victims of human rights violations at risk. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that employers have taken advantage of 
</p>
<p>the restrictive immigration policies to exercise pressure on and exploit migrant workers 
</p>
<p>from Central America. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>26. In 2012, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council developed the Anti-Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons Strategic Plan of Action 2013&#8211;2015 in cooperation with the International 
</p>
<p>Organization for Migration (IOM). It was elaborated through the revision of existing 
</p>
<p>legislation, policies and plans relevant to trafficking and the consultation of relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in an effort to enhance anti-trafficking responses by minimizing duplication 
</p>
<p>and better targeting human and financial resources. 
</p>
<p>27. The Plan reasserts that trafficking cannot be addressed though crime control and 
</p>
<p>prosecution alone and therefore aims at fostering a human-rights, victim-centred approach 
</p>
<p>encompassing all aspects of effective remedies for victims of trafficking. It clearly 
</p>
<p>delineates the roles and responsibilities of each key agency within the Anti-Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons Council and defines specific activities to be undertaken as well as estimated 
</p>
<p>budgetary needs. The Plan spells out six core principles, including a rights-based, victim-
</p>
<p>centred approach, fostering accountability while guaranteeing confidentiality and non-
</p>
<p>discrimination through a multisectoral partnership; it focuses on the three Ps &#8212; prevention, 
</p>
<p>protection and prosecution &#8212; outlining goals, objectives and activities along with the 
</p>
<p>necessary coordination mechanisms as well as capacity-building needs, and sets out 
</p>
<p>provisions for monitoring and evaluation. However, at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>visit the Plan had not been submitted for approval by the Parliament as, she was informed, 
</p>
<p>it is the prerogative of the Cabinet (the Executive) to decide whether plans will be 
</p>
<p>submitted to Parliament. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur raised the issue of the Plan 
</p>
<p>needing legal grounds in order to receive a consistent and sustainable budget allocation for 
</p>
<p>its proper implementation.  
</p>
<p>28. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council reported that the Revised National Gender 
</p>
<p>Policy, adopted in 2013, included human trafficking in its definition of gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence and advocated the establishment of a cohesive, human rights-oriented legal 
</p>
<p>framework that would include protection from, and redress for, all forms of gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, with special emphasis on sexual offences. 
</p>
<p>29. The Government has developed the National Plan of Action for Children and 
</p>
<p>Adolescents (2004&#8211;2015), which gives priority to action in the areas of education, health 
</p>
<p>and child protection. One of the strategic objectives of the Plan is addressing child labour, 
</p>
<p>including the worst forms of child labour. The Plan advocates the revision of current child 
</p>
<p>labour legislation, the development of inter-agency coordination, increasing institutional 
</p>
<p>capacity to enforce legislation, strengthen child labour prevention programmes, and raise 
</p>
<p>awareness.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>30. In 2003, the Government established a task force to coordinate its efforts to prevent 
</p>
<p>and combat trafficking in persons and to provide support and protection to victims. In 
</p>
<p>December 2005, the Executive changed the status of the task force to that of a committee. 
</p>
<p>The status of the committee was legally elevated to that of a council by section 5 of the 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013, which mandates the institution with the 
</p>
<p>following tasks: identify and rescue the victims of trafficking in persons; provide the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>necessary legal, medical, psychological, employment and other assistance to the victims for 
</p>
<p>the duration of their stay in Belize; grant victims legal status in Belize for the duration of 
</p>
<p>their stay in the country; and investigate and prosecute traffickers. The multisectoral Anti-
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons Council is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer of the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Human Development, Social Transformation and Poverty Alleviation and is composed of 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney General&#8217;s Ministry, the 
</p>
<p>Immigration, Police, Labour and Public Prosecutions Departments, the National Committee 
</p>
<p>for Families and Children and the Belize Tourism Board. Council membership has been 
</p>
<p>extended to the National Organization for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect and 
</p>
<p>the Youth Enhancement Services. However it appears that cooperation with civil society 
</p>
<p>remains at its infant stage and is very limited.  
</p>
<p>31. In accordance with section 9 of the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) 2013 Act, 
</p>
<p>the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council established three committees to implement anti-
</p>
<p>trafficking activities: the Operations Committee, responsible for considering and 
</p>
<p>confirming suspected cases of trafficking in persons, providing direct assistance to victims 
</p>
<p>and ensuring the prosecution of perpetrators; the Information, Education and 
</p>
<p>Communication Committee, responsible for conducting public awareness campaigns; and 
</p>
<p>the Monitoring and Evaluation Committee, responsible for data collection, analysis, 
</p>
<p>evaluation and reporting. The Special Rapporteur advises that monitoring and evaluation 
</p>
<p>should be conducted by an independent institution, such as a national rapporteur, able to 
</p>
<p>assess objectively and report on the implementation and impact of the Anti-Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Persons Strategic Plan while providing information on progress made and remaining 
</p>
<p>challenges in cooperation with the Council and its subcommittees. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>also notes that the institution does not have a dedicated executive body with dedicated staff 
</p>
<p>as the current members have other responsibilities within their respective ministries and 
</p>
<p>agencies.  
</p>
<p>32. The Department of Human Services of the Ministry of Human Development and 
</p>
<p>Social Transformation and the Belize Police Department are the leading institutions 
</p>
<p>mandated with directly processing and assisting victims or potential victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Identification of victims of trafficking  
</b></p>
<p>33. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council provided information on the standard 
</p>
<p>operating procedure developed to ensure effective identification, rescue, protection and 
</p>
<p>support of victims, and to increase the prosecution of offenders. The procedure defines the 
</p>
<p>screening process to identify victims or potential victims accurately; it also provides a 
</p>
<p>standard form for reporting potential cases of trafficking, as well as a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>interview questionnaire to be used by social workers to ascertain the status of victims. It 
</p>
<p>also delineates the responsibilities of each agency involved in anti-trafficking activities. 
</p>
<p>Despite the standard operating procedure and the distribution of indicator cards carried by 
</p>
<p>police and immigration agents, the identification rate remains very low and reflects on the 
</p>
<p>low rate of victim rescue and of prosecution. 
</p>
<p>34. The Government has developed and implemented an operational protocol (the 
</p>
<p>CARE Model) to coordinate the protection, care and monitoring of sexually exploited and 
</p>
<p>trafficked children. The protocol outlines the role of the Department of Human Services 
</p>
<p>and the police in receiving allegations of the commercial sexual exploitation of children, 
</p>
<p>making referrals to other agencies for services and protecting children from future 
</p>
<p>exploitation. 
</p>
<p>35. Between 2010 and 2012, 104 interrogations were conducted, leading to the arrest 
</p>
<p>and prosecution of nine persons charged with eight counts of trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p>attempted trafficking in persons, and rape and aggravated assault resulting from trafficking </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>in persons. Over the same period, five cases of commercial sexual exploitation of children 
</p>
<p>were reported and referred to the court. Two successful convictions by magistrates&#8217; courts 
</p>
<p>were recorded in 2013. The Special Rapporteur regrets that despite her request for 
</p>
<p>information on the trials of trafficking cases, no details were provided.  
</p>
<p>36. While the Department of Human Services reported that it receives few direct 
</p>
<p>referrals from the general population, there is no formalized national referral system, and 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations working with potential victims are not directly involved with the 
</p>
<p>identification of victims. Identification has mainly occurred through police and immigration 
</p>
<p>operations, which have proven to be rare in recent years.  
</p>
<p>37. Identification remains challenging also as a result of the restrictive immigration 
</p>
<p>policies. The cases of four women detained for irregular entry were brought to the attention 
</p>
<p>of the Special Rapporteur. In those cases, it was alleged that, although the women had 
</p>
<p>attempted to explain to the magistrate that they had been victims of human rights abuses, 
</p>
<p>the emphasis of the immigration officer on their irregular status had reportedly weighed 
</p>
<p>more heavily. While the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council subsequently intervened in 
</p>
<p>those four cases, that situation testifies to the poor implementation of identification 
</p>
<p>protocols and the dire need to strengthen the capacities of key actors. Another factor 
</p>
<p>affecting identification is the alleged corruption of law enforcement, immigration and 
</p>
<p>customs officers involved in trafficking operations, who are also reported to turn a blind 
</p>
<p>eye to traffickers. The Special Rapporteur also learned that sting operations are sometimes 
</p>
<p>botched through the complicity of officials, leading to mistrust and complicated rescue 
</p>
<p>plans to avoid leaks. 
</p>
<p>38. Information was also provided about the identification of victims of trafficking 
</p>
<p>through interviews with asylum seekers and irregular migrants carried out by non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations (NGOs). References were made to the cases of two persons 
</p>
<p>who had been detained in prison and, upon interview by an NGO, had been referred to the 
</p>
<p>Department of Human Services, which had subsequently taken action to assist them. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur received information on the failure of border agents to 
</p>
<p>properly assist unaccompanied minors at border points; they are most often simply returned 
</p>
<p>without any assistance, thus aggravating their situation of vulnerability, in violation of 
</p>
<p>human rights standards. More alarming is the fact that while visiting the prison, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur interviewed two 17-year-old girls, one of them two months pregnant. According 
</p>
<p>to the stories they told, they had not been screened at all and inconsistencies in their 
</p>
<p>interviews might have been signs that they had been brought to Belize under unclear 
</p>
<p>circumstances. It was further reported that in the week preceding the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>visit, 12 women had been arrested during a raid in a bar and sentenced to serve time in 
</p>
<p>prison without having being screened. 
</p>
<p>39. The Department of Human Services reported that social workers are present during 
</p>
<p>interviews conducted by the police, to ensure that victims are treated with respect and duly 
</p>
<p>informed of their rights. However, according to information received, police interviews are 
</p>
<p>often conducted in the absence of social workers when the victim is not a minor, and the 
</p>
<p>lack of trust in law enforcement agents has led to low numbers of victims coming forward 
</p>
<p>to denounce their situation of exploitation. Moreover, other operations, such as the ones 
</p>
<p>conducted by immigration and labour authorities, are not accompanied by social workers, 
</p>
<p>thus leaving the identification of victims to law enforcement agents alone. The standard 
</p>
<p>operating procedure does not clearly define the role of the Department of Immigration in 
</p>
<p>detecting and referring cases of trafficking, whereas it should be one of the leading 
</p>
<p>institutions involved and trained in recognizing victims. One of the main challenges is the 
</p>
<p>centralization of all initial screenings to only one investigator dedicated to trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons for the whole country.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Government reported that labour investigations are often conducted on the basis 
</p>
<p>of complaints. The standard operating procedure of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council 
</p>
<p>advises labour inspectors to conduct investigations into labour complaints and to refer them 
</p>
<p>to the Council when it considers that elements of trafficking are present. The Social 
</p>
<p>Security Board also has inspectors who in the past have made referrals to immigration 
</p>
<p>authorities with regard to the employment of irregular migrants, although the Board is not a 
</p>
<p>member of the Council and consequently not involved in identifying potential cases of 
</p>
<p>trafficking.  
</p>
<p>41. One civil society organization involved in responding to the needs of victims of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence submitted the information that in 2013 counselling had been provided to 
</p>
<p>four women who had indicated that they had been victims of trafficking. However, the 
</p>
<p>counsellors had not been given consent to disclose the details of their cases to the Anti-
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons Council. This shows that foreign victims are reluctant to interact 
</p>
<p>with the State system, which they perceived to be heavily centred around law enforcement.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Assistance to victims 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Protection, redress and recovery  
</b></p>
<p>42. One of the main goals of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Strategic Plan (2012&#8211;2014) 
</p>
<p>is the protection of victims. The Plan reasserts that the protection of and support to victims 
</p>
<p>of trafficking, with respect for their human rights, are critical to their successful 
</p>
<p>reintegration into society and the successful prosecution of cases. The Plan provides that 
</p>
<p>victims should be granted direct services, such as medical and psychological services, 
</p>
<p>housing, skills training and employment opportunities, and regularized immigration status 
</p>
<p>or safe repatriation.  
</p>
<p>43. The Ministry of Human Development, through its Department of Human Services, 
</p>
<p>is mandated to provide shelter to and meet the needs of victims of trafficking while they are 
</p>
<p>in Belize, for the duration of the criminal proceedings. The needs of victims should be 
</p>
<p>assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the 
</p>
<p>specificities of each victim, including psychological, psychiatric and other health 
</p>
<p>conditions. However, those measures are yet to be enforced.  
</p>
<p>44. According to the standard operating procedure, support activities should be 
</p>
<p>coordinated with civil society entities. However, all the information gathered shows that 
</p>
<p>there has been very little implementation in this regard, as is the case for the entire victim 
</p>
<p>assistance system, which remains ad hoc and weak. No information was provided with 
</p>
<p>regard to the total number of victims assisted since the enactment of the first anti-
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons legislation in 2003. 
</p>
<p>45. The standard operating procedure provides that, upon confirmation of their victim 
</p>
<p>status, individuals should be placed in safe houses, or foster homes in the case of victims 
</p>
<p>below 18 years of age. Belize does not have any dedicated shelter for victims of trafficking 
</p>
<p>because, as the Government explained, it is difficult to keep such places confidential and 
</p>
<p>therefore they could be detrimental to the privacy and safety of victims. The Government 
</p>
<p>has rented a facility that provides rescued victims with housing, but it does not provide 
</p>
<p>proximity services, such as an on-site counsellor and psychosocial support. It is mainly 
</p>
<p>used to house rescued foreign women awaiting repatriation.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur visited the shelter run by Help for Progress, a local non-
</p>
<p>governmental agency, which since 1999 has served as the implementing partner of the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Help for 
</p>
<p>Progress has assisted asylum seekers by offering them shelter, lodging their asylum claims, 
</p>
<p>conducting preliminary interviews and forwarding the claims to immigration authorities. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>The organization informed the Special Rapporteur that it had sheltered few victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons awaiting repatriation at the request of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons 
</p>
<p>Council. Despite its efforts, Help for Progress cannot offer up-to-standard facilities and 
</p>
<p>services to victims owing to its limited financial capacity.  
</p>
<p>47. The Child Development Foundation, a non-profit social justice organization 
</p>
<p>focusing on sexual exploitation and trafficking in persons for sexual purposes, expressed its 
</p>
<p>intention to establish a shelter facility responding to the necessary standards, to assist 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking through in-house counselling, psychosocial support, legal assistance, 
</p>
<p>skills training and other rehabilitative services. It was developing a proposal and plan for a 
</p>
<p>small facility to provide accommodation for four or five women. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>encourages such initiatives and stresses that the Government, through the Anti-Trafficking 
</p>
<p>in Persons Council, should strengthen partnerships with civil society organizations with 
</p>
<p>regard to the identification of and assistance to victims by providing financial support to 
</p>
<p>that type of project. 
</p>
<p>48. The Ministry of Health provided information on the social security system which is 
</p>
<p>being implemented in the south of the country bordering Guatemala and Honduras and 
</p>
<p>which allows access to public hospitals even in the absence of identification papers. That 
</p>
<p>system of free upfront health-care services has benefited many migrants who cross the 
</p>
<p>border for medical care. Victims of trafficking have been provided with medical services at 
</p>
<p>no cost. However, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council did not provide detailed 
</p>
<p>information on the process of medical and psychological screening of rescued victims.  
</p>
<p>49. Access to employment and work permits is of paramount importance to rescued 
</p>
<p>victims, as they contribute to economic self-sufficiency, professional realization and skill-
</p>
<p>building, and thus facilitate the overall process of successful reintegration. The standard 
</p>
<p>operating procedure lays out the role of the Labour Department in issuing, in coordination 
</p>
<p>with the immigration authorities, work permits to victims under the protection of the State. 
</p>
<p>The guidelines also provide for the Immigration Department to grant residence status to 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking for the duration of their stay in Belize or to facilitate the safe 
</p>
<p>repatriation of victims who wish to return to their country of legal residency. However, the 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013 makes the delivery of a residence permit 
</p>
<p>conditional on victims&#8217; cooperation with investigators and prosecutors (art. 14), which is 
</p>
<p>not in conformity with the Trafficking in Persons Protocol; no details were provided with 
</p>
<p>regard to the delivery of any work or resident permits for victims who had been rescued. 
</p>
<p>Information received indicated that persons under the protection of the State on 
</p>
<p>humanitarian grounds had been requested to pay 500 Belize dollars (US$ 250) to obtain 
</p>
<p>work permits, which is an obstacle that further exposes them to seeking work in the 
</p>
<p>informal sector and increases their vulnerability. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur notes that basic services have not been provided to victims. 
</p>
<p>One victim interviewed reported that, once law enforcement officers had rescued her in the 
</p>
<p>Cayo district, she was taken directly to Belize City, where she was interviewed by the 
</p>
<p>police and subsequently placed, for eight months, in an institution catering for vulnerable 
</p>
<p>teenagers, before being placed in a foster home. This is a sign that anti-trafficking efforts 
</p>
<p>and capacities are concentrated in the capital city, whereas trafficking also occurs in rural 
</p>
<p>areas. It is also important to note that that victim&#8217;s foster parents had never received 
</p>
<p>specific training on providing adequate assistance to victims of trafficking and commercial 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation. Moreover, the victim had been provided with very little psychosocial 
</p>
<p>assistance and confessed that she had had suicidal thoughts more than two years after being 
</p>
<p>rescued. Moreover, the same victim was never granted any resident status in Belize or any 
</p>
<p>other type of permit to stay. The Government explained that during the three years she had 
</p>
<p>spent under its protection, there had been no effective coordination and communication 
</p>
<p>with the consulate of her country in Belize in order to process her passport. It appeared that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>only two requests for the victim&#8217;s identification documents had been made, with no serious 
</p>
<p>follow-up, thus leaving her with undetermined status on Belizean territory and facing de 
</p>
<p>facto statelessness.  
</p>
<p>51. That victim never received any vocational training during those three years. The 
</p>
<p>social worker who visited the foster family from time to time explained that vocational 
</p>
<p>training would be provided once the victim had acquired the necessary language skills. 
</p>
<p>However, English language learning support had been provided in the form of tutoring 
</p>
<p>rather than formal language classes, thus significantly reducing the potential for quick 
</p>
<p>language adaptation. No details were provided about other victims who might have 
</p>
<p>benefited from any of the support services stipulated in the standard operating procedure. 
</p>
<p>52. Of further concern is the fact that, despite the victim&#8217;s cooperation with the 
</p>
<p>investigation and prosecution, the perpetrator does not seem to have been sentenced to 
</p>
<p>serve time in prison, nor has she been made to pay compensation to the victim. No 
</p>
<p>information was received about the fate of the law enforcement officer who was accomplice 
</p>
<p>to the victim&#8217;s exploitation and abuse.  
</p>
<p>53. The new legislation provides for restitution to victims (art. 24) as well as for the 
</p>
<p>seizure and forfeiture of traffickers&#8217; assets to finance prevention and rehabilitation 
</p>
<p>programmes (part 5). The Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013 allows for the 
</p>
<p>possibility of requesting compensation. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, a 
</p>
<p>request for compensation made on behalf of a victim following the sentencing of the 
</p>
<p>trafficker was before the magistrates&#8217; court. In cases of labour exploitation, the Labour 
</p>
<p>Department assists in calculating the benefits owed to the victim so that they are added to 
</p>
<p>the restitution sought by the victim. The new legislation allows the Office of the Director of 
</p>
<p>Public Prosecutions to seize assets found during the requisition even before submitting an 
</p>
<p>application for compensation, and to enforce a decision to compensate the victim even if 
</p>
<p>the said victim has been repatriated. However, the seizure and forfeiture of assets are not 
</p>
<p>systematically used to provide compensation and/or restitution to victims. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>granting of compensation has not been enforced in any of the court cases tried thus far. It 
</p>
<p>was also reported that there might be reluctance on the part of the court to award monetary 
</p>
<p>compensation to victims, as some views were expressed that that could open the way for 
</p>
<p>persons to declare themselves victims just to obtain monetary compensation. However, 
</p>
<p>such a view is untenable as it is the responsibility of investigators to gather evidence and 
</p>
<p>prosecutors to assess the validity of the claim, and if a victim has suffered violations, 
</p>
<p>compensation should be granted in compliance with national and international legal 
</p>
<p>standards.  
</p>
<p>54. Another important means of redress, specifically for victims of labour trafficking, is 
</p>
<p>the recovery of unpaid wages. The Labour Act stipulates that: &#8220;any employer who &#8230; fails 
</p>
<p>to pay any worker the average or other pay to which he is entitled &#8230; commits an offence, 
</p>
<p>and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars or to 
</p>
<p>imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to both&#8221; (133 (b)). Article 134 
</p>
<p>further provides that the court may order the employer to make any payments which ought 
</p>
<p>to have been made in respect of the period of employment concerned. In that regard the 
</p>
<p>standard operating procedure mentions that the Department of Labour should assist and 
</p>
<p>guide victims in suing the offender in civil proceedings to recover moneys owed for unpaid 
</p>
<p>work where no criminal proceedings are brought against the offender, or where such 
</p>
<p>proceedings are not successful. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Repatriation and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013 provides in article 16 (1) for the 
</p>
<p>option of safe repatriation of victims if they so wish. However, the plan for safe return has 
</p>
<p>not been implemented yet, although the standard operating procedure requests the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>Immigration Department to take the necessary measures to facilitate victims&#8217; safe return to 
</p>
<p>their country of origin. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Strategic Plan also provides for the 
</p>
<p>development of formal agreements with the main countries of origin with a view, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>to establishing repatriation procedures. After the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission, the 
</p>
<p>Government reported that since 2008, 77 individuals had been repatriated in cooperation 
</p>
<p>with diplomatic missions present in Belize. In that regard, 60 Nepalese nationals, victims of 
</p>
<p>labour exploitation by a Chinese company, had been repatriated. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur expressed serious concerns about the victim assistance 
</p>
<p>programmes, which are ineffectively implemented in practice. Without comprehensive 
</p>
<p>assistance, victims can hardly recover from the grave abuses to which they have been 
</p>
<p>subjected, have no prospects of reintegrating into society be it in the country of destination 
</p>
<p>or origin and remain in positions of vulnerability.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Investigation, prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Police Department is charged with investigating and requesting the prosecution 
</p>
<p>of trafficking cases. The Sexual Offence and Family Violence Units of the Police 
</p>
<p>Department conduct investigations of those crimes. The Police Department is involved in: 
</p>
<p>intelligence gathering; rescue operations; obtaining statements from victims; conducting a 
</p>
<p>complete investigation of the trafficking offence; gathering the necessary evidence 
</p>
<p>regarding the commission of the offence; proffering charges against traffickers; preparing 
</p>
<p>case files for submission within a reasonable time to the Office of the Director of Public 
</p>
<p>Prosecutions; and collecting data on operations. However the Anti-Trafficking in Persons 
</p>
<p>Council reported that at the national level there is only one dedicated, permanent 
</p>
<p>investigator, who leads a team of trained officers brought together on an ad hoc basis to 
</p>
<p>conduct rescue operations. As a result of the very limited human resources allocated to the 
</p>
<p>investigation of trafficking cases, the number of victims rescued and traffickers prosecuted 
</p>
<p>has been very low. The standard operating procedure assigns to the Labour Department 
</p>
<p>responsibility for conducting investigations into labour complaints and referring them to the 
</p>
<p>Operations Committee. The Department should also advise on criminal actions to be 
</p>
<p>brought against the offenders and provide the prosecutor with all relevant information.  
</p>
<p>58. The Ministry of Labour informed the Special Rapporteur that it has 25 labour 
</p>
<p>inspectors in 10 offices throughout the country, all of whom had received training related to 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons and child labour. The Ministry had mandated labour inspectors to 
</p>
<p>conduct a minimum of four inspections per week and approximately 2,000 inspections a 
</p>
<p>year. However, due to resource constraints, the actual rate of inspections was lower than 
</p>
<p>mandated. No data was provided on the number of investigations resulting in the detection 
</p>
<p>of cases of trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>59. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is responsible for: advising the 
</p>
<p>Operations Committee throughout the planning and execution of rescue operations; 
</p>
<p>advising the Police Department during the course of investigations and prosecutions on 
</p>
<p>charges to be proffered against a trafficker; reviewing case files submitted by the Police 
</p>
<p>Department; informing victims of the progress of the criminal court proceedings and 
</p>
<p>advising them of their right to seek compensation. Since 2008 the Office has been solely 
</p>
<p>responsible for the prosecution of trafficking in persons offences, but does not have 
</p>
<p>investigative powers and relies on police and other agencies to be able to bring charges 
</p>
<p>against offenders. A protocol has been established within the framework of the Anti-
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons Council whereby the police ensure that any information containing 
</p>
<p>elements of trafficking is duly brought to the attention of the Office at the outset. Beyond 
</p>
<p>its limited investigative capacity, Belize only has 10 prosecutors for the whole country and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>there is a need to increase that number for the effective processing of all criminal cases, 
</p>
<p>including those that involve trafficking-related offences.  
</p>
<p>60. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions reported that since 2008 no more 
</p>
<p>than 10 confirmed offenders had been brought before the court on charges of trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons. Some cases had been dismissed for lack of evidence and others because of their 
</p>
<p>sensitive nature, involving corruption of government agents. It was also reported that all the 
</p>
<p>persons tried so far had been convicted, but the majority of cases were outstanding due to 
</p>
<p>lengthy judicial processes. Offenders were mainly women from Guatemala and Honduras. 
</p>
<p>61. Until the promulgation of the new anti-trafficking legislation, prosecutions of 
</p>
<p>trafficking cases were made at the magistrates&#8217; level; under the new legislation all offences 
</p>
<p>have to be tried before the Supreme Court. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn 
</p>
<p>that, as a result of that development, all prosecutors would receive training in trafficking-
</p>
<p>related matters and that a budget had already been allocated for that purpose.  
</p>
<p>62. Trials in the Supreme Court allow for harsher sentencing, while in magistrates&#8217; 
</p>
<p>courts the maximum sentence is 10 years&#8217; imprisonment. Today there is a serious backlog 
</p>
<p>in the justice system of Belize, and at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, 200 cases 
</p>
<p>were awaiting trial in the Supreme Court and suspected offenders were said to have 
</p>
<p>remained in custody for five to six years before being tried. Several interlocutors referred to 
</p>
<p>the need for summary trials to be reintroduced for trafficking-related offences, as it is a 
</p>
<p>burden on victims to remain in safe houses for years. Once they chose repatriation, it was 
</p>
<p>impossible to have them come back for the trial and there was no cooperation mechanism in 
</p>
<p>place with countries of origin to facilitate continued judicial process in cases of safe 
</p>
<p>repatriation.  
</p>
<p>63. Article 12 of the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013 provides for the 
</p>
<p>granting of protective hearings for victims of trafficking. The Ministry of Human 
</p>
<p>Development is responsible for the safeguard of witnesses. The Chief Justice reported that 
</p>
<p>common-law rules had been modified to allow victims&#8217; statements to be used in court as 
</p>
<p>evidence, without further testimony. The judicial authorities were also exploring the use of 
</p>
<p>provisions of the Electronic Evidence Act (2003) to introduce the use of video recording as 
</p>
<p>well as video links, so that victims could testify without being intimidated.  
</p>
<p>64. The Families and Children Act (2003) requests that &#8220;the name of an abused child or 
</p>
<p>any information relating to the circumstances of the abuse shall not be published through 
</p>
<p>any medium or otherwise disseminated&#8221; (para. 13). Paragraph 13:01 of the same Act 
</p>
<p>stipulates that a child shall give evidence in a child abuse case from behind a screen or 
</p>
<p>other means of concealment in order to ensure the child&#8217;s privacy and protection.  
</p>
<p>65. The Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013 prescribes punishments of one to 
</p>
<p>eight years&#8217; imprisonment and determines aggravating circumstances, including the 
</p>
<p>trafficking of minors (up to 12 years&#8217; imprisonment) and sexual assault (up to 25 years&#8217; 
</p>
<p>imprisonment). However, little information was provided on sentencing. Mention was made 
</p>
<p>of two cases in which the offenders had only been fined; however that could be explained 
</p>
<p>by the fact that presumed offenders are often held in jail for a long time before being tried.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Prevention 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Strategic Plan lays out prevention as one of the 
</p>
<p>major axes of the fight against trafficking in persons. The Plan therefore aims at sensitizing 
</p>
<p>the general population on the nature and consequences of trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Envoy for Women and Children has implemented a number of public 
</p>
<p>awareness activities, including the development of brochures for public officials to be </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>sensitized on the commercial sexual exploitation of children and push for legal reforms in 
</p>
<p>that regard.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, from January to December 2013, IOM 
</p>
<p>had provided, through its local partner, sensitization training to more than 5,300 persons 
</p>
<p>within communities at risk in Belize. Furthermore, it had given support to the Government 
</p>
<p>for the development of material for sensitization through media outlets, including radio 
</p>
<p>public service announcements in Creole, English and Spanish, and the production of 3,500 
</p>
<p>posters in English, Mandarin and Spanish, 11,000 brochures in English, Mandarin and 
</p>
<p>Spanish, and 190 flip charts for sensitization efforts in schools. However, the Government 
</p>
<p>had yet to distribute those materials extensively and engage in sustained awareness-raising.  
</p>
<p>69. Tourism continues to be a major source of income for Belize and sexual exploitation 
</p>
<p>in the tourism industry is a growing concern. Efforts to address that concern have been 
</p>
<p>supported by the Belize Tourist Board and the Belize Tourism Industry Association 
</p>
<p>promoting the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism among businesses associated with 
</p>
<p>tourism. One of the measures under the Code is that only registered guests can gain access 
</p>
<p>to hotel rooms. Furthermore, the Board has trained 478 persons, including tour guides, 
</p>
<p>agents of the tourism police unit and students by means of a four-hour presentation to raise 
</p>
<p>awareness and provide basic tools for the identification of potential victims and 
</p>
<p>perpetrators. It has also developed ad hoc training for bartenders to assist them in 
</p>
<p>recognizing signs and making referrals to the police. The Board reported on the 
</p>
<p>commitment of the private tourism and hotel associations to fight trafficking and to put to 
</p>
<p>use the training received on the issue of sex exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Safe migration  
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur has advocated the establishment of safe migration pathways 
</p>
<p>to prevent trafficking in persons, bearing in mind that Belize needs a foreign workforce. In 
</p>
<p>that regard, section 16 (1) of the Immigration Act provides that &#8220;a temporary employment 
</p>
<p>permit may be issued by the Director of Immigration and Nationality Services to any 
</p>
<p>person &#8230; described in a current voucher issued &#8230; by or on behalf of the Minister 
</p>
<p>responsible for Labour.&#8221; However the work permit is tied to the employment specified in it, 
</p>
<p>thus tying the employee to his employer (see sect. 16 (1)&#8211;(3) of the Act), which may 
</p>
<p>exacerbate vulnerability. It is possible, however, upon specific conditions determined by 
</p>
<p>the Director of Immigration, for the holder of a temporary employment permit to be 
</p>
<p>allowed to work for another employer, but that remains discretionary. No data were 
</p>
<p>provided by the Government on the number of permits issued and the conditions upon 
</p>
<p>which the Ministry of Labour requests the granting of temporary work permits.  
</p>
<p>71. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council informed the Special Rapporteur that there 
</p>
<p>was a policy in place restricting the delivery of temporary work permits to certain 
</p>
<p>categories of workers, including waitresses, babysitters, domestic workers and bar workers. 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur recommended that, because Belize needed the foreign 
</p>
<p>workforce and because those categories of workers were more vulnerable to exploitation, 
</p>
<p>the Government should establish a protection policy to reduce the negative incidence on 
</p>
<p>those who are employed informally.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Addressing the root causes  
</b></p>
<p>72. The Government reported that several pro-poor policies had been implemented with 
</p>
<p>the aim of reducing disparities as well as improving the living standards of the most 
</p>
<p>vulnerable and marginalized components of society. The expected long-term impact of 
</p>
<p>those initiatives included the development of opportunities that could reduce child abuse 
</p>
<p>and neglect as well as the commercial sexual exploitation of girls and boys from the most 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged families.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Government has implemented the Building Opportunities for Our Social 
</p>
<p>Transformation (BOOST) programme, funded in part by the World Bank, to help combat 
</p>
<p>national poverty. The initiative provides monetary incentives for families to maintain the 
</p>
<p>annual school attendance of their children, aged 5 to 17, at least 85 per cent, and to ensure 
</p>
<p>the immunization of children aged 5 and under. In 2012, the Government expanded the 
</p>
<p>BOOST programme to provide higher payouts to boys in an effort to lower the rate of male 
</p>
<p>school dropout.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Cooperation and partnership 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the need to take into consideration the 
</p>
<p>transnational nature of trafficking, which requires the participation of source, transit and 
</p>
<p>destination countries to prevent and combat trafficking in persons. The Government did not 
</p>
<p>provide information on existing bilateral agreements, but the standard operating procedure 
</p>
<p>developed by the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council emphasizes the need to establish and 
</p>
<p>strengthen cooperation and partnership with countries of origin.  
</p>
<p>75. Within the framework of the Regional Conference on Migration, Belize participated 
</p>
<p>in the development of the <i>Procedures</i> <i>Manual on Trafficking in Persons for Secretariats 
</i></p>
<p><i>and Ministries of Foreign Affairs in Central America and Mexico</i>. That initiative, 
</p>
<p>sponsored by IOM, is aimed at building the capacity of diplomatic and consular entities to 
</p>
<p>address trafficking in persons. It forms part of the Consular Authority Training Programme 
</p>
<p>created as a result of resolutions adopted at the twelfth Regional Conference. The manual 
</p>
<p>details specific actions to be implemented to rescue and provide comprehensive assistance 
</p>
<p>to victims of trafficking, as well as prosecute perpetrators through mutual legal assistance 
</p>
<p>protocols, and delineates responsibilities for different agencies.  
</p>
<p>76. Since 2011, Belize has participated in a four-year global project to combat child 
</p>
<p>labour, in partnership with the United States. The project supports child labour survey 
</p>
<p>activities, which could help in understanding the scope of trafficking in children for labour 
</p>
<p>exploitation in Belize. It also provided training for Belizean officials and other actors on 
</p>
<p>how to identify cases of human trafficking, provide protection to the victims and help 
</p>
<p>prosecute traffickers.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The political commitment to end human trafficking clearly exists in Belize and 
</b></p>
<p><b>is first demonstrated by the ratification of international legal instruments including 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Trafficking in Persons</b> <b>Protocol</b>; <b>the revision and strengthening of the national law 
</b></p>
<p><b>to combat trafficking in persons, and the establishment by law of a multisectoral body 
</b></p>
<p><b>empowered to carry out the fight against trafficking in persons.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The engagement of the Government with international partners to enhance 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity and raise awareness on trafficking in persons and the commercial sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation of children is a positive first step and such partnerships should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>expanded and sustained.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>However, efforts at addressing trafficking in persons in Belize remain at their 
</b></p>
<p><b>infant stage and numerous problems subsist. The lack of capacity and willingness to 
</b></p>
<p><b>identify victims or potential victims of trafficking, especially those in mixed migration 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations, has been exacerbated by</b> <b>the indiscriminate criminalization of irregular </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b>migrants which has contributed to driving the phenomenon of human trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>further underground. Despite the existing standard operating procedure and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicator cards carried by police and immigration agents, the identification rate 
</b></p>
<p><b>remains very low. That is reflected in the prosecution rate of trafficking cases, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>is also very low. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Moreover, reliable statistical data remain unavailable, as the Anti-Trafficking 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Persons Council does not have any consistent or disaggregated information on 
</b></p>
<p><b>rescued victims, traffickers and prosecutions, which puts into question the effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of laws and policies that it has developed.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>In Belize, irregular migrants are imprisoned with common criminals and some 
</b></p>
<p><b>are held for indefinite periods of time. The practice of criminalizing irregular 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants is against international human rights standards and practices, especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>given the inhumane conditions of detention and the absence of basic assistance, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in establishing contacts with families, embassies and lawyers. It is also 
</b></p>
<p><b>worrisome that persons from the Central American subregion are incarcerated for 
</b></p>
<p><b>such immigration offences when they could easily be sent back to their respective 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries. It is particularly disquieting that children under 18 years of age, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>unaccompanied minors, are also punished for breach of immigration laws and kept in 
</b></p>
<p><b>prison. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive and structured victim protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>and assistance programme is problematic. While acknowledging the innovation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>placing trafficked persons in shelter homes, especially with residents from their 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries of origin, there is a need to balance that with vic</b>tims&#8217; need for privacy, 
</p>
<p><b>confidentiality and specialized care to aid their recovery. The lack of specialized 
</b></p>
<p><b>shelters as well as other support services, including psychosocial and legal assistance, 
</b></p>
<p><b>jeopardizes the effective recovery of victims. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The implementation of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Strategic Plan of Action 
</b></p>
<p><b>2012-2014 appears weak and fragmented. Since the Plan was adopted prior to the new 
</b></p>
<p><b>anti-trafficking law, there is a need to review it and ensure that it is not only in 
</b></p>
<p><b>conformity with the law but that it becomes a vehicle for the translation of that law 
</b></p>
<p><b>into practice. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Concerns have been raised about the lengthy judicial processes and the lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>speedy judicial trials, including for cases of trafficking. Those concerns have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>heightened by the 2013 Act, which provides that trafficking cases can no longer be 
</b></p>
<p><b>tried summarily by the magistrate</b>s&#8217;<b> courts but only by the Supreme Court, which is 
</b></p>
<p><b>experiencing a substantial backlog of cases. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The corruption and involvement of law enforcement agents, especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>immigration and police officers, in criminal activities, including trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>offences, are highly detrimental to their critical role in identifying and investigating 
</b></p>
<p><b>potential cases of trafficking in persons and rescuing victims.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Public awareness of human trafficking is still very poor and prevention 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities through the sensitization of the general population are yet to be fully carried 
</b></p>
<p><b>out. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>In view of the above observations the Special Rapporteur makes the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations to the Government of Belize: </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International framework 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Ratify, without delay ILO Convention No. 189 concerning Decent Work for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Domestic Workers.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Take proactive measures to establish bilateral agreements with countries of 
</b></p>
<p><b>origin, especially those within the subregion of Central America, to address the issue 
</b></p>
<p><b>of irregular migration, safe returns and greatly enhance safe migration options. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cooperation should be established with the governments and embassies of other 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries, especially China and India, to combat migrant smuggling and trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons, including for labour exploitation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. National framework 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Reconsider the restrictive immigration policy that further compounds the 
</b></p>
<p><b>problem of human trafficking and undermines efforts to combat and prevent human 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking. Urgently establish a separate migrant holding facility. Take all necessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures to avoid double victimization of those subjected to trafficking and 
</b></p>
<p><b>subsequently detained as irregular migrants. Amend relevant laws to decriminalize 
</b></p>
<p><b>irregular migrants, especially those who are the victims of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Halt the practice of detention and deportation of children, as this contravenes 
</b></p>
<p><b>the principle of the best interests of the child and the principle of non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Belize is a party. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Ensure the effective implementation of existing legislation, namely, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013, as well as the Commercial Sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>Exploitation of Children Act 2013.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Review the existing provisions for the delivery of seasonal or temporary 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers</b>&#8217;<b> permits.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Provide the implementation of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Strategic Plan of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Action 2012-2014 with a legal basis and ensure that adequate funds are allocated for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the effective implementation of the activities set out in the Plan, including monitoring 
</b></p>
<p><b>and evaluating its impact.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Establish efficient and coordinated data collection tools to enhance the existing 
</b></p>
<p><b>system for the collection of data on trafficking in persons, and gather information, 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregated by, inter alia, age, gender, nature of trafficking and nationality of 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims, with the assistance of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Provide a secretariat and appoint without delay a national coordinator/chief 
</b></p>
<p><b>executive officer for the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Council, with a view to improving 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity, coordination, cooperation and effectiveness in dealing comprehensively with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the problem of human trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Establish without delay a national human rights institution which complies 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the Paris Principles. The State should provide the necessary financial and human 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources for such an institution to work effectively and independently, with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes if required. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Identification, training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Enhance the existing standard operating procedures for the identification of 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims and expand capacities for their proper implementation, swiftly and accurately 
</b></p>
<p><b>identifying victims of internal and international trafficking in persons.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>99. <b>Develop a national referral mechanism that will involve social workers, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ombudsman, NGOs and faith-based organizations, including service providers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>IOM in the screening and identification of potential victims of trafficking. In this 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard establish national hotlines in Creole, English, Hindi, Mandarin and Spanish 
</b></p>
<p><b>allowing for free and anonymous referral of potential cases.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Improve partnerships with civil society organizations, including faith-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups, and involve them in the identification and protection of and assistance to 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of trafficking, as well as in creating awareness at all levels, especially in rural 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities, on the forms and manifestations of human trafficking, its causes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequences and their role in reporting and referring potential cases. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Scale up the training of law enforcement agents, including the police, 
</b></p>
<p><b>immigration and customs officers and labour inspectors, and, more importantly, 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>incentives, in order to enhance capacity to ensure continuity in their work of 
</b></p>
<p><b>identification and investigation of cases of trafficking in persons. This could be 
</b></p>
<p><b>achieved in cooperation with United Nations agencies, funds or programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Enhance investigative capacities and the number of dedicated officers working 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the specialized unit investigating trafficking-related cases, in order to improve 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectiveness in surveillance and rescue operations as well as the gathering of 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary evidence that would assist in the apprehension and indictment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>traffickers. More stringent inspection of entertainment and other businesses should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>guaranteed, to ensure that absolutely no person under the age of 18 is engaged in 
</b></p>
<p><b>prostitution and that trafficking victims are not exploited in the sex trade.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Support services for victims of trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Adopt a comprehensive victim protection and assistance programme, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>the establishment of specialized shelters</b> <b>with appropriately trained personnel and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>provision of continuing psychosocial care; separate shelters for child and adult victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>of trafficking should be made available, taking into consideration the gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>perspective as well. Ensure the provision of information and adequate legal assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>in a language victims understand. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Ensure that trafficked persons are provided with temporary residency permits 
</b></p>
<p><b>and give due consideration to the granting of permanent residency status on 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian grounds. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Ensure the effective implementation of the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) 
</b></p>
<p><b>Act 2013 with regard to the provision of compensation to victims of trafficking in 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons, especially section 24, which recognizes the need for restitution to victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking and provides for the tracing of proceeds of trafficking crimes and seizure 
</b></p>
<p><b>of assets of traffickers to assist the recovery/rehabilitation of victims. In this regard, 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop greater collaboration between the investigation of trafficking cases and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation of international financial crimes.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Ensure the safe return of trafficked victims to their country of origin, having 
</b></p>
<p><b>due regard to the need, if any, for international protection of the victims and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>application of the principle of non-refoulement, in collaboration with IOM and 
</b></p>
<p><b>UNHCR. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Prosecution

</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>which only the Supreme Court has jurisdiction. In this regard, the administration of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the criminal justice system should be strengthened, including through enhanced 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building of specialized prosecutors, magistrates and judges and 
</b></p>
<p><b>mainstreaming a human rights-based approach into the justice sector, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>collaboration with United Nations agencies.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Amend the current Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition)</b> <b>Act 2013 to create 
</b></p>
<p><b>hybrid offences that could be tried either by the Supreme Court or by magistrate</b>s&#8217;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>courts.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Enhance efforts to combat impunity for crimes against children, especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual exploitation of young girls and boys from poor families through the </b>&#8220;<b>Hit me on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the hip</b>&#8221;<b> and <i>fichera</i> phenomena, by implementing existing relevant legal provisions.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Entrench a culture of zero tolerance for corruption and the complicity of public 
</b></p>
<p><b>officials with traffickers, including officials who demand and obtain sexual favours 
</b></p>
<p><b>from foreign female migrants, or exploit workers in vulnerable situations in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide the assistance required of them as law enforcement officials. Such cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be prosecuted and offenders adequately punished as deterrence in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>part 2, article 3 (1), of the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013.

<p><b>of trafficking in persons, including domestic servitude, forced labour and sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation, through the dissemination of information on human trafficking and 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrant smuggling as well as on the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Act 2013 and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (Prohibition) Act 2013. Information 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be made available in print in Creole, English, Hindi, Mandarin and Spanish. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This will enhance community participation and involvement in the identification of 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases of trafficking in persons, as well as the rejection of practices and values that 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourage child prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Scale up public information campaigns in the tourism sector to prevent sex 
</b></p>
<p><b>tourism, and encourage private-sector operators to adopt a zero tolerance approach in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to eradicate the sexual exploitation of children in the informal sex tourism 
</b></p>
<p><b>industry. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Take urgent steps to deal with growing youth unemployment, poverty, 
</b></p>
<p><b>inequalities and social exclusion, while continuing current efforts to tackle the 
</b></p>
<p><b>problem of youth violence that may foster a culture of impunity and sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women and girls</b>.
