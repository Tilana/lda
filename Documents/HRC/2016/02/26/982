</p>
<p>held in Warsaw on 23 and 24 April 2013, and its specific recommendations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the work of journalists often puts them at specific risk of

</p>
<p>the safety of journalists, including through killing, torture, enforced disappearance,

<p>violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing serious concern </i>at the recent attacks and violence against journalists and

</p>
<p>they take no action adversely affecting their status as civilians,

</p>
<p>2. <i>Strongly condemns </i>the prevailing impunity for attacks and violence against

</p>

<p>3. <i>Urges</i> States to promote a safe and enabling environment for journalists to 
</p>
<p>perform their work independently and without undue interference, to prevent attacks and 
</p>
<p>violence against journalists and media workers, to ensure accountability through the 
</p>
<p>conduct of impartial, speedy, thorough, independent and effective investigations into all 
</p>
<p>alleged violence against journalists and media workers falling within their jurisdiction, to 
</p>
<p>bring perpetrators including, inter alia, those who command, conspire to commit, aid and 
</p>
<p>abet or cover up such crimes, to justice, and to ensure that victims and their families have 
</p>
<p>access to appropriate remedies;

</p>

</p>
<p>journalists, when threatened, immediate access to the authorities and protective measures; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Emphasizes </i>the important role that media organizations can play in providing 
</p>
<p>adequate safety, risk awareness, digital security and self-protection training and guidance to 
</p>
<p>employees, together with protective equipment, where necessary; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Welcomes</i> the proclamation by the General Assembly, in its resolution

<p>regard to ensuring the safety of journalists, including with regional organizations, and 
</p>
<p>invites United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, other international and regional 
</p>
<p>organizations, Member States and all relevant stakeholders, when applicable and in the 
</p>
<p>scope of their mandates, to cooperate further in the implementation of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity, and to this end also 
</p>
<p>calls upon States to cooperate with relevant United Nations entities, in particular the United
