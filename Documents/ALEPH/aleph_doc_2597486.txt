WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC
MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH
INCORPORATED
J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC
As Representatives of the Underwriters
c/o Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
375 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10152
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Introductory.  SM Energy Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), proposes to issue
and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (the “Underwriters”), for whom
you (the “Representatives”) are acting as representatives, 16,000,000 shares (the “Firm
Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”).
The respective amounts of the Firm Shares to be so purchased by the several Underwriters are
set forth opposite their names in Schedule A hereto. The Company also proposes to grant to the
Underwriters an option to purchase up to 2,400,000 additional shares of the Common Stock (the
“Option Shares”) on the terms set forth in Section 2. The Firm Shares and the Option Shares, if
purchased, are herein collectively called the “Securities.” To the extent there are no additional
underwriters listed on Schedule A other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall
mean you as the Underwriters, and the terms Representatives and Underwriters shall mean
either the singular or plural as the context requires.  The use of the neuter in this Underwriting
Agreement (the “Agreement”) shall include the feminine and masculine wherever appropriate.
The Company hereby confirms its agreements with the Underwriters as follows:
SECTION 1.                                      Representations and Warranties.  The Company represents and
warrants to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters as of the date hereof that:
(a)                                             Registration Statement.  The Company has prepared and filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) a registration statement on Form S-3
(File No. 333-203936), including a post-effective amendment thereto, which contains a base
prospectus (the “Base Prospectus”), to be used in connection with the public offering and sale
of the Securities.  Such registration statement, as amended, including the financial statements,
exhibits and schedules thereto, at each time of effectiveness under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the “Securities
Act”), including any required
information deemed to be a part thereof at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B or 430C under the
Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the “Exchange Act”), is called the “Registration Statement.”  Any preliminary prospectus
supplement relating to the Securities that is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), together with the Base
Prospectus, is hereafter called a “Preliminary Prospectus.”  The term “Prospectus” shall mean the final prospectus
supplement relating to the Securities that is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) after the date and time that this
Agreement is executed and delivered by the parties hereto, including the Base Prospectus.  Any reference herein to
the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the
documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act; any reference
to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and
include any documents filed after the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under
the Exchange Act, and incorporated by reference in such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be;
and any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any
annual report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the effective date of
the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.
(b)                                             Compliance with Registration Requirements.  The Company meets the
requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act.  The Registration Statement has
become effective upon filing with the Commission under the Securities Act.  No stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect, the Commission has not
issued any order or notice preventing or suspending the use of the Registration Statement, any
Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus and no proceedings for such purpose or pursuant to
Section 8A of the Securities Act have been instituted or are pending or, to the best knowledge of
the Company, are contemplated or threatened by the Commission.
Each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus when filed complied in all material respects with the
Securities Act.  Each of the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, at each time of
effectiveness, at the date hereof and at the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3(a) hereof) and any Option Closing
Date (as defined in Section 2(b) hereof), complied and will comply in all material respects with the Securities Act and
did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented, as of its date, at the time of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) and, at the Closing Date and any Option
Closing Date, did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.  The representations and warranties set forth in the two immediately preceding sentences do not apply to
statements in or omissions from the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto, or the
Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto, made in reliance upon and in
conformity with
2
information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Representatives expressly for use
therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Representatives consists of
the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof.
The documents incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement,
the Disclosure Package (as defined herein) and the Prospectus, when they were filed or hereafter are filed with the
Commission (the “Incorporated Documents”) conformed and will conform in all material respects to the requirements
of the Exchange Act.  Any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents are
filed with the Commission will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act.  All
documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure
Package and the Prospectus, as of their respective dates, when taken together with the other information in the
Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time and, when taken together with the other information in the Prospectus, at
the Closing Date and any Option Closing Date, did not or will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.
(c)                                              Well-Known Seasoned Issuer.  (i) At the time of filing the Registration
Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying
with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective
amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form
of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the
meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c) of the Securities Act) made any offer relating to the
Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163 of the Securities Act, and (iv) at the
Applicable Time (with such date and time being used as the determination date for purposes of
this clause (iv)), the Company was and is a “well known seasoned issuer” as defined in Rule 405
of the Securities Act.  The Registration Statement is an “automatic shelf registration statement,”
as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act that has been filed with the Commission not earlier
than three years prior to the Closing Date; the Company has not received from the Commission
any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act objecting to use of the automatic shelf
registration statement form; and the Company has not otherwise ceased to be eligible to use the
automatic shelf registration form.
(d)                                             Disclosure Package.  The term “Disclosure Package” shall mean (i) the
Preliminary Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, (ii) the issuer free writing prospectuses
as defined in Rule 433 of the Securities Act (each, an “Issuer Free Writing Prospectus”), if any,
identified in Schedule B hereto, (iii) any other free writing prospectus that the parties hereto shall
hereafter expressly agree in writing to treat as part of the Disclosure Package and (iv) a final term
sheet in a form approved by the Representatives, and will file such term sheet pursuant to
Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act within the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the
“Final Term
3
Sheet”), which shall be included herein as Annex I.  As of 9:30 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of
this Agreement (the “Applicable Time”), the Disclosure Package did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.  The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the
Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being
understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any
Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof.
(e)                                              Company Not Ineligible Issuer.  (i) At the earliest time after the filing of the
Registration Statement relating to the Securities that the Company or another offering participant
made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the Securities Act and (ii) as of
the Applicable Time (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this
clause (ii)), the Company was not and is not an “ineligible issuer” (as defined in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act), without taking account of any determination by the Commission pursuant to
Rule 405 of the Securities Act that it is not necessary that the Company be considered an
“ineligible issuer.”
(f)                                               Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses.  Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as
of its issue date and at all subsequent times through the Closing Date or any Option Closing
Date or until any earlier date that the Company notified or notifies the Representatives as
described in the next sentence, did not, does not and will not include any information that
conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement,
the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.  If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in the
Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, the Company has promptly
notified or will promptly notify the Representatives and has promptly amended or supplemented
or will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus
to eliminate or correct such conflict.  Any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus not identified on
Schedule B, when taken together with the Disclosure Package, did not, and at the Closing Date
and any Option Closing Date will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The foregoing three sentences do
not apply to statements in or omissions from any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus based upon and
in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the
Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such
information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in
Section 8(b) hereof.
(g)                                              Distribution of Offering Material by the Company. The Company has not
distributed and will not distribute, prior to the later of the Closing Date, any Option Closing Date
and the completion of the Underwriters’ distribution of the Securities, any offering material in
connection with the offering and sale of the Securities other than the
4
Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus reviewed and consented to by the
Representatives.
(h)                                             The Underwriting Agreement. This Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company.
(i)                                                 Authorization of Securities.  The Securities have been duly authorized for
issuance and sale to the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement and, when issued and
delivered by the Company, pursuant to this Agreement against payment of the consideration set
forth herein, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; no holder of the Securities is or
will be subject to personal liability by reason of being such a holder; and the issuance of the
Securities is not subject to any preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or other similar rights of
any security holder of the Company or any other person.
(j)                                                Absence of Registration Rights.  There are no persons with registration
rights or other similar rights to have any securities (debt or equity) (A) registered pursuant to the
Registration Statement or included in the offering contemplated by this Agreement or
(B) otherwise registered by the Company under the Securities Act, except with respect to
registration rights which have already been satisfied by the Company. There are no persons with
tag-along rights or other similar rights to have any securities (debt or equity) included in the
offering contemplated by this Agreement or sold in connection with the sale of Securities by the
Company pursuant to this Agreement.
(k)                                             No Material Adverse Change.  Except as otherwise disclosed in the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto): 
(i) there has been no material adverse change, or any development that could reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the
earnings, business, operations or business prospects, whether or not arising from transactions in
the ordinary course of business, of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one entity
(any such change is called a “Material Adverse Change”); (ii) the Company and its subsidiaries,
considered as one entity, have not incurred any material liability or obligation, indirect, direct or
contingent, not in the ordinary course of business nor entered into any material transaction or
agreement not in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) there has been no dividend or
distribution of any kind declared, paid or made by the Company, except for (A) dividends paid to
the Company or other subsidiaries, any of its subsidiaries on any class of capital stock or
repurchase or redemption by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any class of capital stock
and (B) cash dividends paid by the Company of $0.05 per share of the Company’s Common
Stock paid on May 4, 2016.
(l)                                                 Independent Accountants.  Ernst & Young LLP, which expressed its
opinion with respect to certain financial statements (which term as used in this Agreement
includes the related notes thereto) and supporting schedules filed with the Commission and
incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, is an independent
registered public accounting firm within the meaning of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
5
and any non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young LLP to the Company have been approved by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.
(m)                                         Preparation of the Financial Statements.  The financial statements, together
with the related schedules and notes, incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and
the Prospectus present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
entities to which they relate as of and at the dates indicated and the results of their operations
and cash flows for the periods specified.  Such financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States
(“GAAP”) on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved, except as may be expressly
stated in the related notes thereto.  The financial data set forth in the Disclosure Package and the
Prospectus under the caption “Prospectus Supplement Summary—Summary Consolidated
Historical Financial Information” fairly presents in all material respects the information set forth
therein on a basis consistent with that of the audited financial statements incorporated by
reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.  Nothing has come to the attention of
the Company and its subsidiaries that has caused them to believe that the statistical and market-
related data and forward-looking statements included in the Disclosure Package and the
Prospectus are not based on or derived from sources that are reliable and accurate in all material
respects.  The interactive data in eXtensible Business Reporting Language incorporated by
reference in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus fairly presents in all material respects
the information contained therein and has been prepared in accordance with the Commission’s
rules and guidelines applicable thereto in all material respects.
(n)                                             Good Standing of the Company.  The Company has been duly incorporated
and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and has corporate power and corporate authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and to enter
into and perform its obligations under, or as contemplated by, this Agreement. The Company is
duly qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each other
jurisdiction in which such qualification is required, whether by reason of the ownership or leasing
of property or the conduct of business, except where the failure so to qualify or to be in good
standing would not result in a Material Adverse Change.
(o)                                             No Significant Subsidiaries.  The subsidiaries of the Company, considered
in the aggregate as a single subsidiary, do not constitute a “significant subsidiary” as defined in
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X.  Except for WCT Leasing LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
and Boot Leasing LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the Company does not own or
control, directly or indirectly, any corporation, association or other entity other than the
subsidiaries listed in Exhibit 21.1 to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015.
(p)                                             Capitalization.  The authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company are as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and
the Prospectus in the column entitled “Actual” under the caption
6
“Capitalization” (except for subsequent issuances, if any, pursuant to reservations, agreements or employee benefit
plans referred to in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus). The shares of issued and outstanding capital stock
of the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable; none of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company was issued in violation of preemptive rights, rights of first refusal
or other similar rights to subscribe for or purchase securities of the Company.
(q)                                             Description of the Securities.  The shares of issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Company conform in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the
Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and Prospectus. The form of the certificates for the
Securities conforms to the corporate law of the jurisdiction of the Company’s incorporation and to
any requirements of the Company’s organizational documents.
(r)                                                Corporate Power.  The Company has full right, power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder; and
all action required to be taken for the due and proper authorization, execution and delivery of
each of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby has
been duly and validly taken.
(s)                                               Absence of Defaults and Conflicts. The Company is not in violation of its
charter or by-laws or other governing documents or in default in the performance or observance
of any obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit agreement, note, lease or other agreement or instrument to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which or any of them may be bound,
or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject (collectively, “Agreements
and Instruments”) except for such violations or defaults that would not, singly or in the
aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Change; and the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and in the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (including the issuance and sale of the Securities and
the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities as described in the Disclosure Package
and the Prospectus under the caption “Use of Proceeds”) and compliance by the Company with
its obligations hereunder do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or
passage of time or both, (A) conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default or Repayment Event
(as defined below) under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company pursuant to, the Agreements and
Instruments, (B) result in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws of the Company
or (C) result in any violation of any applicable law, statute, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ
or decree of any government, government instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign, having
jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their assets, properties or
operations (except, with respect to clauses (A) and (C) only, for such conflicts, breaches or
defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that would not, singly or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Change and materially adversely affect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby). As used herein, a “Repayment Event” means any event or
7
condition which gives the holder of any note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness (or any person acting on
such holder’s behalf) the right to require the repurchase, redemption or repayment of all or a portion of such
indebtedness by the Company.
(t)                                                Absence of Proceedings. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or
investigation before or brought by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign,
now pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against or affecting the Company
or any of its subsidiaries which is required to be disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the
Prospectus (other than as disclosed therein), or which might reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Change, or which might reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder. The aggregate of all pending legal or governmental proceedings to which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their respective property or
assets is the subject which are not described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus,
including ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.
(u)                                             Possession of Intellectual Property. The Company and its subsidiaries own
or possess, or can acquire on reasonable terms, adequate patents, patent rights, licenses,
inventions, copyrights, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or
unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), trademarks, service
marks, trade names or other intellectual property (collectively, “Intellectual Property”) necessary
to carry on the business now operated by them, and neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has received any notice or is otherwise aware of any infringement of or conflict with
asserted rights of others with respect to any Intellectual Property or of any facts or circumstances
which would render any Intellectual Property invalid or inadequate to protect the interest of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries therein, and which infringement or conflict (if the subject of
any unfavorable decision, ruling or finding) or invalidity or inadequacy, singly or in the aggregate,
would result in a Material Adverse Change.
(v)                                             Absence of Further Requirements. No filing with, or authorization, approval,
consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental
authority or agency is necessary or required for the performance by the Company of its
obligations under this Agreement, in connection with the offering, issuance or sale of the
Securities hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except such as have been already obtained or as may be required under the Securities Act, the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange, state securities laws or the rules of Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”).
(w)                                           Possession of Licenses and Permits. The Company possesses such
permits, licenses, approvals, consents and other authorizations (collectively, “Governmental
Licenses”) issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory agencies or bodies
necessary to conduct the business now operated by it; the Company is in compliance with the
terms and conditions of all such Governmental
8
Licenses, except where the failure so to comply would not, singly or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Change; all of the Governmental Licenses are valid and in full force and effect, except where the invalidity of such
Governmental Licenses or the failure of such Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a
Material Adverse Change; and the Company has not received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or
modification of, or non-compliance with, any such Governmental Licenses which, singly or in the aggregate, if the
subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would result in a Material Adverse Change.
(x)                                             Title to Property. The Company and its subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to all material real property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries,
including without limitation, all oil and gas properties, and good title to all other properties owned
by them including, without limitation, all assets and facilities used by the Company and its
subsidiaries in the production and marketing of oil and gas, in each case, free and clear of all
mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions or encumbrances of any kind
except such as (i) are described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or (ii) where the
failure to hold such title would not, singly or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse
Change; and all of the leases and subleases of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as
one enterprise, and under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries holds properties
described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, including, without limitation, all oil and
gas producing properties of the Company and its subsidiaries and all assets and facilities used
by the Company and its subsidiaries in the production and marketing of oil and gas, are in full
force and effect, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any notice of any claim
of any sort that has been asserted by anyone adverse to the rights of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries under any of the leases or subleases mentioned above, or affecting or questioning
the rights of the Company or any such subsidiary to the continued possession of the leased or
subleased premises under any such lease or sublease, except where the failure of a lease or
sublease to be in full force and effect or the existence of any such claim would not, singly or in
the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Change.
(y)                                             Environmental Laws. Except as described in the Disclosure Package and
the Prospectus and except such matters as would not, singly or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Change, (i) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in violation of any
federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, policy or rule of
common law or any judicial or administrative interpretation thereof, including any judicial or
administrative order, consent, decree or judgment, relating to pollution or protection of the
environment (including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water, groundwater, land surface
or subsurface strata) or wildlife, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to the
release or threatened release of chemicals, pollutants, contaminants, wastes, toxic substances,
hazardous substances, petroleum or petroleum products or asbestos containing materials
(collectively, “Hazardous Materials”) or to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use,
treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of Hazardous Materials (collectively,
“Environmental Laws”); (ii) the Company and its subsidiaries have all permits, authorizations
and approvals required under applicable Environmental Laws for their operations as presently
conducted and are each in compliance with their
9
requirements; (iii) there are no pending or threatened administrative, regulatory or judicial actions, suits, written
demands, claims, liens, notices of noncompliance or violation, investigation or proceedings arising pursuant to any
Environmental Law asserted against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (iv) to the knowledge of the
Company, there are no events or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to form the basis of an order for
clean-up or remediation, or an action, suit or proceeding by any private party or governmental body or agency, against
or affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries relating to Hazardous Materials or Environmental Laws or the
violation of any Environmental Laws.
(z)                                              Independent Petroleum Engineers. Ryder Scott Company, L.P., whose
report as of December 31, 2015 is referenced in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus
was, as of the date of such report, and is, as of the date hereof, an independent petroleum
engineer with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries.
(aa)                                      Accuracy of Reserve Information. The oil and natural gas reserve estimates of
the Company and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 contained in the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are derived from reports that have been prepared by, or
have been audited by, Ryder Scott Company, L.P., as set forth and to the extent indicated
therein, and such estimates fairly reflect the oil and natural gas reserves of the Company and its
subsidiaries, as applicable, at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance, in all material
respects, with Commission guidelines applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved.
(bb)                                      Oil and Gas Agreements. The participation agreements, joint development
agreements, joint operating agreements, farm-out agreements and other agreements described
in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus relating to the Company’s or its subsidiaries’
rights with respect to the ownership, lease or operation of oil and gas properties, the acquisition
of interests in oil and gas properties or the exploration for, development of or production of oil and
gas reserves thereon, constitute valid and binding agreements of the Company and, to the
knowledge of the Company without inquiry, of the other parties thereto, enforceable against the
Company and/or its subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with their terms, except as the
enforcement thereof may be limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.
(cc)                                        Accounting Controls and Disclosure Controls. The Company and each of its
subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or
specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management’s general or specific
authorization; (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences; and (v) the
interactive data in eXtensible Business Reporting Language incorporated by reference in the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus fairly presents in all material respects the information
contained therein and has been prepared in accordance with the Commission’s rules and
guidelines
10
applicable thereto in all material respects. Since the end of the Company’s most recent audited fiscal year, there has
been (1) no material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated)
and (2) except as disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, no change in the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting. The Company and its subsidiaries employ disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and
forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer
or officers and principal financial officer or officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
(dd)                                      Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. There is and has been no failure
on the part of the Company or any of the Company’s directors or officers, in their capacities as
such, to comply in all material respects with any provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
the rules and regulations promulgated in connection therewith, including Section 402 related to
loans and Sections 302 and 906 related to certifications.
(ee)                                        Payment of Taxes.  Except as otherwise disclosed in the Disclosure
Package and the Prospectus or as would not, singly or in the aggregate, result in a Material
Adverse Change, (i) the Company and its subsidiaries have paid all federal, state, local and
foreign taxes and filed all tax returns required to be paid or filed through the date hereof and
(ii) there is no tax deficiency that has been, or could reasonably be expected to be, asserted
against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets.
(ff)                                          Insurance. The Company and its subsidiaries have insurance covering their
respective properties, operations, personnel and business, in such amounts and covering such
risks as is reasonably adequate to protect the Company, its subsidiaries and their businesses.
The Company has no reason to believe that it or any subsidiary will not be able (i) to renew its
existing insurance coverage as and when such policies expire or (ii) to obtain comparable
coverage from similar institutions as may be necessary or appropriate to conduct its business as
now conducted and at a cost that would not result in a Material Adverse Change.
(gg)                                        No Price Stabilization or Manipulation.  The Company has not taken and will
not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that might be reasonably expected to
cause or result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to
facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.
(hh)                                      Investment Company Act.  The Company is not required, and upon the
issuance and sale of the Securities as herein contemplated and the application of the net
proceeds therefrom as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus will not be
11
required, to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
(ii)                                              ERISA Compliance.  Except as otherwise disclosed in the Disclosure
Package and the Prospectus, the Company and its subsidiaries and any “employee benefit plan”
(as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (as
amended, “ERISA,” which term, as used herein, includes the regulations and published
interpretations thereunder)) established or maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries or their
ERISA Affiliates (as defined below) are in compliance in all material respects with ERISA and, to
the knowledge of the Company, each “multiemployer plan” (as defined in Section 4001 of
ERISA) to which the Company, its subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate contributes (a
“Multiemployer Plan”) is in compliance in all material respects with ERISA.  “ERISA Affiliate”
means, with respect to the Company or a subsidiary, any member of any group of organizations
described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended,
the “Code,” which term, as used herein, includes the regulations and published interpretations
thereunder) of which the Company or such subsidiary is or, within the last six years, has been a
member.  No “reportable event” (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur with respect to any “employee benefit plan” established or
maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates.  No “single
employer plan” (as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA) established or maintained by the
Company, its subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates, if such “employee benefit plan” were
terminated, would have any “amount of unfunded benefit liabilities” (as defined in Section 4001 of
ERISA) that would, singly or in the aggregate (with any other such “single employer plan”),
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.  Neither the Company, its
subsidiaries nor any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred or reasonably expects to incur any
liability (i) under Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or withdrawal from, any
“employee benefit plan” or (ii) that would, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Change under Sections 430, 4971, 4975 or 4980B of the Code.  To
the knowledge of the Company, each “employee benefit plan” established or maintained by the
Company, its subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401 of the Code is so qualified and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure to
act, which would cause the loss of such qualification.
(jj)                                            Compliance with Labor Laws.  Except as otherwise disclosed in the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result
in a Material Adverse Change, (i) there is (A) no unfair labor practice complaint pending or, to the
best of the Company’s knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries
before the National Labor Relations Board, and no grievance or arbitration proceeding arising
out of or under collective bargaining agreements pending, or to the best of the Company’s
knowledge, threatened, against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (B) no strike, labor
dispute, slowdown or stoppage pending or, to the best of the Company’s knowledge, threatened
against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and (C) no union representation question existing
with respect to the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and, to the best of the
Company’s knowledge, no union organizing activities taking place and (ii) there has been no
violation of any
12
federal, state or local law relating to discrimination in hiring, promotion or pay of employees or of any applicable wage
or hour laws.
(kk)                                      Related Party Transactions.  No relationship, direct or indirect, or transaction
exists between or among any of the Company or any affiliate of the Company, on the one hand,
and any director, officer, member, stockholder, customer or supplier of the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company, on the other hand, which is required by the Securities Act to be
disclosed in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which is not so
disclosed.  Except as otherwise disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there
are no outstanding loans, advances (except advances for business expenses in the ordinary
course of business) or guarantees of indebtedness by the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company to or for the benefit of any of the officers or directors of the Company or any Affiliate of
the Company or any of their respective family members.
(ll)                                              Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries nor any director, officer, or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries nor,
to the knowledge of the Company any agent, affiliate or other person associated with or acting on
behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has (i) used any funds for any unlawful
contribution, gift, entertainment or other unlawful expense relating to political activity; (ii) made or
taken an act in furtherance of an offer, promise or authorization of any direct or indirect unlawful
payment or benefit to any foreign or domestic government or regulatory official or employee,
including of any government-owned or controlled entity or of a public international organization,
or any person acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any of the foregoing, or any political
party or party official or candidate for political office; (iii) violated or is in violation of any provision
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any applicable law or regulation
implementing the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
International Business Transactions, or committed an offence under the Bribery Act 2010 of the
United Kingdom, or any other applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws; or (iv) made, offered,
agreed, requested or taken an act in furtherance of any unlawful bribe or other unlawful benefit,
including, without limitation, any rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other unlawful or
improper payment or benefit.  The Company and its subsidiaries have instituted, and maintain
and enforce, policies and procedures designed to promote and ensure compliance with all
applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.
(mm)                              Money Laundering Laws. The operations of the Company and its subsidiaries
are and have been conducted at all times in compliance with applicable financial recordkeeping
and reporting requirements, including those of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting
Act of 1970, as amended, the applicable money laundering statutes of all jurisdictions where the
Company or any of its subsidiaries conducts business, the rules and regulations thereunder and
any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines issued, administered or enforced by any
governmental or regulatory agency (collectively, the “Anti-Money Laundering Laws”) and no
action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental or regulatory agency, authority
or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to
13
the Anti-Money Laundering Laws is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.
(nn)                                      No Conflict with Sanctions Laws. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any agent,
or affiliate or other person associated with or acting on behalf of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is currently the subject or the target of any sanctions administered or enforced by the
U.S. Government, (including, without limitation, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”) or the U.S. Department of State and including, without
limitation, the designation as a “specially designated national” or “blocked person”), the United
Nations Security Council (“UNSC”), the European Union, Her Majesty’s Treasury (“HMT”), or
other relevant sanctions authority (collectively, “Sanctions”), nor is the Company, any of its
subsidiaries located, organized or resident in a country or territory that is the subject or the target
of Sanctions, including, without limitation, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria (each, a
“Sanctioned Country”); and the Company will not directly or indirectly use the proceeds of the
offering of the Securities hereunder, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available such
proceeds to any subsidiary, joint venture partner or other person or entity (i) to fund or facilitate
any activities of or business with any person that, at the time of such funding or facilitation, is the
subject or the target of Sanctions, (ii) to fund or facilitate any activities of or business in any
Sanctioned Country or (iii) in any other manner that will result in a violation by any person
(including any person participating in the transaction, whether as initial purchaser, advisor,
investor or otherwise) of Sanctions.  For the past 5 years, the Company and its subsidiaries have
not knowingly engaged in and are not now knowingly engaged in any dealings or transactions
with any person that at the time of the dealing or transaction is or was the subject or the target of
Sanctions or with any Sanctioned Country.
(oo)                                      Forward-Looking Statements.  No forward-looking statement (within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act) contained in
the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus has been made or reaffirmed without a reasonable
basis or has been disclosed other than in good faith.
Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and delivered to the Representatives or
to counsel for the Underwriters shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Company to each
Underwriter as to the matters covered thereby.
SECTION 2.                            Purchase and Sale.  Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance
upon the representations, warranties and agreements herein set forth, the Company agrees to
sell to the Underwriters and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from
the Company, at a price of $28.875 per share, the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the
name of each Underwriter on Schedule A hereof, subject to adjustments in accordance with
Section 10 hereof.
In addition, subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations, warranties and agreements
herein set forth, the Company grants to the Underwriters an option to
14
purchase up to 2,400,000 Option Shares at the same price per share to be paid by the Underwriters to the Company
for the Firm Shares; provided, however, that the amount paid by the Underwriters for any Option Shares shall be
reduced by an amount per share equal to any dividends declared by the Company and payable on the Firm Shares but
not payable on such Option Shares. Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase the number of
Option Shares (subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional shares as the Representative may determine) that
bears the same proportion to the total number of shares of Option Shares to be sold as the number of Firm Shares set
forth on Schedule A hereto opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the total number of Firm Shares. The
option granted hereby may be exercised by the Representatives on behalf of the several Underwriters at any time and
from time to time on or before the 30th day following the date of the Prospectus, by written notice to the Company. 
Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option shares as to which the option granted hereby is being
exercised and the date and time when the Option Shares are to be delivered (any such time and date being herein
referred to as the “Option Closing Date”); provided, however, that no Option Closing Date shall be earlier than the
Closing Date (as defined below) nor earlier than the second business day after the date on which the option shall have
been exercised for any exercise of the option after the Closing Date nor later than the fifth business day after the date
on which the option shall have been exercised.
SECTION 3.                            Delivery and Payment; Representations and Warranties and Covenants of
the Underwriters.
(a)                                       Delivery and Payment for the Firm Shares.  Delivery of and payment for the
Firm Shares shall be made at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., 2001 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas
75201 (or such other place as may be agreed to by the Company and the Representatives) at
9:00 a.m. New York City time, on August 12, 2016, or such other time and date as the
Representatives shall designate by notice to the Company (the time and date of such closing are
called the “Closing Date”).  Payment for the Firm Shares shall be made on the Closing Date by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the order of the Company. It is understood that the
Representatives have been authorized, for their own account and the accounts of the several
Underwriters, to accept delivery of and receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for,
the Firm Shares.  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, individually and not as the Representative of the
Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment for any Firm Shares to be
purchased by any Underwriter whose funds shall not have been received by the Representatives
by the Closing Date for the account of such Underwriter, but any such payment shall not relieve
such Underwriter from any of its obligations under this Agreement. Delivery of the Firm Shares
shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) unless the
Representatives shall otherwise instruct.  Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time
and place specified in this Agreement is a further condition to the obligations of the Underwriters.
(b)                                       Delivery and Payment for the Option Shares. Delivery of the Option Shares by
the Company and payment for the Option Shares by the several Underwriters through the
Representative shall be made at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Option Closing Date or at
such other date or place as shall be determined by agreement between the Representative and
the Company.  Payment for the Option Shares shall be made on any Option Closing Date by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the order of the Company.  It is understood that the
15
Representatives have been authorized, for their own account and the accounts of the several Underwriters, to accept
delivery of and receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for, the Option Shares. Wells Fargo Securities,
LLC, individually and not as the Representative of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment
for any Option Shares to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds shall not have been received by the
Representatives by any Option Closing Date for the account of such Underwriter, but any such payment shall not
relieve such Underwriter from any of its obligations under this Agreement. Delivery of the Option Shares shall be
made through the facilities of DTC unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.  Time shall be of the essence,
and delivery at the time and place specified in this Agreement is a further condition to the obligations of the
Underwriters.
(c)                                        Delivery of the Prospectus to the Underwriters.  Not later than 10:00 a.m. on
the second business day following the date the Securities are first released by the Underwriters
for sale to the public, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered, copies of the
Prospectus in such quantities and at such places as the Representatives shall reasonably
request.
SECTION 4.                            Additional Covenants.  The Company further covenants and agrees with
each Underwriter as follows:
(a)                                       Representatives Review of Proposed Amendments and Supplements.  During
the period beginning at the Applicable Time and ending on the later of the Closing Date, any
Option Closing Date or such date, as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, the
Prospectus is no longer required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an
Underwriter or dealer, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied
pursuant to Rule 172 (the “Prospectus Delivery Period”), prior to amending or supplementing
the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, the Company shall
furnish to the Representatives for review a copy of each such proposed amendment or
supplement, and the Company shall not file or use any such proposed amendment or
supplement to which the Representatives reasonably object.
(b)                                       Securities Act Compliance.  After the date of this Agreement and during the
Prospectus Delivery Period, the Company shall promptly advise the Representatives in writing
(i) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Applicable Time, shall have become
effective, (ii) of the receipt of any comments of, or requests for additional or supplemental
information from, the Commission, (iii) of the time and date of any filing of any post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary
Prospectus or the Prospectus, (iv) of the time and date that any post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement becomes effective, and (v) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any order or notice
preventing or suspending the use of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or
the Prospectus, or of any receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or of the threatening or
initiation of any proceedings for any of such purposes (including any notice or order pursuant to
Section 8A or Rule 401(g)(2) of the Securities Act).  The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notice of prevention or
suspension of such use.  If the Commission shall enter any such stop order or issue any such
notice at any time, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the lifting or
16
reversal of such order or notice at the earliest possible moment, or, subject to Section 4(a), will file an amendment to
the Registration Statement or will file a new registration statement and use its best efforts to have such amendment
or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.  Additionally, the Company agrees that it
shall comply with the provisions of Rules 424(b) and 430B, as applicable, under the Securities Act, including with
respect to the timely filing of documents thereunder, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to confirm that any
filings made by the Company under such Rule 424(b) were received in a timely manner by the Commission.
(c)                                        Exchange Act Compliance.  During the Prospectus Delivery Period, the
Company will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13,
14 or 15 of the Exchange Act in the manner and within the time periods required by the
Exchange Act.
(d)                                       Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses The Company represents that it has not
made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will
not make, any offer relating to the Securities that constitutes or would constitute an Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus or that otherwise constitutes or would constitute a “free writing prospectus”
(as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) or a portion thereof required to be filed by the
Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Securities Act;
provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives hereto shall be deemed to have
been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule B hereto and any
electronic road show.  Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is
hereinafter referred to as a “Permitted Free Writing Prospectus.”  The Company agrees that
(i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with
the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free
Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and
record keeping. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing
prospectus that (a) is not an “issuer free writing prospectus” as defined in Rule 433, or
(b) contains only (1) information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities or their
offering, (2) information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is
included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in Section 1(d) or (3) information
permitted under Rule 134 under the Securities Act; provided that each Underwriter severally
covenants with the Company not to take any action without the Company’s consent which
consent shall be confirmed in writing that would result in the Company being required to file with
the Commission under Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act a free writing prospectus prepared
by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the
Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
(e)                                        Amendments and Supplements to the Registration Statement, Disclosure
Package and Prospectus and Other Securities Act Matters.  If, during the Prospectus Delivery
Period, any event or development shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the
Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or then
prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or
supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any
document incorporated by reference in the
17
Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading, or if in the opinion of the
Representatives it is otherwise necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Disclosure
Package or the Prospectus, or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the
Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or to file a new registration statement containing the Prospectus, in order to
comply with law, including in connection with the delivery of the Prospectus, the Company agrees to (i) notify the
Representatives of any such event or condition and (ii) promptly prepare (subject to Section 4(a) and 4(e) hereof), file
with the Commission (and use its commercially reasonable efforts to have any amendment to the Registration
Statement or any new registration statement to be declared effective) and furnish at its own expense to the
Underwriters and to dealers, amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or
the Prospectus, or any new registration statement, necessary in order to make the statements in the Disclosure
Package or the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made or then prevailing, as the case may be, not misleading or so that the Registration Statement, the Disclosure
Package or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.
(f)                                         Copies of the Registration Statements and the Prospectus.  The Company
will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters signed copies of the
Registration Statement and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or
incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference therein) and, during the Prospectus Delivery Period, as many copies of each
Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any supplement thereto and the Disclosure Package
as the Representatives may reasonably request.
(g)                                        Blue Sky Compliance.  The Company shall cooperate with the
Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters to qualify or register the Securities for sale
under (or obtain exemptions from the application of) the state securities or blue sky laws or
Canadian provincial securities laws or other foreign laws of those jurisdictions designated by the
Representatives and consented to by the Company, and the Company shall comply in all
material respects with such laws and shall continue such qualifications, registrations and
exemptions in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities.  The Company shall
not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation or other entity or as a dealer in securities in
any such jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to so qualify, (ii) file any general
consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such
jurisdiction if it is not otherwise so subject.  The Company will advise the Representatives

harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees, and each person, if
any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which such Underwriter,
affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at
common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected
with the written consent of the Company), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based:  (i) upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement, or any amendment thereto, including any information deemed to be a part thereof
pursuant to Rule 430B or 430C under the Securities Act, or the omission or alleged omission
therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading; or (ii) upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing), or the omission or alleged
omission therefrom of a material fact, in each case, necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (iii) in
whole or in part upon any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the Company
contained herein; (iv) in whole or in part upon any failure of the Company to perform its
obligations hereunder or under law; (v) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act
by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the offering contemplated
hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or
action arising out of or based upon any matter covered by clauses (i) or (ii) above, provided that
the Company shall not be liable under this clause (v) to the extent that a court of competent
24
jurisdiction shall have determined by a final judgment that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action resulted directly
from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by such Underwriter through its gross
negligence or willful misconduct; and to reimburse each Underwriter and each such affiliate, director, officer, employee
or controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by Wells
Fargo Securities, LLC pursuant to Section 8(c)) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or
such affiliate, director, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling,
compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action; provided, however, that the
foregoing indemnity agreement and expense reimbursement obligation shall not apply, with respect to an Underwriter,
to any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use
in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or
any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing).  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall
be in addition to any liabilities that the Company may otherwise have.
(b)                                 Indemnification of the Company.  Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not
jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors and each person, if any,
who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against
any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Company or any such
director or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or
other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in
settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written consent of such
Underwriter), insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect
thereof as contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), or arises out of or is based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein (in the case of the Registration Statement) or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, and only to
the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any
Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter
through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and to reimburse the Company and each
such director or controlling person for any and all expenses (including the fees and
disbursements of counsel) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by the Company or such
director or controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling, compromising
or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or action.  The Company hereby
acknowledges that the only information that the Underwriters through the Representatives have
furnished to the Company expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) are the statements set forth in the eleventh and twelfth paragraphs under the
caption “Underwriting” in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the
25
Prospectus.  The indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any liabilities that each
Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c)                                  Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures.  Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party
under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof;
provided that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to any indemnified party under this Section 8 except to the extent that it has
been materially prejudiced by such failure (through the forfeiture of substantive rights and
defenses) and shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that the indemnifying
party may have to an indemnified party other than under this Section 8.  In case any such action
is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek
indemnity from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and,
to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by
written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from
such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action include both the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that a conflict may arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to
those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to
select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the
defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.  Upon receipt of notice from
the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party’s election so to
assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the
indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the
indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel
(together with local counsel (in each jurisdiction)), which shall be selected by Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC in the case of counsel representing the Underwriters or their related persons),
representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action; or (ii) the indemnifying party
shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the
indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of
which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
(d)                                 Settlements.  The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for
any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the
plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party
shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise
or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in
respect
26
of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder
by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of
such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding; and
(ii) does not include any statements as to or any findings of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any
indemnified party.
SECTION 9.                            Contribution.  If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for
any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified
party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then
each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of
the Securities pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is
not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one
hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The
relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other
hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be
deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the
Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company,
and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the
cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities
as set forth on the such cover.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the
Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or
warranty relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters,
on the other hand, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or inaccuracy.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to
above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8 hereof, any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.  The
provisions set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim
for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; provided, however, that no additional notice shall be required with
respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8 hereof for purposes of indemnification.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose)
or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this
Section 9.
27
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the discount received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities distributed by it.  No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters’ obligations to contribute
pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective commitments as set forth
opposite their names in Schedule A.  For purposes of this Section 9, each affiliate, director, officer and employee of
an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, and
each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall
have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
SECTION 10.                     Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters.  If, on the Closing Date
or any Option Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to
purchase Firm Shares or Option Shares, as applicable, that it or they have agreed to purchase
hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Firm Shares or Option Shares, as
applicable, which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to
purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of the Securities to be purchased on
such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the number
of Firm Shares and Option Shares to be purchased set forth opposite their respective names on
Schedule A bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all
such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the
Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase the Firm
Shares or Option Shares, which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or
refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date or any Option Closing Date, any one or
more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase the Firm Shares or Option Shares, as
applicable, and the number of Firm Shares or Option Shares, as applicable, with respect to which
such default occurs exceeds 10% of the number of Firm Shares or Option Shares, as applicable,
to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the
Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this
Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the
provisions of Sections 5, 7, 8 and 9 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such
termination.  In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to
postpone the Closing Date or any Option Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven
days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or
arrangements may be effected.  As used in this Agreement, the term “Underwriter” shall be
deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. 
Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability
in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
SECTION 11.                     Termination of this Agreement.  Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement
may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time: 
(i) trading or quotation in any of the Company’s securities shall have been suspended or limited
by the Commission or by the NYSE; (ii) trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq Stock
Market or the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall
28
have been generally established on any of such stock exchange by the Commission or FINRA; (iii) a general banking
moratorium shall have been declared by any federal or New York authorities; (iv) there shall have occurred any
outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United
States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial
change in United States’ or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the
Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering sale or
delivery of the Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or to enforce contracts
for the sale of securities; (v) in the judgment of the Representatives there shall have occurred any Material Adverse
Change; or (vi) the Company shall have sustained a loss by strike, fire, flood, earthquake, accident or other calamity
of such character as in the judgment of the Representatives may interfere materially with the conduct of the business
and operations of the Company regardless of whether or not such loss shall have been insured.  Any termination
pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of (1) the Company to any Underwriter, except that the
Company shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 5 and 7 hereof;
(2) any Underwriter to the Company; or (3) any party hereto to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 8
and 9 hereof shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.
SECTION 12.                     Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery.  The respective
indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, its
directors and the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain
in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter,
the Company, or any of their partners, officers or directors or any controlling person, as the case
may be, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities sold hereunder and any
termination of this Agreement.
SECTION 13.                     Notices.  All communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be

SECTION 15.                     Partial Unenforceability.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any section,

Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (“Related Proceedings”) may be instituted in the federal courts of the United States of America located in the
City and County of New York or the courts of the State of New York in each case located in the City and County of
New York (collectively, the “Specified Courts”), and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
(except for suits, actions, or proceedings instituted in regard to the enforcement of a judgment of any Specified Court
in a Related Proceeding, as to which such jurisdiction is non-exclusive) of the Specified Courts in any Related
Proceeding.  Service of any process, summons, notice or document by mail to such party’s address set forth above
shall be effective service of process for any Related Proceeding brought in any Specified Court.  The parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any Specified Proceeding in the
Specified Courts and irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any Specified Court that
any Related Proceeding brought in any Specified Court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
SECTION 17.                     No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.  The Company acknowledges and
agrees that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the
determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and
commissions, is an arm’s-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one
hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company is capable of
evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction
contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has
been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the
Company or any of its respective affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other
party; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary
responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is
currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the
Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set
forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be
engaged in a broad range of
31
transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and that the several Underwriters have no
obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the
Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering
contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the
extent the Company deemed appropriate.
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company
and the several Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.  The Company hereby waives
and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the several
Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty.
SECTION 18.                     General Provisions.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the
parties (including the Company and the several Underwriters) to this Agreement and supersedes
all prior written or oral and all contemporaneous oral agreements, understandings and
negotiations with respect to the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each one of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.  Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier, facsimile or other electronic
transmission (i.e., a “pdf” or “tif”) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart
thereof.  This Agreement may not be amended or modified unless in writing by all of the parties

Term Sheet, dated August 8, 2016, attached hereto as Annex I
EXHIBIT A
Form of opinion of counsel for the Company to be delivered pursuant to Section 6(d) of the Underwriting
Agreement.
(a)                                 The Company is validly existing as a corporation and is in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware, with full corporate power and authority necessary to own or
lease its properties and to conduct its business, in each case as described in the Disclosure
Package and Prospectus, in all material respects.
(b)                                 The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver, and perform its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby.  The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the
performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company.  The Underwriting
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
(c)                                  The authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company is as set
forth in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus in the column
entitled “Actual” under the caption “Capitalization” (except for subsequent issuances, if any,
pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement or pursuant to reservations, agreements or employee
benefit plans referred to in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the
Prospectus or pursuant to the exercise of convertible securities or options referred to in the
Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus).
(d)                                 The Securities have been duly authorized for issuance and sale to the
Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and, when issued and delivered by the
Company pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement against payment of the consideration set forth
in the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable and no
holder of the Securities is or will be subject to personal liability by reason of being such a holder
under the restated certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws of the
Company or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
(e)                                  The issuance of the Securities is not subject to the preemptive or other similar
rights of any security holder of the Company under the restated certificate of incorporation or the
amended and restated bylaws of the Company or the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.
(f)                                   The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the
Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, the issuance and sale of the
Securities by the Company to the Underwriters) will not constitute or result in a breach or a
default under (or an event that with notice or the passage of time or both would constitute a
default under) any of (i) any instrument to which the Company is a party and which is filed as an
exhibit and set forth on the exhibit list to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 or any other report filed by the Company with the Commission
Exhibit A-1
under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act after the date of such Annual Report on Form 10-K and through the dates of
the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, which reports are incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package
and the Prospectus, (ii) the restated certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws of the Company,
(iii) the Delaware General Corporation Law or any Colorado or United States federal statute that, in our experience, is
applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) any judgment, order or regulation of any
court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority applicable to the Company that is known to us, except, with
respect to clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) only, for any such breach or default that would not reasonably be expected to result
in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Change.  With respect to clause (iii) above, such counsel need
express no opinion as to the applicability of any state securities or Blue Sky laws or federal or state antifraud laws,
rules or regulations.
(g)                                  No consent, approval, authorization or order of any United States federal or
Colorado governmental authority is required for the issuance and sale by the Company of the
Securities to the Underwriters or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions
contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, except (i) such consents, approvals,
authorizations or orders as have been obtained prior to the date hereof, (ii) such consents,
approvals, authorizations or orders as may be required under Blue Sky laws, as to which such
counsel need express no opinion, and (ii) such consents, approvals, authorizations or orders as
may be required by FINRA.
(h)                                 The Company is not, and immediately after the sale of the Securities to be sold
pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and the application of the proceeds from such sale as
described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption “Use of Proceeds”
will not be, required to register as an “investment company” as such term is defined in the
Investment Company Act.
(i)                                     The statements under the captions “Description of Capital Stock,” “Description
of Debt Securities,” and “Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, insofar as such statements relate to statements of law
or summaries of documents referred to therein or of legal conclusions, have been reviewed by us
and such statements of law and summaries of documents are accurate in all material respects.
(j)                                    The Registration Statement became effective under the Securities Act
automatically upon filing with the Commission on August 8, 2016.  To the knowledge of such
counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any post-
effective amendment to the Registration Statement is in effect and no proceedings for such
purpose pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act have been instituted or are pending or
threatened by the Commission.  Any required filing of the Preliminary Prospectus and the
Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act has been made in the manner and
within the time period required by Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act.  Any required filing of the
Final Term Sheet has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 433
of the Securities Act.
In addition, such counsel shall also state, and may state in a separate letter, that it has participated in conferences
with representatives of the Company and with representatives of its
Exhibit A-2
independent accountants and independent reserve engineers at which conferences the contents of the Disclosure
Package and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed.
Although such counsel has not undertaken to determine independently, is not passing upon, and does not assume
any responsibility for, or express any opinion regarding the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements
contained in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except and to the
extent set forth in paragraph (i) above), based upon the participation described above, nothing has come to the
attention of such counsel to lead such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, as of the latest effective
date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; or (ii) the Disclosure Package, as of the
Applicable Time, or that the Prospectus, as of its date or at the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In making the foregoing statement, such
counsel need not express any comment or belief with respect to the financial statements and notes and related
schedules and other financial and accounting data and the oil and natural gas reserve estimates contained in or
omitted from the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.
Such counsel shall also state, and may state in a separate letter, that the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
and each amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as of their respective
effective or issue dates (other than the financial statements and supporting schedules and other financial and
accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or in exhibits to or excluded from the Registration
Statement, as to which no opinion need be rendered) appeared or appear on its face to be appropriately responsive in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

FORM OF LOCK-UP AGREEMENT
MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH
INCORPORATED
J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC
As Representatives of the Underwriters
c/o Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
375 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10152
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The undersigned understands that Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and certain other firms (the “Underwriters”) propose to
enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) providing for the purchase by the Underwriters
of shares (the “Securities”) of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), of SM Energy
Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and that the Underwriters propose to reoffer the securities to the
public (the “Offering”).
In consideration of the execution of the Underwriting Agreement by the Underwriters, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the undersigned hereby irrevocably agrees that, without the prior written consent of Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC, on behalf of the Underwriters, the undersigned will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any shares of Common Stock, enter into a transaction that would have the same effect, or enter into
any swap, hedge, or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
ownership of Common Stock, whether any of these transactions are to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or
other securities, in cash, or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to make any offer, sale, pledge, or disposition,
or to enter into any transaction, swap, hedge, or other arrangement for a period of 60 days after the date of the
prospectus supplement relating to the Offering (such 60-day period, the “Lock-Up Period”), except (i) that the
undersigned may sell, pledge or dispose of shares of Common Stock that were acquired by the undersigned in the
open market after the date of the prospectus supplement, provided that no filing under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, shall be required or shall be voluntarily made in connection with any such sale, pledge or
disposition (other than a filing on a Form 5, Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G (or 13D A or 13G A) made after the
expiration of the Lock-Up Period) and (ii) the undersigned may sell, pledge or
Exhibit B-1
dispose of any shares of Common Stock to a family member, family partnership (including a limited partnership),
other family investment entity or trust, provided that in connection with any such sale, pledge or disposition (A) the
recipient agrees to be bound in writing by the terms of this agreement prior to such sale, pledge or disposition and
(B) the transfer is not a sale, pledge or disposition for value.
In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and its transfer agent are hereby authorized to decline to make any
transfer of securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Lock-Up Letter Agreement.
It is understood that, if the Company notifies the Underwriters that it does not intend to proceed with the Offering, if
the Underwriting Agreement does not become effective, or if the Underwriting Agreement (other than the provisions
thereof which survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to payment for and delivery of the Securities,
the undersigned will be released from its obligations under this Lock-Up Agreement.
The undersigned understands that the Company and the Underwriters will proceed with the Offering in reliance on this
Lock-Up Agreement.
Whether or not the Offering actually occurs depends on a number of factors, including market conditions.  Any
Offering will only be made pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, the terms of which are subject to negotiation
between the Company, and the Underwriters.
[Signature Page Follows]
Exhibit B-2
The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full power and authority to enter into this
Lock-Up Agreement and that, upon request, the undersigned will execute any additional documents reasonably
necessary in connection with the enforcement hereof.  Any obligations of the undersigned shall be binding upon the
heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned.

The information in this pricing term sheet relates to offerings by SM Energy Company of 16,000,000 shares of its
common stock (the “Shares”) and $150,000,000 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2021(the “Notes”) and should be
read together with the applicable preliminary prospectus supplement dated August 8, 2016 (including the documents
incorporated by reference therein and the base prospectus dated August 8, 2016 in respect thereof) relating to such
offerings.  The information in this pricing term sheet supersedes the information in the preliminary prospectus
supplements to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith. Terms used but not defined herein have the meanings
ascribed to them in the applicable preliminary prospectus supplement.
The offering of the Shares and the offering of the Notes are separate offerings that are being made pursuant to
separate prospectus supplements.  The closing of the offering of the Shares is not conditioned upon the closing of the
offering of the Notes, and the closing of the offering of the Notes is not conditioned upon the closing of the offering of
the Shares. In addition, neither the closing of the offering of the Shares nor the closing of the offering of the Notes are
conditioned on, or are a condition to, the consummation of the Acquisition (as defined in the applicable prospectus
supplement).

If certain corporate events as described in the preliminary prospectus supplement for
the Notes occur at any time prior to the maturity date, each of which is referred to as
a “make-whole fundamental change,” the conversion rate for any Notes converted
following such make-whole fundamental change will, in certain circumstances and for
a limited period of time, be increased by a number of additional shares of common
stock. The number of additional shares by which the conversion rate will be increased
per $1,000 principal amount of notes will be determined by reference to the following
table and is based on the effective date of such make-whole fundamental change and
the applicable “stock price” (as defined in the preliminary prospectus supplement for
the Notes) per share of common stock for the make-whole fundamental change:

The exact stock prices and effective dates may not be set forth in the table above, in
which case if the stock price is:
·                  between two stock prices in the table or the effective date is
between two effective dates in the table, the number of additional
shares by which the conversion rate will be increased will be
determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of
additional shares set forth for the higher and lower stock prices and the
earlier and later effective dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day
year;
·                  in excess of $160.00 per share (subject to adjustment), no
additional
shares will be added to the conversion rate; and
·                  less than $30.00 per share (subject to adjustment), no
additional shares will be added to the conversion rate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conversion rate will not be increased to more than
33.3333 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, although the Issuer will adjust
such number of shares for the same events for which the Issuer must adjust the
conversion rate as described under “Description of Notes—Conversion rights—
Conversion rate adjustments” in the preliminary prospectus supplement for the Notes.

Other Information Applicable to both Offerings
We will incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with the Acquisition, and completion
of the acquisition will increase our indebtedness.
We expect to incur a number of significant transaction-related costs and expenses associated with the Acquisition. 
We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the
integration of the properties to be acquired, which may be significant.
We intend to finance a portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition and any transaction-related costs and
expenses with the proceeds from these offerings, and we expect that the remaining portion of the purchase price and
related fees and expenses will be funded with proceeds from asset sales pursuant to definitive agreements currently
in place, asset sales contemplated as part of our continued portfolio management (including the divestiture of our
outside operated position in the Eagle Ford shale), borrowings under our Credit Agreement or borrowings under the
Bridge Facility.  This increase in our indebtedness may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and
economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs.  Based on a preliminary conversation
with a rating agency, it is possible that the Acquisition and related financing could have a negative impact on our
outlook.  In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate any divestitures,
whether pending or contemplated.
