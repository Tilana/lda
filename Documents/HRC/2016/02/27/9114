FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND REPORTS OF THE OFFICE OF THE  
 HIGH COMMISSIONER AND THE SECRETARY-GENERAL 
</b></p>
<p><b>The rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic,  
religious and linguistic minorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the Secretary-General </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/102, requested the Secretary-General and the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with the fulfilment of their 
activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human 
Rights, and to update the relevant reports and studies. Accordingly, the report of the 
Secretary-General on the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities (A/HRC/4/109) was submitted to the Council at its fourth session. At the 
ninth session, an interim report on the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious 
and linguistic minorities (A/HRC/9/8) was submitted, in which some of the main interventions 
undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to strengthen the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to 
national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities since the previous report were outlined. 
They included efforts to promote dialogue and mutual understanding on thematic issues, to 
support capacity-building of OHCHR staff, public officials from Member States and civil 
society, and to strengthen inter-agency cooperation.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report, the final report supplementing the interim report, contains a review of 
relevant developments arising out of the work of the treaty bodies and special procedures and 
information on OHCHR activities in the field in 2007 and 2008 and at headquarters since the 
submission of the interim report. The addendum to the present report (A/HRC/10/38/Add.1) is a 
summary report of the expert meeting on integration with diversity in policing, held on 15 
and 16 January 2008, mentioned briefly in the interim report. 
</p>
<p>3. On the basis of General Assembly resolution 56/162 and Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2003/50, human rights treaty bodies and special procedures (thematic and to a lesser 
extent country mandates) continue to monitor situations and rights of persons belonging to 
national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. Some examples of such focus are given 
below. They do not include the work of the independent expert on minorities, who will submit a 
separate report. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  TREATY BODIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Committee 
</b></p>
<p>4. At its ninety-second session, held from 17 March to 7 April 2008, the Human Rights 
Committee expressed concern at the persisting problems faced by minorities in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, such as police violence, lack of language support in judicial 
proceedings, inadequacy of educational opportunities and lack of a protective and 
non-discriminatory learning environment (CCPR/C/MKD/CO/2).  
</p>
<p>5. At its ninety-third session, held from 7 to 25 July 2008, in its concluding observations, the 
Committee regretted that the report submitted by France lacked sufficient empirical information 
on issues such as the political participation of members of ethnic minorities, and suggested that 
the State review its position concerning the formal recognition of ethnic, religious or linguistic 
minorities, and reinforce its legislative framework and institutional mechanisms to exclude all 
discriminatory practices that prevent equal access to employment for persons belonging to 
ethnic, national or religious minorities (CCPR/C/FRA/CO/4). The Committee also recommended </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that Ireland recognize Travellers as an ethnic minority group (CCPR/C/IRL/CO/3) and that the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland increase the representation of women and 
ethnic minorities in the judiciary (CCPR/C/GBR/CO/6). 
</p><p>6. At its ninety-fourth session, held from 13 to 31 October 2008, in its concluding 
observations on the report of Denmark (CCPR/C/DNK/CO/5), the Committee recommended that 
the State party should pay particular attention to the self-identification of the individuals 
concerned in the determination of their status as persons belonging to minorities or indigenous 
peoples. The Committee recommended that the State translate and disseminate the concluding 
observations in minority languages spoken in Denmark, including Faroese. With regard to the 
report submitted by Japan, the Committee requested that the State party&#8217;s fifth periodic report 
and the present concluding observations be published and widely disseminated, to the extent 
possible, in national minority languages (CCPR/C/JPN/CO/5). 
</p>
<p><b>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. At its thirty-eighth session, held from 30 April to 18 May 2007, in its concluding 
observations to the State report on Latvia (E/C.12/LVA/CO/1), the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights noted with approval the efforts made by the State party to increase 
educational opportunities for Romani children, including the National Programme on Roma in 
Latvia (2007-2009), which includes specific measures on education and integration. At the same 
time, it expressed concerns that the State Language Law, which mandates the use of Latvian in 
all dealings with public institutions, including administrative districts, may be discriminatory in 
effect against linguistic minorities living in the State, including the Russian-speaking minority, 
which constitutes a significant proportion of the population and, in particular, members of 
linguistic minorities, especially older persons, may be disadvantaged in their claims to public 
authorities with regard to their entitlement to public services, which has a negative impact on 
their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. It recommended that the State party take 
measures to increase school attendance by Romani children, provide adequate support to 
members of linguistic minorities, take temporary special measures to ensure that minority 
women have the same access to the regular labour market and remuneration as men, and provide 
vocational training in minority languages. 
</p>
<p>8. At its fortieth session, held from 28 April to 16 May 2008, in its concluding observations 
to the State report on India (E/C.12/IND/CO/5), the Committee expressed concern about the 
negative effect of cultural stereotypes and personal laws of minority groups on the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights by minority women. 
</p>
<p><b>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>9. At its seventy-second session, held from 18 February to 7 March 2008, the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination requested updated data on education, poverty and 
unemployment for ethnic groups and minorities from Belgium (CERD/C/BEL/CO/15) and Fiji 
(CERD/C/FJI/CO/17). In its concluding observations to the report of the Republic of Moldova 
(CERD/C/MDA/CO/7), the Committee, while commending the inclusion of a chapter on the 
rights of national minorities in the national human rights plan of action for the period 2004-2008, 
highlighted several shortcomings, including the lack of disaggregated statistical information, the 
need to represent more effectively the interests of national minorities and to guarantee equitable </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>access to all ethnic and religious minorities. The Committee also discussed the situation of Roma 
in Italy (CERD/C/ITA/CO/15) and Latinos and African Americans in the United States of 
America (CERD/C/USA/CO/6) in relation to police brutality, violence, abuse, Medicare and 
issues related to sexual and reproductive health. 
</p>
<p>10. At its seventy-third session, held from 28 July to 15 August 2008, in its concluding 
observations to the report of Ecuador (CERD/C/ECU/CO/18), while it took note of a ministerial 
decision guaranteeing the Romani people the right to free association for peaceful purposes, the 
Committee expressed concern at the constitutional failure to grant legal recognition to the 
Romani people as an ethnic minority. While noting with appreciation that the Travellers and 
Yenish have been recognized by Switzerland as a national cultural minority, the Committee 
remained concerned that Travellers and Roma are still subjected to numerous disadvantages 
and forms of discrimination, and noted with regret the lack of substantial progress made 
by Switzerland in combating racist and xenophobic attitudes towards minorities 
(CERD/C/CHE/CO/6). It noted with appreciation the efforts by Sweden (CERD/C/SWE/CO/18) 
to promote the rights of the Romani minority and recommended that it strengthen its efforts to 
increase the level of education of members of Romani communities by raising awareness about 
the possibility for Romani children to receive instruction in their mother tongue. The Committee 
welcomed the creation of the German Secretariat for Minorities and the enactment of the law on 
promotion of the Friesian language in public life, adopted in 2004. However, while noting that 
the State party recognized German Roma and Sinti as national minorities, the Committee 
expressed concern that many Roma and Sinti continue to experience discrimination in the fields 
of education, employment and housing (CERD/C/DEU/CO/18). 
</p>
<p>11. The Committee also expressed concern about the distinction made between autochthonous 
minorities and other minority groups in Austria, inter alia, the Slovene minority in Carinthia and 
the Romani and Croat minorities in Burgenland, and individuals who do not reside in those 
areas. The Committee further expressed concerns about the frequent denial of access to places 
intended for use by the general public to persons of African and Latin American origin and to 
Roma (CERD/C/AUT/CO/17). It encouraged Namibia to revise its electoral laws with a view 
to broadening their appeal to ethnic minorities and to include a minimum proportion of 
candidates from these groups. The Committee also expressed concerns about the high incidence 
of rape of San women by members of other communities, which seems to be caused by negative 
stereotypes (CERD/C/NAM/CO/12). 
</p>
<p><b>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women </b></p>
<p>12. At its fortieth session, held from 14 January to 1 February 2008, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women pointed out that the State report by Saudi Arabia 
did not provide information regarding women belonging to ethnic, religious or other 
minorities (CEDAW/C/SAU/CO/2). It also urged the Government of Sweden to take effective 
measures to eliminate discrimination against immigrants, refugees and minority women 
(CEDAW/C/SWE/CO/7). 
</p>
<p>13. At its forty-first session, held from 30 June to 18 July 2008, in its concluding observations 
to the report of Finland (CEDAW/C/FIN/CO/6), the Committee noted the lack of statistics on the 
participation of minority women in political and public life and in academia, and encouraged 
Finland to be proactive in its measures to prevent discrimination against Romani women. While </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>noting various measures taken by the State party, including the Programme for Roma Integration 
into Lithuanian society (2000-2004 and 2008-2010) and the Lithuanian Rural Development 
Programme for 2007-2013, the Committee urged Lithuania to intensify its efforts to eliminate 
discrimination against vulnerable groups of women, including those belonging to ethnic 
minorities such as the Roma (CEDAW/C/LTV/CO/4). It also acknowledged the measures taken 
by Slovakia under the Decade of Romani Inclusion 2005-2015, but expressed its concern that 
Romani women and girls remained vulnerable and marginalized, and urged Slovakia to take 
effective measures to eliminate the multiple forms of discrimination against Romani women and 
girls. The Committee was also concerned at information received with regard to Romani women 
reporting to have been sterilized without prior and informed consent, and recommended that 
Slovakia take all necessary measures to ensure that the complaints are duly acknowledged and 
that victims are granted effective remedies (CEDAW/C/SVK/CO/4). With regard to the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Committee noted that ethnic and 
minority women were underrepresented in all areas of the labour market, particularly in senior 
and decision-making positions (CEDAW/C/UK/CO/6). 
</p>
<p><b>Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>14. At its forty-eighth session, held from 19 May to 6 June 2008, in its concluding 
observations to the report of Bulgaria (CRC/C/BGR/CO/2), the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, while commending efforts made, such as the National Action Plan on the Decade of Roma 
Inclusion and Health Strategy for Disadvantaged Persons from the Ethnic Minorities, highlighted 
several shortcomings, including the particularly limited and inequitable access to adequate 
health-care services for Romani children, the relatively high infant mortality rate and the 
common practice of segregating Romani patients in hospital facilities. The recommendations of 
the Committee also covered areas such as promoting tolerance, addressing negative attitudes, 
removing discrimination and working actively with Romani communities for the full enjoyment 
of their rights. It requested the Government of Eritrea to provide, in its next report, information 
on the fulfilment of the rights of children belonging to minority groups, and recommended that 
the issue of access to health care for children of minority groups be prioritized. It also expressed 
concern at the lack of adequate institutional structures to ensure birth registration of all children, 
especially minorities (CRC/C/ERI/CO/3). Furthermore, the Committee discussed and made 
recommendations on the situation of children of minority groups in relation to adoption and 
education opportunities in Georgia (CRC/C/GEO/CO/3) and Serbia (CRC/C/SRB/CO/1). 
</p>
<p>15. Under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, in relation to the report of the United States of 
America<i>,</i> the Committee expressed concern over cases of recruitment into the armed forces 
through campaigns targeted at children belonging to ethnic and racial minorities and other 
vulnerable socio-economic groups (CRC/C/OPAC/USA/CO/1). 
</p>
<p>16. At its forty-ninth session, held from 15 September to 3 October 2008, in its concluding 
observations to the report of Bhutan (CRC/C/BTN/CO/2), the Committee expressed concern 
about the ability of children belonging to minority groups, in particular of Nepalese ethnic 
origin, to enjoy their own culture, profess and practice their own religion and use their own 
language, and recommended that the State party recognize these rights. In relation to the report 
submitted by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<i>,</i> the Committee noted 
various measures taken by the State party, including plans to consolidate and strengthen equality </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>legislation, with clear opportunities to mainstream children&#8217;s rights to non-discrimination into 
the anti-discrimination law (Equality Bill). However, it expressed concerns that, in practice, 
certain groups of children belonging to minority groups, such as the Roma, Irish Travellers and 
others, continue to experience discrimination and social stigmatization. The Committee therefore 
recommended that the State party ensure full protection against discrimination on any grounds 
by strengthening its awareness-raising and other preventive activities against discrimination and, 
if necessary, take affirmative action for the benefit of these vulnerable groups of children. It also 
expressed concern at the increased number of children in alternative care and, in particular, the 
high percentage of children of African descent and children from ethnic minorities. The 
Committee was similarly concerned that children of African descent and children of ethnic 
minorities sometimes face long waiting periods for adoption by a family of the same ethnic 
origin (CRC/C/GBR/CO/4). 
</p>
<p>17. Under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of 
Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, in its concluding observations for the 
United Republic of Tanzania (CRC/C/OPSC/TZA/CO/1) and Uganda 
(CRC/C/OPSC/UGA/CO/1), the Committee expressed its concern about the lack of statistical 
data disaggregated by age, sex, minority group, socio-economic background and geographic 
location. The Committee, in its concluding observations on the report submitted by the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland under the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict 
(CRC/C/OPAC/GBR/CO/1), mentioned the State party&#8217;s active policy of recruitment of children 
into the armed forces, and recommended that the State ensure that this recruitment is not 
conducted in a manner which specifically targets ethnic minorities and children of low-income 
families. 
</p>
<p><b>Committee against Torture 
</b></p>
<p>18. At its thirty-eighth session, held from 30 April to 18 May 2007, in its concluding 
observations to the report by Poland (CAT/C/POL/CO/4), the Committee against Torture noted 
with approval some positive legislative developments, such as the Law on National and Ethnic 
Minorities and on Regional Languages of January 2005, but also noted that it had received 
reports of intolerance and hatred towards minorities, while the State party was unable to supply 
statistics on racially motivated crimes, particularly violence against the Roma. The Committee 
recommended that the State party continue to be vigilant in ensuring that the relevant existing 
legal and administrative measures are strictly observed and that training curricula and 
administrative directives constantly convey to staff the message that incitation to hatred and 
violence will not be tolerated and will be sanctioned accordingly. 
</p>
<p>19. In its concluding observations to the report by Ukraine (CAT/C/UKR/CO/5), the 
Committee urged the State party to ensure prompt, impartial and effective investigations into 
incitement and acts of violence against persons belonging to ethnic and national minorities, 
including acts against Roma, anti-Semitic attacks and violence against persons of African and 
Asian origin and non-citizens; to prosecute and punish perpetrators with penalties appropriate to 
the nature of their acts; to publicly condemn hate crimes and related violent acts; to work to 
eradicate incitement and any role public officials or law enforcement personnel might have in </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>such violence; to give prompt consideration to expanding recruitment into law enforcement of 
persons belonging to ethnic and national minorities; and to develop and adopt a comprehensive 
governmental programme addressing the human rights situation of national minorities, especially 
the Roma. 
</p>
<p><b>Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment 
</b></p>
<p>20. In its annual report to the Committee against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT/C/40/2), the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment adopted preliminary 
guidelines for the development of national preventive mechanisms, to be established or 
designated by each State party within a year of the entry into force of the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture or of its ratification or accession. The guidelines specifically 
provide that the membership of the national preventive mechanism should be gender balanced 
and have adequate representation of ethnic, minority and indigenous groups. This specific 
provision was formulated as a recommendation in a report of the Subcommittee on its visit to 
Sweden (CAT/OP/SWE/1). 
</p>
<p><b>Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families 
</b></p>
<p>21. A number of State reports clearly indicated that certain migrants facing discrimination 
belong to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities. For example, in its concluding 
observations in 2007 and 2008, the Committee recommended that Egypt (CMW/C/EGY/CO/1) 
and the Syrian Arab Republic (CMW/C/SYR/CO/1) provide adequate training to all judicial 
personnel and law enforcement officials on respect for human rights and non-discrimination on 
ethnic or racial grounds. 
</p>
<p>22. While the work of the treaty bodies clearly shows that significant attention is increasingly 
paid to situations and the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and 
linguistic minorities, it is also evident that most information is available for countries in Europe. 
There is thus a need to mainstream the consideration of situations and rights of persons 
belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities in other regions. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SPECIAL PROCEDURES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>23. In her report (A/HRC/6/5), the Special Rapporteur referred to the vulnerable situation of 
religious minorities in various reports, stating, for example, that the practice of her mandate 
shows that national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities are in a particularly vulnerable 
situation and are often subject to multiple discrimination based on the various aspects of their 
identity, for example racial and religious. The Special Rapporteur also raised the point that 
some religious minorities are adversely affected by manifestations of rejection or violence by 
non-State actors, and recalled that the State remains responsible even when abuses are </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>committed against minorities by non-State actors. She also pointed out that religious minorities 
face various forms of discrimination and intolerance from policies, legislation and State practice. 
Issues of concern relate to obstacles in official registration procedures and inappropriate 
limitations when disseminating materials and displaying religious symbols. 
</p>
<p>24. In an earlier report (A/HRC/4/21), the Special Rapporteur also specifically addressed 
issues facing religious minorities and new religious movements and cautioned that, when 
religious minorities are considered so-called non-traditional or new religious movements, the 
members of these communities may often be the object of suspicion and suffer greater 
limitations to their right to freedom of religion or belief. The Special Rapporteur advocated 
interpreting the scope of application for freedom of religion or belief in a broad sense, with the 
contents of a religion being defined by the worshippers themselves. She thus found it particularly 
worrying when a religious community is empowered, either de jure or de facto, to decide 
whether or not to veto the registration of another religious or belief group. 
</p>
<p>25. In her report on her visit to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
(A/HRC/7/10/Add.3), the Special Rapporteur shared her concern that Catholic staff were 
underrepresented in the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the prison service and other criminal 
justice agencies, and welcomed affirmative strategies to ensure that these agencies could recruit 
a more representative workforce. She emphasized that tackling the sectarian polarization in 
Northern Ireland should not lead to a disregard for the situation and concerns of religious 
minorities, including physical attacks against them. She expressed concerns about reports of 
profiling of Muslims based on physical appearance within the framework of counter-terrorism 
efforts and the resulting alienation of certain ethnic and religious groups, and encouraged the 
introduction of legislation against racial and religious hatred in Scotland. 
</p>
<p>26. In the report on her visit to Tajikistan (A/HRC/7/10/Add.2), the Special Rapporteur urged 
the Government to actively protect and promote the freedom of religion or belief of both the 
Muslim communities and the various religious minorities in Tajikistan and to bear that in mind, 
especially when adopting specific legislations and policies. In the report on her visit to Maldives 
(A/HRC/4/21/Add.3), she expressed concern about reports that individuals who were suspected 
of having converted from Islam had been subjected to coercion in detention to persuade them to 
reaffirm their belief in Islam; about legislation limiting eligibility for certain public posts and 
voting rights to Muslims only; and about the citizenship law which stipulates that only Muslims 
can apply for citizenship. She encouraged the Government to consider amending the current 
practice to enable non-Muslims to manifest their religion or belief in a manner consistent with 
human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on the right to education 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education pointed out in his thematic report on the 
right to education in emergency situations (A/HRC/8/19) that, in times of emergency, inequality 
and discrimination increase for marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities. In the report on 
his visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Special Rapporteur welcomed an action plan on the 
education needs of Romani and other national minorities, the goals of which are the removal of 
financial and administrative barriers to Romani school enrolment and completion, the 
participation of Romani parents and communities in the education process, increasing Romani 
teaching staff and sensitizing non-Romani teaching staff to the needs of Romani students. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>However, he also expressed his concern that these measures may remain on paper, owing to 
various barriers to access to education for a large number of Romani children because of the 
absence of identity documents. The Special Rapporteur called upon federal, entity and cantonal 
authorities to offer all children, regardless of their ethnic origin, an acceptable and adaptable 
education, respecting all cultural specificities. The Special Rapporteur also encouraged Bosnia 
and Herzegovina to implement expeditiously the recommendations made by the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child regarding discrimination suffered by minority children in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina (A/HRC/8/10/Add.4). The Special Rapporteur also sent communications on 
minority issues to the Russian Federation, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Nigeria and 
received replies from the Russian Federation and Slovenia (A/HRC/4/29/Add.1, 
A/HRC/8/10/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur regularly pays attention to minority issues in his country reports; 
for example, in the report on his visit to Mauritania (A/HRC/7/19/Add.6), he called attention to 
the negative effects, such as socio-economic marginalization, of continuing discriminatory 
practices of an ethnic and racial nature such as slavery, the caste system and the use of ethnicity 
as a political tool, and recommended that the Government establish an independent commission 
with the democratic participation of all political movements, affected communities, traditional 
religious and spiritual leaders and civil society actors to tackle these issues. In the report on his 
visit to the Dominican Republic (A/HRC/7/19/Add.5), he drew attention to persistent structural 
and systemic racism and discrimination against Dominicans of African origin, resulting in their 
failure to enjoy economic, social and cultural rights and in poverty, marginalization and 
exclusion. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur has addressed housing issues of minority communities in several 
of his country mission reports. For example, in the report on his mission to Spain 
(A/HRC/7/16/Add.2), he urged all levels of the Government to address urgently the lack of 
housing and social services for, inter alia, the Romani communities, which is a result of the 
primacy of the discriminatory home ownership policy model. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>30. In the mission report to Serbia, including Kosovo (A/HRC/7/28/Add.3), the Special 
Rapporteur recommended that the process of consultation with civil society and human rights 
defenders, including from Romani, Ashkali and Egyptian communities, should be 
institutionalized and systematized in order to ensure their active participation in legislative and 
policy decision-making. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>31. In the report on his mission to Colombia (A/HRC/4/38/Add.3), the Representative of the 
Secretary-General recommended the implementation of a comprehensive policy for 
differentiated assistance to Afro-Colombian communities and individuals that takes into account 
their respective cultural traditions, leadership structures and collective character. He also 
recommended the creation of channels and mechanisms to engage these communities in 
consultations and have them participate in determining solutions and assistance. Regarding 
collective land titles of communities, he recommended that the authorities declare invalid the 
titles issued for parts of the collective land sold by individuals from collective property. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences 
</b></p>
<p>32. In the report on her mission to Sweden (A/HRC/4/34/Add.3), the Special Rapporteur 
recommended that the Government strengthen efforts to protect persons belonging to ethnic or 
religious minorities from discrimination in the labour market, the justice sector and other key 
areas, and consider adopting special measures to facilitate equal participation of women and men 
with minority backgrounds in the educational system and the labour market. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment 
</b></p>
<p>33. In the report on his missions to Togo and Indonesia (A/HRC/7/3/Add.5 and Add.7), the 
Special Rapporteur urged the Government to ensure that the criminal justice system is 
non-discriminatory at every stage and that corruption, which disproportionately affects 
minorities, among others, is fought. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
</b></p>
<p>34. In his reports (A/HRC/4/14 and A/HRC/7/18), the Special Rapporteur emphasized that 
decisions on humanitarian assistance must be guided solely by the best interest of, among others, 
minority groups, and called on the Government to take urgent measures to eliminate 
discriminatory practices against ethnic groups and to ensure that no further discrimination is 
carried out. He also appealed to the Government to put an end to the harassment and persecution 
of representatives of ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. WORK OF THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR 
HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE FIELD AND AT HEADQUARTERS 
</b></p>
<p>35. OHCHR has increasingly been operationalizing its work. The Office now has 
some 50 field presences and its country engagement increasingly includes activities to advance 
the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Such activities contribute to promoting the 
Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic 
Minorities, for example, the rights to participate fully in public life, to be treated equally, to 
practice one&#8217;s own religion and speak one&#8217;s own language, through strengthening dialogue 
between minorities and Governments; building the capacity of persons belonging to minorities to 
protect their own rights; stimulating national human rights institutions to enhance their work on </p>

 <p>

<p>minority issues; enhancing inter-agency cooperation to promote the rights of minorities; reducing 
poverty and exclusion of minorities, for example, by contributing to the implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals and of economic, social and cultural rights; and preventing 
human rights violations. Some examples of good practices and OHCHR work in the field on 
minority issues are given below. 
</p>
<p>36. In 2006, the OHCHR country office in Nepal launched a three-month social inclusion 
project to map out, and thereby gain an understanding of, the issues facing indigenous peoples 
and minorities in Nepal. This mapping exercise resulted in a clearer understanding of the kind of 
intervention OHCHR could undertake for the protection and promotion of the human rights of 
indigenous peoples and minorities in Nepal. On the basis of conclusions of the project, the Office 
carried out a number of activities, especially capacity-building and awareness-raising workshops, 
in cooperation with various local organizations working on indigenous peoples and minority 
rights and issues. For instance, it organized a workshop with Dalits in the Far West Region to 
raise their awareness and strengthen their networks. On the basis of interaction with several Dalit 
organizations and suggestions put forward by them, in November 2008 OHCHR produced a 
cartoon series on filing a first information report. The objective of the cartoon series was to raise 
awareness among grass-roots organizations, especially members of Dalits and marginalized 
communities, about their right to access justice. It served as a tool to enhance their access to the 
formal justice system. OHCHR observed that its efforts to support and encourage minorities to 
enjoy and realize their human rights resulted in an increased level of awareness among 
minorities and an increased willingness on the part of the State to respect and protect the human 
rights of these communities. For instance, the Government and its agencies have started 
introducing programmes to facilitate the participation of persons belonging to minorities in 
public affairs. 
</p>
<p>37. The OHCHR human rights adviser in Ecuador participated in a United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) programme on development and cultural diversity to reduce 
poverty and promote social inclusion, to promote the revitalization of culture, inclusion and 
intercultural dialogue in order to bridge the gap of discrimination and social exclusion affecting 
minorities and disadvantaged groups. The programme contributes to achieving Millennium 
Development Goals 1, 2, 5 and 7. Its objectives include strengthening intercultural public policy; 
support for revitalization initiatives in culture and for income-generating activities; and 
capacity-building for statistical analysis and information on cultural and ethnic diversity. The 
Centre for Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa in Yaound&#233; assisted in the 
preparation of a study on a possible draft law on marginalized peoples, commissioned by the 
Government of Cameroon. 
</p>
<p>38. At the headquarters level, in the period since the submission of the interim report, OHCHR 
continued to concentrate activities on capacity-building of various actors, such as civil society 
and OHCHR staff, and on the mainstreaming of minority rights in the work of the 
United Nations through inter-agency cooperation. The Arabic-speaking component of the 
minority fellowship programme was held from 1 to 19 December 2008, with the participation of 
representatives of the following ethnic and religious communities: the Kurd Failiya from Iraq, 
the Haratin from Mauritania, the Shia Jaafari from Saudi Arabia, the Kurds from the Syrian Arab 
Republic and the Zaghawa from the Sudan. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>39. From 26 to 28 November 2008, OHCHR also held a training workshop in Addis Ababa on 
the promotion and protection of the human rights of minorities and indigenous peoples for 
OHCHR staff in Africa. A total of 21 staff members from 14 field presences participated in the 
workshop. In November 2008, OHCHR published an information note on minorities online, 
entitled &#8220;Towards developing country engagement strategies on minorities&#8221;, to assist OHCHR 
staff, United Nations partners and other practitioners.<b>1</b> The note answers commonly-asked 
questions about minorities and identifies elements that should be included in strategies to address 
the situation of minorities in United Nations country programmes. The note is now being tested 
by OHCHR staff and other practitioners in the field with a view to finalizing a publication at the 
end of 2009. 
</p>
<p>40. OHCHR also organized the fifth consultation of the Inter-Agency Group on Minority 
Issues on 15 October 2008 in Geneva, with the participation of representatives of OHCHR, the 
International Labour Organization, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 
UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research 
and the independent expert on minority issues. The agenda items discussed included the 
information note on minorities: launch, dissemination and further steps; OHCHR minority 
fellowships and inter-agency cooperation; recent developments at the Human Rights Council, 
particularly the universal periodic review and its consideration of minority issues during the first 
cycle and discussion of inter-agency cooperation for future review cycle and in follow-up 
processes; the UNDP/Inter-Parliamentary Union project entitled &#8220;Promoting inclusive 
parliaments: the representation of minorities and indigenous peoples in Parliament&#8221;; and the 
inaugural session of the Forum on Minority Issues. 
</p>
<p>41. In terms of bilateral inter-agency cooperation, OHCHR has been conducting a joint 
initiative with UNDP and the independent expert on minority issues on developing a UNDP 
resource guide on minorities in development, which was validated through a consultation held 
on 2 and 3 December 2008 in New York. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>The Council is invited to consider whether it should request that future annual 
reports submitted to the Council provide information on OHCHR activities related to 
minorities, both at headquarters and in the field, and a review of relevant developments 
arising out of the work of the treaty bodies and special procedures. The Council might also 
consider whether it would be more appropriate for further reports to be submitted by the 
High Commissioner instead of the Secretary-General. Lastly, the Council might want to 
consider grouping all reports on minorities, including that of the independent expert on 
minority issues, the Forum on Minority Issues and the High Commissioner at one time of 
the year in order to facilitate governmental delegations and permit greater participation by 
minority organizations in the work of the Council on this issue, if they so wish.</b>
