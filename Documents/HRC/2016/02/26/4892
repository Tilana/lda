<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the 
Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in 
accordance with resolution 11/12 and decision 3/103 of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b>2. The Intergovernmental Working Group held its seventh session from 5 to 16 
October 2009. The participants discussed issues pertaining to the implementation of the 
previous decisions of the Working Group and the effectiveness of the Working Group in 
the framework of resolution 11/12 of the Human Rights Council. Furthermore, 
presentations by experts on the themes of migration, protection of children and employment 
were followed by interactive discussions. The Working Group adopted conclusions and 
recommendations on the aforementioned themes.1 
</p>
<p><b> A. Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>3. The session was attended by representatives of Member States, an observer from a 
non-Member State of the United Nations as well as observers from intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations (see annex I). 
4. During the session, presentations on the theme of migration were made by the 
following panellists: Ana Elizabeth Cubias Medina, a member of the Committee on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; Ibrahim 
Wani, Chief of the Development and Economic and Social Issues Branch, Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); Anja Klug, senior legal 
officer in the Protection Policy and Legal Advice Section, Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); John K. Bingham, Head of Policy, 
International Catholic Migration Commission; and Patrick Taran, senior migration 
specialist, International Labour Organization (ILO).  
5. Presentations on the theme of protection of children were made by the following 
panellists: Jane Connors, Chief of the Special Procedures Division, OHCHR; Karolina 
Lindholm-Billing, senior liaison officer, UNHCR; and Nicolette Moodie, human rights and 
gender officer, United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF).  
6. Presentations on the theme of employment were made by the following panellists: 
Frederick Muia, senior adviser, International Organization of Employers (IOE) and Esther 
Busser, deputy representative, International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Chief of the Rule of Law, Equality and Non-Discrimination Branch, OHCHR, 
Mona Rishmawi opened the first meeting of the seventh session on 5 October 2009. She 
noted that the meeting took place six months after the successful conclusion of the Durban 
Review Conference. A tribute was paid to the former Chairperson-Rapporteur Dayan 
Jayatilleka, Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka, who guided the sixth session of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b>4</b> GE.10-10828 
</p>
<p>Working Group. Ms. Rishmawi pointed out that the outcome document of the Durban 
Review Conference contained important action points that open new horizons for States to 
act at the national, regional and international levels. The need for international cooperation 
was highlighted. The importance of a victim-oriented approach was also noted. Ms. 
Rishmawi noted that the commitments made needed to be translated into concrete actions 
and that effective policies and programmes must be implemented in order to accelerate 
equal access to human rights by all, especially individuals who had been marginalized as a 
consequence of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>8. Ms. Rishmawi stated that the High Commissioner for Human Rights and her Office 
were determined to build on the momentum gained from the Durban Review Conference 
and, in this regard, strengthen the anti-racism programme of the Office. Ms. Rishmawi 
noted that in May 2009, an in-house task force on Durban follow-up was established. The 
task force recommended a programme that included the following components: supporting 
Durban follow-up mechanisms; building national capacity to combat racism, discrimination 
and intolerance; strengthening awareness-raising, including by carrying out expert 
seminars; enhancing research, analysis and the collection of good practices; and facilitating 
the integration of the anti-racism agenda in United Nations activities. The need for 
additional resources for the Office, in order to implement such a comprehensive 
programme, was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>9. In her concluding remarks, Ms. Rishmawi pointed out that the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference 
constituted a comprehensive agenda for advancing the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>10. At the 8th meeting, on 8 October 2009, Mohamed Siad Douale, Permanent 
Representative of Djibouti to the United Nations, was elected Chairman-Rapporteur by 
acclamation. Following his election, Mr. Douale emphasized his strong commitment to the 
fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>11. During its 8th meeting, the Working Group adopted the agenda for its seventh 
session (A/HRC/13/WG.<footnote name="3">8. Several delegates noted that migration was not only South-to-North, and that more 
people were migrating from South-to-South and North-to-North. It was also pointed out 
that the full scope of understanding of migration was somehow incomplete, due to the lack 
of figures.  </footnote>/1, see annex II).  
</p>
<p><b> E. Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>12. At its 14th meeting, on 13 October, the Working Group adopted its programme of 
work (A/HRC/13/WG.<footnote name="3">7. A delegate provided an extensive overview of national migratory policy. It was 
stressed that the national measures aimed to facilitate the residence of migrants, irrespective 
of their status, to promote their integration and equal access to public services and goods, to 
facilitate the reunification of migrants&#8217; families and to facilitate the legalization of status, 
among others. The participant emphasized that it was important that Governments move to 
design and implement realistic policies.  
</footnote>/CRP.1/Rev.<footnote name="4">. Organization of work. </footnote>, see annex III), which was slightly modified during 
the following days to accommodate changes in the timing of the meetings. The Working 
Group held its last meeting on Friday afternoon, 16 October 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Statements 
</b>13. The representatives of Italy and the Netherlands stated that the adoption of the 
agenda and the programme of work did not imply that Italy and the Netherlands endorsed 
the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference in its entirety. Italy also recalled 
that during the eleventh session of the Human Rights Council it did not join the consensus </p>


<p>GE.10-10828 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>on resolution 11/12 and that the adoption of the programme of work of the Working Group 
did not entail an endorsement of that resolution.  
</p>
<p>14. With regard to the conclusions and recommendations, at the seventh session of the 
Working Group, the representative of the Netherlands stated that in order not to hold up the 
work of the mechanism, the Netherlands could go along with the adoption of the 
conclusions and recommendations as long as it was clear that that in no way implied the 
endorsement by the Netherlands of the outcome document of the Durban Review 
Conference in its entirety.  
</p>
<p>15. With regard to the conclusions and recommendations, at the seventh session of the 
Working Group, the representative of Italy stated that it disassociated from the parts of the 
conclusions and recommendations containing references to the outcome document of the 
Durban Review Conference.  
</p>
<p>16. On behalf of the European Union, the representative of Sweden stated that it was the 
understanding of the European Union that any additional appropriations related to the 
conclusions and recommendations would be met from within existing resources.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Thematic discussions 
</b></p>
<p>17. Delegates speaking on behalf of regional groups and as representatives of their own 
countries reiterated their commitments to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>18. A delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group noted that effective cooperation 
between Governments, national human rights institutions (NHRIs), non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and civil society-based organizations in the identification of good 
practices could help curtail both the incitement and dissemination of hatred. The delegate 
suggested that the identification of focal points by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination and national institutions and close liaison between the two would 
facilitate the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and 
follow-up to the recommendations of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>19. Another delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group pointed out the importance 
of implementing the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and expressed concerns with regard to trafficking and smuggling of persons.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Implementation of previous decisions and effectiveness of the Working 
Group in the framework of resolution 11/12 of the Human Rights 
Council 
</b></p>
<p>20. Several delegates indicated the need to continue to ensure that the recommendations 
of the Working Group were in line with the provisions of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference. It was 
noted that the effective implementation of the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations had to 
be enhanced. In this vein, it was pointed out that increased awareness on the Working 
Group&#8217;s recommendations and other relevant reports and studies of human rights 
mechanisms was needed. Furthermore, the necessity for follow-up activities was also 
highlighted. Delegates also emphasized that the recommendations of the Working Group 
should be action-oriented and formulated in a clear manner, in order to facilitate their 
reflection in the respective resolutions of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>21. A number of delegates noted that during the sessions of the Working Group, 
stakeholders should share national experiences, including good practices, achievements and </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10828 
</p>
<p>difficulties related to implementation of human rights norms and also of previous decisions 
of the Working Group. It was pointed out that such discussions could enable stakeholders to 
perform better. The need to continue to collect information, including through 
questionnaires, and to post updated information on the website of OHCHR were also 
emphasized.  
</p>
<p>22. Several delegates underlined the importance of elaborating and implementing 
national action plans, adopting anti-discrimination legislation and establishing national 
human rights institutions. It was emphasized that participation of all relevant stakeholders 
and consultations with civil society should be ensured.  
</p>
<p>23. A number of members indicated that the active participation of representatives of 
treaty monitoring bodies, in particular the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination and Special Rapporteurs, especially the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in 
the sessions of the Working Group was essential. It was stated that efforts to complement 
the work of other Durban follow-up mechanisms and to avoid the overlapping of initiatives 
needed to be increased and that steps to achieve better coordination and synergy with other 
human rights mechanisms, in particular the Working Group of Experts on People of 
African Descent, should be undertaken progressively.  
</p>
<p>24. Several delegates noted that in order to enhance the effectiveness of the Working 
Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, it was important to address procedural issues in advance, before the beginning of 
the sessions. They emphasized that it was essential that documentation be circulated at least 
six weeks before the beginning of the respective session.  
</p>
<p>25. With regard to the selection of themes for the sessions of the Working Group, a 
number of members pointed out that proposed themes for future discussions should be 
based on the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. It was stated that the selection 
of the themes for each section should be made well in advance and preferably also in 
consultation with the Chairperson of the Working Group of Experts on People of African 
Descent.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Migration 
</b></p>
<p>26. Ana Elizabeth Cubias Medina, a member of the Committee on Migrant Workers, 
noted that the rights of migrants were often violated. She pointed out that migrants were 
increasingly isolated. The speaker also noted that migrants were also vulnerable to 
trafficking. Moreover, she stated that migrants often became scapegoats of existing 
domestic problems such as unemployment, terrorism, crimes and drugs.  
</p>
<p>27. The panellist noted that any difference could trigger a process of discrimination, for 
example nationality, culture, physical appearance, economic status, gender, among other 
things. In that regard, it was important to understand why differences led to discrimination 
and how to reverse the flow of that phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>28. The feminization of migration and the high vulnerability of migrant women were 
highlighted by the panellist. Ms. Cubias Medina also stressed that undocumented migrants 
were highly vulnerable to arbitrary detention, mistreatment, physical violence and torture, 
among others.  
</p>

<p>GE.10-10828 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>awareness on the rights of the migrants and undertaking initiatives to overcome xenophobic 
attitudes of the local population.  
</p>
<p>30. The Chief of Development, Economic and Social Issues Branch at OHCHR, Ibrahim 
Wani, pointed out that States have an obligation to protect the human rights of all 
individuals within their jurisdiction, including all migrants, irrespective of their status. In 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, States, among other things, highlighted 
the importance of creating conditions conducive to greater harmony, tolerance and respect 
between migrants and the rest of society in host countries, recognized that xenophobia 
against non-nationals, particularly migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, constituted one 
of the main sources of contemporary racism and, crucially, emphasized that human rights 
violations against members of such groups were widely perpetrated as a result of 
discriminatory, xenophobic and racist practices. 
</p>
<p>31. The panellist noted that in host societies, migrants often faced multiple forms of 
discrimination. Specific laws, policies and programmes failing to acknowledge the specific 
needs and vulnerability of migrants might preclude access to adequate housing, health or 
education. The lack of official status exposed migrants to unfair labour practices and harsh 
abuse related to the workplace. 
</p>
<p>32. Mr. Wani stated that failure to protect specifically migrant women fostered an 
environment where exploitation and violence could go unreported and unpunished. 
</p>
<p>33. With regard to the link between migration and development, the panellist noted that 
migrants contributed to economic growth and human development both in home and host 
countries and enriched societies through cultural diversity, fostering understanding and 
respect. It was pointed out that supportive policy measures were needed.  
</p>
<p>34. The speaker emphasized that NHRIs could play an important role in ensuring 
effective protection of migrants&#8217; human rights. He also highlighted the importance of a 
human rights approach to migration, in other words, placing human rights standards at the 
centre of migration considerations and making use of existing human rights mechanisms to 
protect migrant women, men and children from the human rights violations they suffer at 
the different stages of the migratory process.  
</p>
<p>35. A concern was raised with regard to the increasing tendency to criminalize the 
irregular entry into a country and to use mandatory detention as a punitive measure to 
discourage irregular migration. Such procedures did not spare migrant children who, in 
many countries, could be held in prolonged administrative detention without proper 
justification. Often such detainees had neither the capacity nor the rights to challenge the 
legality of their detention. 
</p>
<p>36. A delegate stressed that the vulnerability and specific needs of migrant women and 
migrant children should receive due attention, including through institutional frameworks 
and legislative measures. It was noted that migrants&#8217; access to employment, justice, 
education, health, and housing should be ensured through specific measures.  
</p>

<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10828 
</p>
<p>39. Several delegates emphasized that the human rights of migrants were not 
conditioned by the entrance and status of those migrants. It was stressed that the limitation 
of the human rights of migrants was contrary to international human rights instruments, 
generated additional distinctions, and fostered negative stereotypes, among others. It was 
noted that legislation that penalized and criminalized migrants triggered further 
discrimination. Repressive policies increased the price of trafficking. It was emphasized 
that repatriation of migrants should be safe. It was also highlighted that for effective 
measures in the realm of migration, the active involvement of countries of origin, transition 
and destination was needed. 
</p>
<p>40. A delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group emphasized the importance of 
national plans of action and noted that they could strengthen the protection of migrant 
workers. 
</p>
<p>41. A delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group noted that it was important to 
strengthen the rule of law, to eliminate xenophobic practices, to elaborate administrative 
measures and to establish independent human rights institutions, and among others, to 
effectively address issues pertaining to migration.  
</p>
<p>42. A participant noted that it was important not only to diagnose the problems of 
migration, but also to find solutions. The need for increased attention on the mental health 
of migrants was highlighted. 
</p>
<p>43. Another participant pointed out the need to foster institutional dialogue between 
OHCHR, the International Organization for Migration and UNHCR, among others, on the 
different aspects of migration. The necessity for a broadened consideration of best practices 
in the area of migration was emphasized.  
</p>
<p>44. Anja Klug, senior legal officer at UNHCR, emphasized that racism and 
discrimination had always been among the primary root causes of forced displacement. It 
was noted that hate crimes were at the heart of persecution and at the end of a spectrum, 
starting with hidden as well as institutionalized discrimination, incitement to hatred, verbal 
and physical abuse; genocide was at the extreme end of the spectrum. It was pointed out 
that the right to seek and enjoy asylum from such forms of persecution must be ensured.  
45. The panellist noted that in the last years, racism, xenophobia and discrimination 
against asylum-seekers and refugees had increased; that increased their trauma and 
decreased their chances of integrating into their new societies. It was pointed out that the 
global financial crisis also led to an increase in xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>46. Ms. Klug pointed out that due to that increase, there were more restrictive asylum 
policies: it was more difficult for refugees to have their economic and social rights realized 
and it was more difficult for UNHCR to find resettlement countries for refugees from 
certain regions. It was noted that the negative trend had led to an increase in violent attacks, 
including hate crimes, against asylum-seekers and refugees.  
</p>
<p>47. The panellist emphasized the importance of working in partnerships on all fronts, 
including collaborating with human rights mechanisms, regional organizations, national 
associations, launching awareness-raising campaigns and activities, developing specific 
projects and arranging meetings in safe places where people could discuss challenges and 
look for sustainable solutions.  
</p>
<p>48. Ms. Klug mentioned that protection for all people on the move was an approach 
where human rights are the cornerstone. It was pointed out that there was a need to move to 
a rights-based approach. It was mentioned that there had been a debate on the need to think 
more broadly about people on the move and their different protection needs.  </p>


<p>GE.10-10828 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>49. With regard to root causes of migration, John Bingham, the Head of Policy at the 
International Catholic Migration Commission, noted that it was important to focus on the 
three Ds: differences in demographics, differences in development and differences in 
democracy. Moreover, it was pointed out that persecution and conflicts, poverty, 
environmental changes, including man-made and natural disasters, and job opportunities 
should be also taken into consideration. The panellist emphasized that national policies 
were linked to migration; they also had an impact on trafficking and on the routes the 
migrants took. He also pointed out the importance of keeping families together.  
</p>
<p>50. Mr. Bingham noted that it was important to look at both the positive and negative 
aspects of migration. It was mentioned that the issues of social instability and non-cohesion 
both in the countries of origin and destination needed more attention and research.  
</p>
<p>51. The panellist recalled paragraph 96 of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action that invites States to promote and conduct studies and noted that studies on 
migration should be action-oriented so that progress in the area of migration was facilitated.  
</p>
<p>52. A delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group noted that it was important to 
discuss the issue of displacement of migrants due to natural disasters and conflicts. 
Difficulties arising from the sense of insecurity of migrants and refugees were highlighted; 
reference was made to short-term permits. It was pointed out that the issue of resettlement 
needs to be addressed more extensively. The importance of effective awareness-raising 
initiatives was underlined.  
</p>
<p>53. A delegate stressed that migrants faced multiple forms of discrimination. The high 
vulnerability of women and indigenous peoples was pointed out.  
</p>
<p>54. Another delegate noted that forced displacement was a serious problem. It was also 
mentioned that it was important to understand how global governance could be 
strengthened in order to assist people more effectively.  
</p>
<p>55. Several delegates pointed out the significant role of media with regard to creating or 
eliminating negative stereotypes and xenophobic attitudes towards migrants and refugees.  
</p>
<p>56. A delegate provided an overview of national measures in the area of migration. 
Concerns with regard to conditions in detention centres were raised; it was stated that 
detention had to be in accordance with human rights standards, and that the respective 
Government did not have a detention policy for migrants. Difficulties in ensuring accurate 
and accessible statistics on migration were also pointed out.  
</p>
<p>57. A delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group recalled paragraph 175 of the 
Durban Programme of Action. The vulnerability of migrant women to trafficking was 
noted. The need for information campaigns, awareness-raising and human rights education 
was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>58. Patrick Taran, senior migration specialist at ILO, pointed out that the greatest single 
danger to social cohesion everywhere was the rising tide of xenophobia and violence 
against foreigners. It was noted that the global employment crisis, following the financial 
crisis, was only the beginning. Migrants tended to be among the workers most hit by 
economic downturns; they were often the last to be hired and the first to be fired. Many 
countries had reduced quotas or intake of foreign workers. Migrants remaining employed 
were often affected by reductions in pay, working time, and worsening working conditions. 
They had less access to support from the social safety net. The vulnerability of migrant 
workers made them attractive because they could be underpaid, provided with little or no 
workplace safety and health protections, hired and dismissed on a moment&#8217;s notice; 
furthermore, union organizing among such workers could be impossible. Migrants in 
irregular situations were even more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10828 
</p>
<p>59. The speaker pointed out that migration provided responses to fast-changing needs 
for skills and personnel resulting from technological advances, changes in market 
conditions and industrial transformations. In countries of ageing populations, migration 
offered a potential to replenish declining workforces as well as to inject younger workers, 
increasing dynamism, innovation and mobility in workforces. It was noted that ILO 
research indicated that legal labour migration channels contributed to reducing both the 
trafficking and smuggling of migrants.  
</p>
<p>60. Mr. Taran pointed out that, in accordance also with the provisions of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, racist and xenophobic discrimination, behaviour and 
action should be made unacceptable and illegal; administrative measures should ensure the 
full implementation of legislations and accountability of all government officials; 
independent NHRIs/anti-discrimination institutions should have the power to address non-
citizens; respect for diversity and multicultural interaction should be promoted; media 
should be encouraged to emphasize positive images/messages of diversity and migration; 
multicultural and diversity training should be incorporated in educational curricula; and 
civil society should be mobilized.  
</p>
<p>61. Moreover, the panellist noted that immediate crisis response should include, among 
others: avoiding forced expulsions or return of migrant workers; increasing capacity and 
extending labour inspection; using all means to repress violence and xenophobia against 
foreigners and to prosecute perpetrators of such acts; explicitly discouraging the 
scapegoating of migrants in public discourses; expanding international support for 
employment-intensive recovery measures, employment creation and the extension of 
protection measures to affected populations. 
</p>
<p>62. A delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group emphasized that respect for 
human rights could not be ignored even in times of financial difficulty. It was suggested 
that regional bodies become more involved in exchanging ideas and sharing good practices.  
</p>
<p>63. Another delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group expressed concerns over 
nationalistic movements with political motives aiming to deepen xenophobic practices 
against foreigners. The need for urgent measures in this regard was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>64. A delegate pointed out that the human dimension, including the labour force, of 
globalization had not been receiving appropriate attention.  
</p>
<p>65. Another delegate highlighted the importance of national action plans and NHRIs. 
The necessity to improve the collection of information on migration and close collaboration 
with civil society was also noted.  
</p>
<p>66. A participant noted that the sharing of success stories could facilitate progress in the 
area.  
</p>
<p>67. The importance of ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families was emphasized by several 
delegates. It was also noted that participatory approaches, involving all relevant 
stakeholders in the identification of problems and feasible solutions increased the efficiency 
of measures, both in terms of design and implementation.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Protection of children 
</b></p>

<p>GE.10-10828 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>to survive, develop and reach their fullest potential. Such discrimination was also 
frequently compounded by discrimination on other grounds, such as on the basis of sex or 
disability. Very often that discrimination deprived children of the enjoyment of rights 
generally, including the rights to life, to be free from torture, to education and to health. 
Children who experienced racial discrimination were also often denied access to basic 
social services.  
</p>
<p>69. During its latest session, the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed 
concern at the significant disparities in a State party in the implementation of the rights 
enshrined in the Convention, reflected in a range of social indicators, such as enrolment in 
and completion of education, infant mortality rates and access to health care, which 
indicated persistent discrimination against indigenous and Afro-descendent children from 
economically disadvantaged families. Among its recommendations to address these issues 
was the development of awareness-raising campaigns to prevent and eliminate all forms of 
de facto discrimination against those children.  
</p>
<p>70. The panellist noted that much more was required to address the direct and indirect 
effects of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia on children in all contexts, 
including schools and other educational settings, care and justice systems and in the 
community.  
</p>
<p>71. Moreover, the implementation of legal obligations and recommendations remained a 
challenge. That area should be prioritized. United Nations entities, civil society, including 
NHRIs and NGOs should actively seek out information in that context. Various ideas could 
be considered, including an expert seminar on the topic. Measures to monitor progress in 
this area through the exchange of best practices and lessons learned could be discussed. 
Further ways to gather data and information on the nature of discrimination experienced by 
children and its effects could be explored.  
</p>
<p>72. Karolina Lindholm-Billing, senior liaison officer at UNHCR, highlighted that 
children were sometimes discriminated against to such a degree that they were forced to 
flee and seek asylum abroad. The discrimination could have such serious impact on their 
enjoyment of one or several of their human rights that it amounted to persecution in the 
sense of the definition of a refugee in the 1951 Refugee Convention. It was noted that in 
line with the general comment No. 6 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on 
treatment of unaccompanied and separated children outside their country of origin, it was 
important to interpret the refugee definition in a child, gender and diversity-sensitive way.  
</p>
<p>73. The speaker stated that rights-based, victims-oriented protection response must 
include the right to seek asylum and protection against refoulement.  
</p>
<p>74. The panellist pointed out that children who were not citizens of the country in which 
they lived were often discriminated against in legislation and in practice. In addition, those 
children often faced discrimination because they were asylum-seekers, refugees, or 
stateless. And those children who in addition were, for example, disabled or from an ethnic 
minority or held a certain religious belief could face additional discrimination on those and 
other grounds.  
</p>
<p>75. Ms. Lindholm-Billing noted that in mixed migration situations, security and 
immigration concerns tended to prevail over the welfare and rights of children, including 
that to seek asylum.  
</p>
<p>76. It was pointed out that one of the most pressing protection problems facing asylum-
seeking, refugee and sometimes also stateless children, was their lack of access to national 
child protection systems due to discrimination, living in remote areas far away from local 
infrastructure and services, and lack of documentation which de facto precluded children 
from accession to national child protection systems and essential services, such as health or </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-10828 
</p>
<p>education. That was particularly the case in respect of stateless children. Asylum-seeking 
and refugee children, including those who had suffered sexual violence and abuse, often 
faced problems accessing legal remedies.  
</p>
<p>77. In line with paragraph 96 of the Durban Programme of Action, the panellist strongly 
encouraged the conduction of studies, especially if they examined the root causes and the 
various ways in which racism, xenophobia and related intolerance manifested itself vis-&#224;-
vis asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants, and contained suggestions on ways of 
combating such expressions and acts.  
</p>
<p>78. It was noted that another area where children belonging to certain groups faced 
discrimination was in regard to their right to acquire nationality. Often it was 
discriminatory policies towards, for example, certain ethnic, religious or minority groups, 
or towards women, which resulted in statelessness. Ms. Lindholm-Billing pointed out that 
ensuring the equal right of children to the immediate registration of birth, as called for in 
paragraph 56 of the Durban Programme of Action, was essential for preventing 
statelessness, and for enabling children to exercise their other rights.  
</p>
<p>79. Nicolette Moodie, human rights and gender officer at UNICEF, noted that children 
from indigenous communities experienced higher mortality rates; they were more prone to 
low birthweight, malnutrition and disease; and maternal mortality was also particularly high 
in indigenous areas. In most countries, indigenous children had low school enrolment rates; 
education provided to them often was not culturally sensitive; indigenous girls were 
particularly vulnerable to missing out on school because of the multiple forms of 
discrimination they faced.  
</p>
<p>80. Moreover, a significant proportion of indigenous children were not registered at 
birth, which limited access to health and education and increased the risk of child abuse, 
trafficking and exploitation and led to further exclusion. Indigenous children were also at 
particular risk of becoming involved in the worst forms of child labour. Furthermore, 
indigenous young people in some countries were more likely to be incarcerated.  
</p>
<p>81. The panellist said that many country offices, particularly those in Latin America, 
supported a range of programmes for indigenous children, within the framework of a 
human rights-based approach. However, challenges included limited funds, weak 
coordination with other United Nations agencies, variable relationships with indigenous 
organizations and relatively low coverage of indigenous populations. It was noted that 
indigenous peoples should be involved in the identification of their needs, and collaboration 
with United Nations agencies working on the issue should be strengthened.  
</p>
<p>82. One delegate speaking on behalf of a regional group emphasized that education was 
the key to advancement in life and that access to education must be ensured for all children. 
A suggestion was made to create an information centre on abuse of children in the world. 
The delegate noted that OHCHR should play a role with regard to the collection of 
information on the issue. The importance of legislative measures and awareness-raising 
campaigns was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>83. Another delegate on behalf of a regional group underlined the importance of 
criminalizing all forms of violence against children. It was pointed out that children faced 
multiple forms of discrimination. The delegate said that a discussion in the current forum, 
on how the fight against impunity for acts of violence against children could be further 
promoted and implemented at the national level and on the ground, would be welcomed. 
</p>

<p>GE.10-10828 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance, including on challenges for refugees and asylum-
seekers. It was noted that it was important for the United Nations entities to submit inputs 
for the study. Moreover, it was proposed that the study be complemented by an expert 
meeting. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>85. Frederick Muia, senior adviser at IOE, pointed out that fighting against racial 
discrimination was in the best interest of the employer. It had an impact on business 
competiveness, as in the era of globalization companies needed a variety of skills, 
innovativeness, image and reputation, and a human resource pool. All communities must be 
included in the labour market, to foster social cohesion and industrial relations, potential 
and productivity. It was noted that the cooperation of enterprises, NGOs, Government and 
trade unions needed to be enhanced to promote tolerance and change people&#8217;s mindsets.  
</p>
<p>86. The panellist outlined a number of practical measures that could be undertaken by 
employers aiming to eliminate racial discrimination: systematic anonymization of CVs 
eliminated discrimination based on applicant&#8217;s name or origin, and could be done in close 
collaboration with employment agencies; scholarships and internships for students and 
young people from underrepresented communities; intensified exchange of good practices; 
increase of campaigns and awareness-raising initiatives, and codes of conduct; efforts to 
make cultural allowances; organization of trainings; introduction of anti-harassment 
policies and disciplinary procedures.  
</p>
<p>87. Esther Busser, deputy representative of ITUC, noted that workers from vulnerable 
population groups were concentrated in the lowest-paid jobs with the worst working 
conditions, without social security and, in many cases without trade union representation to 
ensure respect for their rights. It was stated that the Decent Work Agenda could also be 
mobilized to address racial discrimination and xenophobia at the workplace.  
</p>
<p>88. The panellist pointed out a number of problematic issues, such as the lack of 
awareness and mobilization against racism, the absence or inadequate involvement of 
workers from discrimination groups in trade union activities, the poor representation of 
those workers in decision-making instances and the inadequate integration of the subject in 
the social dialogue process.  
</p>
<p>89. The speaker highlighted several actions that could be undertaken by Governments, 
including: providing resources for awareness-raising campaigns and wide-ranging training 
programmes on diversity in the workplace and implementing positive actions to prevent 
and eradicate racial discrimination at work; establishing national observatories and an 
international observatory on the impact of racial discrimination and xenophobia on the 
employment market and associated mechanisms for receiving complaints; establishing 
monitoring mechanisms and a legal framework covering racism in the media; promoting 
the development of a database and systematic studies aimed at following the evolution of 
the issue; disseminating good practices and regular reports to the workers, their unions as 
well as to employers and companies; examining and strengthening employment policies; 
implementing capacity-building programmes for labour inspectors; and establishing 
mechanisms to assist the victims of racial discrimination in the workplace.  
</p>

<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10828 
</p>
<p>States should also continue making efforts to reduce inequalities with regard to access to 
public services. The delegates stressed that awareness-raising campaigns and the sharing of 
good practices could make a difference. It was pointed out that the more active participation 
and involvement of regional organizations would be helpful in that regard. A delegate 
speaking on behalf of a regional group highlighted the importance of combating 
discrimination against women in relation to employment, and suggested paragraphs 31 and 
51 in the Durban Programme of Action as a basis for further discussion. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Implementation of previous decisions of the Working Group

documentation, both procedural and substantive, at least six weeks before the 
respective session starts. The Working Group requests that the Secretariat notify 
NGOs, NHRIs and other stakeholders well in advance, with regard to upcoming 
sessions.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Working Group commits to increase efforts to complement the work of 
other Durban follow-up mechanisms, aiming to avoid overlapping and/or duplication 
of initiatives and agrees to continue discussion on this at future sessions. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Working Group invites experts, in particular the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance to have interactive discussions with the Working Group during its 
respective sessions, in accordance with the availability of the Special Rapporteur.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Working Group decides to increase efforts to remain focused throughout

complex nature of the themes and adopt action-oriented recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Working Group decides to achieve better coordination and ensure synergy
