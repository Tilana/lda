Atrum  Coal  NL  (“Atrum”  or  the  “Company”)  (ASX:  ATU)  is  pleased  to  announce  it  has 
commenced discussions with European and Asian parties regarding the supply of up to 
100,000t of ACG anthracite. Earlier this month, Atrum announced it had entered into a 
binding agreement to acquire a 26.68% interest in ACG. 
 
Export markets remain under-supplied for ultra-high grade anthracite and the Company 
is arranging for ACG product samples to be sent to customers in Asia, Europe and Brazil.  
Although some major users have already expressed interest in the entire 100,000t option, 
the Company is contemplating supply of select parcels to numerous customers in order 
to develop a commercial relationship with Atrum.   
 
Peter  Doyle,  VP  Business  Development  and  Marketing  commented:  “Interest  in  Atrum 
continues  to  strengthen  as  we  prepare  to  enter  the  market  with  ultra-high  grade 
anthracite  for  sale.  We  are  currently  opening  discussions  with  multiple  parties  across 
Europe,  Asia  and  South  America  in  relation  to  the  100,000t  option,  with  the  aim  of 
strengthening long-term ties with Atrum.”

Subject to specified pricing hurdles, ACG will, on request from Atrum, make available up 
to 100,000t of anthracite in aggregate at its site in Pennsylvania for Atrum to collect and 
arrange  transport  to  its  customers.    Several  anthracite  mines  are  expected  to  close  in 
Europe over the next 18 months due to depletion of reserves, and removal of government 
subsidies,  and  the  Company  expects  the  global  anthracite  market  to  tighten  even 
further.   
 
In  addition  to  the  more  typical  Electric  Arc  Furnace,  metals  production  and  filtration 
media users, the Company has also been investigating the growing use of anthracite in 
sugar beet production and chemical manufacturing.  Anthracite is the preferred type of 
fuel for sugar beet refining due to its low sulphur and nitrogen, high heating value and 
low emissions. 
 
Over the coming weeks leading up to the Extraordinary General Meeting the Company 
will continue to investigate high value carbon markets, with the aim of securing multiple 
customers.   An updated presentation featuring information on  Atlantic Carbon Group 
has been prepared as an introduction to the EGM and is attached to this release.  The 
Company will provide more information on ACG in the coming weeks.

Atrum Aim: to become the only anthracite company supplying east and west
Atrum’s Groundhog Project has the potential to be the largest supplier of exported anthracite globally. The project is ready 
to build, and has the attributes to become a long-term supplier of choice to the global carbon industry.
Atlantic Carbon Group currently supplies only domestic US markets. With good access to export ports, and long -term supply 
potential of ultra-high grade anthracite, Atlantic Carbon is ideally positioned to service European and South American 
markets, as well as swing supply into Asian markets

Anthracite Supply and Demand Dynamics: falling supply, sustained demand
Global seaborne supply of high grade anthracite has fallen to below 20Mtpa. This is the result of Vietnam withdrawing from the 
export market, and difficulties for Ukrainian supply. There are no new suppliers of high-grade anthracite of significant volume other 
than Groundhog.

Anthracite Price: anthracite prices remain strong through the cycle
Whilst coke and coking coal prices have fallen over 50% in the past 4 years, anthracite prices have remained strong. 
Abundant availability of merchant coke has kept a ceiling on anthracite price rises, but supply scarcity has created price resilience.
Steady rises in coking coal prices in 2016 have been reflected in increasing anthracite prices.

Groundhog North Project Location: 150km from tide -water
Groundhog is strategically placed on an 
existing rail easement with access to Canada’s 
mainline rail network via Prince George.
 Significant capacity exists on both the rail 
route, and at the port for new tonnage at 
competitive rates
 A western road is planned to provide access
to the Port of Stewart in 2019/2020
 Road/rail to Prince George and Vancouver
or Ridley interim solution until road to 
Stewart is completed
 Via rail 1250km to Ridley Terminal:
 CN rail head 80km to south of
Groundhog, connected by existing 
easement
 Established coal terminal with
significant unused capacity
 Via road 235km to Port of Stewart:
 Higher production provides impetus to
support dedicated infrastructure 
corridor to the west
 New road construction of 118km to join
Hwy 37 to Port of Stewart
 This will be the shortest distance to 
port of any operating export mine in 
Canada

Groundhog North: Development of first mine on the 800km 2 coalfield
The Groundhog Coalfield is the world’s largest undeveloped 
high grade anthracite deposit. Atrum controls 800km2 lease 
area, and has explored only a small portion, delineating over 
1Bn tonnes of resources.
 Atrum began exploration at Groundhog in 2012, building on 
knowledge gained from drilling programs in 1970, 1981, and 
2008.
 144 fully-cored boreholes have been drilled including studies
covering geotechnical, gas and water which have led to the 
delineation of the first mining zones on the Groundhog 
coalfield.
 First development zone is Groundhog North Mining Complex
located in the north-eastern portion of the coalfield which 
contains:
 Multiple potential underground mines feeding central
processing, beneficiation and coal dispatch centre
 Phase 1 mine saleable anthracite capacity of 880,000
tpa in staged development leading to larger scale 
production
 Additional underground and low impact surface
operations identified within Groundhog North precinct, 
may provide either low cost early phase mines, and de-
risk the project in development

Financial Analysis: Groundhog North returns are strong
Groundhog North Mining Complex (US$)
 Assumptions are based on:
 average historical anthracite price (long-term, 5 year
average price)
 moderate production assumptions (global productivity
averages)
 standard exchange rates (current broker consensus outlook
for CAD:USD)
 Minimise capital spend to produce first coal, and displacement of
larger capital costs post cash-flow through in-place equipment 
financing
 Leveraging the project with debt; deferring non-essential capital and
securing separate infrastructure funding increases equity returns 
significantly (38%)
