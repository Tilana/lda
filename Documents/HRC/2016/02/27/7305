<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 26/22, 
</p>
<p>considers the kinds of action that business enterprises have taken to meet their corporate 
</p>
<p>responsibility to respect human rights, based on the discussions held during the third annual 
</p>
<p>Forum on Business and Human Rights, which took place from 1 to 3 December 2014. The 
</p>
<p>report focuses on presentations and key lessons from the thematic session entitled &#8220;Respect 
</p>
<p>in practice: progress and challenges in implementing the corporate responsibility to 
</p>
<p>respect&#8221;, which was convened by the Working Group on the issue of human rights and 
</p>
<p>transnational corporations and other business enterprises, and organized jointly with the 
</p>
<p>Global Business Initiative on Human Rights and the Business and Human Rights Resource 
</p>
<p>Centre. The present document is based on the session report prepared by those two 
</p>
<p>organizations in their capacity as joint organizers. In the concluding section, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group highlights observations and recommendations for the consideration of stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>The purpose of the thematic session was to enable a meaningful multi-stakeholder

<p><b>2</b>  
</p>
<p>relating to the second pillar of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>which concerns the corporate responsibility to respect human rights.  
</p>
<p>The present report provides an overview of the presentations and discussions, as 
</p>
<p>well as some key lessons and insights from the session. The aim is to make available to a 
</p>
<p>wider audience the concrete experiences highlighted and lessons identified at the Forum 
</p>
<p>with a view to building common knowledge and supporting further efforts to implement the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>One part of the session was entitled &#8220;Embedding the Guiding Principles in company 
</p>
<p>policies, processes and decision-making&#8221;. Several business representatives shared the 
</p>
<p>experience of, and lessons from, their company&#8217;s work to achieve meaningful integration, 
</p>
<p>with reference to some of the key concepts set out in the Guiding Principles. The panel 
</p>
<p>touched upon the engagement of chief executive officers on human rights; upgraded policy 
</p>
<p>commitments; cross-functional involvement; the need for strong investment in internal 
</p>
<p>capacity-building to support horizontal and vertical coherence; methodologies to apply 
</p>
<p>human rights due diligence; embedding human rights considerations into core processes; 
</p>
<p>and enhancing operational grievance mechanisms. Several general observations were 
</p>
<p>drawn from the discussion, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Where company commitment exists, the Guiding Principles are influencing 
</p>
<p>practices and decision-making; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Some convergence is occurring around foundational building blocks and associated 
</p>
<p>tools and approaches related to implementing the corporate responsibility to respect; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Putting the basics in place within large organizations takes time, and implementation 
</p>
<p>is an ongoing process; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There is a communication gap, as companies may not be sharing and discussing the 
</p>
<p>totality of what they do with stakeholders and the public. 
</p>
<p>The other main part of the session focused on sharing lessons from specific cases of 
</p>
<p>engagement between business and civil society in order to support implementation of the 
</p>
<p>corporate responsibility to respect human rights. The title of that panel was &#8220;Applying the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles in specific cases: cases of collaboration between civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and business&#8221;. It brought together businesses and civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>working collaboratively, though not always in full agreement, to apply the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles in specific local or sectoral contexts, and included the following case studies: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Community relocation in the context of mining in Mozambique (Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Watch and Vale); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Child labour and women&#8217;s rights on West African cocoa farms (International Cocoa 
</p>
<p>Initiative, Nestl&#233; and Oxfam); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Applying global framework agreements on union rights locally through mutual 
</p>
<p>responsibility in the textile sector (Inditex and IndustriALL); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Privacy and freedom of expression on the Internet (Ranking Digital Rights). 
</p>
<p>The main lessons of the session included: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An understanding that the ingredients for successful relationships between non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations and business include a shared commitment to 
</p>
<p>improving the situation for affected communities, transparency on both sides, a 
</p>
<p>willingness to find ways to promote ongoing communication in order to improve 
</p>
<p>relationships over time, and the recognition that relationship building is a continual 
</p>
<p>process; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Relationships between companies and civil society tend to focus on addressing 
</p>
<p>specific human rights issues in specific contexts. There are often good practical 
</p>
<p>reasons for that, and it is not incompatible with the expectation that companies need 
</p>
<p>to be aware at the same time of the full range of human rights impacts across their 
</p>
<p>operations; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Experience has shown that constructive interaction can lead to specific steps being 
</p>
<p>taken by companies on the ground within a relatively short time; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Good relationships between companies and non-governmental organizations should 
</p>
<p>enable, not replace, further relationship building, especially with civil society 
</p>
<p>stakeholders at the local level; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Government engagement is necessary and will help to frame the relationship 
</p>
<p>between non-governmental organizations and business.  
</p>
<p>Among its key recommendations for the future, the Working Group encourages 
</p>
<p>more companies and non-governmental organizations to publicly share examples of steps 
</p>
<p>taken to implement the second pillar of the Guiding Principles and joint efforts to address 
</p>
<p>challenges in specific situations and contexts, both at the annual Forum and in other 
</p>
<p>settings. Such dialogue and lesson sharing, which should also involve Governments, has 
</p>
<p>great potential for stimulating further learning and spreading innovative engagement 
</p>
<p>between non-governmental organizations and business to prevent and address adverse 
</p>
<p>impacts of business on human rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction and background 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United 
</p>
<p>Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework clearly establish that all business 
</p>
<p>enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights. Understanding better what such 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights might entail in terms of practical steps for companies in specific 
</p>
<p>situations would constitute an important contribution to meeting that responsibility. That is 
</p>
<p>the focus of the present report; it seeks to provide examples of action companies have 
</p>
<p>taken, based on discussions held at the third Forum on Business and Human Rights, which 
</p>
<p>was held from 1 to 3 December 2014. 
</p>
<p>2. Specifically, the report provides an overview of a session held at the Forum entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Respect in practice: progress and challenges in implementing the corporate responsibility 
</p>
<p>to respect&#8221;. The session was convened by the Working Group on the issue of human rights 
</p>
<p>and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, and organized jointly with the 
</p>
<p>Global Business Initiative on Human Rights (GBI) and the Business and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Resource Centre (BHRRC). The Working Group would like to thank GBI and BHRRC for 
</p>
<p>their collaboration in organizing the session and for having prepared a report containing a 
</p>
<p>detailed summary and analysis of the discussions.1 The present document is based on that 
</p>
<p>report, and seeks to transmit key lessons and insights to interested parties. In the concluding 
</p>
<p>section, the Working Group highlights observations and recommendations for the 
</p>
<p>consideration of stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>3. One aspect of the Working Group&#8217;s mandate is to identify, exchange and promote 
</p>
<p>good practices and lessons learned on the implementation of the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/17/31, annex).2 The Working Group also has a mandate to guide the annual Forum 
</p>
<p>on Business and Human Rights that was established to discuss trends and challenges in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Guiding Principles and promote dialogue and cooperation on issues 
</p>
<p>linked to business and human rights, including challenges faced in particular sectors, 
</p>
<p>operational environments and in relation to specific rights and groups, as well as identifying 
</p>
<p>good practices. 
</p>
<p>4. The main themes of the third annual Forum included challenges faced and progress 
</p>
<p>made by companies in integrating the corporate responsibility to respect human rights both 
</p>
<p>in policy and in practice, as well as good practice models for meaningful stakeholder 
</p>
<p>engagement.3 Accordingly, the &#8220;respect in practice&#8221; thematic sessions sought to facilitate a 
</p>
<p>multi-stakeholder dialogue about good practices, lessons, challenges, shortfalls, innovations 
</p>
<p>and complexities relating to implementation of the second pillar of the Guiding Principles 
</p>

</p>
<p> 2 The Guiding Principles were endorsed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4. They are 
</p>
<p>the first United Nations-backed framework to define the respective duties and responsibilities of 
</p>
<p>Governments and business enterprises for preventing and addressing adverse human rights impacts 
</p>
<p>arising from business activities. They apply to all States and business enterprises of all sizes and in all 
</p>
<p>sectors and operating contexts. 
</p>
<p> 3 The other themes were the role of public policy and national action plans, ways to enhance 
</p>
<p>accountability and access to effective remedy for victims of business-related human rights abuse, and 
</p>
<p>the integration of the Guiding Principles in global governance structures. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>and the &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework, which is the corporate responsibility to 
</p>
<p>respect human rights.4  
</p>
<p>5. The overall aim of reporting on the thematic sessions is to make available to a wider 
</p>
<p>audience concrete experiences and lessons presented at the Forum in order to build 
</p>
<p>common knowledge and support further efforts to implement the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group would like to note that the examples highlighted in the present 
</p>
<p>report constitute a limited sample of the practices presented by companies that participated 
</p>
<p>in the Forum and that were willing to share their perspectives in public in a multi-
</p>
<p>stakeholder setting, which a number of other companies are not yet ready to do. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>the fact that the examples were discussed as part of the thematic discussion on &#8220;respect in 
</p>
<p>practice&#8221; does not imply any endorsement of them as &#8220;good practice&#8221;, nor of the company 
</p>
<p>overall, its policy or action taken to respect human rights. The primary purpose in 
</p>
<p>discussing the case studies is to facilitate the exchange of experience and mutual learning 
</p>
<p>among business, civil society and Governments.  
</p>
<p>7. Based on its own assessment, and feedback received from all stakeholder groups, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group would like to facilitate more of that type of focused and action-oriented 
</p>
<p>discussion around specific cases and experiences. In that regard, it commends the 
</p>
<p>companies, non-governmental organizations and States that shared their experiences and 
</p>
<p>perspectives at the Forum. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Introductory reflections on the discussion on respect  
</b></p>
<p>8. The Working Group acknowledged the key importance of using the annual Forum to 
</p>
<p>explore the complexity of what corporate respect for human rights means in practice, and to 
</p>
<p>involve a diverse range of stakeholders in the discussion. With the support of GBI and 
</p>
<p>BHRRC, the aim was to take an innovative approach by looking both inside companies to 
</p>
<p>understand the policies and systems being put in place, and at the same time, at how 
</p>
<p>business engages with civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>9. Inside companies, all actors must appreciate the need to develop robust policies, 
</p>
<p>operating procedures, processes and systems. However, it is also necessary to look at the 
</p>
<p>cultural, &#8220;people-side&#8221; of respect for human rights, be it the message from the chief 
</p>
<p>executive officer (CEO) or the decision of the manager on the ground, as those two 
</p>
<p>dynamics need to work together to achieve effective and sustained human rights due 
</p>
<p>diligence. The Working Group has consistently highlighted the need for more companies to 
</p>
<p>talk publicly about their systems, which in some instances are highly sophisticated and 
</p>
<p>robust from a human rights perspective, and not just from a business management 
</p>
<p>perspective. For the Working Group, that is imperative in order to ensure that the vast 
</p>
<p>majority of companies that are new to the business and human rights agenda do not have to 
</p>
<p>reinvent the wheel, and also in order to recognize that it is essential to close the gap 
</p>
<p>between &#8220;leaders and laggards&#8221;. A common challenge is that there is often reluctance for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 The concept note for the session, which includes further background and the names of panellists, is 
</p>
<p>available from www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/Forum/Pages/2014ForumParallelUNled.aspx. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group also convened other &#8221;good practice&#8221; oriented sessions at the Forum in collaboration 
</p>
<p>with other organizations: a panel discussion on meaningful stakeholder engagement in human rights 
</p>
<p>due diligence, and another on supporting and protecting human rights defenders who work on issues 
</p>
<p>of corporate responsibility and accountability. Both provided valuable insights on elements of good 
</p>
<p>practice relating to implementation of the corporate responsibility to respect. Summaries of the 
</p>
<p>discussions are available in the summary of discussions of the Forum on Business and Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>prepared by the Chair, Mo Ibrahim (A/HRC/FBHR/2014/3).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>companies to share their approaches and lessons, in part because it is very easy to go from 
</p>
<p>&#8220;hero to zero&#8221; when things go wrong. Furthermore, good people can make bad decisions, 
</p>
<p>and good systems can sometimes lead to bad outcomes. That reinforces the need to engage 
</p>
<p>with experts and external stakeholders who can support due diligence approaches.  
</p>
<p>10. Moreover, in exploring the nuts and bolts of corporate respect for human rights in 
</p>
<p>very practical terms, it is not only necessary to address what goes on within companies 
</p>
<p>when putting in place policies and systems, but also how companies engage with affected 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and civil society organizations. While relations with communities and civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations are sometimes tense, they can also be hugely constructive for all 
</p>
<p>parties if approached correctly.  
</p>
<p>11. Another central aspect relates to the role of Governments, as both business 
</p>
<p>integration and relationships between companies and civil society are influenced by the 
</p>
<p>context, or operating environment, that the Government creates. However, that is also a 
</p>
<p>complex task, meaning that it is key for Governments to learn about what it takes to achieve 
</p>
<p>corporate respect for human rights. Governments need to understand the challenges and 
</p>
<p>concerns of communities, civil society and business in order to be effective in meeting their 
</p>
<p>own duties to protect human rights and ensure access to effective remedy when business 
</p>
<p>interests have adverse impacts on human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. </b>Examples of companies&#8217; e<b>fforts to integrate human rights 
in policies and processes and decision-making 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>12. The first panel of the &#8220;respect in practice&#8221; session was entitled &#8220;Embedding the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles in company policies, processes and decision-making&#8221;. The background 
</p>
<p>for the focus of the panel was the benchmark and the standard of conduct established in the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles for both States and businesses. For businesses, respect for human rights 
</p>
<p>requires a clear policy commitment to respect human rights, acting with human rights due 
</p>
<p>diligence and engaging in remediation. That is not a check-box exercise. Rather, it requires 
</p>
<p>genuine changes in mindsets, culture and systems, similar to developments in other areas of 
</p>
<p>corporate policy and systems such as health and safety, the fight against corruption and 
</p>
<p>environmental management. Furthermore, the Guiding Principles articulate certain concepts 
</p>
<p>and ideas that are intended to improve the quality and outcomes of corporate action. The 
</p>
<p>panel was therefore composed of several business representatives who shared the 
</p>
<p>experience and lessons of their company&#8217;s work to achieve meaningful integration, with 
</p>
<p>reference to some of the key concepts set out in the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Policy development and senior management buy-in 
</b></p>
<p>13. The representative of Total S.A. focused on the decade-long journey towards 
</p>
<p>establishing a corporate policy commitment to respect human rights, and the role of CEOs 
</p>
<p>and senior leaders in that process. Some of the following lessons from the process were 
</p>
<p>highlighted, including the need to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Demystify human rights for colleagues and be prepared to use operational language;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Tailor the business case to different internal functions and stakeholders, or in other 
</p>
<p>words, speak about issues that are relevant to them;<b> </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Focus on costs and opportunities: while implementing systems for good due 
</p>
<p>diligence and remediation does cost money, there are always much larger costs when 
</p>
<p>things are not managed and go wrong;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Take a sectoral approach, which also means working collaboratively with 
</p>
<p>competitors;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Take an integrated approach by working with existing processes and systems;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Benchmark through engagement with experts, civil society and peers from diverse 
</p>
<p>industries.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Corporate-wide impact and risk mapping 
</b></p>
<p>14. The representative of Novo Nordisk shared insights from the company&#8217;s experiences 
</p>
<p>of conducting corporate-wide human rights impact and risk mapping. Some of the key 
</p>
<p>lessons learned from the process were that:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Understanding the business context and realities faced by those responsible for 
</p>
<p>carrying out the human rights impact and risk mapping is key. Such internal 
</p>
<p>engagement and effort to understand builds buy-in and ownership; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Undertaking corporate level due diligence is a good starting point because it allows 
</p>
<p>the company to identify priority areas for deeper due diligence and impact 
</p>
<p>assessments at the local level. That deeper level will probably require different types 
</p>
<p>of internal and external expertise; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Guiding Principles helped the company to look at their human rights 
</p>
<p>programmes with fresh eyes and in a more systematic way. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Internal human rights training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>15. The representative of ABB highlighted some key lessons and challenges regarding 
</p>
<p>efforts to embed human rights in the company through human rights training and capacity-
</p>
<p>building, including that:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The leadership mandate from the CEO and senior management for training is key, 
</p>
<p>but ensuring ongoing commitment in the context of stretched resources is a 
</p>
<p>challenge for all businesses; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Achieving coherence across a group of 140,000 people is very difficult. That 
</p>
<p>becomes even more of a challenge when a company has to consider diverse 
</p>
<p>functions, different business units and membership of business associations; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Training is necessary, but it is imperative to put the correct processes in place to 
</p>
<p>ensure people make the correct decisions. For example, the need for human rights 
</p>
<p>training for the security function was highlighted, as security officers are also 
</p>
<p>responsible for questions and requirements about human rights when contracting 
</p>
<p>security providers; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Individuals who have been on training programmes support the company in 
</p>
<p>identifying human rights risks and gaps in company approaches. People who are 
</p>
<p>well trained can become &#8220;eyes and ears&#8221; on the ground to support overall due 
</p>
<p>diligence efforts.  </p>

<p><b> E. Effectiveness of operational-level grievance mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>16. The representative of the BG Group shed light on experiences and challenges related 
</p>
<p>to the effectiveness criteria for operational-level grievance mechanisms set out in the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles, as the company had learned several lessons about issues that can either 
</p>
<p>help or hinder meeting the effectiveness criteria. The lessons learned included:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Good key performance indicators are critical. It is important to look at trends and not 
</p>
<p>make judgements about effectiveness based on data at one point in time. One 
</p>
<p>common pitfall highlighted was the misperception that few grievances was 
</p>
<p>necessarily an indicator of success; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The design of the mechanism should be informed by stakeholder engagement, 
</p>
<p>especially with those who may ultimately use the mechanism. That can help with 
</p>
<p>questions of accessibility and cultural appropriateness; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Addressing budget issues up front is important. In one situation, it was found that 
</p>
<p>lack of internal clarity on who would cover the costs of compensation led to a delay 
</p>
<p>in closing a case. The lesson was to have a budget in place up front which can be 
</p>
<p>used to close off cases and clarify which functions or departments need to be billed 
</p>
<p>for the payment.  
</p>
<p>17. In the context of insights related to implementation of operational grievance 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, a toolbox and a manual developed by the International Petroleum Industry 
</p>
<p>Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) were highlighted. The toolbox includes 
</p>
<p>an awareness pack, template operating procedures, and a diagnostic tool for existing 
</p>
<p>corporate grievance mechanisms.5 The manual is for site managers and those at corporate 
</p>
<p>level.6  
</p>
<p><b> F. General observations from the discussion on embedding the Guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles in company policies, processes and decision-making 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Where company commitment exists, the Guiding Principles are influencing practices 
</b></p>
<p><b>and decision making  
</b></p>
<p>18. Speakers noted that the endorsement of the Guiding Principles by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council provoked a step-up, or reset, of their human rights commitments and work. Equally 
</p>
<p>importantly, the content of the Guiding Principles has begun to influence the details of 
</p>
<p>implementation. Speakers described instances where the spirit and letter of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles are making their way into policies, practices and processes. The panel touched 
</p>
<p>upon CEO engagement on human rights, upgraded policy commitments, cross-functional 
</p>
<p>involvement, strong investment in internal capacity-building to support horizontal and 
</p>
<p>vertical coherence, methodologies to apply human rights due diligence, embedding human 
</p>
<p>rights considerations into core processes, and enhancing operational grievance mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>Examples of where the Guiding Principles are directly influencing policies and processes 
</p>
<p>include due diligence that looks at all operations and all human rights, as opposed to one 
</p>
<p>function and a sub-set of rights; wording about addressing conflict of laws in codes of 
</p>
<p>conduct; the use of the phrase &#8220;cause, contribute and directly linked&#8221; when engaging 
</p>
<p>colleagues about the company&#8217;s impact; and verbatim inclusion of the effectiveness criteria

</p>
<p>for grievance mechanisms contained in the Guiding Principles in company standards and 
</p>
<p>operating procedures.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Some convergence is occurring around foundational building blocks and associated 
</b></p>
<p><b>tools and approaches 
</b></p>
<p>19. Speakers were invited to address one aspect of their human rights work, as each 
</p>
<p>sector and company establishes an approach to human rights that fits their circumstances. 
</p>
<p>At the same time, it seems that a picture is beginning to emerge about some key 
</p>
<p>foundational building blocks relating to implementing respect for human rights. Speakers 
</p>
<p>presented or referenced tools and resources that have been developed in-house, albeit often 
</p>
<p>with the help of external experts. For example:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; To establish priorities and a road map, some companies are developing in-house 
</p>
<p>Excel and Word tools to map human rights risks at a corporate level. Those tools 
</p>
<p>cover all business processes, the value chain and operational contexts, address the 
</p>
<p>adequacy of current policy and practice, and are based on the Guiding Principles; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To strengthen internal coherence and commitment to action, some companies are 
</p>
<p>hosting cross-functional meetings and workshops or establishing cross-functional 
</p>
<p>working groups or committees; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To build capacity and awareness, some companies are publishing internal guides or 
</p>
<p>developing training modules that address basic definitional questions while using 
</p>
<p>examples and operational language relevant to the business; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To begin to prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, some companies are 
</p>
<p>using a mixture of self-assessments, studies and impact assessments. They can relate 
</p>
<p>to a specific function, a country, an operation or a product or service in the value 
</p>
<p>chain; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To start thinking about grievance mechanisms, some companies are beginning to 
</p>
<p>develop tools to assess current mechanisms against the effectiveness criteria set out 
</p>
<p>in the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Putting the basics in place within large organizations takes time, and implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>is an ongoing journey during which things can change and go wrong  
</b></p>
<p>20. The session was a reminder of the attention and time it takes for a single company to 
</p>
<p>address one aspect of its human rights programme. Even for companies that are actively 
</p>
<p>engaged and committed to implementing corporate respect for human rights, getting the 
</p>
<p>basics in place across vast entities and value chains takes time. It also seemed clear that 
</p>
<p>even the best tools, processes and systems can be undermined by personnel changes, 
</p>
<p>restructuring and bad decision-making. That is true of every aspect of corporate life and 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the need to build coherence, the correct incentives, robust processes, awareness 
</p>
<p>and culture.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Given that companies are acknowledging that it takes time to put in place the 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary components to respect human rights, questions remain regarding the 
</b></p>
<p><b>timelines for suppliers to meet expectations  
</b></p>
<p>21. The panel noted that assessing whether a supplier or business partner is a good 
</p>
<p>performer or not regarding respect for human rights was rarely a simple process. Certain 
</p>
<p>rights might be very well respected and others not. The decision then becomes about 
</p>
<p>whether to work with the supplier towards improvement, what is non-negotiable in terms of 
</p>
<p>current practice or timetable for corrective action and how to work with the supplier to raise 
</p>
<p>performance. It was acknowledged that a further query that needs to be addressed is what </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>companies should ask of business partners to substantiate the judgement about their 
</p>
<p>performance regarding human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Coherence and endurance are important, as good systems and policies do not mean 
</b></p>
<p><b>things cannot go wrong, and the reasons why things go wrong are not necessarily 
</b></p>
<p><b>simple  
</b></p>
<p>22. In essence, things can go wrong because companies are made up of people and 
</p>
<p>people do not always follow the rules. It was noted that there is not one reason for that. It 
</p>
<p>can be a result of different cultural understandings of a rule or the idea of rules. It can be a 
</p>
<p>function of an incentive structure that does not prioritize certain rules in favour of other 
</p>
<p>objectives. Sometimes people, often a very small number, simply do not want to follow the 
</p>
<p>rules. All of that reinforces the importance of coherence, the correct incentives, robust 
</p>
<p>processes, awareness and culture.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. There is a communication gap  
</b></p>
<p>23. Committed companies may not be sharing and discussing the totality of what they 
</p>
<p>do with stakeholders and the public. A few speakers noted that such reticence often comes 
</p>
<p>from knowledge that there is still much more work to be done. Furthermore, a bad incident 
</p>
<p>or error could render communication of progress and action meaningless, or worse, 
</p>
<p>disingenuous, in the eyes of some stakeholders. At the same time, it is likely that 
</p>
<p>stakeholders could interpret limited communication as reflecting a limited or hollow 
</p>
<p>commitment.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Stakeholder engagement is of critical value  
</b></p>
<p>24. The discussion highlighted that engagement with stakeholders and rights-holders is a 
</p>
<p>critical success factor for achieving meaningful results for vulnerable groups. One 
</p>
<p>observation was that there are often inherent tensions between the interests of the company 
</p>
<p>and the interests of the community, especially when addressing the issues involves 
</p>
<p>significant costs. It was acknowledged that such tensions can exist, and that in order to 
</p>
<p>avoid them as much as possible, it is imperative that the company has cross-functional buy-
</p>
<p>in, discusses the issues in depth, and addresses the budgeting and resource question up 
</p>
<p>front.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Examples of engagement between non-governmental 
organizations and business to advance implementation of the 
corporate responsibility to respect human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>25. The second panel of the session was entitled &#8220;Applying the Guiding Principles in 
</p>
<p>specific cases: cases of collaboration between civil society organizations and business&#8221;. As 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles are a means to an end, intended to ensure that the human rights of 
</p>
<p>those impacted by business operations, decisions, omissions and actions are respected and 
</p>
<p>protected, and that remedy is provided in the case of adverse impacts, their implementation 
</p>
<p>is far more than the development or enhancement of policies, processes and management 
</p>
<p>systems. Companies therefore should and need to communicate openly about specific cases 
</p>
<p>and situations, including ones in which they have made progress, but also cases and 
</p>
<p>situations in which mistakes have been made and lessons have been learned. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>understanding what good quality and meaningful respect looks like in practice is a task that 
</p>
<p>is highly dependent on the specific operating and human rights context; in that regard, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>cooperation with civil society organizations is crucial. Moreover, the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>themselves include a call for engagement with human rights experts, relevant stakeholders 
</p>
<p>and affected populations as part of due diligence processes. Thus, the panel brought 
</p>
<p>together businesses and civil society organizations working collaboratively, though not 
</p>
<p>always in full agreement, to apply the Guiding Principles in specific local and sectoral 
</p>
<p>contexts.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Community relocation in the context of mining in Mozambique 
</b></p>
<p>26. The discussion featured a case study on the engagement between the mining 
</p>
<p>company Vale and the international non-governmental organization (NGO) Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Watch in the context of the Moatize mine in Mozambique. In recent years, Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Watch has been engaged in monitoring the impact on local communities of the extractives 
</p>
<p>boom in Mozambique, especially regarding resettlements. According to the presentations at 
</p>
<p>the Forum, between 2006 and 2010, the Moatize mine developed by Vale involved moving 
</p>
<p>1,365 households that were in close proximity to the project site. The representative of Vale 
</p>
<p>explained that the company had worked closely with local communities on the resettlement, 
</p>
<p>conducting dialogues and consultations, in accordance with company guidelines on respect 
</p>
<p>for human rights. Human Rights Watch conducted research on the resettlements in 2012 
</p>
<p>and raised concerns about the ability of resettled families to obtain adequate food, water 
</p>
<p>and access to work. Vale and Human Rights Watch engaged in a productive dialogue as 
</p>
<p>Vale worked to address those concerns.  
</p>
<p>27. The representative of Vale highlighted that the mode of engagement of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Watch had been key in enabling a constructive relationship. The relationship was 
</p>
<p>seen as a &#8220;two-way street&#8221;, with a strong focus on transparency and being proactive about 
</p>
<p>changes on the ground as early as possible. The following elements of the approach were 
</p>
<p>identified:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Human Rights Watch demonstrated understanding of how a company works, which 
</p>
<p>was reflected in the initial approach to the president of Vale and in its support of the 
</p>
<p>company&#8217;s response and action plans; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; From the outset, Human Rights Watch was very transparent about the findings of its 
</p>
<p>research and what it felt the company needed to correct. Human Rights Watch 
</p>
<p>shared its initial findings with Vale; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Concerning transparency, Human Rights Watch wanted Vale to be proactive from 
</p>
<p>the outset. It was in favour of Vale taking action that would lead to results as early 
</p>
<p>as possible for the families and communities concerned, and for the company; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The overall spirit of the engagement was not to &#8220;name and shame&#8221;, even though it 
</p>
<p>was made clear that that would be a possible avenue of action if deemed necessary; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; When conducting the investigation, the research methodology of the NGO was 
</p>
<p>thorough and fact-based.  
</p>
<p>28. The presentation also included an explanation of the immediate steps taken by the 
</p>
<p>company following the initial communication from Human Rights Watch to the president 
</p>
<p>of Vale, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Opening up the records about the resettlement process in question and discussing 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Watch what had been done, what flaws there were and what 
</p>
<p>mistakes had been made; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Six weeks after the initial meeting, and on the recommendation of the NGO, Vale 
</p>
<p>convened a 40-person group of its managers in Mozambique to identify lessons 
</p>
<p>learned, which the company recorded as a very positive experience; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An agreement/memorandum of understanding between Vale and the local authorities 
</p>
<p>was signed. A plan of action containing 42 points relating to water, housing, road 
</p>
<p>maintenance, transportation and income generation was agreed on by the parties. An 
</p>
<p>important aspect of the plan was clarity about the timing of the action. Vale was 
</p>
<p>clear about what could be achieved in the medium and the long term. Managing 
</p>
<p>expectations about what was possible and when was very important; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Joint follow-up calls to monitor and discuss progress and a meeting in less than a 
</p>
<p>year to review action regarding the resettlement. The sustainability Vice-President of 
</p>
<p>Vale met with Human Rights Watch in New York to reaffirm the company&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>engagement in the process. 
</p>
<p>29. The representative of Vale also shared the company&#8217;s perspective on lessons learned 
</p>
<p>and further steps that were taken after Human Rights Watch released its report in May 
</p>
<p>2013. The company attended the release in Maputo and participated in dialogues with 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in Mozambique. At that stage, additional points were added to the action plan, 
</p>
<p>including with regard to social dialogue and grievance mechanisms. A key lesson was the 
</p>
<p>need to ensure that all human rights are dealt with in the context of social and 
</p>
<p>environmental impact assessments. Furthermore, the process was seen as being instructive 
</p>
<p>in terms of establishing a clear internal standard for the conduct of resettlement processes, 
</p>
<p>which everyone in the business must apply.  
</p>
<p>30. A central challenge that was highlighted was the need to address the State&#8217;s duties, 
</p>
<p>as some of the issues relate to government policies, legal frameworks and actions related to 
</p>
<p>land and resettlement. They involve issues that cannot be solved by one company 
</p>
<p>unilaterally. In addition, the point was highlighted that often, more than one company is 
</p>
<p>involved in the social and human rights impacts that are being felt on the ground.  
</p>
<p>31. The representative of Human Rights Watch emphasized the fact that it sought to 
</p>
<p>engage with various actors to achieve necessary changes in the context of human rights 
</p>
<p>abuses. With regard to the specific situation in Mozambique, it was noted that the 
</p>
<p>combination of the mining boom and the outdated regulations, as well as the lack of 
</p>
<p>monitoring and oversight over licensing and mining operations, was a recipe for human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses. The NGO had first become involved in the Vale mine in 2012 when it had 
</p>
<p>learned of a protest related to the quality of housing, which had led to the initial 
</p>
<p>investigation. 
</p>
<p>32. The representative of Human Rights Watch noted that the nature of the response 
</p>
<p>from Vale to its action had been positive in comparison with many other responses to 
</p>
<p>investigations. The response to the initial inquiry had been immediate and Vale had made 
</p>
<p>all the relevant documentation available, and the company&#8217;s attitude was seen as timely and 
</p>
<p>open. In addition, Human Rights Watch was given significant access to leaders and 
</p>
<p>employees at all levels of the company, from the headquarters in Brazil to offices in 
</p>
<p>Maputo and at the mining operation. That had facilitated the ability of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Watch to identify the best way forward in terms of recommendations to improve the 
</p>
<p>situation.  
</p>
<p>33. As part of the engagement, Vale had also been provided with a version of the final 
</p>
<p>report before the launch. Due to the nature of the relationship, it had been possible to reflect 
</p>
<p>the views and actions taken by Vale, even if the purpose of sharing the report had not been 
</p>
<p>to enable the company to propose changes. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>34. Like Vale, Human Rights Watch also reported that it found the relationship with 
</p>
<p>Vale to be a positive experience, and that it led to meaningful concrete changes in company 
</p>
<p>action and the situation of the community in Mozambique. The NGO also noted that it was 
</p>
<p>pleased that Vale was determined to integrate lessons learned into policies and practices in 
</p>
<p>other operations. Human Rights Watch hoped that other companies operating in 
</p>
<p>Mozambique would do likewise.  
</p>
<p>35. Human Rights Watch provided several general reflections, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A number of issues could have been addressed or prevented if better due diligence 
</p>
<p>had been done early on; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Companies often have good systems in place, but Human Rights Watch finds that 
</p>
<p>they often lack an accurate picture of perspectives on the ground. Sometimes, 
</p>
<p>companies recognize the issues, but fail to accept their gravity; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; While forming relationships with local civil society organizations is critically 
</p>
<p>important, it can be different from working with international NGOs. Often, there is 
</p>
<p>a heightened sense of conflict between local actors and the company, local actors 
</p>
<p>may have access to fewer resources, they can be less sophisticated in their mode of 
</p>
<p>engagement and some can feel excluded from a process. Human Rights Watch urged 
</p>
<p>companies to investigate thoroughly any issues or concerns that came their way, 
</p>
<p>without needing the external push or scrutiny that international NGOs brought. That 
</p>
<p>should also be considered even when management thought it was aware of the 
</p>
<p>situation and even when there were doubts about the credibility of interlocutors.  
</p>
<p><b> C. </b>Child labour and women&#8217;s rights <b>on West African cocoa farms 
</b></p>
<p>36. The second case study featured presentations by representatives of Nestl&#233;, Oxfam 
</p>
<p>and the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI) on their engagement in addressing challenges 
</p>
<p>related to child labour and women&#8217;s rights in the context of cocoa production in West 
</p>
<p>Africa, an issue that has attracted increasing attention from civil society organizations in the 
</p>
<p>past decade. 
</p>
<p>37. The representative of Nestl&#233; provided some background information on the 
</p>
<p>programme to address child labour in the cocoa industry. In recent years, the yield for 
</p>
<p>cocoa has stagnated for a number of reasons, including the lack of implementation of good 
</p>
<p>agricultural practices, the small size of fields, which limited industrial production, ageing 
</p>
<p>trees, an ageing workforce, as many young people did not want to work in the cocoa fields, 
</p>
<p>and the stagnation in the commodity price coupled with a reduction in prices at the farm 
</p>
<p>level, in part due to high taxation and the number actors/tiers in the supply chain. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the situation is characterized by low income for farmers (about US$ 50 per 
</p>
<p>month, or barely above US$ 2 per day) and the high number of children involved in cocoa 
</p>
<p>production. One estimate is that there are 800,000 children working in the cocoa supply 
</p>
<p>chain in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire alone.  
</p>
<p>38. The representative of Nestl&#233; explained that its response was to put in place a 
</p>
<p>programme consisting of three pillars, the first seeking to increase farmers&#8217; profits, the 
</p>
<p>second focused on the social conditions in the supply chain and the third seeking to ensure 
</p>
<p>resilience in the cocoa supply chain in order to meet production needs.  
</p>
<p>39. In order to address the issue of social conditions, Nestl&#233; entered into a partnership 
</p>
<p>with the Fair Labor Association in 2011 to conduct a baseline analysis of the prevalence of 
</p>
<p>child labour in the cocoa supply chain, which resulted in 11 recommendations from the Fair 
</p>
<p>Labor Association. Nestl&#233; adopted all the recommendations, including the one to establish 
</p>
<p>the Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation System, which was supported by ICI. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>system sought to address policies and practices in all the tiers of the supply chain, from 
</p>
<p>local growers to cooperatives and tier-one suppliers to Nestl&#233;. By the end of November 
</p>
<p>2014, some 16 cooperatives had implemented the system. The aim is to have the system 
</p>
<p>implemented by all Nestl&#233; Cocoa Plan cooperatives by 2016. With the support of ICI, 
</p>
<p>Nestl&#233; conducted training for company employees, including agronomists, who can now 
</p>
<p>identify cases of child labour, and with external actors such as farmers and cooperative 
</p>
<p>owners. A key finding was that the system identifies more cases of concern than those 
</p>
<p>identified under the certification scheme audits. In fact, about 3,000 instances of child 
</p>
<p>labour were found that were linked to certified cooperatives.  
</p>
<p>40. The collaboration with the Fair Labor Association and ICI was seen as crucial by 
</p>
<p>Nestl&#233; with respect to its efforts to address child labour. Civil society organizations have 
</p>
<p>the necessary expertise, credibility and capacity to implement programmes and audits. It 
</p>
<p>was also important to try and engage with the Government in order to coordinate 
</p>
<p>programmes.  
</p>
<p>41. It was noted that activities related to child labour were part of the overall programme 
</p>
<p>on human rights due diligence. The Guiding Principles had been critical in informing the 
</p>
<p>design of the programme and in clarifying the responsibility of the company to use leverage 
</p>
<p>in addressing the problem of child labour in the supply chain.  
</p>
<p>42. The representative of ICI, a multi-stakeholder coalition that aimed to bring about 
</p>
<p>sector-wide change to protect children in the cocoa industry, noted that a key aspect of its 
</p>
<p>work was building the capacity of a range of actors in the supply chain, including Nestl&#233;, 
</p>
<p>and engaging communities and Governments in producing countries. Among the insights 
</p>
<p>ICI had identified with regard to making valuable changes on the ground through 
</p>
<p>collaboration with multiple actors, the following were emphasized: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is necessary to recognize that identifying child labour is a complex issue. It is not 
</p>
<p>easy to walk onto a farm and spot which cases constitute child labour and which do 
</p>
<p>not. Consideration should be given to time of day, the nature of the work and the age 
</p>
<p>of the child, which is not always easy to determine; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Building on existing capacity makes sense. Since cooperatives in the supply chain 
</p>
<p>are institutions with management capability and structures, working through them is 
</p>
<p>necessary; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Real remediation, not policing, is critical. Arriving on a farm and simply pinpointing 
</p>
<p>child labour silences dialogue and pushes the issue under the surface. Farmers and 
</p>
<p>children need good alternatives that work; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Innovation can help spread knowledge and good practices, such as in the case of a 
</p>
<p>smartphone application implemented by ICI that allows data to be gathered in order 
</p>
<p>to inform decisions taken by cooperatives.  
</p>
<p>43. The representative of Oxfam explained that its engagement with Nestl&#233; and other 
</p>
<p>companies in the sector took place in part through the &#8220;Behind the Brands&#8221; campaign, 
</p>
<p>which ranks and scores 10 food and beverage companies in seven areas: land access and 
</p>
<p>rights, women&#8217;s rights, support to farmers, workers&#8217; rights, mitigation of climate impacts, 
</p>
<p>transparency at corporate level, and water use and impacts as well as access to water. Issues 
</p>
<p>and lessons highlighted from engagement through that initiative included: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is not just about the relationship between Oxfam and the brands<b>.</b> It is also a 
</p>
<p>dialogue in which Oxfam has tried to involve the public; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It is not easy to engage all 10 companies on all seven areas. Companies are often 
</p>
<p>more comfortable or confident addressing some issues rather than others; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Oxfam found that it is effective to use reports and campaigns to highlight specific 
</p>
<p>issues that require more attention, in its opinion; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Oxfam does not set out to blindside companies. Before going public with reports, it 
</p>
<p>gives the company or companies concerned the opportunity to comment and 
</p>
<p>understand Oxfam&#8217;s demands. 
</p>
<p>44. A particular focus for Oxfam&#8217;s work on the cocoa supply chains was the issue of 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s inequality, and the double aspect of recognizing the need to protect women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights and addressing inequality as a means to tackle child labour. As women make up 
</p>
<p>43 per cent of the workforce in the world&#8217;s agricultural sector, and investments in family 
</p>
<p>health care, children&#8217;s education and food tends to be the concern of women, it was noted 
</p>
<p>that increased income and opportunities for women in the supply chain can address the root 
</p>
<p>causes of child labour.  
</p>
<p>45. With regard to engaging Nestl&#233;, Oxfam explained that research conducted in 2013 
</p>
<p>had highlighted the issue of women&#8217;s rights in the cocoa supply chain. The process had 
</p>
<p>involved engaging Nestl&#233; and others both privately and publicly, and shortly after the 
</p>
<p>public campaign, Nestl&#233; had agreed to all of the requests made. After engagement between 
</p>
<p>Oxfam and Nestl&#233;, as well as Mars and Mondel&#275;z, a road map to address the issues had 
</p>
<p>been agreed on, and Oxfam had continued the engagement with those companies in order to 
</p>
<p>evaluate the progress on the road map.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Applying global framework agreements locally through mutual 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility in the textile sector 
</b></p>
<p>46. The third case study included presentations by representatives of Inditex and the 
</p>
<p>global union federation IndustriALL on the implementation of a global framework 
</p>
<p>agreement covering the 6,000 factories that supplied Inditex. Inditex, which manufactures 
</p>
<p>close to 1 billion garments per year, involving some 1 million workers in 40 different 
</p>
<p>countries, signed an agreement with IndustriALL in 2007, which was renewed in 2014, to 
</p>
<p>promote decent working conditions in supplier factories worldwide. The agreement 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the importance of freedom of association and collective bargaining, enabling 
</p>
<p>workers to monitor and enforce their rights. The agreement is underpinned by the Inditex 
</p>
<p>code of conduct, which sets out a commitment by the company that includes requirements 
</p>
<p>for zero tolerance of forced and child labour, the guarantee of a living wage and other core 
</p>
<p>labour rights.  
</p>
<p>47. The representative of Inditex highlighted the commercial benefits of that 
</p>
<p>arrangement, and its importance to the expression of the company&#8217;s values of creating 
</p>
<p>prosperity and being transparent in its operations. All suppliers were bound by social and 
</p>
<p>environmental responsibility guidelines, but the approach was not only about compliance, 
</p>
<p>but rather multilateral cooperation involving trade unions, NGOs, the International Labour 
</p>
<p>Organization and local industries to engage directly with supplier factories. 
</p>
<p>48. The representative of IndustriALL explained how the policy framework had come 
</p>
<p>into being, starting with a series of unilateral commitments, codes and approaches to 
</p>
<p>implementation by Inditex in 2002. That had led in 2007 to the signing by both parties of a 
</p>
<p>global framework agreement, which had been the first such agreement in the garment 
</p>
<p>sector.7 In 2012, Inditex and IndustriALL had signed a protocol on trade union rights. The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 There are now 42 such agreements in diverse sectors. It was noted that the Accord on Fire and 
</p>
<p>Building Safety in Bangladesh, which includes a legally binding agreement between 190 brands, had 
</p>
<p>been the result of the promotion of such arrangements.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>protocol established the role of trade unions in the implementation of the agreement. In 
</p>
<p>2014, the agreement was renewed.  
</p>
<p>49. With regard to the application of the global framework agreement, by 2013, some 
</p>
<p>3,500 factories were taking steps related to trade union rights. Other activities included 
</p>
<p>country-level follow-up plans; trade union visits to a number of factories; a pilot project in 
</p>
<p>Turkey involving elected workers&#8217; representatives, trade union leaders and managers from 
</p>
<p>factories; conflict resolution in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Peru; and a project to create 
</p>
<p>factory health and safety committees in Bangladesh.  
</p>
<p>50. Commenting on the effectiveness of the model for engagement, the representative of 
</p>
<p>IndustriALL observed that local trade unions need to be involved. That means engaging in 
</p>
<p>bargaining, discussions and factory visits. The role of unions is not just to address 
</p>
<p>grievances or complaints, but also to prevent problems and address the root causes of 
</p>
<p>labour rights abuses. The representative of IndustriALL also stressed the importance of 
</p>
<p>recognizing the move from unilateral corporate commitments to joint responsibility based 
</p>
<p>on mutual and contractual commitments between actors. Joint responsibility also needed to 
</p>
<p>be about broadening application and spreading the experience to others in the sector.  
</p>
<p>51. One lesson identified was the need to establish legally binding agreements at the 
</p>
<p>local level so that mutual responsibility exists. The Guiding Principles on Business and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, which require companies to look at all human rights, had been taken into 
</p>
<p>account in the development of the framework agreement, which now includes the concepts 
</p>
<p>from the Guiding Principles of prevention, correction and remediation. The focus on union 
</p>
<p>rights was also a necessity, given the capacity of the union federation. At the local level, the 
</p>
<p>first challenge is often to get managers to speak with trade unions, which can lead to 
</p>
<p>addressing a whole range of rights concerns. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Privacy and freedom of expression on the Internet 
</b></p>
<p>52. The following case study was presented by the NGO Ranking Digital Rights and 
</p>
<p>featured its engagement with Microsoft to strengthen protection of the right to privacy and 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression for Internet users.8 The specific human rights issue in question 
</p>
<p>focused on how telecommunications companies providing web and voice services over the 
</p>
<p>Internet respect the freedom of expression and privacy of users. That is a concern 
</p>
<p>worldwide, and is often characterized by a situation in which companies are stuck between 
</p>
<p>demands from a Government and the concerns of a company&#8217;s users or customers.  
</p>
<p>53. The presentation highlighted how the relationship between civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and business on that particular issue had evolved from one of public 
</p>
<p>confrontation to shared learning, dialogue and problem solving, as described in the 
</p>
<p>following four phases: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Online criticism of the sector: In January 2006, Microsoft had its first experience 
</p>
<p>with the issue when a story surfaced about Microsoft deleting a blog of a Chinese 
</p>
<p>activist. After investigation, it transpired that the deletion had allegedly followed a 
</p>
<p>telephone call from a government official and was a result of action taken by a local 
</p>
<p>Microsoft partner. That was happening at the same time as Yahoo! and Google were 
</p>
<p>involved in related freedom of expression and privacy issues in China. In 2006, the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 Microsoft was also scheduled to join the discussion, but had to cancel. However, Microsoft 
</p>
<p>encouraged Ranking Digital Rights to proceed alone, thus giving a clear indication of the level of 
</p>
<p>trust and dialogue that exists between the two entities. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>status of the relationship between companies and civil society effectively amounted 
</p>
<p>to yelling at each other over the so-called &#8220;blogosphere&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Interaction in the United States of America: In 2006, a high-ranking member of the 
</p>
<p>United States Congress called attention to those cases and in effect claimed that the 
</p>
<p>companies were morally deficient for allowing such things to happen. At that time, 
</p>
<p>there were opposing views, with many arguing that companies should pull out from 
</p>
<p>markets where they faced such requirements, whereas the companies argued that 
</p>
<p>their presence was a good thing as it could foster development and respect for 
</p>
<p>various rights where they operated; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A discussion about subtleties: Around the same time, some individuals and 
</p>
<p>organizations within civil society started asking more subtle questions such as: If a 
</p>
<p>company is going to do business in that market, how will it do business? What will 
</p>
<p>or should a company do to be responsible? Were the requests to take down user 
</p>
<p>information or data linked to a legal process? Does Microsoft, and do others, have a 
</p>
<p>process in place to evaluate requests or evaluate local partners? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Multi-stakeholder agreement on principles and monitoring: In 2008, the Global 
</p>
<p>Network Initiative was founded based on the principles of freedom of expression 
</p>
<p>and privacy. A number of companies, human rights organizations, investors and 
</p>
<p>academics joined the process to agree guidelines, monitor their implementation and 
</p>
<p>support transparency regarding company practices.  
</p>
<p>54. Further insights were shared in relation to Microsoft&#8217;s purchase of Skype in 2011, at 
</p>
<p>which time Skype&#8217;s Chinese joint venture had been exposed as allegedly enabling 
</p>
<p>government surveillance and censorship. Working in close consultation with the civil 
</p>
<p>society and academic members of the Global Network Initiative, Microsoft ended Skype&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>original joint venture and found a new local partner that allowed Microsoft to maintain 
</p>
<p>control over Skype&#8217;s security and communications.  
</p>
<p>55. One of the key lessons that was noted from the evolving relationship between civil 
</p>
<p>society and business was the importance of recognizing that both sides learned from the 
</p>
<p>engagement. Another key lesson learned for everyone was that decisions were not straight 
</p>
<p>forward. For civil society organizations engaged in the Global Network Initiative, an 
</p>
<p>important lesson learned was that companies are often faced with a range of sub-optimal 
</p>
<p>choices. In that regard, a mature relationship between civil society and business could play 
</p>
<p>a role in supporting the company to make the least bad choice, and to be open about that 
</p>
<p>fact.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Government perspectives 
</b></p>
<p>56. Representatives of Governments speaking at the session9 emphasized the value of 
</p>
<p>hearing practical examples of companies and civil society working together. Some 
</p>
<p>observations included the need for both sides to learn in the process and putting in place 
</p>
<p>long-term changes that were sector-wide. With regard to the role that Governments could 
</p>
<p>play, it was noted that Governments could encourage and reinforce partnerships, and also 
</p>
<p>play an active role in facilitating or participating in multi-stakeholder platforms. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>Governments could also support good practices through their own relationships with 
</p>
<p>business, such as when purchasing goods or services, enact legislation, and develop 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 The panel included representatives from the Governments of Colombia and the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>national action plans on business and human rights, ensuring that both business and civil 
</p>
<p>society were engaged in the consultation process.  
</p>
<p><b> G. General observations from the discussion on relationships between civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society organizations and business 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. There are some common ingredients for successful relationships  
</b></p>
<p>57. Based on the presentations by the panel speakers, certain elements that seem 
</p>
<p>essential for meaningful and constructive engagement between companies and civil society 
</p>
<p>were elicited. For example:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Shared commitment to improved results for rights-holders; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Two-way transparency, including the company providing open access to 
</p>
<p>documentation and civil society not blindsiding the company; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Formalizing relationships through open letters, memorandums of understanding, 
</p>
<p>work plans and even binding or contractual arrangements supports clarity and 
</p>
<p>mutual accountability; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Making the relationship institutional as opposed to between a few people only, such 
</p>
<p>as the NGO and someone in the company&#8217;s corporate social responsibility 
</p>
<p>department. That includes meetings involving individuals at company and NGO 
</p>
<p>headquarters, in the country concerned and at a local or operational level; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; All parties must expect to learn, including being prepared to take on new data, and to 
</p>
<p>change perspectives and mindsets, even when they feel they start with a large 
</p>
<p>amount of knowledge and insight. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. </b>Grounding the interaction and relationship in the company&#8217;s responsibility to respect 
</p>
<p><b>can be productive  
</b></p>
<p>58. From the examples shared, it appears that meaningful relationships include a mutual 
</p>
<p>interest in enhancing the company&#8217;s ability to meet its responsibility to respect, as defined 
</p>
<p>in the Guiding Principles. That is distinct from companies closing off genuine policy and 
</p>
<p>practice changes, or civil society using scrutiny or knowledge of a company with the main 
</p>
<p>aim of influencing the action of others, such as Governments or investors. When civil 
</p>
<p>society proposals dovetail with some level of existing company commitment and know-
</p>
<p>how, it seems to maximise the chances of successful relationships.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Relationships between companies and civil society seem to be focused on addressing 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific rights in specific contexts with specific individuals or groups in mind  
</b></p>
<p>59. The relationships discussed seemed to relate to the particular mission, agenda, skill 
</p>
<p>set and experiences of the civil society organization. In every example shared, the civil 
</p>
<p>society organization is a recognized leader in achieving policy and practice change on the 
</p>
<p>issue in question. Given the highly significant and severe risks for the company or industry 
</p>
<p>in question, the company itself usually has a level of knowledge and experience, but sees 
</p>
<p>the need to go further in its efforts to respect rights related to, for example, land in the 
</p>
<p>mining industry, trade union rights in the textiles sector, child labour in agriculture and 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression and privacy in the information and communications technology 
</p>
<p>industry. While it is important to bear in mind that the Guiding Principles indicate that 
</p>
<p>companies have a responsibility to respect all human rights, in evaluating partnerships in 
</p>
<p>that regard, two elements come to light. Firstly, the activities linked to the relationship are 
</p>
<p>rarely the sum total of a company&#8217;s efforts to meet its responsibility to respect human </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>rights. Secondly, addressing some rights in great depth can enable the protection and 
</p>
<p>respect of others rights, such as when tackling inequality for women in the cocoa supply 
</p>
<p>chain helps eliminate child labour and when other rights are indirectly upheld when trade 
</p>
<p>union rights are protected.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Timing and timeframes matter, and not everything takes a long time  
</b></p>
<p>60. It is notable that in the examples involving a report from civil society, the company 
</p>
<p>in question acted very quickly and constructively; sometimes meetings took place within 
</p>
<p>one week and action plans were in place within one month. Importantly, that may be 
</p>
<p>because the civil society group provided a window of opportunity for the company to input 
</p>
<p>and engage before reports were released. Establishing timeframes for action such as 
</p>
<p>implementing commitments, taking next steps and publishing reports is important. Several 
</p>
<p>speakers noted that managing expectations is necessary. For example, it helps if actors are 
</p>
<p>realistic and clear about what is possible by when, ideally with a short, medium and long-
</p>
<p>term division of action. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Good relationships should enable, not replace, further relationship building, especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>at the local level 
</b></p>
<p>61. Many speakers emphasized that, while international civil society organizations have 
</p>
<p>particular strengths from which companies can benefit, relationships between corporations 
</p>
<p>and international NGOs should not replace engagement with local stakeholders and rights-
</p>
<p>holders. Moreover, as one speaker noted, relationships with local actors can often be more 
</p>
<p>conflict-ridden or politically complex. A key positive feature of all the examples shared 
</p>
<p>was that the relationship between companies and civil society actively encouraged and 
</p>
<p>supported engagement with other actors. That includes local actors such as local trade 
</p>
<p>unions and affected populations, but it also includes other international NGOs, academic 
</p>
<p>experts, competitors and even consumers and the public, as is the case in the Behind the 
</p>
<p>Brands campaign. At all levels, open and honest communication is a key ingredient for 
</p>
<p>successful engagement between companies and NGOs. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Without government engagement, partnerships between companies and NGOs to 
</b></p>
<p><b>support the corporate responsibility to respect will be limited in their ability to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address the human rights impacts associated with business  
</b></p>
<p>62. Ultimately, partnerships between diverse private actors, both business and civil 
</p>
<p>society, are always at some level trying to fill a governance gap due to a failure of the State 
</p>
<p>to meet its duty to protect, owing to lack of political will or capacity. That suggests that 
</p>
<p>more of those relationships need to include Governments around the negotiating table in 
</p>
<p>order to sustain, widen and foster progress.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>While all stakeholders recognize that there is still more work to be done, given 
</b></p>
<p><b>that a large part of the business community worldwide remains unaware of its human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights responsibilities, discussions at the Forum highlighted that there is much 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment and innovative learning on which to build.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Forum discussions also highlighted that the Guiding Principles are 
</b></p>
<p><b>influencing practices and decision-making in some companies and are also informing 
</b></p>
<p><b>the development of new tools and approaches relating to the corporate responsibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>to respect. The Working Group welcomes the development of such tools, both in-
</b></p>
<p><b>house and through collaborative efforts, such as through industry associations, and </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>remains committed to working with business actors and other stakeholders to support 
</b></p>
<p><b>such efforts. The Working Group is also committed to facilitating multi-stakeholder 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue on questions that need further clarification and to ensuring that all efforts 
</b></p>
<p><b>are consistent with the Guiding Principles. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Working Group recognizes the importance of addressing the gap that has 
</b></p>
<p><b>been identified in communication about what companies are doing to implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles. All stakeholders have a role to play to overcome the reluctance by 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies to share information on the steps being taken to avoid and address human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights abuses in their operations. The annual Forum should serve as a space for 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies and business associations to share practice and experience and to engage in 
</b></p>
<p><b>a constructive dialogue with other stakeholder groups.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Working Group welcomes the innovative and constructive contributions of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the companies and NGOs that shared their experiences of joint engagement to address 
</b></p>
<p>specific human rights concerns in the context of the companies&#8217; operations. One 
</p>
<p><b>challenge in the future will be to explore how such approaches can spread to other 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies, and not just to the few most visible global brands. The Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>considers that the kinds of engagement that were featured at the Forum, focused as 
</b></p>
<p><b>they were on finding solutions and improving situations in local contexts, should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>emulated to a much greater extent. Often such constructive engagement may arise 
</b></p>
<p><b>from investigative efforts by civil society organizations to shed light on human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerns and negative impacts, but where companies are willing to engage with NGOs 
</b></p>
<p><b>on such findings, it is clear that all parties stand to gain. When there is genuine 
</b></p>
<p><b>engagement from both sides, significant progress can be made in preventing and 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing human rights impacts of business activities. At the same time, where 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies are not willing to engage with civil society and affected stakeholders in 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing concerns, the </b>traditional approaches of &#8220;naming and shaming&#8221; and 
</p>
<p><b>litigation may be seen as the only available avenues. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>In order to encourage further learning and the spread of innovative 
</b></p>
<p><b>engagement between NGOs and business on business and human rights, the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group would like to encourage NGOs and companies to share more examples of joint 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts undertaken in specific cases at future sessions of the Forum. The Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group calls in particular on Governments to join the discussions and encourages both 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant host and home States to participate in panel discussions similar to the one on 
</b></p>
<p><b>engagement between NGOs and companies held at the third annual Forum. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Moreover, the Working Group encourages the sharing of such examples and dialogue 
</b></p>
<p><b>on lessons learned in other relevant contexts, such as at regional forums and meetings 
</b></p>
<p><b>convened by stakeholders themselves. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Highlighting existing practices of both company efforts to meet the business 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility to respect, and of joint stakeholder engagement to deal with concrete 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases, should be supported by all stakeholders in order to encourage further action 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the small but important steps towards workable solutions that ultimately benefit 
</b></p>
