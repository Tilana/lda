<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the first submitted to the Council by the newly appointed 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur, Dainius P&#363;ras, and is the twenty-fourth thematic report submitted by 
</p>
<p>the mandate holder on the enjoyment of the right to health since the establishment of the 
</p>
<p>mandate in 2003. The report is submitted pursuant to Council resolution 24/6.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur provides a brief account of his activities since his 
</p>
<p>appointment, including communications, country visits and cooperation with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system and other key stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur provides an overview of the work of the mandate since 
</p>
<p>2003, focusing on the right to health framework, and the development of the contours and 
</p>
<p>content of the right to health. He then reflects on how he sees the way forward, based on the 
</p>
<p>current context, challenges and opportunities for the full realization of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>He lays out the main themes as priorities for the coming years. In the final chapter, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur provides his conclusions and observations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities during the reporting period 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Communications transmitted to States 
</b></p>
<p>4. During the reporting period, between 1 March 2014 and 28 February 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteurs sent 72 communications to 39 States. At the time of writing, 36 
</p>
<p>responses had been received, indicating a 52 per cent response rate.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur visited Malaysia from 19 
</p>
<p>November to 2 December 2014. He would like to thank the Government for extending this 
</p>
<p>invitation and facilitating the visit. A separate report on this visit has been submitted as 
</p>
<p>addenda 1 to the present report (A/HRC/29/33/Add.1). Comments by the Government 
</p>
<p>thereon have been submitted (A/HRC/29/33/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Algeria for having 
</p>
<p>extended an invitation to conduct a country visit, and hopes this visit will take place in the 
</p>
<p>coming months. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with the United Nations system and intergovernmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur participated in sessions, meetings and events linked to the 
</p>
<p>discharge of his mandate, including the induction course for new mandate holders (3&#8211;
</p>
<p>5 September 2014); the 21st Annual Meeting of Special Procedures of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council (29 September&#8211;3 October 2014); and the sixty-ninth session of the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly (27&#8211;30 October 2014). 
</p>
<p>8. In addition, on 18 September 2014, the Special Rapporteur participated as panellist 
</p>
<p>in the high-level launch of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-
</p>
<p>based approach to reduce and eliminate preventable mortality and morbidity of children 
</p>
<p>under 5 years of age, which took place in Geneva. </p>


<p>9. From 9 to 11 December 2014, the Special Rapporteur was invited to attend the 
</p>
<p>Programme Coordinating Board meeting of the Joint United Nations Programme on 
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS, which took place in Geneva. In the context of that meeting, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur participated in various meetings and events, including on harm reduction issues. 
</p>
<p>10. On 16 and 17 October 2014, the Special Rapporteur was invited to participate in the 
</p>
<p>symposium on the rights of persons with psychosocial disabilities, which was organized by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR Regional Office for Europe in Brussels. 
</p>
<p>11. From 18 to 20 February, the Special Rapporteur participated as panellist at the 2015 
</p>
<p>Social Forum, which took place in Geneva and focused on access to medicines in the 
</p>
<p>context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
</p>
<p>physical and mental health, including best practices in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Cooperation with non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>12. On 3 October 2014, the Special Rapporteur participated in an event on &#8220;Autism and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights throughout the Life Course&#8221;, organized by the NGO Forum for Health and 
</p>
<p>which took place in Geneva. 
</p>
<p><b>III. Overview of the work of the mandate (2003</b>&#8211;<b>2014) 
</b></p>
<p>13. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to of everyone to the enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health was originally established 
</p>
<p>by the Commission on Human Rights in April 2002 in resolution 2002/31, and renewed in 
</p>
<p>2005 in resolution 2005/24. Subsequent to the replacement of the Commission with the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council in June 2006, the mandate was endorsed and extended by the 
</p>
<p>Council through resolutions 6/29, 15/22 and 24/6. 
</p>
<p>14. The new Special Rapporteur was appointed in August 2014 and feels privileged to 
</p>
<p>have been given the opportunity to assess the realization of the right to health in the coming 
</p>
<p>years. He will make use of his voice and of all tools available to discharge his mandate and 
</p>
<p>contribute to the full enjoyment of the right to health by all. In his first report to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur focuses on the work of the mandate, including 
</p>
<p>challenges and opportunities, and on how he sees the way forward in the discharge of his 
</p>
<p>functions. 
</p>
<p>15. During the first years of the existence of the mandate, the first Special Rapporteur, 
</p>
<p>in collaboration with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the World 
</p>
<p>Health Organization (WHO), civil society and the academic sector, developed a framework 
</p>
<p>for analysing the right to health with a view to making it easier to understand and apply to 
</p>
<p>health-related policies, programmes and projects in practice. 
</p>
<p>16. The analytical framework that was developed consists of several key elements and 
</p>
<p>has a general and inclusive application to all aspects of the right to health, including the 
</p>
<p>underlying and social determinants of health and timely and appropriate medical care. The 
</p>
<p>framework is intended to address the crucial question of what human rights in general, and 
</p>
<p>what the right to health in particular, bring to policymaking process (see E/CN.4/2003/58, 
</p>
<p>para. 9). That question remains valid today and will continue guiding the work of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>17. The first mandate holder identified three primary objectives for the mandate: to 
</p>
<p>promote &#8212; and encourage others to promote &#8212; the right to health as a fundamental human 
</p>
<p>right; to clarify the contours and content of the right to health; and to identify good 
</p>
<p>practices for the operationalization of the right to health at the community, national and </p>


<p>international levels (see E/CN.4/2003/58, para. 9). The then Special Rapporteur explored 
</p>
<p>those three objectives by way of two interrelated themes: the right to health in relation to 
</p>
<p>poverty, focusing on health-related Millennium Development Goals; and the right to health 
</p>
<p>and the determinants of discrimination and stigma. 
</p>
<p>18. Throughout his tenure, the former Special Rapporteur Paul Hunt distinguished 
</p>
<p>between judicially oriented and policy-oriented processes. Although the two approaches are 
</p>
<p>closely related and mutually reinforcing, the former aims to promote and protect the right to 
</p>
<p>health via the drawing up of rules and principles derived from case law, building up general 
</p>
<p>guidance from the lessons learned via the resolution of particular disputes. Judicial and 
</p>
<p>quasi-judicial forms of accountability exemplify this approach. The former Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>emphasized that the policy approach is not a soft option, on the contrary, it places a legal 
</p>
<p>obligation on policymakers to ensure that a health system includes comprehensive health 
</p>
<p>plans encompassing the public and private sectors, outreach programmes for the 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged and numerous other features demanded by the right to health. The policy 
</p>
<p>approach is not without accountability: it requires that policymakers are subject to judicial 
</p>
<p>and non-judicial forms of review. 
</p>
<p>19. The work of the mandate has addressed the challenges and opportunities related to 
</p>
<p>progressive realization of the right to health and those obligations that have immediate 
</p>
<p>effect. With regard to resource constraints and progressive realization, international human 
</p>
<p>rights law recognizes that the realization of the right to health is subject to progressive 
</p>
<p>realization based on resource availability. That is why a higher standard is required of a 
</p>
<p>developed State today than is required of a developing State. However, all States are 
</p>
<p>obliged to realize progressively the right to the highest attainable standard of health. In 
</p>
<p>order to measure progress, indicators and benchmarks need to be identified, and the work of 
</p>
<p>the first mandate holder in that regard continues to be very useful (see A/58/427 and 
</p>
<p>E/CN.4/2006/58). 
</p>
<p>20. Previous mandate holders have given details of the challenges and opportunities that 
</p>
<p>arise from the right to available, accessible, acceptable and good-quality health-care 
</p>
<p>services. In that regard, health-care systems are at the heart of the right to health and act as 
</p>
<p>a fundamental building block of sustainable development, poverty reduction and economic 
</p>
<p>prosperity (A/HRC/7/11, para. 12). The principles embodied in the Alma-Ata Declaration 
</p>
<p>on Primary Health Care (1978) and the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (1986) remain 
</p>
<p>relevant today. 
</p>
<p>21. The work of the mandate has also addressed the challenges for States in realizing 
</p>
<p>their obligations to ensure that adequate funds are available for health in national budgets, 
</p>
<p>to safeguard an equitable allocation of health resources and to enhance international 
</p>
<p>cooperation to promote sustainable international funding for health (see A/67/302).  
</p>
<p>22. The work of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessors has highlighted that one of most 
</p>
<p>important obligations of immediate effect related to right to health is the duty to avoid 
</p>
<p>discrimination.1 This means that, even in the presence of resource constraints, that 
</p>
<p>obligation should not be subject to progressive realization. Discrimination and stigma are 
</p>
<p>considered as social determinants in the enjoyment of the right to health, as social 
</p>
<p>inequalities and exclusion shape health outcomes and contribute to increasing the burden of 
</p>
<p>disease borne by marginalized groups. In addition, some health conditions, such as mental 
</p>
<p>health or HIV/AIDS, may involve exposure to compounded forms of discrimination and 
</p>
<p>reinforce existing inequalities (E/CN.4/2003/58, para. 59). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See Committee on Economic Social and Cultural  Rights, general comment No. 14 (2000) on the right 
</p>
<p>to the highest attainable standard of health, para. 43. </p>


<p>23. The work of previous mandate holders has underlined the need to respect, protect 
</p>
<p>and fulfil the enjoyment of right to health and other related rights of those groups who 
</p>
<p>appear to be in vulnerable situations and face discrimination in general, including in 
</p>
<p>accessing health-care services. 
</p>
<p>24. Previous work on the issue of sexual and reproductive health and rights, including 
</p>
<p>on maternal mortality, has shown that human rights when applied to public health policies 
</p>
<p>can save lives by ensuring that health policies are equitable, inclusive, non-discriminatory, 
</p>
<p>participatory and evidence-based (A/61/338, para. 29). Most of pregnancy-related deaths 
</p>
<p>and many of the causes of under-5 mortality are avoidable. Those most at risk are groups 
</p>
<p>living in poverty, groups in rural areas and women from ethnic and religious minorities or 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities. Women and children must be placed at the centre of an integrated 
</p>
<p>approach to sexual and reproductive health and their rights must be fully recognized. 
</p>
<p>25. Moreover, the work of the mandate has focused on the serious detrimental impact 
</p>
<p>that the criminalization of identities, behaviours and health status can have on the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the right to health. Criminalization and restrictive laws are ineffective as 
</p>
<p>public health interventions and fuel underreporting of health indicators. For instance, the 
</p>
<p>work done has shown that legal restrictions on access to abortion services, comprehensive 
</p>
<p>sexual and reproductive education and information, and contraception and family planning 
</p>
<p>methods can have a serious detrimental impact on the enjoyment of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>Evidence shows that this includes a negative impact not only on access to goods, services 
</p>
<p>and information, but also on the enjoyment of fundamental freedoms and entitlements, and 
</p>
<p>on the dignity and autonomy of individuals, in particular women (see A/66/254).  
</p>
<p>26. Previous mandate holders have also looked into the negative impact of the 
</p>
<p>criminalization of consensual same-sex conduct, of sexual orientation and gender identity, 
</p>
<p>of sex work and of HIV transmission (see A/HRC/14/20). Such work has shown that 
</p>
<p>punitive policies and criminalization are not effective and act as a barrier to access health 
</p>
<p>services, fuel social stigma and exclusion and lead to poor health outcomes. 
</p>
<p>27. On the issue of drug policy, the work of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessors has 
</p>
<p>shown that the current international system&#8217;s punitive regime, which focuses on creating a 
</p>
<p>drug-free world, has failed mostly owing to ignorance of the realities surrounding drug use 
</p>
<p>and dependence (see A/65/255). There is a need for a shift in the current drug control 
</p>
<p>regime away from substance-oriented policies and an increased focus on human rights. 
</p>
<p>Evidence has shown that the criminalization of certain behaviours leads to a reluctance to 
</p>
<p>seek help, including health-related services, and this should be a concern to the authorities. 
</p>
<p>Pursuing overly punitive approaches has resulted in more health-related harms than those 
</p>
<p>the authorities seek to prevent. 
</p>
<p>28. The important issue of access to medicines has also been part of the work of the 
</p>
<p>mandate. Medical care in the event of sickness and the prevention, treatment and control of 
</p>
<p>diseases depend to a great extent on timely access to quality medicines. Despite progress 
</p>
<p>made, an estimated 2 billion people still lack access to essential medicines. There remains 
</p>
<p>an intrinsic link between poverty and the realization of the right to health, where developing 
</p>
<p>nations have the greatest need and the least access to medicines. Previous mandate holders, 
</p>
<p>including Anand Grover, have given details of the different dimensions of the issues, such 
</p>
<p>as: the role and responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies; the impact of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property laws and free-trade agreements; and the implications and elements of a right-to-
</p>
<p>health approach to access to medicines (see A/63/263, A/HRC/17/43 and A/HRC/23/42).  
</p>
<p>29. During the past 12 years, the work of the mandate has also paid special attention to 
</p>
<p>two other key elements of the analytical right-to-health framework: monitoring and 
</p>
<p>accountability. Without monitoring and accountability, all human rights norms and 
</p>
<p>obligations are likely to become empty promises. Accountability in respect of the right to </p>


<p>health and a health system is often quite weak (see A/63/263). Judicial accountability has 
</p>
<p>been highlighted by the work of the mandate (see A/69/299) but other forms of 
</p>
<p>accountability, such as health impact assessments, have also been addressed, including 
</p>
<p>during country visits (Romania, Sweden and Uganda). 
</p>
<p>30. Other thematic reports have explored the enjoyment of the right to health and the 
</p>
<p>underlying determinants, including water and sanitation, occupational health, the right to 
</p>
<p>health in conflict, unhealthy foods, and the right to health of migrants, older persons and 
</p>
<p>persons with psychosocial disabilities (including the key issue of informed consent). 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur concurs with his predecessors that a comprehensive right-to-
</p>
<p>health approach is necessary, which includes decriminalization of sexual orientation and 
</p>
<p>gender identities, certain behaviours and health status, as well as the establishment of 
</p>
<p>conducive legal and administrative frameworks with emphasis on human rights education, 
</p>
<p>meaningful participation and empowerment of the groups targeted, and serious efforts to 
</p>
<p>reduce stigma and discrimination in society as a whole.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The way forward: context, challenges and opportunities 
</b></p>
<p>32. In the words of Jonathan Mann &#8220;the human rights framework provides a more useful 
</p>
<p>approach for analysing and responding to modern public health challenges than any 
</p>
<p>framework thus far available with the biomedical tradition&#8221;.2 The Special Rapporteur will 
</p>
<p>address the most important issues related to the discharge of his mandate with that in mind.  
</p>
<p>33. The right of everyone to physical and mental health can only be realized through 
</p>
<p>concerted and sustained efforts, and shared responsibility by all stakeholders at national, 
</p>
<p>regional and universal levels. It requires an unequivocal commitment to the realization of 
</p>
<p>universal human rights principles as enshrined in the Universal Declaration on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and human rights law and standards.  
</p>
<p>34. Building on the work of his predecessors, the Special Rapporteur will advocate for 
</p>
<p>the application of the right to health framework to strengthen health systems, emphasizing 
</p>
<p>the need to place the well-being of individuals and communities at the centre of health 
</p>
<p>policies. He will look at processes within health systems &#8212; at how things are done and the 
</p>
<p>actors involved &#8212; with particular attention devoted to access to information, participation 
</p>
<p>and accountability mechanisms in place (see A/HRC/7/11, paras. 38&#8211;64).  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur will continue applying a gender perspective in his work, 
</p>
<p>with a special focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights as an integral part of the 
</p>
<p>right to health. He will apply a life-cycle approach to his work, paying special attention to 
</p>
<p>the needs of the children and adolescents in the realization of the right to health, and the 
</p>
<p>needs of other groups in vulnerable situations, including persons with disabilities. He will 
</p>
<p>continue paying attention to the issue of access to medicines, including access to essential 
</p>
<p>and controlled medicines, and its human rights dimensions. 
</p>
<p>36. In the current context of the shaping of the Sustainable Development Goals, the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to health is extremely relevant, both as precondition for, and as an 
</p>
<p>outcome of, a successful process of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and their 
</p>
<p>main elements.

</i></p>
<p><i>Medical Journal</i>, No. 312 (1996), pp. 924&#8211;925. </p>


<p><b> A. The policy approach to the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>37. There are different and equally relevant ways to apply a human rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach for improving the health of individuals and populations, and to promote the right 
</p>
<p>to health in everyday practices. One such approach is looking at normative frameworks, 
</p>
<p>including at the role of legislation and litigation through courts, which inter alia underlines 
</p>
<p>the importance of the justiciability of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>38. The approach that the Special Rapporteur will prioritize is what he calls the &#8220;policy 
</p>
<p>approach&#8221;, which focuses on health and health-related policies, including the analysis of 
</p>
<p>processes and outcomes of policies as they are formulated and implemented. It will 
</p>
<p>consider whether or not these policies are based on human rights principles and modern 
</p>
<p>public health approaches, including solid scientific evidence. 
</p>
<p>39. Departure from universal human rights principles and standards, as enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration, and from evidence provided by the modern public health approach is 
</p>
<p>a major obstacle for effective realization of the right to health. The Special Rapporteur will 
</p>
<p>use the right to health framework to identify good practices in the operationalization of 
</p>
<p>modern principles of health promotion. He will underline the possible synergies between 
</p>
<p>the human rights and the modern public health approaches for the realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>health worldwide. 
</p>
<p>40. One the objectives of the Special Rapporteur will be to examine the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;implementation gap&#8221;. The human rights-based approach can be very effective in 
</p>
<p>implementing health policies and practices. However, while the fundamental principles and 
</p>
<p>the main processes and mechanisms of the right to health are well identified, there still 
</p>
<p>remains a significant gap between the formulation of health policies and their effective 
</p>
<p>implementation in everyday practice. While the formulation of health policies may be 
</p>
<p>satisfactory from the perspective of the right to health, their effective implementation 
</p>
<p>remains a significant challenge. 
</p>
<p>41. All too often, the failure to put basic principles into practice is not linked to financial 
</p>
<p>obstacles, but is mostly owing to prevailing attitudes among stakeholders that are not in line 
</p>
<p>with human rights and public health principles. The Special Rapporteur will focus on the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;implementation gap&#8221; but he will continue to underline, interpret and link the fundamental 
</p>
<p>universal human rights principles and standards with the everyday practice of effective 
</p>
<p>investment in individual and societal health. 
</p>
<p>42. Despite the work of many who have convincingly highlighted the need and benefits 
</p>
<p>to adhere to universal human rights principles, there continues to be a tendency to apply 
</p>
<p>and justify a narrow and selective approach to human rights, including to the right to health. 
</p>
<p>That tendency has been accentuated during the last decade and questions the very essence 
</p>
<p>of universal human rights principles and standards. 
</p>
<p>43. For example, such a retrogressive tendency has been observed in the area of sexual 
</p>
<p>and reproductive health and rights, and with regard to discrimination against groups in 
</p>
<p>vulnerable situations, including children, documented and undocumented migrants, persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. In his reports and 
</p>
<p>through his other activities, the Special Rapporteur will highlight the need and importance 
</p>
<p>of applying the principle of the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights, and will 
</p>
<p>underline how essential this is for the full realization of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this tendency to take a selective approach 
</p>
<p>to human rights has its most detrimental effects on those groups of population which face 
</p>
<p>de jure or de facto discrimination. These groups suffer from social exclusion, stigmatization 
</p>
<p>and humiliation, which has a negative impact to their health status. They are often deprived 
</p>
<p>of access to health support and the care services they need, and of meaningful participation </p>


<p>in processes that affect them. These are the groups in most need of quality and human 
</p>
<p>rights-friendly health-care services precisely because of their situation. 
</p>
<p>45. This departure from universal human rights principles and this selective approach, 
</p>
<p>ignoring or not adequately addressing one or more rights of a group of the population, 
</p>
<p>reinforces cycles of poverty, inequalities, social exclusion, discrimination and violence, and 
</p>
<p>in the longer run has a negative impact on the health and development of society in general.  
</p>
<p>46. There are good health practices worldwide that emerge when culturally and socially 
</p>
<p>appropriate programmes are used, involving and empowering individuals, families and 
</p>
<p>communities. These practices challenge traditional barriers between health, education, 
</p>
<p>social welfare and other sectors. For example, effective programmes can be developed to 
</p>
<p>enable community support for preventing violence, particularly violence against women 
</p>
<p>and domestic violence. Community-based initiatives and neighbourhood prevention 
</p>
<p>activities can also be designed to provide education for first-time parents, focusing on 
</p>
<p>child-parent relationships. Support to family planning activities can be put in place to 
</p>
<p>prevent early or unwanted pregnancies through the provision of comprehensive sexuality 
</p>
<p>education and information, and by providing access to a varied range of contraception 
</p>
<p>methods. 
</p>
<p>47. The cooperation between sectors can also be beneficial to facilitate access to 
</p>
<p>preschool education, especially for children of families at risk, and enable community 
</p>
<p>readiness to accept and integrate children and adults with disabilities into all of the 
</p>
<p>everyday life of the community. This approach can also offer opportunities for adolescents 
</p>
<p>and youth at risk to find alternatives to youth violence by engaging them in community 
</p>
<p>programmes that support recreation centres for older persons, thus contributing to the 
</p>
<p>reinforcement of intergenerational links and improving the quality of human relationships 
</p>
<p>in general. 
</p>
<p>48. The &#8220;policy approach&#8221;, if implemented effectively, creates valuable opportunities 
</p>
<p>for social innovations through the empowerment of citizens, families, communities and 
</p>
<p>societies at large. By using modern concepts of health promotion and public health, this 
</p>
<p>approach can also facilitate the meaningful participation of all stakeholders and reinforce 
</p>
<p>the protective factors and resilience of individuals and communities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to health policies: power asymmetries, unbalanced approaches 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other challenges  
</b></p>
<p>49. The implementation of evidence-based medicine and public health science is often 
</p>
<p>hindered by the departure from such evidence, resulting in unbalanced and selective 
</p>
<p>policies and practices that hamper the full realization of human rights, including the right to 
</p>
<p>health. One way to analyse the challenges to and opportunities for the effective realization 
</p>
<p>of right to health is to focus on the need to balance the important elements of the right and 
</p>
<p>to prevent tendencies and incentives which lead to power asymmetries and unfair policies 
</p>
<p>and practices. 
</p>
<p>50. The imbalances in health-related policies and practices are often a result of power 
</p>
<p>struggles and an outcome and sign of a lack of transparency, accountability and political 
</p>
<p>will to follow established principles and standards. Such imbalances emerge often as a 
</p>
<p>consequence of a departure from a holistic approach to human rights. This is reinforced by 
</p>
<p>power asymmetries between stakeholders and interest groups within and outside of health 
</p>
<p>sector. These selective policies and practices tend to lead to ineffective health policies and 
</p>
<p>ineffective, even harmful, health-care practices and to violations of human rights. </p>


<p>51. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about instances of unbalanced policies and 
</p>
<p>practices which seriously undermine the full enjoyment of the right to health. Those 
</p>
<p>imbalances can lead to an artificial hierarchy and a selective approach to human rights 
</p>
<p>prioritizing one group of rights over another, or can set different human rights standards for 
</p>
<p>different groups of the population. Some imbalances and power asymmetries are present 
</p>
<p>within the different elements of health systems; for example, primary care often fails to 
</p>
<p>compete for budget allocations with specialized medicine. These imbalances have also 
</p>
<p>historically led to disparities in investing in physical and mental health. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. No hierarchy within human rights 
</b></p>
<p>52. Lessons should be learned from past and present experiences, which demonstrate 
</p>
<p>that any hierarchy among human rights, a prioritizing of one right or one group of rights 
</p>
<p>over another, leads to detrimental outcomes and systemic violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>Selective approaches deprive certain groups of basic rights and undermine the meaningful 
</p>
<p>participation and empowerment of all stakeholders. Such participation and empowerment 
</p>
<p>are crucial preconditions for positive public policy outcomes, which are based on the 
</p>
<p>particular attention given to those in vulnerable situations.  
</p>
<p>53. Many examples have been presented by the health and human rights movement of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights being neglected since they were perceived as not 
</p>
<p>requiring immediate action based on erroneous interpretations of the fact that they were 
</p>
<p>subject to progressive realization. That tendency to undermine importance of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights has led, and continues to lead, to a detrimental combination of 
</p>
<p>poverty, inequalities and disempowerment of large groups of population, who will 
</p>
<p>consequently suffer from poor health status and barriers to accessing health-care services. 
</p>
<p>54. The right to health approach, as a part of human rights-based approach, has emerged 
</p>
<p>during recent decades as a powerful tool to reinforce the global goal of improving the 
</p>
<p>health and well-being of populations. However, it can also be used to monitor and prevent 
</p>
<p>those underlying health conditions and tendencies within health-care systems which may 
</p>
<p>lead to violations of human rights and to a negative impact on the health of individuals and 
</p>
<p>societies. 
</p>
<p>55. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur will continue highlighting the need to reduce 
</p>
<p>poverty and inequalities, including those within and between regions and countries. He will 
</p>
<p>do so by analysing the root causes of the gap between opportunities and reality, between 
</p>
<p>evidence, policies and practices and between obligations of duty bearers and effective 
</p>
<p>implementation. 
</p>
<p>56. A recent example of the detrimental effect of inequalities has been the Ebola 
</p>
<p>epidemic in countries of Western Africa with weak health-care systems which were not 
</p>
<p>able to adequately respond. One of the lessons learned from that and other epidemics is the 
</p>
<p>importance of social medicine which, since the nineteenth century has highlighted that 
</p>
<p>many diseases and epidemics are social diseases in their origin; therefore, primary 
</p>
<p>prevention should properly address the social determinants of health and the context in 
</p>
<p>which epidemics emerge. 
</p>
<p>57. The Ebola crisis has provided meaningful lessons with regard to many elements of 
</p>
<p>the right to health. It has questioned our preparedness for emergencies at national, regional 
</p>
<p>and global levels. It has raised important issues, such as access to information, trust in 
</p>
<p>public authorities and safety of medical personnel, and it has reminded us of the importance 
</p>
<p>of upholding the human rights of the affected populations in the context of public safety 
</p>
<p>concerns. The Ebola crisis has once again raised issue of the responsibility and social 
</p>
<p>accountability of key actors, including pharmaceutical companies, and the need for strong 
</p>
<p>public leadership in addressing global health challenges. </p>


<p>58. Another example of an unbalanced approach to human rights is when the full 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to health is hindered by undue restrictions in the enjoyment of civil 
</p>
<p>and political rights. That approach can lead to a failure in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>principles of participation and empowerment and it undermines the crucial role that civil 
</p>
<p>society can play in promoting societal health and well-being. 
</p>
<p>59. There is no hierarchy among human rights, and any attempt to restrict or undermine, 
</p>
<p>intentionally or unintentionally, any of the basic human rights can have a harmful impact on 
</p>
<p>individual and societal health and well-being. That is why the best way of &#8220;vaccinating&#8221; 
</p>
<p>health-care systems and policy decisions against a departure from agreed principles and 
</p>
<p>standards is to systematically apply a human rights approach in full accordance with 
</p>
<p>universal principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and human 
</p>
<p>rights conventions and treaties. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Balancing the key elements in the health-care system 
</b></p>
<p>60. All key elements of health-care systems must be balanced. That includes the 
</p>
<p>relationships between the curative and preventive aspects of health care, so that power 
</p>
<p>asymmetries do not weaken primary care and preventive medicine. The modern public-
</p>
<p>health approach should be strengthened and a right balance between all elements of the 
</p>
<p>health-care system should be ensured so that the implementation of health policies is not 
</p>
<p>dominated by vertical &#8220;disease-based&#8221; programmes and specialized health-care services. 
</p>
<p>61. In addition, the role of the health sector and that of other sectors in improving the 
</p>
<p>health of individuals and populations must also be balanced. A modern understanding of 
</p>
<p>the effective realization of right to health requires a &#8220;health in all policies&#8221; approach. To 
</p>
<p>fully achieve goals, such as to reduce infant or under-5 mortality, improve mental health, 
</p>
<p>reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases or promote the health of older persons, all 
</p>
<p>sectors and all branches responsible for public policies need to be involved. 
</p>
<p>62. This does not mean that role of health sector should be restricted to specialized 
</p>
<p>health care. On the contrary, the scenario of ministries of health preoccupied mainly with 
</p>
<p>meeting the need of specialized health-care services is an outdated one. The role of the 
</p>
<p>health sector is becoming increasingly important in areas such as health promotion, 
</p>
<p>prevention of health problems and protection of human rights, especially within health-care 
</p>
<p>services, with particular attention given to the situation of marginalized groups. In the 
</p>
<p>promotion of a &#8220;health in all policies&#8221; approach, the health sector should take the lead and 
</p>
<p>share responsibility for societal health with other sectors. 
</p>
<p>63. With all this in mind, the Special Rapporteur is considering the analysis of the 
</p>
<p>following themes as some of his priorities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Themes as priorities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Global health in the post-2015 agenda 
</b></p>
<p>64. The transition from Millennium Development Goals to Sustainable Development 
</p>
<p>Goals is a unique opportunity to rethink achievements and assess the remaining challenges 
</p>
<p>affecting the right to health and well-being of individuals and societies. In the decade 
</p>
<p>between 2000 and 2010, an estimated 3.3 million deaths from malaria were averted and 22 
</p>
<p>million lives were saved in the fight against tuberculosis. Access to retroviral therapy for </p>


<p>HIV-infected people has saved 6.6 million lives since 1995. At the same time, access to 
</p>
<p>child and maternal health care has improved steadily.3 
</p>
<p>65. Since the end of nineteenth century, science and the practice of medicine and public 
</p>
<p>health have created enormous opportunities for preventing premature mortality and 
</p>
<p>improving the health and well-being of individuals and societies. Many scientific 
</p>
<p>discoveries have been successfully put into practice, resulting in an overall increase of life 
</p>
<p>expectancy, a reduction in maternal and child mortality, a successful combat against many 
</p>
<p>infectious diseases and a general improvement of the quality of life of the world&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>population. 
</p>
<p>66. However, current rates of preventable deaths among newborns, children under 5 and 
</p>
<p>adults are still unacceptably high. Universal health-care coverage is still a dream for many. 
</p>
<p>The realization of the right to health is impeded by many factors, and most of them are 
</p>
<p>related to inequalities, and selective approaches to human rights principles and existing 
</p>
<p>scientific evidence. This can and must be addressed with the strong commitment by States 
</p>
<p>and concerted efforts by all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>67. In the context of the post-2015 agenda, the right to health framework can be a useful 
</p>
<p>and powerful analytical and operational tool for the transition to the Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals. And the Sustainable Development Goals can be instrumental for the 
</p>
<p>effective and holistic realization of the right to health, if human rights are effectively 
</p>
<p>incorporated in their conceptualization. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The right to health and public policy  
</b></p>
<p>68. Primary care is to be strengthened in the twenty-first century as the crucial 
</p>
<p>cornerstone of modern medicine and public health. The Alma-Ata Declaration and Ottawa 
</p>
<p>Charter for Health Promotion should be reaffirmed and the root causes of the relative 
</p>
<p>failure to achieve commitments to &#8220;health for all by 2000&#8221; should be sought. 
</p>
<p>69. Without a well-established infrastructure of primary health care, all achievements of 
</p>
<p>modern science and the practice of medicine might be compromised and could be misused. 
</p>
<p>When health policy chooses to prioritize specialized services, the latter tend to function 
</p>
<p>without the necessary ethical and human rights safeguards, leading to barriers in access to 
</p>
<p>services for people and groups who have more health needs or to the ineffective use of 
</p>
<p>those services, or to both. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that primary care and the modern public health 
</p>
<p>approach often lose the battle for resources to the biomedical model and vertical 
</p>
<p>programmes of treatment of diseases through specialized health care. When resources are 
</p>
<p>allocated to specialized health care, that may reinforce power asymmetries and funding 
</p>
<p>imbalances, which often favour powerful groups representing vested interests in the health 
</p>
<p>sector and industry. States, when meeting their obligation to protect, respect and fulfil the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the right to health, should be aware of, and be willing and able to address, 
</p>
<p>such power asymmetries. They should also provide mechanisms for independent 
</p>
<p>monitoring, as such mechanisms are essential tools in ensuring accountability. 
</p>
<p>71. If that does not happen, power asymmetries and imbalances may lead to scenarios 
</p>
<p>where (a) preference in allocating budgets is given to expensive biomedical technologies 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 <i>Millennium Development Report 2014</i>, quoted in &#8220;The road to dignity by 2030: ending poverty, 
</p>
<p>transforming all lives and protecting the planet&#8221;, synthesis report of the Secretary-General on the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 sustainable development agenda (A/69/700), para. 17. </p>


<p>which are not necessarily used in an ethical and cost-effective way; (b) there are increased 
</p>
<p>incentives for corruptive practices when expensive specialized health-care interventions in 
</p>
<p>public sector do not serve those in most need; (c) the filters (tiers) in health-care systems do 
</p>
<p>not properly function, and mild cases flow into specialized care, placing the entire health-
</p>
<p>care system at risk of poor management of the principles of medical ethics and health 
</p>
<p>economics. That has negative impact on the full realization of right to health and generates 
</p>
<p>negative public health outcomes. 
</p>
<p>72. The sustainable implementation of a modern public health approach is not only in 
</p>
<p>line with human rights, but is also a powerful way to develop and strengthen social justice 
</p>
<p>and social cohesion. In that regard, the importance of universal health coverage cannot be 
</p>
<p>overestimated. Since the International Conference on Primary Health Care, there have been 
</p>
<p>many achievements, but also failures. Universal coverage is a central component of healthy 
</p>
<p>public policies and its global achievement should be seen as one of the main goals for the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 agenda. However, the Special Rapporteur thinks that a broader holistic approach 
</p>
<p>is needed so that none, in particular those in vulnerable situations and in most need of 
</p>
<p>health care, are not excluded neither de jure nor de facto from access to quality services. 
</p>
<p>73. All international and national actors should be mobilized to reaffirm and revitalize 
</p>
<p>the decisions of the historic International Conference on Primary Health Care and 
</p>
<p>International Conference on Health Promotion. The full enjoyment of the right to health can 
</p>
<p>only be operationalized through human rights-friendly and culturally relevant health 
</p>
<p>promotion policies that empower people to increase control over their lives and improve 
</p>
<p>their health and well-being. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Mental health and emotional well-being  
</b></p>
<p>74. The historical divide, both in policies and practices, between mental and physical 
</p>
<p>health has unfortunately resulted in political, professional and geographical isolation, 
</p>
<p>marginalization and stigmatization of mental health care. 
</p>
<p>75. The modern public mental health approach, which emerged in the global scene in 
</p>
<p>the end of twentieth century with a critical mass of new evidence on the importance of 
</p>
<p>mental health and the effectiveness of integrated approaches, still faces enormous 
</p>
<p>challenges. It is regrettable that, in many countries and regions of the world, modern mental 
</p>
<p>health care is still not available. Moreover, in countries which can afford to give resources 
</p>
<p>to mental-health services, those resources are often used to support segregated psychiatric 
</p>
<p>institutions where stigmatizing and human rights-unfriendly services are provided. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur would like to highlight two key messages of the modern 
</p>
<p>public mental-health approach. Firstly, there is no health without mental health. Secondly, 
</p>
<p>good mental health means much more than absence of a mental impairment. 
</p>
<p>77. The modern understanding of mental health includes good emotional and social 
</p>
<p>well-being, healthy non-violent relations between individuals and groups, with mutual trust 
</p>
<p>of, tolerance of and respect for the dignity of every person. In that regard, promoting good 
</p>
<p>mental health should be a cross-cutting priority relevant to the sustainable development 
</p>
<p>agenda, as it is of concern to many of its elements, including the protection of dignity and 
</p>
<p>people in order to ensure healthy lives and strong inclusive economies; promote safe and 
</p>
<p>peaceful societies and strong institutions; and catalyse global solidarity for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development (see A/69/700). 
</p>
<p>78. By investing in the good mental health of children and youth, a substantial 
</p>
<p>contribution is made not only to the sustainable development of our economies, for which 
</p>
<p>good emotional and cognitive abilities are needed, but also the root causes of intolerance 
</p>
<p>and social exclusion are addressed and healthy and cohesive societies promoted. </p>


<p>79. It is estimated that the burden of mental-health problems and mental disabilities 
</p>
<p>constitutes 14 per cent of general burden of disease.4 However, compared with physical 
</p>
<p>health, mental health is given inadequately low priority and insufficient human and 
</p>
<p>financial resources. 
</p>
<p>80. The end of twentieth century brought two main messages to the international 
</p>
<p>community. The first message was about the centrality of mental health in the modern 
</p>
<p>health policies, based on the high burden of mental-health problems and mental disorders. 
</p>
<p>The second message was that, contrary to the previous understanding, effective measures 
</p>
<p>are possible if outdated traditions are abandoned and the modern public health approach is 
</p>
<p>applied. In the twenty-first century there is no place for psychiatric institutions based on 
</p>
<p>stigma and segregation, and there is a need, in words of G.H. Brundtland &#8220;to ensure that 
</p>
<p>ours will be the last generation that allows shame and stigma to rule over science and 
</p>
<p>reason&#8221;.5 
</p>
<p>81. However, after more than a decade since the publication of the landmark <i>World 
</i></p>
<p><i>Health Report 2001</i>, mental health remains hostage to outdated attitudes and inadequate 
</p>
<p>services. Studies show that, in many instances, there is either no access to mental health 
</p>
<p>services at all, or those services are stigmatizing and violate human rights.6 
</p>
<p>82. One of the significant obstacles to the implementation of modern public mental-
</p>
<p>health principles is a lack of political will, including on global health agenda, to recognize 
</p>
<p>the centrality of mental health in the full realization of the right to health and to implement 
</p>
<p>the principle of parity between physical and mental health. The Special Rapporteur is 
</p>
<p>concerned that, despite clear evidence of the increasingly heavy burden of mental ill-health, 
</p>
<p>many important stakeholders continue to marginalize this field of health. 
</p>
<p>83. Mental health deserves much more attention and must be effectively mainstreamed 
</p>
<p>within the Sustainable Development Goals through the goals and benchmarks related to 
</p>
<p>health and sustainable development. The high number of suicides and suicide attempts are 
</p>
<p>an indicator that the mental health of individuals and population needs to be addressed very 
</p>
<p>seriously.7 Concerted and effective measures need to be applied to substantively address 
</p>
<p>this challenge and reduce the numbers of suicides, which have in many countries reached 
</p>
<p>epidemic rates. The Special Rapporteur will further analyse the relevance of human rights 
</p>
<p>in addressing suicide and other mental health issues as a public health challenge. 
</p>
<p>84. In some regions, resources allocated to mental health care are used ineffectively and 
</p>
<p>predominantly for maintaining large segregated psychiatric long-term care institutions and 
</p>
<p>separate psychiatric hospitals. In such institutions, psychotropic medications are too often 
</p>
<p>overprescribed, including as a measure of chemical restraint or even as a punishment. That 
</p>
<p>is an example of an imbalance: when resources are used for biomedical interventions and 
</p>
<p>institutionalization and not for the development of psychosocial interventions through 
</p>
<p>community-based services meeting more closely the individual needs of people. Such 
</p>
<p>imbalances feed ineffective systems, reinforce stigma and social exclusion and lead to 
</p>
<p>systemic violations of human rights, sometimes amounting to torture or ill-treatment.

<p>85. This, once again, reflects power asymmetries between interest groups behind 
</p>
<p>different forms of services and interventions, and a lack of transparency, monitoring and 
</p>
<p>accountability in mental health-care systems. WHO recommendations are very clear about 
</p>
<p>the five obligatory components of community-based care for persons with severe 
</p>
<p>psychosocial disabilities, which comprise access to psychotropic medications, 
</p>
<p>psychotherapy, psychosocial rehabilitation, vocational rehabilitation and employment and 
</p>
<p>supported housing. However, in many countries, a number of those components are not 
</p>
<p>being implemented.8  
</p>
<p><b> D. The life-cycle approach to the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>86. There is overwhelming evidence that many children die too young from preventable 
</p>
<p>causes and/or suffer high levels of violence and insecurity. Consequently, the health status, 
</p>
<p>quality of life and well-being of many individuals, groups and entire societies worldwide 
</p>
<p>remain unacceptably low. The Special Rapporteur believes that the life-cycle approach can 
</p>
<p>be used as one method to identify the critical elements of the challenges and opportunities 
</p>
<p>for the reduction of preventable deaths and the improvement of health indicators, well-
</p>
<p>being and quality of life. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur is planning to address right-to-health challenges using, 
</p>
<p>among other methods, a life-cycle approach. Such an approach helps identify critical 
</p>
<p>elements of challenges and opportunities for full realization of the right to health. It is 
</p>
<p>during some important stages of the life course that the right to health needs to be 
</p>
<p>particularly protected, since during those stages there is a greater risk of violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights, including the right to health. On the other hand, interventions during those 
</p>
<p>critical stages of life open up new opportunities and offer new health protective factors. The 
</p>
<p>life-cycle approach can help in the prevention of chronic diseases in adult life through the 
</p>
<p>effective protection of children from early childhood adversities. 
</p>
<p>88. In line with the life-cycle approach, the Special Rapporteur will dedicate his next 
</p>
<p>thematic report to the challenges to, opportunities for and best practices in promoting the 
</p>
<p>right to health in early childhood. He will analyse two interdependent and indivisible rights 
</p>
<p>directly related to the right to health: the right to survival and the right to development 
</p>
<p>during first five years of life. 
</p>
<p>89. The right to survival relates to the prevention of infant and under-5 mortality. 
</p>
<p>Despite many achievements in the field of medicine, 6 million children under 5 die every 
</p>
<p>year in the world. Those children do not die of unknown or incurable diseases or illnesses; 
</p>
<p>they die because of the conditions in which they and their parents live and poor governance 
</p>
<p>and accountability. 
</p>
<p>90. The launch of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate 
</p>
<p>preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age (A/HRC/27/31) in 
</p>
<p>2014 is a serious attempt to put an end to the unacceptable epidemics of preventable deaths 
</p>
<p>of infants. The human rights-based approach is critically important in that regard since 
</p>
<p>child mortality is intimately linked with human rights of women and the widespread 
</p>
<p>discrimination against vulnerable groups of population. 
</p>
<p>91. The right to holistic development is another equally important element of the right to 
</p>
<p>health of children. Children need to be protected through the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>their economic, social and cultural rights. Furthermore, from the moment of birth, children 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 See WHO, <i>World Health Report 2001</i>. </p>


<p>should also be considered as citizens entitled to all rights, including civil rights and 
</p>
<p>freedoms. Their right to health should be promoted not only through the prevention of child 
</p>
<p>mortality and morbidity but also through the protection of children&#8217;s right to holistic 
</p>
<p>development. 
</p>
<p>92. The life-cycle approach will be also be used in addressing the right of adolescents 
</p>
<p>and youth to health; the role of family and parenting; mental-health issues and ways to 
</p>
<p>prevent violence as a public health problem; and important issues around healthy ageing. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The right to health of persons with disabilities  
</b></p>
<p>93. One of priorities of the Special Rapporteur will be to look into the role of the health 
</p>
<p>sector and health professionals in the implementation of ambitious goals raised by the 
</p>
<p>Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. He hopes to address that role in close 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, and other 
</p>
<p>mandate holders and United Nations mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>94. The human rights standards set forth by the Convention present a good opportunity 
</p>
<p>to rethink the historical legacy of previous models and to move away from those health-
</p>
<p>care practices which are against human rights and the modern public health approach. 
</p>
<p>There is a unique and historic opportunity to end the legacy of the overuse and misuse of 
</p>
<p>the biomedical model. 
</p>
<p>95. All persons with disabilities have a right to health, including to quality health-care 
</p>
<p>services. In that regard, persons with disabilities should not be discriminated against and 
</p>
<p>should enjoy that right in their communities as persons without disabilities do. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is concerned that all too often children and adults with different forms of 
</p>
<p>disabilities are deprived of the full realization to the right to health. He will address that 
</p>
<p>serious issue, with a particular focus on the rights of persons with psychosocial and 
</p>
<p>intellectual disabilities. 
</p>
<p>96. The Convention is challenging traditional practices of psychiatry, both at the 
</p>
<p>scientific and clinical-practice levels. In that regard, there is a serious need to discuss issues 
</p>
<p>related to human rights in psychiatry and to develop mechanisms for the effective 
</p>
<p>protection of the rights of persons with mental disabilities. 
</p>
<p>97. The history of psychiatry demonstrates that the good intentions of service providers 
</p>
<p>can turn into violations of the human rights of service users. The traditional arguments that 
</p>
<p>restrict the human rights of persons diagnosed with psychosocial and intellectual 
</p>
<p>disabilities, which are based on the medical necessity to provide those persons with 
</p>
<p>necessary treatment and/or to protect his/her or public safety, are now seriously being 
</p>
<p>questioned as they are not in conformity with the Convention. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur believes that a serious multi-stakeholder dialogue about the 
</p>
<p>future models and practices of psychiatry is needed to address the situation in many 
</p>
<p>countries where exceptions, allowing the restriction of the human rights of service users, 
</p>
<p>sadly turn into rules, and persons with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities suffer from 
</p>
<p>systemic or ad hoc violations of their rights. 
</p>
<p>99. A large number of persons with psychosocial disabilities are deprived of their liberty 
</p>
<p>in closed institutions and are deprived of legal capacity on the grounds of their medical 
</p>
<p>diagnosis. This is an illustration of the misuse of the science and practice of medicine, and 
</p>
<p>it highlights the need to re-evaluate the role of the current biomedical model as dominating 
</p>
<p>the mental-health scene. Alternative models, with a strong focus on human rights, 
</p>
<p>experiences and relationships and which take social contexts into account, should be 
</p>
<p>considered to advance current research and practice. </p>


<p>100. The issue of shared responsibility is as a crucial one. Representatives of professional 
</p>
<p>health-care groups, including psychiatry, should agree that it is in the interest of all to de-
</p>
<p>monopolize the decision-making process and to develop mechanisms for sharing 
</p>
<p>competences and responsibilities between actors, including providers and users of services, 
</p>
<p>policymakers and civil society. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Violence as a major obstacle for the realization of the right to health  
</b></p>
<p>101. Protection from all forms of violence is considered by the Special Rapporteur as a 
</p>
<p>cross-cutting issue present in all key elements of the realization of the right to health. As the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has recently underlined, violence 
</p>
<p>and human rights violations are often rooted in the deprivation and discrimination of 
</p>
<p>individuals and communities. Such violations are not generated spontaneously but &#8220;result 
</p>
<p>from policy choices which limit freedoms and participation, and create obstacles to the fair 
</p>
<p>sharing of resources and opportunities&#8221;.9 Violence needs to be addressed in a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive and proactive way, not only as a cause of serious violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights, but also as a consequence of a lack of political will to effectively invest in human 
</p>
<p>rights, including the right to health. 
</p>
<p>102. It was not until the end of the twentieth century that the close link between violence 
</p>
<p>and health began to be sufficiently understood. Interestingly, as health and human rights 
</p>
<p>came closer, a similar tendency could be observed by the turn of century when violence 
</p>
<p>was finally seen as a public health concern. In 1996, the World Health Assembly declared 
</p>
<p>violence as &#8220;a leading worldwide public health problem&#8221;.10 Since then, the burden of 
</p>
<p>violence has been documented and the effectiveness of programmes, with particular 
</p>
<p>attention devoted to women and children and community-based initiatives, has been 
</p>
<p>assessed. 
</p>
<p>103. Evidence has shown that, when violence is addressed proactively as a public health 
</p>
<p>issue, there are more opportunities to break the cycle of violence, poverty and helplessness 
</p>
<p>and, in the longer run, to significantly reduce the prevalence of all forms of violence, 
</p>
<p>including collective violence.11  
</p>
<p>104. All forms of violence are harmful and detrimental to the health and development of 
</p>
<p>human beings, starting from the youngest children. Early childhood adversities, including 
</p>
<p>all forms of violence against children, such as physical and emotional abuse and chronic 
</p>
<p>neglect, if they are not timely addressed by healthy public policies, can result in chronic 
</p>
<p>diseases in the adult affecting both physical and mental health.  
</p>
<p>105. The human rights approach, together with the modern understanding of public 
</p>
<p>health, warns against typifying violence into severe forms and those forms which are 
</p>
<p>considered to be &#8220;milder&#8221; and thus perceived as not harmful. That can lead to the 
</p>
<p>proliferation of practices which are justified as being &#8220;mild&#8221; forms of violence and thus 
</p>
<p>tolerated or even recommended, such as domestic violence against women, female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation or the institutional care of young children. 
</p>
<p>106. From the public health perspective, the cumulative effect of a large number of &#8220;mild 
</p>
<p>cases&#8221; generates a heavier burden for the health of population than a smaller number of 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>the twenty-eighth session of the Human Rights Council, 2 March 2015.

<p> 10 World Health Assembly resolution 49.25 (1996). 
</p>
<p> 11 See Etienne G. Krug et al. (eds.), &#8220;World report on health and violence&#8221; (WHO, Geneva, 2002).

<p>&#8220;severe cases&#8221;.12 The practice of tolerating and justifying milder forms of violence can pave 
</p>
<p>the way to severe violations of human rights, which can amount to grave violations and 
</p>
<p>even atrocities. 
</p>
<p>107. Any form of violence, including collective violence, does not originate in a vacuum. 
</p>
<p>Violence has roots in unhealthy relationships amongst individuals, and is reinforced by the 
</p>
<p>failure to promote and protect good-quality human relations, starting with relationships 
</p>
<p>between an infant and the primary caregiver. The cycle of violence is reinforced when 
</p>
<p>children grow up &#8212; whether in families or in institutions &#8212; without having their basic 
</p>
<p>needs satisfied, which include not only the need to survive, but the need to feel secure and 
</p>
<p>thus to enjoy the right to healthy development. 
</p>
<p>108. The most powerful way of preventing the epidemics of violence and different forms 
</p>
<p>of insecurity in the modern world is the provision of holistic support to all forms of family 
</p>
<p>unit, including access to food, shelter, health care and education, but also the provision of 
</p>
<p>basic parenting skills. The quality of relationships between individuals in society is an 
</p>
<p>increasingly important element in the realization of the right to health and the prevention of 
</p>
<p>the cycle of violence. The right to a healthy environment should include not only the 
</p>
<p>physical environment, but also the emotional and psychosocial environment in all settings, 
</p>
<p>family units, schools, workplace, communities and societies at large. 
</p>
<p>109. The resilience and the protective factors in individuals, families communities and 
</p>
<p>societies need to be promoted, and more investment in healthy human relationships, 
</p>
<p>emotional and social well-being and social capital is required. The empowerment of all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders &#8212; without exception &#8212; is an effective way of addressing major public health 
</p>
<p>threats and violations of human rights, including the right to health. 
</p>
<p><b> G. The role of stakeholders  
</b></p>
<p>110. The Special Rapporteur considers the active and informed participation of all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to be one of the key elements of the analytical framework of the right to 
</p>
<p>health. There is growing understanding and evidence that top-down relations between 
</p>
<p>governments and local authorities and populations, including civil society, and paternalistic 
</p>
<p>relations between health personnel and users of health-care services do not effectively 
</p>
<p>contribute to the realization of the right to health.  
</p>
<p>111. The meaningful involvement of all actors and the empowerment of those who make 
</p>
<p>use of services, especially the poor and other groups in vulnerable situations, is a crucial 
</p>
<p>precondition for the full realization of the enjoyment by everyone of the right to health and 
</p>
<p>other rights. 
</p>
<p>112. Civil society actors should be able to do their work for the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights, including the right to health, in safe and enabling environments and should 
</p>
<p>not suffer from criminalization, stigmatization or harassment of any sort because of the 
</p>
<p>work that they do (see the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, A/HRC/25/55). The Special Rapporteur believes that there is a clear and direct 
</p>
<p>link between the environment in which civil society operates in a given country and the 
</p>
<p>level of realization of basic rights and freedoms, not only of the public freedoms that are 
</p>
<p>necessary to advocating for human rights, but also of the specific rights for which they 
</p>
<p>advocate. If civil society actors are harassed or persecuted due to their work advocating for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 See Geoffrey Rose, &#8220;A large number of people exposed to al small risk may generate many more 
</p>
<p>cases than a small number exposed to a high risk&#8221;, in <i>The Strategy of Preventive Medicine</i> (Oxford 
</p>
<p>University Press, 1992). </p>


<p>and promoting the right to health, that is a symptom of important gaps in the realization of 
</p>
<p>the right itself. 
</p>
<p>113. It is crucial to strengthen the trust and cooperation between public institutions and 
</p>
<p>those representing the State and civil society actors representing the general public, 
</p>
<p>including the most disadvantaged groups of society. The importance thereof should not be 
</p>
<p>underestimated. Civil society plays a key role as agent of change, advocates good practices, 
</p>
<p>provides independent monitoring and, in many instances, provides necessary services. 
</p>
<p>Trustful partnerships between government agencies, State-run health-care services and the 
</p>
<p>non-profit sector, including civil society, constitute one of the cornerstones of effective 
</p>
<p>health systems and act as a guarantee for the effective realization of health-related human 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p>114. The role of medical doctors and other health-care professionals is also crucial. With 
</p>
<p>the ongoing change of paradigm, from paternalistic top-down medicine to partnership 
</p>
<p>between health-care providers and users, the medical profession should reconsider some of 
</p>
<p>its traditional views. Health-care professionals need to strengthen effective self-regulatory 
</p>
<p>practices and capacity-building activities within their professions so as to promote the best 
</p>
<p>traditions of medicine and prevent ethical misconduct and human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>115. Education in the health-care sector is one important element in that regard. The 
</p>
<p>doctrine of the &#8220;five star doctor&#8221;13 needs to be reaffirmed in the light of translating modern 
</p>
<p>values and scientific evidence into everyday medical practice. Modern medical doctors 
</p>
<p>need to be not only good clinicians but also effective community leaders, communicators, 
</p>
<p>decision makers and managers. That doctrine should be complemented by a strong human 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach and evidence gained from the modern public health approach. 
</p>
<p>116. Strengthening the human rights dimension in health-care education curricula would 
</p>
<p>be in the interests not only users of health services but also of medical doctors and other 
</p>
<p>members of the health-care workforce. Medical education, as well as medical and health 
</p>
<p>research, should help in providing tools to address imbalances when power asymmetries 
</p>
<p>lead to too much focus on the tertiary level of health care, biomedical technologies and 
</p>
<p>other components of the excessively exploited biomedical model. 
</p>
<p>117. The Edinburgh Declaration on medical education14 should be recalled and education 
</p>
<p>and research reoriented to the basics of social medicine through training in community 
</p>
<p>settings and fostering social sciences and qualitative methods, which are as relevant as 
</p>
<p>biomedical sciences and quantitative research. That would help in restoring the balance 
</p>
<p>with a holistic approach to promoting the health and well-being of individuals and societies.  
</p>
<p>118. The role of private companies, such as pharmaceutical ones, should also be 
</p>
<p>highlighted. The work of previous mandate holders has been crucial to underline their 
</p>
<p>duties with regard to right to health, in particular the Human Rights Guidelines for 
</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Companies in relation to Access to Medicines (A/63/263, annex). The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur will be addressing those issues with a view to ending unacceptable 
</p>
<p>practices and entrenched misconceptions.

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>Over the past few decades, measurable improvements have been made in health 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicators and the realization of the right to health worldwide. This has enabled 
</b></p>
<p><b>important progress in development goals, and the introduction in many countries of 
</b></p>
<p><b>health-related public policies with a human rights and modern public health 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>Moreover, the past 12 years have implied the consolidation of the framework of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to health, based on the key role of human rights in policymaking. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur hopes to continue contributing to the full realization of the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to health and related rights by providing guidance on how to address current 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges and how to exploit existing opportunities.  
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>States have the primary responsibility to ensure a conducive environment for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the full realization of the right to health, and related rights. But the role of other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders is crucial in this respect. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Observations 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>In that connection, at the outset of his tenure, the Special Rapporteur would 
</b></p>
<p><b>like to put forward the following observations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Departure from universal human right principles and standards, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and from evidence provided 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the modern public health approach is a major obstacle for effective realization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to health; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) History and evidence show that selective approaches to human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>reinforce the cycle of poverty, inequalities, social exclusion, discrimination and 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence and are detrimental to the full enjoyment of the right to health; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Inequalities and discrimination remain a crucial factor impeding the full 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of the right to health threatening the healthy development of individuals 
</b></p>
<p><b>and societies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Unequivocal political will to apply human rights principles and 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards to normative frameworks and public policies is key in addressing existing 
</b></p>
<p><b>imbalances and power asymmetries in the formulation and implementation of health-
</b></p>
<p><b>related public policies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The meaningful participation and empowerment of all stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be promoted, in particular of groups in vulnerable situations, and effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring and accountability mechanisms need to be in place to ensure the full 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of the right to health; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The analysis of the functioning and financing of health-care systems, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the need to ensure the right to available, accessible, acceptable and good-quality 
</b></p>
<p><b>health-care services remain crucial; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The policy approach, if implemented effectively and creatively, opens up 
</b></p>
<p><b>valuable opportunities for social innovations, through the empowerment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals, communities and societies at large; </b></p>


<p><b>(h) The role of health sector is becoming increasingly important, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the promotion and protection of human rights, in particular of marginalized 
</b></p>
<p>groups. The health sector should take the leadership in the promotion of &#8220;health in all 
</p>
<p>policies&#8221; approach;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Primary care needs to be strengthened as a crucial cornerstone of health 
</b></p>
<p><b>system, enabling the effective use of discoveries of modern medicine and public 
</b></p>
<p><b>health; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Achieving universal health coverage is one of the main goals and 
</b></p>
<p><b>processes for the post-2015 agenda; and commitments made in the Alma-Ata 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration and Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion should be reaffirmed and 
</b></p>
<p><b>revitalized by all stakeholders; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) There is no health without mental health. Good mental health means 
</b></p>
<p><b>much more than the absence of mental impairment. Modern understanding of mental 
</b></p>
<p><b>health includes good emotional and social well-being and healthy non-violent relations 
</b></p>
<p><b>between individuals and groups with mutual trust, tolerance and respect of the dignity 
</b></p>
<p><b>of every person; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Mental health is relevant to many key elements of the post-2015 agenda 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals; and it should be a new 
</b></p>
<p><b>priority in public policies addressed in parity with physical health; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) The effective promotion and protection of the rights of children and 
</b></p>
<p><b>adolescents offers huge potential for the full realization of the right to health in our 
</b></p>
<p><b>societies. Synergies between the right to survival and right to holistic development 
</b></p>
<p><b>need to drive cross-sectoral policies and accountability mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) The rights of persons with disabilities are of a special relevance to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to health and should be protected and promoted through the lens of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In that regard, the role of 
</b></p>
<p><b>health-care services and professionals and the role of the biomedical model need to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconsidered; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) Violence, as a public health problem, needs to be addressed with 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerted efforts by all actors as a human rights challenge, having a detrimental 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on the health of individuals and societies. There should be no excuse or 
</b></p>
<p><b>justification for any form of violence;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(p) Trustful partnerships between the policymakers responsible for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>health sector and civil society actors, including non-governmental organizations, 
</b></p>
