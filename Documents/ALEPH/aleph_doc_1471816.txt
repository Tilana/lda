FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This  quarterly  report  on  Form  10-Q  contains  forward-looking  statements  that  involve  risks  and  uncertainties.  Forward-looking 
statements  in  this  quarterly  report  include,  among  others,  statements  regarding  our  capital  needs,  business  plans  and  expectations.
Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the following:
(cid:122) our need for additional financing;
(cid:122) our exploration activities may not result in commercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas on our properties;
(cid:122) the  risks  inherent  in  the  exploration  for  oil  and  gas  such  as  weather,  accidents,  equipment  failures  and  governmental
restrictions;
(cid:122) our limited operating history;
(cid:122) our history of operating losses;
(cid:122) the potential for environmental damage;
(cid:122) our lack of insurance coverage;
(cid:122) the competitive environment in which we operate;
(cid:122) the level of government regulation, including environmental regulation;
(cid:122) changes in governmental regulation and administrative practices;
(cid:122) our dependence on key personnel;
(cid:122) conflicts of interest of our directors and officers;
(cid:122) our ability to fully implement our business plan;
(cid:122) our ability to effectively manage our growth; and
(cid:122) other regulatory, legislative and judicial developments.
Forward-looking  statements  are  made,  without  limitation,  in  relation  to  operating  plans,  property  exploration  and  development, 
availability of funds, environmental reclamation, operating costs and permit acquisition. Any statements contained herein that are not
statements  of  historical  facts  may  be  deemed  to  be  forward-looking  statements.  In  some  cases,  you  can  identify  forward-looking 
statements by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, 
“potential” or “continue”, the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. Actual events or results may differ materially. 
In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks outlined in our annual report on Form 10-K for 
the year ended December 31, 2009, this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and, from time to time, in other reports that we file with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-
looking statement. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS
 
Park Place Energy Corp., formerly ST Online Corp. (the “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada 
on August 27, 2004. On June 22, 2007, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement with Park Place Energy
Inc.,  a  private  company  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  Province  of  Alberta,  Canada,  and  0794403  B.C.  Ltd.,  a  British
Columbia corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On  July  6,  2007,  the  Company  affected  a  forward  split  of  its  shares  of  common  stock  on  the  basis  of  eight  new  shares  of
common stock for each one share of common stock outstanding on that date and increased the authorized share capital from
100,000,000 shares of common stock to 800,000,000 shares of common stock. At the same time, the Company merged with a
wholly-owned subsidiary, Park Place Energy Corp. which incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in contemplation
of the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Park Place Energy Inc. and the name of the Company was then
changed to Park Place Energy Corp. On July 23, 2007, the Company effected a forward split of its shares of common stock on
the basis of one and one-half new shares of common stock for each one share of common stock outstanding on that date and 
increased  authorized  share  capital  from  800,000,000  shares  of  common  stock  to  1,200,000,000  shares  of  common  stock.
Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company issued to each shareholder of record of Park Place
Energy Inc. at the time of the acquisition one share of our common stock for every two shares they held of Park Place Energy
Inc. On August 31, 2009, the Company affected a forward split of its shares of common stock on a one old share for ten new
shares  basis  on  that  date  and  increased  the  authorized  share  capital  from  1,200,000,000  shares  of  common  stock  to
12,000,000,000 shares of common stock. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company affected a reverse stock split of its
common  shares  on  a  three  hundred  old  shares  for  one  new  share  basis,  decreasing  the  authorized  share  capital  from
12,000,000,000 common shares to 40,000,000 common shares. All references to number of shares outstanding, earnings per
share, stock options and warrants have been adjusted to reflect the above mentioned stock splits. 
 
On July 30, 2007, the Company acquired Park Place Energy Inc. which was renamed to Park Place Energy (Canada) Inc. (“Park 
Place Canada”) on September 14, 2007. The business of the Company is now the acquisition and exploration of oil and gas 
properties. Park Place Energy Corp. held exploration interests in a property in Tennessee, USA. Park Place Canada holds the
exploration interests in three properties in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, in Canada. For accounting purposes,
the  merger  was  treated  as  a  recapitalization  with  Park  Place  Energy  Inc.  being  the  accounting  acquirer  and  the  go-forward 
financial statements reflect the history of Park Place Energy Inc. from its inception on May 4, 2006. The fiscal year-end of Park 
Place Energy Corp. was changed to December 31 from September 30.
 
On  November  22,  2007  a  new  private  company,  Park  Place  Energy  (International)  Inc.  (“Park  Place  International”)  was 
incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada. This company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Park Place Energy
Corp. 
 
On July 24, 2008, the Company acquired the interest in certain 5 Year Northern Petroleum and Natural Gas Leases located in
Alberta, Canada. The Company sold this interest on April 6, 2010 for consideration of $50,000. 
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets
and  settlement  of  liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The  Company  has  had  a  history  of  negative  cash  flows from
operating  activities.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $11,880,714  as  of  March  31,  2011.  These
considerations raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as going concern. Accordingly, the Company 
will require continued financial support from its shareholders and creditors until it is able to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations on a sustained basis. Failure to obtain the ongoing support of its stockholders and creditors may make the going
concern basis of accounting inappropriate, in which case the Company’s assets and liabilities would need to be recognized at 
their  liquidation  values.  These  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might arise from this uncertainty.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Recent accounting pronouncements 
 
In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update “ASU” 2010-09, Subsequent Events (Topic 855), amending 
ASC 855. ASU 2010-09 removes the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date relating to its subsequent events in both
issued  and  revised  financial  statements.  ASU  2010-09  also  eliminates  potential  conflicts  with  the  SEC’s  literature.  Most  of 
ASU 2010-09 is effective upon issuance of the update. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
 
In  January  2010,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2010-06,  Fair  Value  Measurements  and  Disclosures  (Topic  820),  Improving 
Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, amending ASC 820. ASU 2010-06 requires entities to provide new disclosures 
and  clarify  existing  disclosures  relating  to  fair  value  measurements.  The  new  disclosures  and  clarifications  of  existing
disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures
about  purchases,  sales,  issuances,  and  settlements  in  Level  3  fair  value  measurements,  which  are  effective  for  fiscal  years
beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this standard did not have
a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
 
In  June  2009,  the  FASB  issued  ASC  810,  which  revised  the  consolidation  guidance  for  variable  interest  entities.  The
amendments  include:  (1)  the  elimination  of  the  exemption  for  qualifying  special  purpose  entities,  (2)  a  new  approach  for
determining who should consolidate a variable-interest entity, and (3) changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should 
consolidate a variable-interest entity. ASC 810 is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after November 15,
2009 and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period. The Company adopted FASB ASC 810 and the adoption
of this standard had no material impact on our financial statements for the three month period ended March 31, 2011.
 
In  September  2009,  the  FASB  issued  authoritative  guidance  regarding  multiple-deliverable  revenue  arrangements.  This 
guidance  addresses  how  to  separate  deliverables  and  how  to  measure  and  allocate  consideration  to  one  or  more  units  of
accounting. Specifically, the guidance requires that consideration be allocated among multiple deliverables based on relative
selling  prices.  The  guidance  establishes  a  selling  price  hierarchy  of  (1)  vendor  specific  objective  evidence,  (2)  third-party 
evidence and (3) estimated selling price. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2010 but may be
early adopted as of the beginning of an annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that this guidance will
have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations but does not expect its adoption to have a material impact
on the Company’s financial reporting and disclosures.
 
In July 2010, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-20, Receivables, Disclosure about the Credit Quality 
of Financing Receivables and Allowances for Credit Losses. The standard requires additional disclosure related to the credit
quality of financing receivables, troubled debt restructurings and significant purchases or sales of financing receivables during
the period. The standard requires that these disclosures and existing disclosures be presented on a disaggregated basis, similar
to the manner that the entity uses to evaluate its credit losses. Disclosures of information as of the end of a reporting period are
effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2010, and disclosures of activity that occurred during a
reporting period are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company has adopted
this standard on January 1, 2010, and it will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements for the three month period
ended March 31, 2011, due to the receivables being short-term in nature and are therefore not financing receivables.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d…)
 
Recent accounting pronouncements (cont’d…)
 
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, which contains updated accounting guidance to clarify the acquisition date 
that should be used for reporting pro forma financial information when comparative financial statements are issued. This update
requires that a company should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that
occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. This
update also requires disclosure of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments. The provisions of
this update, which are to be applied prospectively, are effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on
or  after  the  beginning  of  the  first  annual  reporting  period  beginning  on  or  after  December  15,  2010,  with  early  adoption
permitted. The impact of this update on the Company’s consolidated financial statements will depend on the size and nature of
future business combinations.

OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES (cont’d…) 
 
On  January 28,  2010,  the  Company  bought  a  50%  interest  in  an oil  and  gas  exploration  property  located  in  Saskatchewan,
Canada by issuing a US$150,000 note payable. This note payable was later settled by issuing 500,000 common shares of the
company. 
 
On May 11, 2010, the Company assigned one-half of its 50% working interest in its Saskatchewan oil and gas property to a
privately held exploration company. As consideration for the assignment, the Company received 750,000 shares of the private
company. As the shares had no active market they were valued based on the consideration given up, US $75,000.
 
On October 12, 2010 the Bulgarian Council of Ministers granted to the Company a permit for the exploration and prospecting
of oil and natural gas properties known as the Vranino Blocks.
 
On October 25, 2010 an appeal against the Bulgarian Council of Ministers decision to award the Vranino Block to Park Place
was filed with the Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria.

splits.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
Financial  instruments,  including  receivables,  prepaids,  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities  are  carried  at  cost,  which
management believes approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Unless otherwise noted, it is 
management's  opinion  that  the  Company  is  not  exposed  to  significant  interest,  currency  or  credit  risks  arising  from  these
financial instruments. The company’s investments are classified as held-for-trading and are marked-to-market at each reporting 
date with the unrealized gains or losses being recognized in net income.
 
Under GAAP, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an
exit  price)  in  the  principal  or  most  advantageous  market  for  the  asset  or  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market
participants on the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is also established, which requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that
may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
Level 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable 
Level 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)
At March 31, 2011 our cash and investments were measured using level one inputs.
 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 
On April 6, 2011, the Company entered into a Convertible Promissory Note (the “Note”), to evidence the Company’s promise 
to repay the noteholder (the “Holder”) $150,000 (the “Principal”), together with interest (the “Interest”) from April 6, 2011 at a 
rate of 10% per annum on the unpaid balance of the Principal. Pursuant to the terms of the Note, the Principal and the Interest
thereon shall be due and payable in full on April 6, 2012 (the  “Due Date”). The Note may be prepaid at any time without 
penalty. 
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Note, the Principal and the Interest thereon is convertible, in whole and not in part, at the option of
the lender at any time prior to the Due Date by notice to the Company into shares of the Company’s common stock at the 
conversion price equal to $0.04 per common share. Pursuant to the terms of the Note on or about May 4, 2011, the Company
issued to the Holder 5,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Collateral Shares”), as collateral under 
the Note. Such Collateral Shares are being held in escrow by the Holder. Upon conversion by the Holder of the Principal and
Interest into the Company’s common shares, or upon payment in full of the Note and all Interest thereon, the Collateral Shares 
shall  be  cancelled  and  returned  to  Treasury.  The  Company  relied  on  Regulation  S  as  an  exemption  from  the  registration
requirements of the Securities Act for the issuance of the Collateral Shares to the Holder.

Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The  following  discussion  of  our  financial  condition,  changes  in  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  for  the  three  months
ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements and related notes for
the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, 
uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a 
result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form
10-K.
Overview of our Business
We are currently an exploration stage company engaged in exploring for conventional oil and natural gas. In the projects in which we
hold interests, another party typically acts as the operator of the project. With respect to the projects that we participate in, we provide
to the operator funding for our proportionate share of costs as well as technical input on how best to develop the property. As a way to
keep our overhead down, we engage the services of consultants who have technical expertise to best represent our interests.
Plan of Operations
Overview
Our initial Plan of Operations for the next 12 months is to work with the Bulgarian Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism, as
well as negotiate with Overgas Inc. directly, to attempt to find a positive conclusion to the current court case in front of the Supreme
Administrative Court of Bulgaria. If the original permit is upheld or if the Company can enter into a Joint Venture agreement with
Overgas Inc., we plan to undertake an exploration program in the Dobroudja Basin. The first year program includes perforating and
testing the Vranino #1 well, and procuring a seismic program of the license area which will cost approximately $350,000. While the
Company  awaits  the  outcome  in  Bulgaria  representatives  are  actively  seeking  further  domestic  and  international  exploration
opportunities either through direct acquisition or joint venture agreements. We anticipate spending approximately $150,000 in the next
12 months in office and general expenses, as well as approximately $500,000 in professional, consulting and management fees.
Estimated Capital Costs
Based on our current plan of operations as set forth above, we estimate that we will require approximately $1.000,000 to pursue our
plan of operations over the next 12 months. As at March 31, 2011, we had cash of $1,877 and a working capital deficit of $167,250.
Consequently,  we  will  require  additional  financing  to  pursue  our  plan  of  operations  over  the  next  12  months.  There  can  be  no
assurance that we will obtain any additional financing in the amounts required or on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain
additional financing, we may have to re-evaluate or abandon our business activities and revise our plan of operations.
We believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding as we do not have any significant tangible assets to secure any
debt  financing.  We  anticipate  that  additional  funding  will  be  in  the  form  of  equity  financing  from  the  sale  of  our  common  stock.
However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common
stock  to  fund  our  plan  of  operations  going  forward.  In  the  absence  of  such  financing,  our  business  plan  will  fail.  Even  if  we  are
successful in obtaining equity financing, there is no assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary to pursue our business plan. If
we do not continue to obtain additional financing going forward, we will be forced to re-evaluate or abandon our plan of operations.
Results of Operations
The following table sets forth our results of operations from inception on May 2, 2006 to March 31, 2011 as well as for the three
month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.
