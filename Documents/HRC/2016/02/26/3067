<p><b> 20</b>/&#8230;<b> Trafficking in persons, especially women and children: access 
to effective remedies for trafficked persons and their right to an 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective remedy for human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions on the problem of trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, in particular General Assembly resolutions 63/156 of 18 
December 2008 and 64/178 of 18 December 2009, and Human Rights Council resolutions 
8/12 of 18 June 2008, 11/3 of 17 June 2009, 14/2 of 23 June 2010 and 17/1 of 6 July 2011, 
in which the Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, </p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and 
declarations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol 
thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, </p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling </i>the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
and the Protocols thereto, in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and the Convention for the 
Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others, </p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29) and the Worst Forms 
of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the International Labour Organization, and 
welcoming the adoption by that Organization of the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 
(No. 189) and of the Domestic Workers Recommendation, 2011 (No. 201), </p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking1 and the commentary thereon developed by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, </p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee, the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and the Committee against Torture at the persistence of trafficking and the 
vulnerability of trafficked persons to human rights violations, </p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>that trafficking in persons violates and impairs the enjoyment of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and 
requires a concerted international assessment and response and genuine multilateral 
cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination for its eradication, </p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that victims of trafficking are often subject to multiple forms of 
discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of gender, age, disability, ethnicity, 
culture and religion, as well as national or social origin, and that these forms of 
discrimination may themselves fuel trafficking in persons, </p>
<p><i>Recognizing also </i>that women and children without nationality or without birth 
registration are particularly vulnerable to trafficking in persons, </p>
<p><i>Noting </i>that some of the demand for sexual exploitation, forced labour and removal 
of organs is met by trafficking in persons, </p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>that the right to an effective remedy<b> </b>as enshrined in article 2.<footnote name="3">A/HRC/17/35. </footnote> (a), 
(b), and (c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a human right of 
all persons whose human rights have been violated, including trafficked persons, that States 
have an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil, </p>
<p><i>Emphasizing </i>that States&#8217; responses to trafficking should take fully into account their 
human rights obligations with the objective of guaranteeing the full enjoyment of human 
rights of trafficked persons, which includes implementing the right to an effective remedy 
for trafficked persons whose human rights have been violated, </p>
<p><i>Emphasizing also </i>that, owing to the interrelated nature of the different components 
of an effective remedy, States should provide, as appropriate in each individual case, 
assistance and support aimed at restitution, rehabilitation, compensation and satisfaction, 
and guarantees of non-repetition, </p>
<p><i>Emphasizing further </i>that policies and programmes for rehabilitation, access to 
justice and compensation should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, 
comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims 
and respect for the full enjoyment of their human rights, and with the involvement of all 
</p>

<p>relevant actors, taking into account the specific protection needs of trafficked persons in 
countries of origin, transit and destination, </p>
<p><i>Welcoming in particular</i> the efforts of States, United Nations bodies and agencies 
and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the problem of 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, including the United Nations Global 
Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 
64/293 of 30 July 2010, the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking, the Working 
Group on the Review of the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, the Inter-Agency Coordination 
Group against Trafficking in Persons, and the United Nations Task Force on Transnational 
Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking, </p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the <i>Global Report on Trafficking in Persons</i> of the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime and the <i>Global Report on Forced Labour</i> of the International 
Labour Organization, </p>
<p><i>Taking note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking 
in persons, especially women and children,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/17/35. </footnote> </p>
<p>1. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its concern</i> at: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The high number of persons, especially women and children, who are being 
trafficked within and between regions and States; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime groups 
and others who profit from trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without 
regard for dangerous and inhumane conditions, in flagrant violation of domestic laws and 
international law and contrary to international standards; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for the 
purposes of exploitation that constitute trafficking, such as for trafficking in women for 
forced marriages, for forced labour and services and for exploitation in sex tourism, as well 
as trafficking in children for, inter alia, child pornography, paedophilia, forced labour and 
services, and any other form of exploitation of children; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The high level of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and their accomplices and 
the denial of rights and justice to victims of trafficking; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) The lack of effective remedies for trafficked persons globally, including the 
possibility of obtaining compensation for damage suffered; </p>
<p>2.<i> Encourages </i>States to refer to the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking developed by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights1 as a useful tool in integrating a human rights-based 
approach into their responses to provide a full range of effective remedies to trafficked 
persons and, in the case of trafficked children, to uphold, at a minimum, the general 
principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; 
</p>
<p>3.<i> Urges</i> States to recognize trafficked persons as victims with specific 
protection needs from the moment they are trafficked, and to ensure the promotion, 
protection and fulfilment of their human rights, including the right to an effective remedy 
for breaches of these rights; 
</p>
<p>4.<i> Encourages </i>States, guided by their human rights obligations and with a view 
to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of trafficked persons, including their right to 
</p>

<p>an effective remedy for human rights violations, to implement the following measures, inter 
alia: </p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Ensuring that, in order to most effectively protect victims and bring their 
abusers to justice, national laws criminalize all forms of trafficking in persons in 
accordance with the provisions of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking 
in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime, regardless of whether the offence is transnational 
in nature or involves organized crime; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Ensuring adequate procedures are in place to enable rapid and accurate 
identification of trafficked persons with their consent, regardless of whether the offence is 
transnational in nature or involves organized crime; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Providing trafficked persons with appropriate, relevant and understandable 
information on their rights, including the right to a remedy, the mechanisms and procedures 
available to exercise these rights, and how and where to obtain legal and other necessary 
assistance by, inter alia, developing guidelines and ensuring that such guidelines are 
properly applied; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Providing victims of trafficking with a recovery and/or reflection period to 
adequately recover and escape the influence of traffickers and/or to take an informed 
decision on cooperating with the competent authorities, during which time trafficked 
persons should not be subject to an expulsion order; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Facilitating legal assistance for trafficked persons to exercise their right to an 
effective remedy, and ensuring that lawyers providing such assistance have received 
adequate training in the rights of trafficked persons, including children, and in effective 
communication with victims of trafficking; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Ensuring that trafficked persons are provided with appropriate protection for 
their privacy and safety when taking part in legal proceedings; 
</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) Reviewing eligibility criteria that might have the effect of preventing 
trafficked persons from seeking compensation, such as nationality and residence 
requirements where State-funded compensation schemes for victims of crime exist; 
</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) Issuing a renewable residence permit to victims of trafficking, without 
prejudice to the right to seek and enjoy asylum, when the competent authority considers 
that their stay is necessary for the purpose of their cooperation with the competent 
authorities in investigations or criminal proceedings; 
</p>
<p>(<i>i</i>) Providing and/or intensifying training, including human rights education and 
training, for relevant authorities and officials, such as police, border guards, consular 
officers and labour inspectors, as well as immigration officials in the identification of 
trafficked persons to allow rapid and accurate identification of trafficked persons with their 
consent, and training for the judiciary, prosecutors and lawyers on laws and issues 
pertaining to the rights of trafficking in persons and relevant legal procedures, and by 
adopting system-wide approaches, including case management support and 
multidisciplinary teams in countries of both destination and origin; 
</p>
<p>(<i>j</i>) Training law enforcement officials in identifying, tracing, freezing and 
confiscating assets connected to the crime of trafficking and, with full respect of the 
budgetary competences of Member States, ensuring that their domestic legal system 
contains measures that offer victims of trafficking in persons the possibility of obtaining 
compensation for damages suffered; 
</p>
<p>(<i>k</i>) Ensuring that the best interest of the child is a primary consideration in all 
decisions or actions that affect trafficked children, whether made by public or private social </p>


<p>welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, in 
particular by respecting the right of trafficked children to be heard and to express their 
views freely in all matters affecting them, and to give due consideration to these views in 
accordance with their age and maturity; 
</p>
<p>(<i>l</i>) Ensuring that trafficked children are equipped with information on all matters 
affecting their interests, including their situation and the legal options, entitlements and 
services available to them, and processes of family reunification or repatriation, and to 
ensure that trafficked children have access to legal, interpretative and other necessary 
assistance provided by professionals trained in child rights and in communicating with 
trafficked children; </p>
<p>5.<i> Calls upon </i>States to consider signing and ratifying, as a matter of priority, in 
the case of Governments that have not yet done so, and for States parties to implement 
relevant United Nations legal instruments, such as the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, in particular the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and 
to take immediate steps to incorporate provisions of the Protocol into domestic legal 
systems; 
</p>
<p>6.<i> Urges </i>States and requests United Nations funds, agencies and programmes, 
and other relevant international, regional and subregional organizations within their 
respective mandates, to continue to contribute to the full and effective implementation of 
the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons; 
</p>
<p>7.<i> Also urges </i>States, regional and subregional organizations to develop 
collective regional strategies and plans of action to combat trafficking in persons; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to organize, in close 
cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children, consultations with States, regional intergovernmental bodies and organizations 
and the civil society on the draft basic principles on the right to effective remedy for 
trafficked persons, and to submit a summary thereon to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-sixth session; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Invites </i>States and other interested parties to make further voluntary 
contributions to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the United Nations Trust Fund on 
Contemporary Forms of Slavery; 
</p>
<p>10.<i> Calls upon </i>all States to continue to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and to consider responding 
favourably to the mandate holder&#8217;s requests to visit their countries and to provide all 
necessary information related to the mandate to enable the mandate holder to fulfil the 
duties of the mandate effectively, including by giving input to the Special Rapporteur on 
the draft basic principles on the right to an effective remedy for trafficked persons, annexed 
to her report submitted to the Human Rights Council ;3 
</p>
<p>11.<i> Requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to continue and strengthen its 
activities, including technical assistance and capacity-building, devoted to combating 
trafficking in persons in coordination with relevant international agencies; 
</p>

<p>12. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to promote at the regional 
and subregional levels the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking developed by the Office; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to provide the Office of the High 
Commissioner with resources sufficient to fulfil its mandate in relation to combating 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children; 
</p>
