<p><b>Summary 
</b> 
</p>
<p>This report presents the findings and recommendations of the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on her mission to The former 
</p>
<p>Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from 23 to 25 September 2007.  
 
</p>
<p>The purpose of the follow-up mission was to evaluate progress and challenges in 
implementing the recommendations of the Special Representative four years after the report on 
her first visit. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative notes  a number of improvements since 2003, in particular in 
the increased capacity and professionalism of human rights defenders, the adoption of legislation 
relevant to the work of defenders, and the positive role of international organizations in 
strengthening human rights defenders both through capacity building and funding. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The situation of human rights defenders still has to be improved in several areas to 
</p>
<p>comply with the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs 
of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, known as the Declaration on human rights defenders. The Special Representative 
addresses a number of recommendations to the Government, human rights defenders and the 
international community to facilitate a better implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The following table compares the situation of human rights defenders as assessed during 
the first visit in 2003 with the assessment made during the second visit in 2007. It provides a 
</p>
<p>schematic overview of developments that have occurred in four years, which were the main 
focus of the follow-up mission. The table does not summarize all the findings contained in this 
</p>
<p>report, particularly those not directly related to issues and concerns raised in the first mission.

</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>The context in which defenders work</b> 
</p>
<p>The implementation of the Ohrid 
Agreement was the political priority 
</p>
<p>(paragraphs. 10-13b). 
</p>
<p>In 2007 efforts to integrate into the EU 
</p>
<p>dominate the political agenda. The 
consequences of the prominence of the 
</p>
<p>EU agenda are tangible in the overall 
</p>
<p>situation of both human rights and civil 
society in the country (paragraph 11c). 
Political will and the genuine 
commitment of national public authorities 
are however fundamental to ensuring that 
achievements are sustainable and human 
rights priorities are not empty 
</p>
<p>programmatic objectives with a view to 
EU accession (paragraph 16). 
</p>
<p>The decentralization process sponsored 
</p>
<p>by the Ohrid Agreement presents 
concerns over the existing means of local 
</p>
<p>authorities to fulfil their human rights 
</p>
<p>responsibilities. The concentration of 
defenders in Skopje limits their capacity 
to do human rights monitoring at the 
local level (paragraph 15). 
</p>
<p>While this remains a concern, this has 
</p>
<p>been partly redressed with capacity 
building programmes specifically aimed 
at strengthening local civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and reducing the 
monitoring gap at the local level. Another 
</p>
<p>positive development is the structure of 
the Office of the Ombudsman, who has 
six regional offices in the country. 
</p>
<p>However, more awareness-raising is 
</p>
<p>needed to overcome the still deficient 
collaboration of local authorities with the 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Office of the Ombudsman. Municipalities 
should in principle fund civil society 
organizations but this is not actually 
happening yet (paragraphs 17-20). 
</p>
<p>Discrimination on the basis of ethnicity is 
a root cause of many human rights 
</p>
<p>violations (paragraph 19). 
</p>
<p>Discrimination along ethnic lines remains 
</p>
<p>a concern. Progress in the availability of 
higher education opportunities for ethnic 
Albanians as well as pre-employment 
training for minority public servants are 
positive developments (paragraphs 21-
22). 
</p>
<p>Intention of the Government to give more 
</p>
<p>emphasis to human rights education<b> </b>in 
the school curriculum (paragraph 22). 
</p>
<p>Ad hoc activities but limited concerted 
action taken to implement the Plan of 
</p>
<p>Action for the first phase of the World 
Programme for Human Rights Education 
(paragraph 23). 
</p>
<p><b>Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>A majority of human rights defenders 
require a greater degree of knowledge of 
international human rights standards, 
methodological skills and expertise in 
developing and implementing human 
rights strategies (paragraph 41). 
 
</p>
<p>A major area of progress is the improved 
capacity and skills of human rights 
defenders in terms of expertise in human 
rights methodologies, strategies and 
planning frameworks, advocacy and 
communication skills among others. 
</p>
<p>Overall their discourse is more articulate 
and focused, as it is backed by more years 
of experience (paragraph 24). 
</p>
<p>Strong thematic areas<b> </b>of work are 
women&#8217;s rights and the human rights of 
Roma communities (paragraphs 26 and 
28) 
</p>
<p>These two areas of work are confirmed as 
strong among human rights defenders. 
Rights of persons with disability acquired 
prominence and lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and intersex rights are an 
emerging area (paragraph 26). </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 5 
</p>
<p>Human rights organizations are largely 
</p>
<p>concentrated in Skopje with a small 
presence outside the capital (paragraph 
47). 
</p>
<p>Still mainly so, although there have been 
some improvements. The training 
</p>
<p>provided by international organizations to 
human rights organizations working 
</p>
<p>outside the capital has contributed to this 
</p>
<p>improvement (paragraph 27). 
Women defenders are numerous and 
especially active at the community level 
</p>
<p>(paragraph 28). 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s organizations continue to be 
perceived as the strongest civil society 
movement, with presence at the local 
</p>
<p>level and the highest percentage of 
citizen&#8217;s participation (paragraph 29). 
</p>
<p>Women defenders work more on 
awareness-raising and lobbying rather 
than on protection and monitoring. 
</p>
<p>Still mainly so but more reporting 
activities with the presentation of shadow 
reports to the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women (paragraph 30). 
Positive evaluation of the training 
</p>
<p>provided by international organizations to 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders (paragraph 40). 
</p>
<p>Human rights defenders assessed 
positively the training received, which 
</p>
<p>helped them in getting recognition for 
their role and in being more vocal. 
Defenders expressed the need for follow-
up training (paragraph 35). 
</p>
<p>Limited capacity of defenders to work on 
monitoring and protection (paragraph 
43). 
</p>
<p>Some improvements in monitoring 
</p>
<p>activities and better level of networking 
with regional and international coalitions, 
but the capacity of defenders to pursue 
</p>
<p>cases is still limited (paragraph 36-38). 
Politicization of human rights 
</p>
<p>organizations damages the image and 
work of defenders (paragraph 46). 
</p>
<p>This is still a concern, together with the 
</p>
<p>limited transparency and accountability 
of civil society organizations vis-&#224;-vis the 
</p>
<p>public. There are ongoing initiatives 
within the civil society organization </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 6 
</p>
<p>movement to promote transparency and 
to improve their public image (paragraphs 
40-42). 
</p>
<p>Concern about the very limited extent to 
which human rights defenders create 
formal networks amongst themselves and 
coordinate their activities (paragraph 39). 
</p>
<p>Improvements in creating umbrella 
organizations to coordinate work on 
thematic areas and to pursue common 
objectives. The Civic Platform of 
Macedonia is an attempt to create a space 
to communicate and coordinate civil 
society actions. Despite these 
</p>
<p>improvements, human rights 
</p>
<p>organizations still do not form a 
community that would be in a position to 
</p>
<p>protect defenders (paragraphs 45-49). 
Human rights defenders face security 
concerns mostly linked to the types of 
issues they address, including corruption, 
combating organized crime, respect for 
civil and political rights in areas formerly 
affected by the conflict, trafficking in 
persons and the collection of weapons. 
There have also been a number or attacks 
on defenders because of their ethnicity 
</p>
<p>(paragraph 72). 
</p>
<p>Overall, human rights defenders enjoy a 
good level of security and attacks and 
threats to their security are not 
</p>
<p>systematic. However, defenders working 
on some thematic areas are more exposed 
to violations. This is the case for 
</p>
<p>defenders working on anti-corruption 
cases and minority issues, such as 
ethnicity and/or religion (paragraph 50). 
 
</p>
<p>The almost complete dependence of 
defenders on international donors for 
</p>
<p>funding is a major concern in terms of the 
long-term sustainability of their work 
(paragraph 32). 
</p>
<p>Dependence on international donors is 
still the reality for most human rights 
</p>
<p>organizations in the country. International 
</p>
<p>funding is shrinking and resources 
available at the national level are not 
enough (paragraph 55). 
</p>
<p>Donors are not interested in funding 
projects identified by defenders as their 
</p>
<p>With few exceptions, international donors 
are unresponsive to funding requests for </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 7 
</p>
<p>priorities (paragraph 68). priority issues identified by defenders 
(paragraph 56). 
</p>
<p>A major concern is that defenders are not 
exempt from tax (paragraph. 35). 
</p>
<p>The tax regime continues to be a major 
obstacle to the development of civil 
society. The Strategy for Government 
</p>
<p>Cooperation with the Civil Society Sector 
envisages reforming the tax framework to 
</p>
<p>provide tax benefits for civil society 
organizations (paragraph 57). 
</p>
<p><b>An enabling environment 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Representative recommended 
the ratification<b> </b>of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
</p>
<p>Workers and Members of Their Families 
(paragraph 79 (a)). 
</p>
<p>The country has not ratified the 
Convention on the Protection of the 
</p>
<p>Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. It has, 
however, ratified the two Optional 
Protocols to the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict, and on the sale 
</p>
<p>of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, and the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>All Forms of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women (paragraph 58). 
Freedom of expression<b> </b>is perceived as 
generally very good (paragraph 53). 
</p>
<p>The overall positive assessment of the 
</p>
<p>respect for freedom of expression is 
confirmed, although there is a difficult 
</p>
<p>environment for defenders working on 
anti-corruption or minority issues, or for 
</p>
<p>those taking positions critical of the 
</p>
<p>Government (paragraph 60). 
The absence of a law on the right to 
access information is a concern 
</p>
<p>A law on access to information entered 
into force in September 2006. While this </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 8 
(paragraph 52). is a positive legislative development, its 
</p>
<p>unsatisfactory implementation is a 
</p>
<p>concern (paragraphs 61-62). 
Freedom of association is respected 
(paragraph 54). 
</p>
<p>The same positive assessment is 
</p>
<p>confirmed, with the exception of the 
limitations and constraints on association 
in trade unions in the private sector in 
companies with foreign capital, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the textile sector 
</p>
<p>(paragraph 63). 
Consultation with human rights defenders 
takes place on an ad hoc basis only and at 
the discretion of the authorities concerned 
(paragraph. 51). 
</p>
<p>Consultation processes still take place on 
an ad hoc basis. The adoption of the 
Strategy for Government Cooperation 
</p>
<p>with the Civil Society Sector for 2007-
</p>
<p>2011 is a welcome development and has 
the potential to institutionalize 
</p>
<p>consultation with civil society if there is 
</p>
<p>the political will to implement it.  The 
</p>
<p>Government is well aware of the need for 
the local authorities and the Parliament to 
follow the same approach in order that 
the institutionalization of the consultation 
</p>
<p>processes takes place at all levels 
</p>
<p>(paragraphs 65-70). 
Police officers have been accused of 
committing abuses. The absence of a 
</p>
<p>transparent complaint procedure 
encourages impunity. The ethnic and 
gender composition of the police is a 
concern (paragraph 59). 
</p>
<p>Several improvements can be registered 
in the role of the police: (a) the 
establishment of an internal complaint 
procedure; (b) a more ethnically diverse 
police; (c) implementation of human 
rights training programmes for the police; 
</p>
<p>(d) the ongoing establishment of 
community police; (e) an overall </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 9 
</p>
<p>improved attitude towards citizens, with 
the exception of Roma who continue to 
</p>
<p>be victims of the abusive behaviour of the 
police (paragraph 72). Concerns on police 
action include: (a) the abuses committed 
by the Alfi Unit of the police and the 
difficulty of investigating them; (b) a 
deficient internal control mechanism; (c) 
the absence of an external control 
mechanism; and (d) the denial of access 
to police stations for human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders (paragraphs 71-77). 
The Special Representative recommended 
</p>
<p>the adoption of the law establishing an 
independent court budget (paragraph. 79 
(a)). The judiciary has a significant 
backlog of cases and the justice is slow 
(paragraph 64). 
</p>
<p>The law on the independent court budget 
</p>
<p>entered into force in 2004. According to 
representatives of the judiciary, it needs 
amendments to further improve the 
independence of the judiciary. Lengthy 
duration of judicial proceedings continues 
to be a problem, although some progress 
can be registered (paragraphs 78-79). 
</p>
<p>Limited collaboration and responsiveness 
of public authorities with the 
Ombudsman (paragraph 24). 
</p>
<p>There have been improvements in the 
collaboration of public authorities, 
particularly with the introduction of 
</p>
<p>quarterly reports on governmental 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the Ombudsman and the 
</p>
<p>circulars of the Ministry of Interior 
</p>
<p>instructing the police to collaborate with 
the Ombudsman. However, 
improvements in this area are still needed 
(paragraphs 82-85). 
</p>
<p>The adoption of legislation to strengthen 
</p>
<p>the inspection functions of the 
</p>
<p>Legislation was adopted in 2003 but is 
</p>
<p>not considered in compliance with the </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 10 
Ombudsman was envisaged (paragraph  
25). 
</p>
<p>Paris principles for national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions (paragraph 82). 
The Office of the Ombudsman needs 
greater support from the international 
</p>
<p>community (paragraph 25). 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative welcomes the 
</p>
<p>support provided by international 
organizations especially in the area of 
</p>
<p>capacity-building (paragraph 86).

<p><b>Introduction 
</b> 
</p>
<p>1. The Special Representative conducted a mission to The former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia from 23 to 25 September 2007. The Special Representative would like to thank the 
Government for extending her the invitation to visit the country and for the collaboration 
</p>
<p>provided to undertake a fruitful visit. The Special Representative expresses her gratitude to the 
United Nations Resident Coordinator and her office, particularly the human rights adviser, for 
</p>
<p>the excellent support provided in the organization of the visit. 
 
</p>
<p>2. The mission to The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia concluded a visit to the 
region that included Serbia and Kosovo, visited from 17 to 21 September 2007. The findings and 
recommendations on the visit to the Republic of Serbia, including Kosovo, are presented in a 
separate report.<footnote name="1">9

<p> 
</p>
<p>3. The visit to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a follow-up mission aimed at 
</p>
<p>identifying progress and challenges in the situation of human rights defenders 4 years after the 
visit undertaken by the Special Representative from 27 to 30 January 2003.2 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Representative had 25 meetings during her visit to the country. All meetings 
were held in Skopje. She met with Government representatives, members of the judiciary and the 
Parliament, the Ombudsperson, the international community, and human rights defenders. In 
particular, she met with the Speaker of the Macedonian Parliament and other Members of the 
Parliament, the Minister of Interior, the Minister of Justice, the Deputy Minister of Education, 
representatives of the Government in charge of integration with the European Union (EU), 
representatives of the General Secretariat of the Government in charge of cooperation with civil 
</p>
<p>society, the President of the Constitutional Court, the President of the Judicial Council, the 
Ombudsman, the EU Special Representative and Head of Delegation of the European 
</p>
<p>Commission, the Head of Mission and other representatives of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), representatives of the Information Office of the Council of 
Europe, members of the United Nations country team and a group of international donors. She

also met non-governmental organizations (NGOs), journalists, representatives of trade unions 
and the Macedonian Bar Association, and individual human rights defenders. A press conference 
was held at the end of the visit. 
 
</p>
<p><b>I. THE CONTEXT IN WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS WORK 
A. Methodology</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5. The visit to The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was a follow-up mission. The 
purpose was therefore not to make a full assessment of the situation of human rights defenders 
but to rather evaluate progress and challenges in implementing the recommendations of the 
Special Representative four years after her last report. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6. The 2004 report was used as the basis to assess progress and gaps in the subsequent four 
years in the present report. To facilitate the assessment, a matrix was prepared containing a list of 
over 60 issues, findings and recommendations detailed in a schematic manner. For each item, 
information on developments that occurred between 2003 and 2007 was sought before and 
during the mission. This allowed immediate identification of areas in which progress has been 
</p>
<p>more evident, versus other areas which have stagnated more. 
 
</p>
<p>7. The assessment undertaken during the visit, however, went beyond the issues raised in 
the 2004 report to allow new developments to be captured or concerns that were not covered in 
the first report to be taken into account, to provide an updated overview of the situation of human 
rights defenders. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. The pace of change</b> 
 
</p>
<p>8. &#8220;After your report, nothing changed&#8221;, said a human rights defender to the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative. The impatience of those in the front line for the promotion and protection of 
human rights to see the progress they are striving for is justified. It is in itself a motivating factor 
to continue defending human rights with renewed energy and commitment.  
</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p>9. While the Special Representative understands the frustration of human rights defenders 
who have not seen the improvements expected and shares their disappointment in several areas 
that will be analysed in more detail, she nevertheless recognizes a number of positive 
developments since 2003. In particular, she is impressed by the progress made by defenders 
themselves in terms of their increased level of capacity, professionalism, expertise on human 
</p>
<p>rights methodologies, as well as more clarity about their objectives and strategies for achieving 
them. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>C. From the Ohrid Agreement to the European Union</b> 
 
</p>
<p>10. While the political context of the 2003 visit of the Special Representative was marked by 
the Ohrid Agreement, which provided a framework for addressing the problems that prompted 
the armed conflict of 2001, in 2007 the efforts to integrate into the EU dominate the political 
agenda. This is a major difference from the previous visit and the prominence of the EU agenda 
had had a tangible impact on the overall situation of both human rights and civil society in the 
</p>
<p>country. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11. On 17 December 2005, the Council of the European Union decided to recognize The 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as a candidate for EU membership. Since 2004, 
European partnerships have been adopted with the countries of the Western Balkans as a means 
to realize progressive integration with the EU. These Accession Partnerships establish short- and 
medium-term priorities that the competent State authorities are requested to meet to advance 
towards EU accession. The European Commission regularly monitors progress in the 
implementation of these priorities. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>12. The priorities set forth in the European and Accession Partnerships include human rights 
priorities, as well as priorities in areas that have direct influence on the environment in which 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders operate. 
 
</p>
<p>13. Human rights priorities for EU accession include, inter alia: (a) full compliance with the 
European Convention on Human Rights and the recommendations made by the European 
Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 16 
(b) full implementation of the rules applicable to ethics, internal control, professional and human 
rights standards in law enforcement agencies, the judiciary and prison administration, including 
regular training; (c) establishment of effective mechanisms to identify, pursue and penalize all 
forms of discrimination by State and non-State bodies against individuals and groups; (d) 
upgrading and implementation of the strategy on equitable representation of non-majority 
communities; and (e) further implementation of the strategy on equitable representation of non-
minority communities.3 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14. The European and Accession Partnerships also include a priority on promoting the active 
participation of civil society. Compliance with this priority prompted the adoption of the 2007-
2011 Strategy for Government Cooperation with the Civil Society Sector (see paragraphs 67-71 
below). 
 
</p>
<p>15. The human rights priorities for accession to the EU, as well as other requirements that are 
instrumental to the work of defenders, such as the involvement of civil society in public 
</p>
<p>administration, cooperation with the Ombudsman or collaboration with the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), are definitely a powerful engine to further 
the human rights agenda and progress can be registered in several areas as a consequence of EU 
requirements and their monitoring. &#8220;Whenever we want to move faster, we lobby the EU&#8221;, 
commented a human rights defender to underline the effectiveness of having the backing of the 
EU in pursuing human rights objectives. 
 
</p>
<p>16. While recognizing the benefits of the EU framework in making progress on human rights, 
the Special Representative warns that political will and the genuine commitment and 
participation of national public authorities are fundamental to ensuring that achievements in this 
</p>
<p>area are sustainable and that human rights priorities are not empty programmatic objectives in 
the progress towards EU accession. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>D. Decentralization</b> 
 
</p>
<p>17. In the 2004 report, some concerns were expressed as to the possible negative 
consequences for human rights defenders triggered by the ongoing decentralization process 
envisaged by the Ohrid Agreement and supported by the EU. With the local authorities assuming 
</p>
<p>more functions and competencies, the potential for committing human rights abuses at the local 
level had increased, as had the need to monitor local institutions. As the bulk of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders were based in Skopje, their monitoring capacity at the local level was considered not 
to be strong enough to address the human rights challenges posed by decentralization. 
 
</p>
<p>18. While this remains a concern, the Special Representative welcomes the capacity-building 
programmes specifically aimed at strengthening local civil society organizations and reducing 
the monitoring gap at the local level. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19. Another positive development is the structure of the Office of the Ombudsman, who has 
six regional offices in the country. Regional offices facilitate access to the Ombudsman at the 
local level. However, more awareness-raising and training on the role and functions of the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman is needed among local authorities, whose collaboration with the Office of the 
Ombudsman is still deficient. 
 
</p>
<p>20. With the decentralization process, municipalities should in principle also fund civil 
society organizations but this is not actually happening yet. 
 
</p>
<p><b>E. Progress and setbacks in the overall human rights situation  
as identified in the 2004 report</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21. In the 2004 report, concerns over the overall human rights situation mainly referred to 
</p>
<p>discrimination on the basis of ethnicity. Non-discrimination and equitable representation of non-
majority communities remain among the outstanding human rights priorities established by the 
EU. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 18 
22. Progress can be registered in the availability of higher education opportunities for ethnic 
Albanians as well as pre-employment training programmes for minority public servants. This 
should give better employment opportunities for minority communities. 
 
</p>
<p>23. Despite some efforts to improve education opportunities for Roma, Turkish and Vlach 
</p>
<p>minorities, there has been no tangible progress in this area. It is regrettable that the Ministry of 
Education has taken ad hoc but not concerted action to implement the Plan of Action for the first 
</p>
<p>phase of the World Programme for Human Rights Education (2005-2009). Human rights 
education is not only about introducing human rights in school curricula. It is also about 
inclusion as opposed to exclusion and marginalization, it is about equality as opposed to 
discrimination and stigmatization. The Plan of Action is a policy framework that would be 
instrumental in addressing and redressing discrimination practices in the country. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS</b> 
 
</p>
<p>24. The major area of progress identified by the Special Representative is the improved 
capacity and expertise of human rights defenders on human rights methodologies, strategies and 
</p>
<p>planning frameworks, advocacy and communication skills, among others. Overall their discourse 
is more articulate and focused, as it is backed by more years of experience. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25. Human rights defenders had frank discussions with the Special Representative on their 
strengths and weaknesses. The Special Representative considers the openness to self-criticism 
showed by defenders in her discussions with them as an indication of maturity and self-
confidence that was not there four years ago. 
 
</p>
<p>26. In terms of thematic areas of work, some trends identified in the 2004 report were 
confirmed, such as the strength of the women&#8217;s movement, the steady growth of capacity and 
</p>
<p>activities carried out by defenders working on the rights of Roma. New thematic areas are now 
on the agenda of human rights defenders. Work on the human rights of persons with disabilities 
has become prominent in the country. Another emerging area is the rights of lesbians, gays, 
bisexual, transgender and inter-sexual persons (LGBTI). While the difficult access to public 
authorities for NGOs working on LGBTI rights is a concern, the Special Representative notes as 
</p>
<p>a positive development the solid work of defenders on LGBTI rights, who are well-integrated </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 19 
</p>
<p>among human rights organizations, formed a coalition to pursue improvements in the legislation, 
and achieved changes in media ethics banning homophobic positions. 
 
</p>
<p>27. In terms of geographic distribution, human rights organizations continue to be mainly 
concentrated in Skopje, as was noted at the time of the 2003 visit, although there have been some 
improvements thanks to the training provided by international organizations to human rights 
organizations working outside the capital. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>28. In 2003, there were 5,289 civil society organizations registered in Macedonia, 43 per cent 
of which were registered in Skopje. According to the Directory of Civic Organizations, the 
number of active organizations is far smaller and amounts to 1,512, of which 23 per cent are 
active in Skopje.4  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A. Women human rights defenders</b> 
 
</p>
<p>29. &#8220;The women&#8217;s movement has such a large social capital that it does not need the support 
of the international community to operate&#8221;, commented a defender. Women&#8217;s organizations are 
</p>
<p>considered the strongest sector of civil society. The empowerment of women is perceived as one 
of the areas in which civil society organizations have achieved the most. While there is overall a 
</p>
<p>relatively low percentage of citizen participation in civil society activities, the highest rate of 
</p>
<p>participation is in women&#8217;s organizations. Women&#8217;s organizations have a relatively large 
</p>
<p>presence throughout the country, as compared to other organizations, which tend to be 
concentrated in towns and in Skopje in particular. 
 
</p>
<p>30. Women&#8217;s organizations have several examples of networks, mutual cooperation and 
lobbying. For example, the Macedonian Women Lobby (MZL), established as an informal 
movement in 2000, is a coalition of leading women from civil society organizations and unions, 
</p>
<p>political parties, the media, public authorities, as well as women who are experts in different 
fields. MZL played a role in the inclusion of gender quotas in elections, commended by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).5

<p>31. The Union of Women Organizations of Macedonia (UWOM) is a network of 64 
independent women organizations throughout the country with members of different ethnic, 
national, and religious affiliation. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32. Women&#8217;s organizations also participated in the review undertaken by the CEDAW 
Committee of The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and submitted two shadow reports 
</p>
<p>to the Committee, one on the overall situation of women&#8217;s rights and another on Roma women. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. Achievement in building the capacity of human rights defenders</b> 
 
</p>
<p>33. In 2003, the Special Representative made a positive assessment of the training 
programmes for human rights defenders conducted by international organizations, including the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), OSCE and the 
Council of Europe.<footnote name="6">E/CN.4/2004/94/Add.2, para. 40. </footnote> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>34. OSCE and the Council of Europe continue to provide training to defenders, while the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR project ended in 2006. Assistance is provided through a national human rights adviser 
in the office of the Resident Coordinator but without a direct engagement in project activities. 
Support to human rights defenders provided in this framework includes, inter alia, the 
establishment of a civil society focal point within the United Nations Country Team in 2006 
aimed at facilitating relationships between the Team and civil society organizations, the 
dissemination of information on and facilitation of access to funds for human rights activities 
implemented by grass-roots civil society organizations, such as the United Nations Voluntary 
Fund for Victims of Torture and the United Nations Voluntary Fund on Contemporary Forms of 
Slavery. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>35. Defenders evaluated positively the training provided to them by international 
organizations. They deemed the training useful in giving them recognition and in encouraging 
them to be vocal. They also considered it an important opportunity to get to know each other and 
build contacts. They pointed to the need for follow-up training. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 21 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Representative noted some improvement in the capacity of human rights 
organizations to work on monitoring and protection, including by using international and 
regional human rights mechanisms. The shadow reports submitted to CEDAW are an example. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>37. There is also a better level of networking through international and regional coalitions, 
which facilitate participation in international settings and give them access to capacity-building 
</p>
<p>programmes available outside the country. 
 
</p>
<p>38. However, most NGOs do not have the capacity to pursue cases until the end among those 
</p>
<p>they take up in their protection activities. This requires resources, including legal expertise, 
which most NGOs still do not have. The inability of defenders to seek remedies and redress is 
also due to the insufficient mechanisms that they have at their disposal for their protection 
activities. For instance, access to information is not granted in many crucial areas, including on 
violations committed by the police. The absence of an external oversight mechanism is another 
obstacle in the activities of defenders that report on alleged violations committed by the police 
(see paragraph 75 below). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>C. The independence of civil society organizations and public perception  
of their role and performance</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>39. A survey among communities&#8217; samples showed a relatively low level of public trust in 
the institutions, including civil society organizations.<footnote name="7">9. The lengthy duration of judicial procedures continues to be a major cause of inefficiency 
of the judiciary.  However, the Special Representative appreciates the information provided by </footnote> However, when it comes to concrete 
services to the people, they are considered more helpful in resolving the problems of 
communities than Government institutions.8 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>40. Concerns about the independence of civil society organizations from political parties 
were expressed both by some defenders as well as public authorities. Subjective  
 
</p>
<p>politicization of civil society organizations is considered a problem that affects the credibility of 
civil society and contributes to a negative image in the media and public opinion. 
</p>

</p>
<p>41. Some organizations were aware of their own responsibility in creating the negative image 
they have in media and in public opinion, and pointed to the need to develop media strategies to 
improve the quality of media coverage of human rights and of the work of defenders. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>42. Other organizations identified a lack of or limited transparency of civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations as a problem of Macedonian civil society that weakens their image in public 
opinion. Only a small number of organizations provide public access to their sources of funding. 
</p>
<p>While most of civil society&#8217;s funding relations are with foreign donors and therefore primary 
accountability is towards them, transparency towards the general public is an important element 
of integrity and credibility. Gaining the trust of citizens can also have financial benefits in the 
medium and long term, as sources of funding will have to be more and more sought at the local 
level to ensure financial sustainability. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>43. Under the motto &#8220;Together for Transparency&#8221; some organizations decided to voluntarily 
publish their annual reports, financial reports and independent audit reports. 
 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Representative acknowledges that issues of transparency and credibility must 
be addressed by civil society, in particular the community of human rights organizations. 
</p>
<p>However, she has observed that in many transitional societies a growing civil society with 
relatively more resources at its command and a focus on the promotion of rights that may not yet 
be fully understood or respected,  may encounter a level of resistance from social and State 
institutions. This can lead to misperceptions which may arise because of the nature of the State 
and society rather than as a consequence solely of the shortcomings of the groups striving for 
rights. She, therefore, believes that removal of misperceptions as well as building a more positive 
image of human rights organizations and defenders is a collective responsibility, requiring 
contributions from State institutions, social actors and defenders themselves. This is a crucial 
</p>
<p>undertaking. Support for the work and activities of defenders has a direct relation to the level of 
respect for human rights in any country. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 23 
</p>
<p><b>D. Networking</b> 
 
</p>
<p>45. In her 2004 report, the Special Representative expressed her concern about the limited 
level of networking and coordination among defenders. 
 
</p>
<p>46. Some improvements can be registered in this area. Umbrella organizations on the basis of 
thematic area or target group (women, Roma, disability) coordinate the work of several 
organizations. As mentioned, the women&#8217;s movement is the best organized and with a large 
</p>
<p>presence on the ground. 
 
</p>
<p>47. Other initiatives are aimed at combining efforts on common human rights objectives. 
This is the case of the coalition &#8220;All for Fair Trials&#8221; established in 2003 with the support of 
OSCE. The coalition represents a network of 22 independent NGOs engaged in promoting 
respect for international standards on fair trials.<footnote name="9">http://www.all4fairtrials.org.mk.  </footnote> A more recent initiative was the establishment 
in 2007 of a coalition of NGOs working on a proposal for an anti-discrimination law. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>48. Another coordinating entity is the Civic Platform of Macedonia established in March 
2004. It is composed of 36 organizations that wanted to create an open space to improve 
communication, coordination and cooperation of civil society and facilitate the establishment of 
partner relations with the Government, the business sector and international organizations. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>49. Despite these efforts in improving coordination among civil society organizations, the 
Special Representative notes that human rights organizations still do not form a real human 
rights community that can voice the positions of human rights defenders more forcefully and 
protect defenders. Human rights organizations still do not see it as part of their role as defenders 
to systematically protect defenders at risk, those who are marginalized or are facing difficult 
battles. The Special Representative is encouraged by some examples of solidarity expressed by 
</p>
<p>human rights organizations when defenders had been unfairly attacked by the media or 
politicians. She hopes that these examples will gain consistency and pave the way for a solid 
human rights community in Macedonia. 
 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 24 
</p>
<p><b>E. Defenders at risk</b> 
 
</p>
<p>50. Overall, human rights defenders enjoy a good level of security and attacks and threats to 
their security are not systematic. However, defenders working on some thematic areas are more 
exposed to violations. This is the case for defenders working on anti-corruption cases and on 
</p>
<p>minority issues, be they ethnic, religious or both. 
 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Representative was informed of a recent case of a human rights defender 
assaulted and insulted with racist comments because of his mixed marriage and his position on 
the law of religious communities. Fifteen NGOs intervened to condemn the attack and expressed 
their solidarity with the defender. These fifteen NGOs were in turn discredited by the media and 
some political parties, which labelled them as &#8220;<i>wahabists</i>&#8221;. 
 
</p>
<p>52. On anti-corruption work, the Special Representative followed up the case of Mr Zoran 
Bozinovski, an investigative journalist working on anti-corruption cases. The attacks against Mr 
Bozinovski were already taken up in her 2004 report10 and his situation was then followed by 
communications sent on three occasions in the following years.<footnote name="11">In 2004 (E/CN.4/2005/101/Add.<footnote name="1">8
 Ibid., p. 29. 
</footnote>, paras. 530-532) and in 2006 (A/HRC/4/37/Add.<footnote name="1">6
 Government of the Republic of Macedonia, Strategy for Government Cooperation with the Civil Society Sector, 
</footnote>, paras. 410-412). </footnote> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>53. Over the last few years, Mr Bozinovski has faced numerous defamation legal suits, 
reportedly orchestrated by those whose supposed corruption he was investigating. He reported 
that the intervention of the Special Representative through the communications on his situation 
</p>
<p>that she sent to the Macedonian Government contributed to saving him from serving a three-
month prison sentence. Mr Bozinovski explained how the legal suits against him are meant to 
impede him in investigating corruption and are reactivated as soon as he touches sensitive issues 
in his investigative work. The journalists&#8217; association has not been able to defend him and the 
only support he has received came essentially from international organizations. 
 
</p>
<p>54. While the relentless judicial prosecution of Mr Bozinovski might be an isolated example 
and not a systematic targeting of a journalist, the fact that the support he received came from the 
international community and not from national organizations illustrates how human rights 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 25 
</p>
<p>organizations are still not able to assess facts and to act as a community of defenders that 
systematically protects and expresses solidarity to defenders under attack or facing difficulties.  
The Special Representative welcomes the subsequent information provided by the Government 
on this point, i.e. the recent adoption of the Code of Best Practices for financial support of 
citizens&#8217; associations and foundations.<footnote name="1">5
 E/CN.4/2004/94/Add.2, para. 79 (a). </footnote>2 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>F. Funding</b> 
 
</p>
<p>55. Funding of human rights organizations continues to come mostly from international 
donors. This was already a concern in 2003 in terms of the medium and long-term sustainability 
of the work of defenders when international funding would significantly reduce. The shrinking of 
international funding is even more real in 2007. This is happening at a time when alternative 
funding at the national level is still not available in sufficient quantities. The Special 
Representative is also concerned that the Government has not established transparent criteria and 
procedures for granting Government funding to civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>56. With few exceptions, international donors continue to be less than responsive to funding 
requests for programmes and activities on the basis of the priorities identified by defenders 
themselves. Donors tend rather to support what they consider priorities. 
 
</p>
<p>57. As already observed in 200313 the tax regime is a major obstacle to the development of 
civil society. The Strategy for Government Cooperation with the Civil Society Sector (see 
paragraph 67 below) recognizes the need to reconsider the present tax framework and envisages 
reforming it to extend exemption from tax to civil society organizations in line with EU 
regulations and to foster the development of such organizations.14

<p><b>III. AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT 
A. International human rights instruments</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>58. Since 2003, there has been progress in the ratification of international human rights 
instruments. In particular, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has ratified the 
</p>
<p>following instruments: the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on the involvement of children in armed conflict, and on the sale of children, child prostitution 
</p>
<p>and child pornography and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Representative recommended the ratification of the Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which did not 
occur. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has signed and is taking steps to ratify the 
other core international human rights standards, namely the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, for whose 
</p>
<p>ratification a law is being drafted; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and 
the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, for 
</p>
<p>which a pre-ratification analysis is under way. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. Freedom of expression, access to information and freedom of association</b> 
 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Representative confirms the overall positive assessment of the respect of 
freedom of expression that she already expressed in 2003, although she noted a more difficult 
environment for defenders working on anti-corruption, minority issues, both ethnic and religious, 
and for those taking positions critical of the Government. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Representative welcomes the adoption of a law on access to information, 
which responded to one of her earlier recommendations.15 The law has been in force since 1 
September 2006. It established an independent five-member Commission to oversee the 
implementation of the law. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 27 
</p>
<p>62.  A more effective implementation of the law has, however, yet to be achieved. A 
monitoring project on the implementation of the law reported that only 35 per cent of requests 
are answered. When information is not provided, it does not happen on the basis of the 
established procedures. In 65 per cent of cases the information is provided as soon as the refusal 
to provide information is appealed before the Commission. This indicates a widespread lack of 
</p>
<p>responsiveness of the public authorities that is redressed only when accountability mechanisms 
are activated. The role of the Commission was not considered to be proactive enough to counter 
</p>
<p>the problems in the implementation of the law and it is perceived as accepting passively the 
excuses given by public authorities for failing to provide the information requested. 
 
</p>
<p>63. Freedom of association is guaranteed in article 20 of the Constitution and it is generally 
respected. Problems in respecting freedom of association affect trade unions in the private sector 
in companies with foreign capital, particularly in the textile industry. 
 
</p>
<p>64. The Government envisages amending the Law on Citizen Associations and Foundations 
adopted in 1998 to improve the conditions for the establishment and functioning of civil society 
organizations and to be in line with EU practices and regulations. In particular, amendments are 
</p>
<p>aimed, on the one hand, at enabling associations to engage directly in economic activities, thus 
facilitating their ability to generate income for the delivery of their activities and the coverage of 
their expenses. On the other hand, the role of civil society organizations working on activities of 
public interest will be strengthened with the introduction of tax benefits.16 
 
</p>
<p><b>C. Government&#8217;s attitude and policies</b> 
 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Representative notes that there has not been much progress on consultation 
processes with civil society, which still take place on an ad hoc rather than systematic basis and 
mainly because of the efforts made by civil society organizations or because of the pressure of 
</p>
<p>international organizations. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 28 
66. The Special Representative is encouraged by and welcomes the adoption of the Strategy 
for Government Cooperation with the Civil Society Sector for 2007-2011, which is meant to 
</p>
<p>provide a framework to institutionalize cooperation between the Government and civil society. If 
implemented properly, the Strategy has the potential to redress the present situation of ad hoc, 
insufficient and in some cases non-existent consultation processes with civil society. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>67. The Strategy outlines action in seven areas: (a) upgrading of the legal framework for the 
development of the civil sector; (b) participation of the civil sector in decision-making processes, 
which includes the participation of civil society organizations in drafting, implementing and 
monitoring public policies and national laws; (c) maintaining inter-institutional cooperation; (d) 
maintaining inter-sector cooperation; (e) involvement of the civil sector in the process of EU 
integration; (f) provision of more favourable conditions for the civil society sector; and (g) 
continuous development of the civil society sector. 
 
</p>
<p>68. The Unit for Cooperation with Non-governmental Organizations within the General 
Secretariat of the Government holds the primary role for coordinating, monitoring and reporting 
on the implementation of the Strategy. In the second year of implementation, an assessment of 
</p>
<p>how the Strategy is being implemented will be conducted by means of a broad consultation 
process. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>69. The Strategy concerns collaboration between Governmental authorities and the civil 
society sector and does not extend to local authorities. Measures to institutionalize collaboration 
between civil society organizations and all public authorities, in particular local authorities and 
the Parliament, are needed to overcome the present trend of ad hoc consultation processes. 
 
</p>
<p>70. As mentioned above, the Strategy was adopted to comply with the requirements of EU 
accession. While EU accession is definitely a priority for the Government, the human rights 
</p>
<p>requirements that are to be met to achieve it are perceived more as part of the EU package than 
as a priority per se, for which there is political commitment. This might be an obstacle for the 
sustainability of human rights achievements, particularly when the attitude of the Government 
</p>
<p>towards civil society organizations is not actively supportive. For instance, the Special 
Representative sees as an indication of such an attitude the lack of responsiveness or reaction of </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 29 
</p>
<p>the Government at information, reports, cases, complaints of human rights violations and abuses 
documented by defenders and brought to the attention of the concerned authorities, without a 
consequent action being taken by the Government to investigate, respond, or even refute the 
alleged facts. 
 
</p>
<p><b>D. The police</b> 
 
</p>
<p>71. Compared to the assessment of 2003, some improvements can be registered in the role of 
the police: (a) the establishment of an internal complaint procedure in 2003;( b) a more 
ethnically diverse police force; (c) implementation of human rights training programmes for the 
police with the support of international donors; (d) the ongoing programme supported by OSCE 
on the establishment of community policing aimed at bringing the police closer to citizens; (e) an 
overall improved attitude towards citizens, with the exception of Roma who continue to be 
victims of abusive behaviour by the police. 
 
</p>
<p>72. Most of the abuses allegedly committed by the police relate to a police unit called &#8220;Alfi 
Unit&#8221;. The Alfi unit aims to counter urban crime and works in plain clothes. Access to their files 
</p>
<p>is very limited and it is therefore difficult to investigate complaints of abuse committed by them. 
Even the Ombudsman does not have adequate powers or the instruments to fully investigate 
complaints against members of the Alfi unit. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>73. The Internal Control and Professional Standards Department within the Ministry of 
Interior is the internal oversight mechanism to investigate complaints of abuse by the police. In 
his 2006 annual report, the Ombudsman reported that the Department &#8220;continued to conceal the 
relevant factual situation in some cases and to withhold information regarding the exceeding of 
the official authority and the excessive use of force requested by the Ombudsman. The Internal 
</p>
<p>Control and Professional Standards Department during the reporting year continued to show 
unprofessional attitude towards the function of internal control mechanism&#8221;. He therefore 
recommended a &#8220;higher level of professionalism by the official in the area of human rights while 
performing police affairs and impartial and responsible work of the Internal Control 
Department&#8221;.17  The Special Representative takes note of the efforts made in this respect through 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>17
 Republic of Macedonia Ombudsman, <i>Annual report 2006</i>, pp. 57 and 59. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 30 
the capacity building project funded by the European Agency for Reconstruction aimed at 
improving the functioning of this control mechanism. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Representative is concerned that an external oversight mechanism to 
investigate abuses committed by the police does not exist. The problems of the internal 
mechanism outlined above make the absence of an external control mechanism an even more 
</p>
<p>worrying concern. The Special Representative is encouraged by the ongoing initiative of OSCE, 
which is coordinating a working group composed of public authorities, civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, international organizations and the Ombudsman, with the aim of proposing a 
possible external control mechanism and paving the way to setting it up. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>75. Another problem is that human rights defenders do not have access to detention centres 
and police stations. This is a serious obstacle that prevents defenders from fully performing their 
monitoring and protection role.  The Government has assured the Special Representative that the 
OSCE initiative will alleviate the problem of access to police stations for defenders. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>76. As regards police stations, the Minister of Interior referred to legal obstacles, namely the 
limitations provided for by the Law on Classified Information, which prevents the access of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders to police stations. Only the Ombudsman can access police stations. 
 
</p>
<p>77. As regards detention centres, which are under the responsibility of the Ministry of 
Justice, defenders stated that they are either denied access or have difficulty in getting 
permission to visit detention centres. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>E. The judiciary</b> 
 
</p>
<p>78. The Law on the Independent Court Budget was adopted in September 2003 and entered 
</p>
<p>into force in January 2004. The law provides for the judiciary to prepare and execute its own 
budget. It has therefore improved the independence of the judiciary. However, representatives of 
the judiciary pointed to the need to further amend the law to improve the independence of the 
judiciary. 
 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 31 
</p>
<p>the Government on the amendment of some laws on judicial proceedings. These amendments 
have shown some progress in reducing the duration of judicial proceedings between 2005 and 
2006. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>80. Another concern is the non-application to domestic jurisdiction of the Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe and of the 
</p>
<p>decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.18 
 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Representative recalls that an independent judiciary open to human rights 
concerns and protective of the right to defend human rights is a determining factor in ensuring an 
enabling environment for defenders. For instance, rights like freedom of expression, peaceful 
assembly and association, are important for the work of defenders. The Constitutional Court 
plays a fundamental role in interpreting these rights in a manner that is protective of human 
rights activities and of defenders exercising these rights in their work. An independent judiciary 
open to human rights also means a judiciary which proactively takes measures to facilitate the 
use of the judicial system by defenders for the protection and promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>F. The Ombudsman</b> 
 
</p>
<p>82. The law strengthening the Office of the Ombudsman was adopted in 2003. The law 
strengthened the inspection functions of the Ombudsman. For instance, he or she can undertake 
unannounced visits to police stations. Despite improvements in the investigative functions of the 
Ombudsman, its mandate is not considered in compliance with the Paris Principles for national 
human rights institutions. Concerns regarding the limited scope of the mandate and its 
independence persist. 
 
</p>
<p>83. The cooperation of public authorities with the institution also continues to be a concern. 
&#8220;During 2006 a positive trend was noted in the cooperation with the Ombudsman, but the 
obstruction of its work from certain bodies of the State continued&#8221;, reported the Ombudsman.19 
Some improvements were brought about by the introduction of reporting obligations established 
by the Government in 2005. All Governmental authorities are requested to submit quarterly 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 32 
reports on how they collaborate with and respond to the requests of the Ombudsman and justify 
failure to collaborate with his Office. The Ombudsman acknowledged some improvements in the 
responsiveness of Governmental authorities after the introduction of the quarterly reports. 
Nevertheless, he pointed to the poor quality of many responses and the need for improvement in 
this area. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>84. The collaboration of the police with the Ombudsman also needs improvement. The 
Ministry of Interior issued circulars instructing the police to collaborate with the Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>This yielded results but more efforts are still needed to have a fully cooperative police force. 
 
</p>
<p>85. Another area that needs improvement is the awareness of local authorities of the role and 
functions of the Ombudsman. The six regional offices of the Ombudsman facilitate access to the 
institution at the local level but they need more visibility, including and especially among local 
authorities, to perform their functions effectively. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Representative welcomes the support provided by international 
organizations, such as OSCE and OHCHR, to the Office of the Ombudsman, particularly in the 
area of capacity-building. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>G. The international community</b> 
 
</p>
<p>87. The international community continues to play a fundamental role in the country, both 
financially and in influencing policies and decision-making at the political level. As already 
mentioned, the EU has gained prominence, as membership is a high priority. 
 
</p>
<p>88. This influence has resulted in some positive measures in the short term. However, a 
commitment of State institutions to continue and sustain the improvement in the environment for 
the protection and promotion of human rights would be a more dependable guarantee. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>89. The Special Representative welcomes the establishment of the Civil Society Advisory 
Board within the United Nations Country Team as a space for civil society to meet and interact 
with the United Nations in a regular and institutionalized manner. The Advisory Board is meant 
to provide a forum to discuss, propose and evaluate United Nations policies at the country level. 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative suggests discussing possible actions to promote the implementation </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4

</p>
<p>of the Declaration on human rights defenders and to follow up the recommendations of this 
report. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Representative recognizes a considerable number of positive 
developments since her first visit. The most remarkable is the increased capacity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>professionalism of human rights defenders, although human rights organizations still do 
not form a community in a position to protect defenders. 
 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Another area of major progress has been in legislation, with the adoption of several 
laws relevant to the work of human rights defenders, including the law strengthening the 
inspection functions of the Ombudsperson; the law on free access to public information; 
the abolition of prison sentences for the offence of defamation; the law on an independent 
court budget, among others. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>While progress can be registered on the adoption of new laws, the implementation of 
these laws is often not satisfactory. Enforcing and monitoring mechanisms that defenders 
can use to report cases of non-compliance and protect affected victims are still lacking, are 
insufficient or do not function properly. This has created an environment in which 
Government responsiveness is limited or absent. 
 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Representative recognizes that the international community has played 
an important role in strengthening human rights defenders in the country, both in funding 
their projects and in building their capacity. The lobbying and advocacy efforts of human 
rights defenders have often been more successful when backed by international 
organizations. The current trend of reducing funds for civil society organizations is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>concern. The Special Representative firmly believes that support to civil society 
organizations by foreign donors is essential even if the Government&#8217;s capacity to extend 
grants to NGOs is increased. 
 </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 34 
<b>Recommendations for the consideration of the Government 
 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Institutionalize interaction and consultation processes with civil society in drafting 
legislation and policies, in reporting to international human rights mechanisms, and in 
other relevant areas of Government action. The Strategy for Government Cooperation 
with the Civil Society Sector can provide an appropriate framework for such cooperation 
provided its application is extended to local authorities and the Parliament. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Establish enforcement and monitoring mechanisms that defenders can use to report 
non-compliance with legislation and human rights abuses. Among those mechanisms, an 
external oversight mechanism to investigate abuses committed by the police should be 
established and the Commission in charge of monitoring the implementation of the law on 
access to information should be reinvigorated. Ensure that complaints on abuses 
committed by the Alfi Unit of the police can be independently investigated, including by the 
Ombudsman. Monitoring mechanisms should be established and accessible at the local 
level. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Remove the legal and administrative constraints that prevent human rights defenders 
from accessing detention centres and police stations and ensure that such access is given. 
 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Ensure tax exemption for voluntary organizations and expedite the legal and 
procedural requirements for this purpose. 
 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Take the appropriate measures to ensure that freedom of association of trade unions 
in the private sector is respected, so that activities for the promotion of labour rights are 
</b></p>
<p><b>protected. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations for the consideration of human rights defenders 
 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Develop and strengthen initiatives aimed at forming a human rights community able 
to voice the positions of human rights defenders more forcefully and act as a protection 
network for defenders. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.4 
Page 35 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Improve strategies to work with the media to increase media understanding of and 
reporting on human rights and the work of defenders. 
 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Consider the implementation and strengthening of measures aimed at improving the 
transparency and accountability of civil society organizations in order to build public 
confidence and to ensure that the human rights agenda remains relevant to the problems 
</b></p>
<p><b>faced by the population. 
 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Strengthen human rights work with a multi-ethnic dimension. This will contribute to 
overcoming deeply rooted discriminatory practices along ethnic lines and will strengthen 
the reconciliation process. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to the international community 
 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Accompany the transition process until the end and continue supporting human 
rights defenders, both in terms of funding and capacity-building. This should be done while 
</b></p>
<p><b>respecting the independence of defenders in determining their priorities and strategies and 
preserving their role of monitoring State institutions. 
 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>In assessing the country&#8217;s compliance with human rights requirements, such as those 
needed to access the EU, use indicators that go beyond superficial changes. For instance, in 
the case of legislation, it is not enough to just adopt laws more conducive to the work of 
human rights defenders, but also to demonstrate effective implementation.
