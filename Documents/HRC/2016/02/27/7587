</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to resolution 17/4, The Working Group on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises is mandated by the Human Rights 
Council to conduct country visits. At the invitation of the Government, it conducted an 
official visit to the United States of America from 22 April to 1 May 2013. 
</p>
<p>2. Taking account of the size and complexity of the political and legal landscape of the 
United States, the Working Group selected certain policy themes and sectors to be the focus 
of the visit: 
</p>
<p>(a) Implementation by the federal Government of the Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations &#8216;Protect, Respect and 
Remedy&#8217; Framework (the Guiding Principles), including legal and policy measures to 
ensure business respect for human rights and access to effective remedy; 
</p>
<p>(b) Issues relating to respect for internationally recognized labour standards, 
including in the context of low-wage and migrant workers in the agricultural supply chain 
and in the services sector; 
</p>
<p>(c) Issues relating to indigenous peoples in the context of business activities; 
(d) Challenges, gaps, opportunities and good practices in implementing the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles for businesses operating in particular contexts and in particular sectors 
such as the extractive, finance and information and communications technology (ICT) 
sectors. 
</p>
<p>3. The 10-day visit was carried out by the following members of the Working Group: 
Michael K. Addo and Puvan Selvanathan. Meetings were held in Washington D.C., 
Arizona, California, Florida, New York and West Virginia. The Working Group thanks the 
Government of the United States for the invitation to visit and for facilitating and 
coordinating activities throughout. It also thanks to all the organizations, individuals and 
groups that contributed variously to the success of the visit.  
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group met officials from the Department of State, the Department of 
Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the 
Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 
the United States Agency for International Development, the Department of the Treasury, 
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank of the United States 
(Ex-Im Bank) and the Office of Management and Budget.1 The Working Group also met 
officials of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the United States Congress and 
of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group also met representatives of civil society, including trade unions, 
employer organizations and professional organizations, and a wide range of civil society 
groups and academic institutions throughout the visit. In addition, two consultations were 
organized by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and one with a wide range of 
companies was organized by the United Nations Global Compact Office and BSR. 
Meetings were also held with companies in the banking sector, the information and 
communications technology sector and with socially responsible investors. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 In addition, the Working Group received written information from the Environmental Protection 
</p>
<p>Agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>

</b></p>
<p>6. In San Francisco, the Working Group met officials from the city and county 
Governments of San Francisco. In Los Angeles, the Working Group met labour rights 
experts and workers in the carwash and hotel industries. In Flagstaff, the Working Group 
met Native American representatives at a meeting hosted by the Navajo Nation Human 
Rights Commission. In Immokalee, the Working Group met civil society representatives 
and companies growing and buying tomatoes through the Fair Food Program and visited 
tomato farms to meet workers and managers. In Charleston, the Working Group met 
officials from the West Virginia Environmental Protection Agency, representatives of 
industry organizations and NGOs and residents of Lindytown. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b>7. The United States is a federal State with a multilayered, multifaceted legal and 
political system governing a business community with local and global influence and 
operations. Regulations in key areas, such as environmental and labour law, involve both 
federal and state institutions in their implementation, making efforts to implement the 
Guiding Principles complex. The country scores comparatively well in international 
rankings relating to rule of law2 and absence of corruption.3 
</p>
<p>8. The United States is party to three core international human rights treaties4 and has 
signed but not ratified a further four treaties.5 It was reviewed at the ninth session of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review in 2010. It has ratified two of the eight 
fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization.6 In 2011, it co-
sponsored resolution 17/4, by which the Human Rights Council endorsed the Guiding 
Principles.  
</p>
<p>9. The Working Group was encouraged by the support of the United States Council for 
International Business for the Guiding Principles and welcomes the fact that some United 
States multinational enterprises recognize the value of embarking on a process for 
implementation of the Principles. However, it was also evident that large segments of the 
United States business community appear to have limited awareness or understanding of 
internationally recognized human rights and of the standards and processes contained in the 
Guiding Principles. Lack of awareness of the Principles may be explained by the fact they 
were only endorsed in 2011, however the Working Group encountered suspicion, and even 
outright rejection, of important elements of the human rights framework on the part of some 
business groups, particularly in relation to labour rights.

 The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The United States has ratified the Optional 
Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed 
conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, although it is not a party 
to the Convention, which it has signed but not ratified.

<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>10. Civil society in the United States is vibrant, with NGOs, trade unions, multi-
stakeholder initiatives and professional associations, such as the American Bar Association, 
working proactively on issues relating to business impacts on human rights, both within the 
United States and in relation to United States companies operating abroad. Many 
organizations provided information to the Working Group during the visit.7 
</p>
<p>11. The views of various stakeholders, including the Government, often diverge on 
issues of business and human rights, particularly those concerning labour. Multi-
stakeholder initiatives provide space for social dialogue upon specific themes and within 
sectors to discuss business and human rights issues.8  
</p>
<p><b> III. Government regulatory and policy approach 
</b>12. In April 2013, the Government of the United States published a policy document 
entitled &#8220;U.S Government Approach on Business and Human Rights&#8221;.9 That document and 
the ongoing actions of the Government in support of the Guiding Principles demonstrate the 
commitment of the Government to the  Principles, an official position evidenced throughout 
the visit. 
</p>
<p>13. The document suggests that the primary focus of the Government is the external 
implications of United States corporate activities and support for business diplomacy in 
promoting foreign policy objectives, including the respect for labour and human rights; 
partnering with business to undertake projects of mutual interest; and also the promotion of 
the rule of law and respect for human rights through multilateral and bilateral collaboration. 
The Working Group notes the value of some of the initiatives highlighted in the policy and 
their correspondence with some of the objectives of the Guiding Principles. 
</p><p>14. The Working Group supports and commends the Government of the United States 
for taking important regulatory and policy initiatives aimed at preventing potentially 
adverse impacts of United States companies when they operate abroad.  
</p>
<p>15. However, the Working Group notes that the scope of the document on the approach 
of the Government to business and human rights remains limited. It seems that the 
Government needs to undertake a rigorous and comprehensive review of the current legal 
and policy environment for businesses, to ensure that they are capable of meeting the 
expectations of the Guiding Principles at home and abroad, for example in the area of 
labour laws and access to effective remedy.

</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Achieving policy coherence 
</b></p>
<p>16. Policy coherence is a key element of pillar 1 of the Guiding Principles, which states 
that the State should ensure that the various government departments and agencies &#8220;that 
shape business practices are aware of and observe the State&#8217;s human rights obligations 
when fulfilling their respective mandates&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p>17. During extensive briefings by a broad range of federal government agencies, the 
Working Group received information about multiple regulatory and policy initiatives by 
different federal and other authorities aimed at protecting persons from the potential or 
actual human rights impacts of business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>18. While fully acknowledging the challenges of pursuing a more comprehensive 
approach to implementation of the Guiding Principles across many different government 
entities, the Working Group considers it imperative for the Government of the United 
States to undertake an assessment of the current state of overall policy coherence and 
coordination between Government entities,11 the effectiveness of the measures undertaken, 
identification of good practices and gaps12 and challenges in the protection of rights and 
access to remedy. Such an analysis could contribute to a wider national action plan to 
implement the Guiding Principles.13 
</p>
<p><b> B. Transparency and reporting 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Guiding Principles emphasize the importance of communication by businesses 
as to how they address their human rights impacts, particularly where the nature of their 
business operations or operating contexts pose a significant risk to human rights.14 
</p>
<p>20. The Government of the United States has developed a series of legal and policy 
measures to increase transparency and reporting by companies in relation to their potential 
and actual human rights impacts through initiatives such as the responsible investment 
reporting requirements for investments in Burma, which reference the Guiding Principles, 
and section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for 
companies in the oil, natural gas or minerals sectors, which requires them to disclose the 
type and amount of payments made to foreign Governments in connection with the 
development of those natural resources. The Government has also given its support and 
committed to implementing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a multi-
stakeholder initiative to promote revenue transparency and accountability in the extractive 
sector including by maintaining the EITI standard.  
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group welcomes the efforts of the United States to increase 
transparency with regard to due diligence on human rights and payments to Governments 
by companies, although civil society organizations have raised concerns that a focus on

<p> 
</p>
<p>10
 A/HRC/17/31, annex, guiding principle 8. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11
 Such an assessment could form part of a baseline study on the effective implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles by the United States. 
 
</p>
<p>12
 Some of those gaps are explored in subsequent sections of the report but that is not an exhaustive list, 
</p>
<p>hence the need for a comprehensive analysis.

</p>
<p>reporting with no consequences for those that do not report could have a limited impact in 
terms of preventing human rights abuse.  
</p>
<p>22. The Working Group recommends that the Government ensure that reports submitted 
under transparency and reporting schemes include information as to how the submitting 
companies have addressed human rights risks. For legitimacy and effectiveness, it also 
recommends meaningful consequences for companies who do not fulfil reporting 
obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights risks in conflict-affected areas 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Guiding Principles offer guidance to States on how to ensure that business 
enterprises operating in conflict-affected areas are not involved in human rights abuses.15  
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group noted the attention paid by the Government and stakeholders to 
section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on 
conflict minerals. That provision requires companies to determine whether conflict minerals 
used in their products are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining 
countries and if so, requires companies to conduct due diligence measures to determine 
whether the minerals financed or benefited armed groups before they can describe their 
products as &#8220;DRC conflict free.&#8221; The aim is to avoid financing armed groups from the 
proceeds of minerals extraction. 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group welcomes the efforts to avoid corporate involvement in human 
rights abuses linked to conflict and recognizes that due diligence requirements, such as that 
contained in section 1502, can play an important role in preventing trade in minerals from 
fuelling conflict and gross human rights abuses. The Working Group notes concerns from 
some business enterprises that carrying out such due diligence will be onerous, but stresses 
that greater transparency and accountability in the sourcing of minerals that may be linked 
to human rights violations and abuses can be important in limiting the revenue streams of 
the violators and abusers.  
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group received information about the support of the Government for 
the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade, a public-private partnership 
that complements section 1502. The Working Group would welcome further information 
about the implementation of this initiative. 
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group also received information that several United States companies 
using minerals have signed up to the Conflict-Free Smelter Program, an audit which assists 
companies to identify smelters or refiners that can demonstrate that the materials they 
process are from conflict-free sources. 
</p>
<p>28. The issue of private security providers came up frequently in discussions concerning 
conflict. The Government of the United States is a participant in the initiative on Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights, which aims to guide extractive companies in 
conducting risk assessments and engagement with public and private security providers in a 
way that respects human rights. The Working Group notes efforts by the United States to 
increase accountability with respect to implementation of the Voluntary Principles, enhance 
their implementation on the ground and increase transparency within the initiative, 
reflecting concerns that have been raised by civil society. The Government has also 
supported the development of the International Code of Conduct (ICoC) for Private 
Security Service Providers and is a founding member of the ICoC Association, a multi-
</p>

</b></p>
<p>stakeholder independent governance and oversight mechanism that aims to certify and 
monitor private security providers and provide a complaints procedure. The Working 
Group welcomes the support of the Government for the code of conduct and the fact that 
the Department of State has stated its intention of requiring membership in the Association 
for entities wishing to bid for government contracts.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The State-business nexus 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Government of the United States provides financing support for companies, 
including through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Ex-Im Bank. The 
Working Group notes that the Corporation&#8217;s environmental and social policy statement 
draws on the performance standards on social and environmental sustainability of the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC). Additionally, the Corporation&#8217;s Office of 
Accountability can receive complaints in relation to the environmental or social impacts of 
projects supported by it. The Working Group also notes that since 2010 the Corporation 
requires projects to establish grievance mechanisms for workers and affected communities.  
</p><p>30. The Working Group welcomes such steps to ensure that the United States promotes 
and requires respect for human rights when supporting or conducting commercial 
transactions with business enterprises. The Working Group also welcomes the 
incorporation of the IFC performance standards, reflecting important elements of the 
Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>31. However, the Working Group heard allegations that the procedures of the 
Corporation&#8217;s Office of Accountability and their implementation might not be fully 
consistent with the criteria for an effective grievance mechanism under guiding principle 31 
and recommends that a review be undertaken to address any inconsistencies.  
</p>
<p>32. The Working Group notes and welcomes the recent adoption by Ex-Im Bank of 
policies relating to the impact of financed operations,16 including the adoption of the IFC 
performance standards, the Equator Principles and the stated alignment with the Common 
Approaches for Officially Supported Export Credits and Environmental and Social Due 
Diligence of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),17 
which references the Guiding Principles. The Working Group notes concerns raised by civil 
society about the ability of impacted communities to hold Ex-Im Bank accountable for 
adherence to these standards.18  
</p>
<p><b> E. Advancing the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
through other policy frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>33. As part of its activities within OECD, the Working Group considers that the national 
contact point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises has the potential to 
play an important role, including in mediating specific instances, but is concerned about the 
limited resources available to the contact point to fulfil its important functions. The 
Working Group also notes the concerns expressed by some civil society organizations and

</p>
<p>their recommendations to strengthen the specific instance process further,19 and encourages 
the United States to consider those recommendations, including the incorporation of best 
practices from the specific instances procedures of other OECD national contact points, 
including as regards transparency and making findings of fact. 
</p>
<p><b> F. The role of Congress 
</b></p>
<p>34. The United States Congress has long addressed issues of the impact of business on 
human rights, including in recent years, through the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
and the  Dodd-Frank Act. Congress and the Senate can play an important role in raising 
awareness of the Guiding Principles and in promoting policy coherence regarding different 
initiatives related to business impacts on human rights, both within the United States and by  
companies domiciled in the United States operating abroad. 
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group encourages both chambers to increase awareness of the Guiding 
Principles among lawmakers and to consider what further legislative action may be 
required to address remaining gaps and challenges in their implementation.  
</p>
<p>36. As a first step, the Working Group considers that the Tom Lantos Human Rights 
Commission would be well placed to hold a hearing on the Guiding Principles. This might 
focus on how the Government could further integrate the Principles into the activities of its 
various agencies, particularly the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the 
Department of Commerce, and the Department of the Treasury.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Labour 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International labour standards and the United States 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Guiding Principles stipulate that States have a duty to protect against human 
rights abuses by business and companies have a responsibility to respect human rights as 
expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles concerning 
fundamental rights set out in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work.20 
</p>
<p>38. Whilst the United States has not ratified all core ILO conventions, it is a member of 
ILO and has an obligation to respect, promote and realize the principles concerning the 
fundamental rights enshrined in the Declaration and its follow-up concerning freedom of 
association and effective recognition of the right to bargain collectively; prohibition of 
forced labour and child labour; and non-discrimination in employment. The Government of 
the United States has committed to protecting and respecting those rights and has detailed 
constitutional provisions, laws and policies that protect labour rights in its annual reports to 
ILO. 
</p>
<p>39. Nevertheless, ILO bodies have raised some concerns with regards to gaps between 
existing United States laws and practices and the rights enshrined in the Declaration and 
fundamental conventions, as well as other conventions ratified by the United States.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/25/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Unfair practices and low-wage labour issues  
</b></p>
<p>40. During the visit, the Working Group encountered allegations of unfair labour 
practices relating to the exercise of freedom of association and other core labour rights, 
previously raised with the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association.21 
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group notes with concern that public sector employees at the state and 
federal levels, agricultural workers and domestic workers are excluded from the protection 
offered by the National Labor Relations Act and that the protection provided by other 
federal and state legislation is more limited and often does not include the right to form a 
trade union and to bargain collectively. 
</p>
<p>42. Other allegations presented to the Working Group included the use of permanent 
replacements for workers exercising their legal right to strike; the denial of access to the 
workplace for union representatives; the denial for public workers and supervisors of the 
right to form trade unions and bargain collectively (outside the narrow exceptions allowed 
for by the right to freedom of association); the widespread denial in practice of adequate 
protection and remedies for undocumented immigrant workers, who risk intimidation and 
dismissal for seeking to join a trade union. 
</p><p>43. The Working Group also received allegations of abusive labour practices in low-
wage industries with a high presence of migrant workers, many undocumented, such as the 
carwash and hotel industries and the agricultural sector, which would be illegal under 
United States laws and violate international labour standards.22 They included paying 
workers less than the statutory minimum wage, non-payment of wages and chronic 
disregard for minimum health and safety measures, including rest breaks or providing 
workers with safety equipment, leading to accidents and injuries for workers. 
44. In this regard, the Working Group welcomes recent efforts by the Departments of 
Labor and Justice to ensure that migrant workers are aware of their labour rights and that 
these are effectively protected. This complements the work of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, which is charged with enforcing non-discrimination statutes and 
receiving complaints of alleged discrimination in the private or public sector, as well as 
providing guidance to employers and employees. The Working Group was also informed of 
some new and innovative initiatives by the Government, trade unions and employers to 
address some of these concerns, some undertaken jointly, and would welcome further 
information on their implementation.23 
</p>
<p>45. The overall sense from the visit was that the scale of current initiatives was 
insufficient, including in terms of allocated resources, to effectively address the widespread 
nature of violations in low-wage sectors, particularly sectors with a significant presence of 
undocumented migrant workers. Furthermore, the information received indicates that in 
low-wage sectors, the legal and regulatory framework may generally present insufficient

<p>deterrents to illegal behaviour, too many loopholes for employers wishing to avoid 
compliance and insufficient incentives for companies to behave responsibly with 
subcontractors or in a supply chain.  
</p>
<p>46. The situation is compounded by the apparent disregard, by at least some of the 
companies in the low-wage sectors, of the corporate responsibility to respect human rights 
that applies to all industry sectors, irrespective of whether the State is meetings its own duty 
to protect through effective policies and regulations.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Anti-trafficking initiatives  
</b></p>
<p>47. The Working Group was informed about a range of efforts undertaken by the United 
States to combat and address human trafficking, both within and outside the country, 
through legislation24 and coordinated action through the President&#8217;s Interagency Task Force 
to Monitor and Combat Trafficking.  
</p>
<p>48. In particular, the Working Group was encouraged by Executive Order 13627 of 
September 2012 on strengthening protections against trafficking in persons in federal 
contracts, which establishes specific requirements for federal contractors and 
subcontractors to prevent trafficking in persons in government contracts. The Working 
Group notes the considerable efforts that will now be required to implement it, including 
through raising awareness and building the capacity of contractors to comply with the new 
regulation, as well as ensuring its enforcement.  
</p>
<p>49. At the same time, the Working Group received reports that despite those efforts, 
human trafficking occurs within the United States, including some allegations of trafficking 
within guest worker programmes. The Working Group encourages the United States to 
continue and expand its efforts in this area, in collaboration with business and civil society 
organizations, and to share its experience of coordinated action with other countries. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Initiatives against child labour 
</b></p>
<p>50. The United States has ratified ILO Convention No. 182 (1999) concerning the 
Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child 
Labour25 and child labour in the United States is regulated by several federal26 and state 
statutes. During the country visit, the Working Group was informed of initiatives by the 
Departments of Labor and Agriculture to reduce child labour in the United States and 
abroad. These included developing and funding programmes to support foreign 
Governments and companies in tackling child labour, including assisting them to carry out 
risk assessments and due diligence on labour rights in their supply chain.27 The Department 
of Labor has also produced a toolkit for business to ensure that a company&#8217;s goods and the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>24
 The key statute is the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. The United States has also 
</p>
<p>ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and 
Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25
 It has not, however, ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, nor the ILO Minimum Age 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1973 (No. 138) concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment. 
 
</p>
<p>26
 Inter alia, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Victims of 
</p>
<p>Trafficking and Violence Protection Act, executive order 13126 on the Prohibition of Acquisition of 
Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor, the 2008 Farm Bill, and other statutes and 
provisions of the constitution.

<p>raw materials that it uses are not made by child labour or forced labour.28 Similarly, in 
2012, it published a set of voluntary recommendations for agricultural companies to combat 
child and forced labour in their supply chains,29 although to date the extent of their uptake 
by industry remains unclear.  
</p>
<p>51. The Working Group welcomes these and other efforts to provide guidance and 
support to companies and their partners on how to ensure respect for the rights of children. 
However, the Working Group notes that significant concerns remain with regard to 
hazardous and dangerous conditions of work for children aged less than 18 and even 16 in 
the agricultural sector. The Working Group received information indicating that accident 
and death rates among children employed in the agricultural sector far exceeded similar 
rates for children employed in other sectors, further noting that children are permitted in 
agriculture to carry out certain hazardous activities that are prohibited in other sectors and 
that they are excluded from federal protection with regard to the minimum age and hours of 
work limitations.30  
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group also received information on violations of the limited protection 
available to children and information that negative impacts on the rights of children 
disproportionately affected the children of migrants. The Working Group notes prior 
concerns expressed with regard to child labour in the United States agricultural sector by 
ILO31 and the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/OPSC/USA/CO/2 paras. 25 
and 26), and recommends that the Government and companies in the agricultural sector 
address such concerns as a matter of priority so as to ensure that the rights of children are 
effectively protected in the context of agricultural business activities. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Labour rights in supply chains  
</b></p>
<p>53. The Government of the United States and United States companies participate in 
several voluntary multi-stakeholder initiatives that address labour rights. The United States 
is a partner of the joint ILO and IFC Better Work programme, which aims to improve 
effective protection of labour rights and access to remedy for garment sector workers, in 
alignment with the ILO core labour standards that underpin the Guiding Principles. The 
Working Group notes that some stakeholders have suggested that the Better Work 
programme should be further strengthened, in particular with regard to access to remedy for

<p>workers in cases of violations of labour rights, ensuring effective exercise of freedom of 
association and strengthening monitoring and transparency.32 
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group met with and noted the work and activities of the Fair Labor 
Association. The Working Group notes allegations by some stakeholders of weaknesses in 
the procedures of the Association and its effectiveness in detecting violations of labour 
rights, particularly the right to freedom of association, and of the lack of a grievance 
mechanism to allow workers effective access to remedy when its policies are not 
observed.33 In this regard, the Working Group welcomes the initiative by the Association to 
review the implications of the Guiding Principles for its work.34 
</p>
<p>55. As an example of a new, innovative initiative to address labour rights issues in a 
supply chain within the United States, the Working Group was impressed with efforts to 
strengthen the protection of workers in the tomato-growing sector through the Fair Food 
Program, which is a groundbreaking model for promoting labour rights based on a 
partnership between farmworkers, Florida tomato growers and participating buyers. Under 
the programme, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers conducts worker education sessions, 
held &#8220;on the farm&#8221; and &#8220;on the clock&#8221;, on the labour rights set forth in the Fair Food code 
of conduct, which requires compliance with all applicable laws and provides for labour 
rights which go beyond existing legal requirements. 
</p>
<p>56. The Fair Food Standards Council is a third-party monitor created to ensure 
compliance with the Fair Food Program, which conducts regular audits and carries out  
investigations into complaints and their resolution. The Fair Food agreements &#8211; between the 
Coalition and retailers, and the Coalition and growers &#8211; are legally enforceable by the 
Coalition. 
</p>
<p>57. While the Working Group reiterates that the ultimate responsibility remains with the 
Government to ensure that rights, including labour rights, are protected and that there is 
access to effective remedy for any adverse impacts, in the absence or failure of those State 
mechanisms, the Fair Food Program provides a model of a market-based approach to the 
protection of human rights in corporate supply chains that ensures a substantive role for the 
rights holders themselves in the monitoring and enforcement of their own rights.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Access to remedy 
</b></p>
<p>58. The third pillar of the Guiding Principles concerns access to remedy. The Working 
Group notes the limited references to access to remedy in the document on the Government 
approach to business and human rights referred to in paragraph 12 above, suggesting &#8211; 
perhaps mistakenly &#8211; that insufficient priority is attached to the third pillar. 
</p>
<p>59. The most common method of seeking redress for those whose rights may have been 
impacted by business activities is through civil law suits grounded in tort law, property law, 
or specific legislation at the state or federal level. Such legislation may often empower

<p>different executive or administrative agencies to provide remedies for violations and abuses 
of human rights.35 
</p>
<p>60. There is no single federal ombudsperson in the United States. However, several 
federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Homeland 
Security, Department of Education, Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and 
Drug Administration all house ombudspersons addressing specific issues and often acting 
as the link between private citizens and corporations.  
</p>
<p>61. The document on the Government approach to business and human rights refers to 
the national contact point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and states 
that it offers a recourse mechanism and forum for confidential discussion between business 
and stakeholders on issues related to the Guidelines.36 The Working Group nevertheless 
received allegations that the national contact point falls short of its purpose of providing an 
effective way of resolving specific issues. In particular, the Working Group notes calls from 
civil society organizations that the national contact point should be empowered to make 
findings of fact and draw conclusions as to whether the OECD Guidelines have been 
breached, as is the case for some other national contact points.37 The Working Group 
supports this call. 
</p>
<p>62. Civil society organizations stressed the need to strengthen access to remedies for 
human rights abuses linked to United States business activities, both within and outside the 
country.38 The Working Group received information about legal and practical barriers to 
access to remedy and heard complaints that the United States has not ensured that victims 
have access to judicial remedies for human rights abuses that have arisen extraterritorially 
owing to the activities of United States businesses or their subsidiaries. 
</p>
<p>63. Much of the debate over judicial remedies in the United States has focused on the 
Alien Tort Statute.39 The visit of the Working Group took place just a few days after the 
United States Supreme Court had issued a ruling in <i>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</i>,40 
which was at the heart of much of the discussion about remedy during the visit. The full 
consequences of that decision will emerge over time.  
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group notes that the <i>Kiobel </i>decision notwithstanding, Congress and 
the Government can support appropriate and effective remedy of adverse impacts created 
by United States-based companies abroad using relevant laws and regulations. Where there 
are gaps, including regulatory gaps, or legal or practical barriers that prevent legitimate 
cases from being brought before the courts, appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that 
such gaps or barriers are addressed.

</p>
<p><b> VI. Issues in specific contexts 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Coal mining in West Virginia 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Working Group met with representatives of the coal mining industry, the state 
environmental regulator, civil society organizations and representatives of communities 
impacted by surface mining activities in Appalachia. The objectives were to look at the 
actual and potential impacts on human rights arising from a business activity with a 
significant physical footprint and to get perspectives from industry and the regulator on 
strategies to minimize the impact on communities. 
</p>
<p>66. Surface mining, or &#8220;mountaintop removal mining&#8221;, as those opposing the activity 
refer to it, is a deeply contested issue in West Virginia and beyond. The Working Group 
does not have a mandate to take a position for or against the practice and confines its 
interest as to whether actual or potential adverse human rights impacts are identified, 
prevented, mitigated and addressed.  
</p>
<p>67. Surface mining is regulated at both federal and state levels under the Surface Mining 
Control and Reclamation Act and the Clean Water Act, and the relevant West Virginia state 
laws respectively. The main federal regulatory agencies are the Environmental Protection 
Agency41 and the Army Corps of Engineers, with the West Virginia Department of 
Environmental Protection as the regulatory agency at the state level. At a meeting with the 
Working Group, officials of the Department outlined key elements of the consultative 
processes carried out in granting mining permits.42 The Working Group also received 
information about the functions of the environmental advocate.43 It notes the efforts of the 
Department to engage with and respond to community concerns related to surface mining.  
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group was informed that some of the communities most directly 
impacted by surface mining were isolated and economically marginalized. According to 
information received from both industry sources and community representatives, many 
coal-mining communities are deeply divided about the significance of surface mining and 
its impact. Community representatives emphasized that such divisions at times resulted in 
threats, intimidation and harassment of those activists seen as &#8220;anti-coal&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>69. In meetings with community representatives, the Working Group heard allegations 
of significant adverse human rights impacts arising from surface mining, most notably 
related to physical and mental health, including cancer and birth defects, and access to 
clean water. Other concerns raised included non-compliance with regulatory standards for 
access to information and for protection of local cemeteries, which is considered a core 
element of the cultural heritage by community representatives. Allegations were also made 
about a lack of adequate and timely consultation about planned permits.44  
</p>
<p>70. According to industry sources, coal companies in West Virginia recognize that there 
may be legitimate concerns about adverse impacts arising from surface mining activities, 
but are of the view that many allegations arise from a general environmental agenda against 
coal. Industry sources informed the Working Group of their efforts to engage with 
stakeholders and of their contributions to local communities, which could not take place 
with full transparency in case they attracted protests from those opposing surface mining.

<p>71. Some investors have been engaging critically on the issue of surface mining.45 The 
Working Group also heard from some financial institutions about the specific due diligence 
processes they engage in when dealing with companies involved in surface mining,46 
although such measures have been criticized as being insufficient by some civil society 
groups.47 
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group notes with concern the serious nature of the alleged adverse 
impacts, including impacts on health and water quality and the intimidation of those 
exercising their rights to express opposition to surface mining. It urges the responsible 
authorities to investigate and address such impacts, including through timely and 
comprehensive consultations with affected communities, and through providing for 
effective remedy for those adversely impacted. It also recommends that coal companies 
ensure that they operate with respect for human rights, including by conducting due 
diligence on human rights in accordance with the Guiding Principles. The divisive nature of 
the issue and the strong opposition from some groups does not remove the responsibility to 
respect human rights, including through effective stakeholder engagement and establishing 
or participating in legitimate grievance mechanisms at the operational level. Coal 
companies should be able to demonstrate their efforts in this regard, even where such 
efforts have failed due to opposition and protest.  
</p>
<p><b> B. City government 
</b></p>
<p>73. Local county and municipal authorities also have powers to guide and regulate 
business conduct, including in labour-related issues. 
</p>
<p>74. The Working Group was encouraged by a number of initiatives implemented by the 
City of San Francisco to improve local labour conditions and establish non-discrimination 
requirements for businesses domiciled within the city. Those initiatives stipulated that there 
should be human and labour rights provisions in city procurement contracts and encouraged 
business to engage with local communities and support human rights initiatives in urban 
rejuvenation programmes. 
</p><p>75. However, San Francisco continues to face challenges in implementing, monitoring 
compliance with and enforcing some of the regulations. City officials noted that in certain 
instances the value of some contracts was simply too small to compel compliance from 
suppliers, who then chose instead to forgo doing business with the city. One strategy being 
attempted to overcome this was the Sweatfree Purchasing Consortium,48 an aggregated 
buying scheme whereby neighbouring cities and states collectively established minimum 
procurement criteria. This both increased contract leverage and enhanced the capacity to 
monitor and enforce compliance. 
</p>
<p>76. The Working Group would encourage other counties and municipalities to consider 
implementing and sharing learning on such initiatives, especially on policy coherence 
across departments that engage with contractors and other businesses. Initiatives may

<p><b> C. Business impacts and Native Americans  
</b></p>
<p>77. In 2010, the United States declared support for the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.49 The Working Group draws attention to the 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, who 
visited the United States in 2012, (A/HRC/21/47/Add.1) and those of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination with respect to business impacts on indigenous 
peoples (CERD/C/USA/CO/6). 
</p><p>78. The Working Group held meetings in Washington, D.C. and Arizona with 
representatives of indigenous peoples, who highlighted the adverse impacts on indigenous 
peoples from past and present business activities, in particular the extractive industries. In 
submissions to the Working Group, the National Congress of American Indians, the 
International Indian Treaty Council, the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission, and the 
San Carlos Apache Tribe noted impacts on the environment, land and water and on sites of 
economic, cultural and religious significance to Native Americans, leading to displacement, 
and adverse impacts on, inter alia, the rights of individuals to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of health; to an adequate standard of living, including food; to safe 
drinking water and sanitation; and to the right of self-determination for indigenous peoples. 
Native American representatives further highlighted the imperative that federal authorities 
consult with Native American Governments when taking decisions in relation to business 
activities that may impact on indigenous peoples and welcomed recent federal Government 
initiatives in this regard. However, they also highlighted continuing obstacles to ensuring 
effective protection by state authorities from present potential impacts and to accessing 
effective remedy for past impacts. 
</p>
<p>79. The Working Group received information from extractive companies based in the 
United States on initiatives they had taken to carry out due diligence in accordance with the 
Guiding Principles.50 The Working Group welcomes such efforts, which should take place 
in close coordination and consultation with indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>80. The Working Group draws attention to its thematic report on addressing the adverse 
impacts of business-related activities on the rights of indigenous peoples through the lens of 
the Guiding Principles (A/68/279), in which it makes recommendations to both 
Governments and business enterprises that are relevant to the United States.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Issues specific to particular sectors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The financial sector 
</b></p>
<p>81. The financial sector is an enabler of business activity, a gatekeeper of investment, an 
arbiter of economic risk and opportunity and a major business sector in itself. It has an 
</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>49
 See www.state.gov/documents/organization/184099.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>50
 The commentary to the Guiding Principles states that business enterprises should pay special attention 
</p>
<p>to any particular human rights impacts on individuals from groups or populations that may be at 
heightened risk of vulnerability or marginalization, such as indigenous peoples, and that they should 
seek to understand the concerns of potentially affected stakeholders by consulting them directly. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/25/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>important role in defining how and if businesses choose to address human rights. The 
Guiding Principles advise that the corporate responsibility to respect applies to financial 
institutions. Thus they have a responsibility to prevent and address the adverse impacts of 
their own activities, as well as to seek to prevent or mitigate impacts that are directly linked 
to their operations, products or services through their business relationships.51 This 
guidance is material to financial institutions whose business relationships with clients 
require them to provide financial and investment advice, including opinions and 
assessments of financial risks and opportunities, or to handle transactions on their behalf. 
</p>
<p>82. The Working Group met with a group representing banks and, separately, with a 
group of investors and civil society representatives to discuss the implementation of the 
Guiding Principles in the financial sector. The bankers informed the Working Group of 
ongoing efforts and initiatives relating to policies addressing social risks, such as the recent 
updating of the Equator Principles referencing the Guiding Principles for large-scale project 
finance. However, the bankers suggested that their leverage and ability to prevent adverse 
impacts was limited and their ability to raise human rights as a material factor depended on 
how finance was regulated in different countries. They also indicated that understanding 
how the Guiding Principles might be applied is evolving through initiatives such as the 
Finance Initiative of the United Nations Environment Programme, the Thun Group of 
Banks, the OECD Working Party on Responsible Business Conduct and the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 
</p>
<p>83. The group of investors and civil society organizations informed the Working Group 
that some investors actively used the Guiding Principles in their engagements with asset 
owners and that human rights issues informed their investment decisions. They also noted 
that the existing narrow definition of fiduciary duty made it difficult for asset managers to 
include human rights within an assessment of materiality. Others commented on what they 
perceived as systemic risks that investors should be aware of, for example issues relating to 
political disclosure and tax havens. Investors emphasized that human rights were not 
generally considered a business issue by many United States companies and that this was 
reflected in their own experience of engaging with the companies they invested in. Civil 
society organizations called for enhanced disclosure requirements that investors could then 
use in assessing companies, while appreciating that disclosure of actual human rights 
impacts was constrained by the risk of legal liability. 
</p>
<p>84. The Working Group welcomes the efforts of socially responsible investors to 
promote the implementation of the Guiding Principles and in using them as benchmarks in 
their analysis of company performance. The Working Group encourages the investment 
community to evolve further the definitions of fiduciary duties and push for their adoption 
by regulators, to enable better consideration of the opportunities and risks arising between 
business and human rights.

</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. The impact of the financial crisis 
</b></p>
<p>85. Since the onset of the global financial crisis, there has been a focus on the impact of 
the financial sector on the broader society, including its impacts on the enjoyment of human 
rights.52 
</p>
<p>86. The Working Group received information during the visit on how the activities of 
the financial sector leading up to and during the financial crisis impacted rights, in 
particular on adequate housing in the United States and on food security both within and 
outside the United States. Some stakeholders suggested that there was neither effective 
protection nor access to remedy for those impacted and pointed to an alleged failure of the 
regulators to prevent and mitigate human rights risks arising from reckless financial sector 
activities. 
</p>
<p>87. The Working Group is particularly concerned by information alleging a 
disproportionate impact of the crisis on the poor, on racial minorities and on women, 
particularly from minorities, and how predatory mortgage lending practices particularly 
targeted such groups and communities.53 Such concerns echo those raised by the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, during her visit to 
the United States in 2009 (A/HRC/13/20/Add.4) and in her reports on the impact of the 
financial crisis on adequate housing (A/HRC/10/7), and those raised by the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD/C/USA/CO/60). 
</p><p>88. The Working Group notes and welcomes the efforts by the United States and 
individual state attorneys general to investigate various aspects of lending by financial 
institutions in the context of the subprime mortgage crisis and the settlements reached with 
banks and other financial institutions that provide partial relief to borrowers who were 
negatively impacted by their actions.54 At the same time, the Working Group received 
allegations that relief was not reaching all those who had been affected and that in 
particular, minority households were the least likely to be receiving relief, despite being 
proportionately the worst affected. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Information and communications technology 
</b></p>
<p>89. The information and communications technology (ICT) sector is a significant driver 
of growth and productivity gains in other sectors of the United States economy. During its 
visit, the Working Group met separately with companies in the sector, civil society 
organizations and multi-stakeholder initiatives in relation to the corporate responsibility to 
respect human rights. Information and communications technology facilitates the sharing of 
ideas, permits the broadcasting of information and enables communication. Its platforms 
and software connect individuals, communities and societies both publicly and privately. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>52
 The impact of the financial crisis on human rights has been examined in detail by human rights 
</p>
<p>bodies. See, for example, A/HRC/13/38. 
 
</p>
<p>53
 See, for example, the submission of the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions to the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review of the United States, April 2010. 
 
</p>
<p>54

</p>
<p>reached with respect to other ongoing investigations. </p>

<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>How those technologies are used, or abused, has an impact on the rights to privacy, 
property and freedom of expression.55  
</p>
<p>90. The Working Group notes the concerns of stakeholders regarding surveillance by the 
Government of the United States. The responsibility of ICT companies to respect human 
rights under the Guiding Principles coexists with the need to comply with legal 
requirements for national security and countering terrorism if that entails providing access 
to private data.56 The Working Group notes that United States ICT companies operating 
abroad sometimes face requirements from Governments concerning surveillance, the 
removal or censorship of content, restrictions of network service or coverage and other 
demands that may not immediately be reconcilable with the duty of States to protect human 
rights, as prescribed by the Guiding Principles.57 
</p>
<p>91. The Working Group notes efforts by some United States ICT companies to ensure 
that they are able to disclose information on data requests with greater transparency, as well 
as efforts through multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as the Global Network Initiative, to 
establish common principles for managing government requests related to privacy and 
freedom of expression. The Working Group also welcomes efforts by the Global Network 
Initiative to review the alignment of its policies with the Guiding Principles and its stated 
intent to develop a mechanism for stakeholders wishing to raise concerns over the 
compliance of members of the Initiative with its principles. The Working Group further 
notes industry initiatives, such as the telecommunications industry dialogue on freedom of 
expression and privacy, and encourages the participation of United States 
telecommunications companies in this initiative.58  
</p>
<p>92. Other relevant human rights risks in the ICT sector relate to, inter alia, working 
conditions in manufacturing supply chains, impacts associated with alleged use of &#8220;conflict 
minerals&#8221; and impacts associated with the harmful effects of improperly handled electronic 
waste. The Working Group in this context acknowledges industry-led initiatives, such as 
the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, and recommends that the Coalition ensure 
that its code of conduct aligns with the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>93. The Working Group cautions that there are significant risks associated with United 
States companies selling surveillance technology to States if these are then used to violate 
human rights. The Working Group advises that where conflicts regarding access to data or 
application of technology arise, close consideration is given to the expected roles and 
responsibilities of respective State and business actors, as prescribed by the three pillars of 
the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>55
 The Working Group also refers to the report and recommendations on this subject of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
(A/HRC/23/40).

<p>

<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Working Group welcomes the political leadership of the Government of 
the United States in supporting and committing to the implementation of the Guiding 
Principles. The Working Group found that many government agencies are making 
notable efforts to address specific business-related human rights challenges.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Working Group also welcomes the efforts of the Government to set out its 
approach to business and human rights in the document released on the final day of 
its visit. However, given the gaps revealed in that document, as well as during 
testimonies and information provided to it in meetings with stakeholders during the 
visit, the Working Group considers it imperative that the Government embark upon a 
process aimed at developing a comprehensive national action plan for the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Working Group found that significant gaps remain in regulation, oversight 
and enforcement in some areas where business activities might adversely impact 
human rights. This was the case notably but not exclusively in the area of labour, such 
as the exclusion of workers in agriculture from protections afforded in other sectors 
through legislation such as the National Labor Relations Act. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Working Group was encouraged by the vibrant dialogue and multi-
stakeholder initiatives on a range of thematic and sectoral issues that it encountered 
and commends all stakeholders, including the Government, that participate in robust, 
constructive initiatives to ensure that rights are protected and respected in a business 
context. Nonetheless, the Working Group notes that while many such initiatives can 
play an important role in advancing respect for human rights, notably when they 
include strong and legitimate grievance and accountability mechanisms, the 
Government ultimately has the duty to protect against abuses.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Working Group notes that remedy for business related human rights 
abuse can come in many different forms: judicial, non-judicial or at the operational 
level. While remedy mechanisms are provided in selected policy areas and while the 
United States courts are still</b> <b>generally more accessible to victims than is the case in 
many other jurisdictions,</b>59<b> the Working Group is of the view that a comprehensive 
study of different remedial mechanisms and their effectiveness needs to be undertaken 
to allow for a more comprehensive implementation of the third pillar of the Guiding 
Principles. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>During the visit, the Working Group was encouraged by several encounters 
with business representatives fully committed to ensuring that they operate with 
respect for human rights. However, it was struck by the hostility, particularly with 
respect to labour rights, of many business representatives to the notion that business 
enterprises have distinct responsibilities with regard to human rights. The Working 
Group would like to reiterate that alongside the duty of the State to protect human 
rights, the Guiding Principles stipulate that companies should respect all 
internationally recognized human rights, as that term is defined in the Guiding 
Principles. The Guiding Principles also reaffirm the expectation that business 
complies with national law, but where the regulatory framework is either absent,

<p><b>insufficient or not enforced, business cannot assume that legal compliance alone is 
commensurate with meeting their responsibility to respect human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Working Group recognizes that business may be less familiar with human 
rights issues than Governments and civil society and that it may face challenges in 
integrating and interpreting human rights within corporate systems and decision-
making processes. It urges business associations and networks to demystify human 
rights by raising awareness among their members. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Working Group was encouraged by the vibrant civil society in the United 
States engaging on business and human rights from different angles and perspectives 
and using the Guiding Principles in their advocacy and policy development work. 
Constructive engagement by civil society, including trade unions, is essential to 
moving the agenda forward.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Working Group would like to make the following more specific 
recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Working Group recommends that the Government commence the 
process of developing a national action plan for the implementation of the Guiding 
Principles that takes account of both the domestic and foreign dimensions of its duty 
to protect human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The Working Group recommends that the Government ensure that 
reports submitted under transparency and reporting schemes include information on 
how the submitting companies have addressed human rights risks. For legitimacy and 
effectiveness, it is also recommended that there are meaningful consequences for 
companies which do not fulfil reporting obligations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Working Group welcomes the support of the Government for the 
International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers and the fact 
that the Department of State has signalled its intent to require membership for 
entities wishing to bid for government contracts. The Working Group recommends 
that it become government policy across the board to require membership of the code 
of conduct in relevant contracts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Working Group encourages the Government to ensure that 
sufficient resources are allocated to the national contact point for the OECD 
Guidelines and consider strengthening the specific instance process, including the 
incorporation of best practices from the specific instances procedures of national 
contact points of other countries as regards transparency and making findings of fact; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The Working Group recommends that the Tom Lantos Human Rights 
Commission consider holding a hearing on how the Government could further 
integrate the Guiding Principles into the activities of its various agencies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The Working Group calls on the Government to ensure that all workers 
are able to exercise their rights in accordance with the ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, with no undue exclusions, including, but 
not limited to, agricultural workers, supervisors and public employees; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The Working Group recommends that the Government take steps to 
strengthen the relevant domestic legal environment, especially in relation to labour 
rights. It encourages the Government to take steps to ratify the core ILO conventions </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/25/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p><b>and implement the recommendations of the ILO review bodies and the human rights 
treaty bodies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) The Working Group encourages the United States to continue and 
expand its efforts to fight trafficking in persons, in collaboration with business and 
civil society organizations, and to share its experience of coordinated action with other 
countries;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) The Working Group recommends that the Government and companies 
in the agricultural sector address concerns expressed by international bodies with 
regard to child labour in the United States agricultural sector as a matter of priority, 
so as to ensure that the rights of children are effectively protected in the context of 
agricultural business activities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) The Working Group welcomes the proliferation of multi-stakeholder 
initiatives to address business and human rights challenges, but recommends that all 
such initiatives review the implications of the Guiding Principles and take appropriate 
steps to ensure that their policies, procedures and practices are aligned with the 
Principles, including as regards access to remedy; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) The Working Group recommends that the Government undertake a 
comprehensive review of the mechanisms that are in place to provide effective remedy 
for cases involving business-related human rights abuse;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) In the context of high-impact business activities, such as surface mining, 
the Working Group urges the responsible authorities to investigate and address 
allegations of serious human rights impacts, including through timely and 
comprehensive consultations with affected communities. It also recommends that coal 
companies ensure that they operate with respect for human rights, as proposed under 
the Guiding Principles;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) In the context of implementation of the Guiding Principles at the county 
and municipal levels,  the Working Group encourages counties and municipalities to 
consider implementing and sharing learning on relevant initiatives, especially on 
policy coherence across departments that engage with contractors and other 
businesses;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) The Working Group encourages the United States authorities to address 
potential impacts on the rights of indigenous peoples in both awareness-raising with 
business enterprises and regulatory and policy programmes, to encourage and/or 
require companies to respect their rights throughout their global operations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) The Working Group encourages the financial sector, which is key to 
enabling the environment for business, to ensure that it meets its own responsibilities 
under the Guiding Principles and to use the Principles to foster greater respect, 
responsibility and accountability for human rights amongst their business clients and 
customers, including in the context of providing services to high-impact industries 
such as surface mining;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(p) The Working Group urges business associations and networks to 
demystify human rights by raising awareness of the Guiding Principles among their 
members; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(q) The Working Group encourages civil society organizations to continue 
their constructive engagement on business and human rights and welcomes the use of 
the Guiding Principles as a tool for advocacy and engagement.  </b></p>
