<p><b>  Iran (Islamic Republic of)</b>*<b> (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement): draft 
resolution 
</b></p>
<p><b>  24</b>/&#8230;  <b>Human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions on human rights and unilateral coercive 
measures adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights Council and the 
General Assembly, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 19/32 of 23 March 2012 and General 
Assembly resolution 67/170 of 20 December 2012, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to 
international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter and the norms and principles 
governing peaceful relations among States, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of 
all human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as a universal and 
inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> at the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on 
human rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that unilateral coercive measures in the form of economic sanctions can 
have far-reaching implications for the human rights of the general population of targeted 
States, disproportionately affecting the poor and the most vulnerable classes, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that long-term unilateral coercive measures may result in social 
problems and raise humanitarian concerns in the States targeted, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling</i> the final document of the sixteenth summit of the Heads of State and 
Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Tehran, in August 2012, in which the 
States members of the Movement decided to refrain from recognizing, adopting or 
implementing extraterritorial or unilateral coercive measures or laws, including unilateral 
economic sanctions, other intimidating measures and arbitrary travel restrictions, that seek 
to exert pressure on non-aligned countries &#8211; threatening their sovereignty and 
independence, and their freedom of trade and investment &#8211; and to prevent them from 
exercising their right to decide, by their own free will, their own political, economic and 
social systems, where such measures or laws constitute flagrant violations of the Charter, 
international law, the multilateral trading system as well as the norms and principles 
governing friendly relations among States, and, in this regard, oppose and condemn these 
measures or laws and their continued application, persevere with efforts to effectively 
reverse them and urge other States to do likewise, as called for by the General Assembly 
and other United Nations organs, and request States applying these measures or laws to 
revoke them fully and immediately, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 
to 25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in 
accordance with international law and the Charter and that created obstacles to trade 
relations among States and impeded the full realization of all human rights, and that also 
severely threatened the freedom of trade, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply</i> <i>concerned</i> that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the General 
Assembly, the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human Rights and at United 
Nations conferences held in the 1990s and at their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms 
of international law and the Charter, unilateral coercive measures continue to be 
promulgated, implemented and enforced by, inter alia, resorting to war and militarism, with 
all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and 
social development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby 
creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and 
individuals under the jurisdiction of other States, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
which provides that, inter alia, in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of 
subsistence, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to stop adopting, maintaining or implementing unilateral 
coercive measures not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, 
the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations 
among States, in particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which 
create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the 
rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human 
rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in 
addition, threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member 
States neither to recognize these measures nor to apply them, and to take effective 
administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial 
application or effects of unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain 
powers of such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, 
particularly against developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from </p>


<p>exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and 
social systems; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Expresses</i> <i>grave concern</i> that, in some countries, the situation of children is 
adversely affected by unilateral coercive measures not in accordance with international law 
and the Charter that create obstacles to trade relations among States, impede the full 
realization of social and economic development and hinder the well-being of the population 
in the affected countries, with particular consequences for women, children, including 
adolescents, the elderly and persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its call</i> upon Member States that have initiated such measures to 
abide by the principles of international law, the Charter, the declarations of the United 
Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions, and to commit themselves to their 
obligations and responsibilities arising from relevant provision of the international law and 
human rights instruments to which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such 
measures; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Reaffirms</i>, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by 
virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their own 
economic, social and cultural development; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Also reaffirms</i> its opposition to any attempt aimed at the partial or total 
disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a State, which is incompatible 
with the Charter; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Recalls</i> that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations, and to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, proclaimed by the General Assembly in 
its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32 thereof, no State 
may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce 
another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign 
rights and to secure from its advantages of any kind; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Reaffirms</i> that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be 
used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be 
deprived of their own means of subsistence and development; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Underlines</i> the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major 
obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this 
regard, calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive 
measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws that run counter to the 
principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Rejects</i> all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with 
extraterritorial application, which are not in conformity with international law; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Recognizes</i> that the Declaration of Principles, adopted at the first phase of the 
World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly 
urges States to avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the information 
society; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Urges</i> all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the 
Human Rights Council in the field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due 
attention, within the scope of their respective mandates, to the negative impact and 
consequences of unilateral coercive measures; </p>


<p>14. <i>Decides</i> to give due consideration to the negative impact of unilateral 
coercive measures on the human rights issues in its task concerning the implementation of 
the right to development;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 
discharging her functions in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights, to 
pay due attention and give urgent consideration to the present resolution; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Takes note</i> of the thematic study prepared by the Office of the High 
Commissioner on the impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human 
rights,1 including recommendations on actions aimed at ending such measures; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Also</i> <i>takes note</i> of the report of the Office of the High Commissioner on the 
proceedings of the workshop on the various aspects relating to the impact of the application 
of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights by the affected 
populations in the States targeted,2 and takes positive note of the report of the Secretary-
General to the General Assembly on human rights and unilateral coercive measures;3 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Notes</i> <i>with appreciation</i> the holding of the workshop on the impact of the 
application of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights by the 
affected populations in the States targeted organized by the Office of the High 
Commissioner, on 5 April 2013, in Geneva; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Requests</i> the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to prepare a 
research-based report containing recommendations on mechanism to assess the negative 
impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights and to promote 
accountability, and to present a progress report of the requested research-based report to the 
Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session for its consideration. 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Also requests</i> the Advisory Committee to seek the views and inputs of 
Member States and relevant special procedures, as well as national human rights 
institutions and non-governmental organizations, in the preparation of the above-mentioned 
research-based report; 
</p>

proceedings of the workshop4 held on 5 April 2013: 
</p>
