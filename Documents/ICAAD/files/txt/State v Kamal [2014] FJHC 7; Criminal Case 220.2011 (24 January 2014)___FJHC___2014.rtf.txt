PRAVEEN KAMAL, on the 5th day of May 2010 at Tavua in the Western Division, with intent

Count 4

WRONGFUL CONFINEMENT: Contrary to Section 286 of the Crimes Decree, 2009.

Particulars of Offence

PRAVEEN KAMAL between the 5th day of May 2010 and the 6th day of May 2010, at Tavua in the Western Division, wrongfully confined AK.

2.      
The three assessors unanimously found accused Not Guilty of the above counts one and two and majority of the assessors found accused Not Guilty of the counts three and four.

3.      
Obviously, the majority of the assessors have not accepted the prosecution's version of events. It appeared that they have found the prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. 

4.      
I direct myself in accordance with the law and the evidence which I discussed in my summing up to the assessors.

5.      
In my view, the assessor's verdict was not perverse. It was open for them to reach such conclusion on the evidence.

6.      
It is Judge's duty to listen to the view of the community when it comes to a conflict of version of events.

7.      
In this case, the assessor's verdict is not binding on me. However, on careful assessment of the case, I am prepared to accept their unanimous Not Guilty verdict on the counts of Abduction of person under 18 years of age with intent to have carnal knowledge and Rape and majority Not Guilty verdict on counts of Abduction with intent to confine person and Wrongful confinement and give the accused benefit of the doubt.

8.      
I accept the assessor's verdict and I find that the prosecution has not proven its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

9.      
I find the accused Not Guilty as charged on the four counts and acquit him accordingly of those counts.

10.     
This is the Judgment of the Court.
