</p>
<p><i>Summary  
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers conducted an 
official visit to Turkey at the Government&#8217;s invitation from 10 to 14 October 2011. She met 
</p>
<p>with governmental, legislative and judicial authorities, as well as with representatives of 
professional associations, civil society organizations and other stakeholders. Visits to 
Ankara, Istanbul and Diyarbakir enabled the Special Rapporteur to assess the situation of 
the judiciary and the challenges thereto in different areas of the country. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur examines the wide-ranging reforms 
recently carried out in Turkey, including at the constitutional level, many of which are of 
direct relevance to her mandate. While as a whole the reforms undertaken can be 
considered as an improvement, challenges remain to fully guarantee the independence and 
impartiality of judges and prosecutors in practice. Reference is made in particular to the 
role of public prosecutors in the administration of courts; the position and functions of the 
Minister of Justice within the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors; the need for 
separation between the careers of judges and prosecutors; the excessively close relationship 
between judges and prosecutors; the appointment, transfer and rotation system for judges 
and prosecutors; the mindset of judges and prosecutors; and the issue of women in the 
administration of justice. The Special Rapporteur also examines the issue of access to 
justice and delayed proceedings, and the related problems of the backlog of cases, the 
heavy workload, the lack of adequate infrastructure in the judiciary and the resulting long 
</p>
<p>

<p>pretrial detention periods. Furthermore, she analyses the restrictions allowed by legislation 
in terrorism and organized crime cases dealt with by the Special Heavy Penal Courts, and 
expresses concern about the related lack of procedural guarantees. A section is devoted to 
current investigations into high-profile cases of alleged coup-plotting. 
</p>
<p> The report also focuses on the lawyers&#8217; profession and examines the challenges 
encountered in the performance of their duties. These include a widespread perception that 
lawyers are not considered and treated in the same manner as judges and prosecutors and 
the difficulties they face in appropriately defending their clients, especially in terrorism-
related crimes. A particular concern in this respect is that in various instances lawyers have 
been criminally charged for activities carried out in the legitimate exercise of their 
profession when defending suspects accused of terrorism-related charges. There was a 
steep increase in this worrisome trend in the months preceding the submission of the 
present report. The Special Rapporteur also makes recommendations concerning the 
requirements for admission to the Bar. 
</p>
<p> The report concludes with remarks in respect of capacity-building and legal human 
rights training for judges, prosecutors and lawyers.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Turkey, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, visited the country on an official visit 
from 10 to 14 October 2011, in order to examine matters relating to the independence and 
impartiality of judges, prosecutors and the free exercise of the legal profession by lawyers. 
In particular, she had the opportunity to assess a series of judicial reforms recently 
undertaken by the Government that include several aspects at the core of her mandate. The 
Special Rapporteur also examined other issues, such as the respect of fair trial guarantees 
and access to justice. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur visited Ankara, Istanbul and Diyarbakir. She met with a 
number of Government officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Deputy 
Director General for the Council of Europe and Human Rights, and directors of various 
general directorates of the Ministry of Justice; the President, the Secretary-General and 
other judges of the Court of Cassation; the Secretary-General and other judges of the 
Council of State; judges from the High Military Criminal Court and the High Military 
Administrative Court; the Rapporteur and the Deputy Secretary-General of the 
Constitutional Court; the Secretary-General and other members of the High Council of 
Judges and Prosecutors; the Chief Prosecutor in Diyarbakir and the Deputy Chief 
Prosecutors in Ankara and Istanbul; members of the Human Rights Presidency; members of 
the Human Rights Inquiry and Justice Committees of the Grand National Assembly; 
representatives of the Justice Academy of Turkey; and representatives of the Turkish 
National Police and the General Command of the Gendarmerie. She also met with 
representatives of professional associations of judges and prosecutors, bar associations, 
lawyers, academics, international and local non-governmental organizations and United 
Nations agencies. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government for its invitation and for 
having facilitated the smooth development of the visit with full respect for her mandate. 
The Special Rapporteur considers, however, that five days is too short a period to conduct a 
visit in a vast country like Turkey. She would also like to express her gratitude to the Office 
of the United Nations Resident Coordinator and the United Nations Development 
Programme office in Turkey for their valuable support. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The justice system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p>4. Turkey has recently undertaken a series of reforms aimed at consolidating the rule of 
law and strengthening respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Legislative 
reforms include the adoption, in 2004, of the new Criminal Code and the new Criminal 
Procedure Code, aimed primarily at aligning Turkish legislation to the standards contained 
in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms. 1  Article 90 of the Constitution was also amended in 2004, to provide that 
international agreements in the area of fundamental rights and freedoms prevail in case of 
conflict with the provisions of the national laws. Its impact on the jurisprudence, however, 
has yet to be seen. More recent, and of particular relevance for the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
mandate, are the Judicial Reform Strategy 2009-2013 and its Plan of Action and the 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 1 See the report by Thomas Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, 
</p>
<p>following his visit to Turkey from 10 to 14 October 2011, 10 January 2012, para. 5. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>5 
</b></p>
<p>constitutional amendments adopted in 2010, aimed, inter alia, at improving the efficiency, 
independence and impartiality of the judicial system.  
</p>
<p>5. The Judicial Reform Strategy 2009-2013 was drafted by a commission established 
by the Strategic Development Department of the Ministry of Justice, taking into account the 
commitments of Turkey to the European Union and the priorities in the Ninth Development 
Plan and the Special Expertise Committee of Judicial Service. The Strategy put forward 10 
main objectives; topping the list  were (a) strengthening the independence of the judiciary 
and (b) promoting impartiality in the judiciary.2 The Strategy is being implemented through 
a plan of action that covers the activities, the timetable and the budget required to reach the 
objectives. 
</p>
<p>6. With respect to the constitutional reform, a referendum on proposed amendments 
was held on 12 September 2010. A total of 58 per cent of the population supported the 
amendments, with a participation rate of 77.4 per cent. The constitutional reform package 
included 26 amendments to the 1982 Constitution. Particularly relevant for the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate are those redefining the jurisdiction of military courts and modifying 
</p>
<p>the composition and functions of the Constitutional Court and the High Council of Judges 
and Prosecutors. These amendments will be analysed in more detail below. 
</p>
<p>7. In addition, since the 2010 constitutional referendum and the elections held in June 
2011, consensus has been emerging on the need for a new Constitution to entirely replace 
the 1982 Constitution. 
</p>
<p>8. Both the Judicial Reform Strategy and the constitutional amendments represented, 
on the whole, positive steps towards strengthening the structural and functional 
independence of the judiciary. Nonetheless, challenges remain in various areas with respect 
to guaranteeing, in practice, the effective independence and impartiality of judges, 
prosecutors and lawyers. These challenges are rooted in a number of structural and 
functional problems in the administration of justice, which are associated with dispositional 
factors deeply embedded in the practice of judicial actors. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The Constitution: provisions related to the judiciary  
</b></p>
<p>9. The legal system in Turkey is fundamentally based on articles 138-160 of the 1982 
Constitution, as amended in 2010.  
</p>
<p>10. The Constitution contains detailed provisions on judicial independence, starting 
from the provision that &#8213;judicial power shall be exercised by independent courts on behalf 
of the Turkish Nation&#8214; (art. 9). It further regulates the substance of judicial independence in 
its article 138 on independence of the courts. 
</p>
<p>11. The Constitution also generally regulates the elements of the security of tenure of 
judges and prosecutors (arts. 139 and 140), leaving the details thereof to specific 
legislation, notably Law No. 2802 of 24 February 1983 on judges and prosecutors 
(amended in 2010). 
</p>
<p>12. Regarding the structure of the judiciary in Turkey, courts are divided as described 
below. 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 2  Objectives 3 through 10 are as follows: enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in the judiciary; 
</p>
<p>enhancing professionalism in the judiciary; improving the management system of the judicial 
organization; enhancing confidence in the judiciary; facilitating access to justice; ensuring effective 
implementation of measures to prevent disputes and improving alternative dispute resolution 
mechanisms; improving the penitentiary system; and the needs of the country and continuation of 
legislation work for European Union harmonization. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. The court structure 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Constitutional Court 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Constitutional Court was established in 1962 and is one of the oldest in Europe. 
The establishment, composition, functions, duties and rules of procedures of the Court are 
stipulated in articles 146 to 153 of the Constitution.3 With respect to its competences, the 
Constitutional Court examines laws, decrees having the force of law and the rules of 
procedure of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (parliament) and assesses their 
constitutionality, in terms of both form and substance. It also has the unique and final 
power to dissolve political parties. Constitutional amendments are subject to constitutional 
review only in respect of form. 
</p>
<p>14. In terms of its composition, the Constitutional Court is currently composed of 17 
members; previously there were 15 members. Ten members are nominated by the President 
of the Republic from among candidates proposed by the Court of Cassation, the Council of 
State, the High Military Administrative Court, the Military Court of Cassation and the High 
Education Board; four are elected directly by the President of the Republic from among 
senior administrators, lawyers and rapporteur judges of the Constitutional Court. The Grand 
National Assembly then elects the remaining three members from among the candidates 
proposed by the Court of Auditors and the bar associations. The involvement of the 
parliament in the election of Constitutional Court judges may be seen as a positive 
development. 
</p>
<p>15. With respect to its functions, another important novelty is that the amendment to 
article 148 of the constitution recognizes a new right of individual petition to the 
Constitutional Court. This groundbreaking innovation represents a potential improvement 
for human rights protection at the domestic level in all cases where an individual claims 
that any of her or his fundamental rights has been violated by the public authorities. In 
order to file such an application, all ordinary domestic legal remedies must have been 
exhausted. It is the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s hope that this new procedure will also serve to 
</p>
<p>foster the use of international and regional human rights standards in the judicial system by 
giving effect to article 90 of the Constitution. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the 
Court is taking the necessary measures, including with respect to the provision of human 
resources, to be able to effectively perform this new function, which will certainly have an 
impact on the workload of the Court. The Court is expecting to start examining individual 
petitions from September 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Civil and criminal courts 
</b></p>
<p>16. Turkey has a two-tier system for civil and criminal courts, that is, the Court of 
Cassation (Yargitay, or Supreme Court of Appeal) and first instance civil and criminal 
courts. The Court of Cassation is the last instance for reviewing rulings and judgements 
rendered by civil and criminal courts and which are not referred by law to another judicial 
authority. Members of the Court of Cassation are appointed by the High Council of Judges 
and Prosecutors from among first-class judges and public prosecutors, by secret ballot and 
by an absolute majority of the total number of members (art. 154 of the Constitution). Law 
No. 2797 of 1983 on the Court of Cassation regulates in detail its establishment, 
composition, functioning and duties in addition to what is provided under the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>17. The establishment of district or regional courts of appeal as a potential intermediate 
tier in the structure of civil and criminal courts has been envisaged since 2005, when the 
legal framework for their creation was set up. However, there are still difficulties vis-&#224;-vis 
</p>
<p>

</b></p>
<p>their actual establishment, despite the fact that they should have been operational by 1 June 
2007 (see para. 46 below).  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Administrative courts 
</b></p>
<p>18. Administrative courts are divided into the Council of State, district administrative 
courts, and administrative and tax courts. The Council of State, as per article 155 of the 
Constitution, is the last instance court for reviewing decisions and judgements rendered by 
administrative courts and which are not referred by law to other administrative courts. It is 
also the first and last instance court for dealing with specific cases prescribed by law. 
</p>
<p>19. Three quarters of the members of the Council of State are appointed by the High 
Council of Judges and Prosecutors from among the first-class administrative judges and 
public prosecutors, while the remaining quarter is selected by the President of the Republic 
from among officials meeting the requirements designated by the law. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Military courts 
</b></p>
<p>20. Military justice is exercised by military courts and disciplinary courts. The Military 
High Court of Appeals, defined by article 156 of the Constitution, is the last instance for 
reviewing decisions given by military courts. Members of the Military High Court of 
Appeals are appointed by the President of the Republic from among three candidates 
nominated by the Plenary Assembly of the Military High Court of Appeals.4 All members 
of this Court are military judges. 
</p>
<p>21. Military courts are criminal courts set up under the Law on establishment and 
procedural rules of the military courts. 5  The 2010 constitutional reform limits the 
jurisdiction of military courts to military service and military duties. Under the new system, 
crimes against State security, the constitutional order and the functioning of this order will 
be dealt with by civilian courts. By the amendments made to articles 145 and 156 of the 
Constitution regarding military justice, the scope of the authority of the military justice is 
limited to the trial of military offences, and civilians cannot in principle be tried before 
military courts for offenses under the Military Penal Code committed during peacetime. 
However, it is unclear whether in practice military courts continue to be competent when 
the crime is the result of military personnel&#8217;s service or duty, even if the crime is committed 
against a civilian.6. 
</p>
<p>22. Disciplinary courts and high disciplinary courts are established to try the disciplinary 
offences of military personnel.7 Finally, the High Military Administrative Court is defined 
by article 157 of the Constitution and regulated by the Law on the High Military 
Administrative Court. 8  The latter court is the first and last instance for the judicial 
supervision of disputes arising from acts and actions involving military personnel or 
relating to military service.  
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, in accordance with the amendment to article 125 of the Constitution on 
recourse to judicial review, all decisions by the Supreme Military Council concerning 
exemption from the Turkish Armed Forces are now subject to judicial review.  
</p>
<p>                                                          
 4 Law No. 1600 of 8 July 1972 on the Military High Court of Appeals, art. 14. 
</p>
<p> 5 Law No. 353 of 26 October 1963. 
</p>
<p> 6 See ibid., art. 9.  
 7 These courts are established under Law No. 477 of 26 June 1964 on the establishment of disciplinary 
</p>
<p>and high disciplinary courts.  
</p>
<p> 8 Law No. 1602 of 20 July 1972.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Court of Jurisdictional Disputes 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Court of Jurisdictional Disputes is empowered to deliver final judgments in 
disputes among civil, administrative and military judicial branches concerning their 
jurisdiction and decisions. It was established by article 158 of the Constitution and is 
regulated by the Law on the establishment and functioning of the Court of Jurisdictional 
Disputes (Law No. 2247 of 22 June 1979).  
</p>
<p>25. With respect to the structure of courts in Turkey, one element that should be 
underlined is that, under the 1982 Constitution, the then military Government established 
State Security courts to try cases involving crimes against the security of the State and 
organized crime. The panel of three judges in each State Security Court included one 
military judge. In a number of cases, the European Court of Human Rights has found the 
presence of military judges in the State Security Courts to be a violation of fair trial 
principles. In the context of a package of reforms to the Constitution passed in June 2004, 
such courts were formally abolished and transformed into Special Heavy Penal Courts, 
composed of three civilian judges, authorized to try only cases involving organized crime, 
organized drug trafficking and cases brought under Law No. 3713 on the fight against 
terrorism (Anti-Terrorism Law), as amended on 29 June 2006.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to the independence and impartiality of judges 
and prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. High Council of Judges and Prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>26. The 2010 Constitutional amendments brought substantive changes to the High 
Council of Judges and Prosecutors, which is the body that regulates and oversees the judge 
and prosecutor professions in the country. By the amendment made to article 159 of the 
Constitution, the organization, structure and functioning of the High Council was 
considerably modified.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Structure 
</b></p>
<p>27. The structure of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors was rearranged in a 
manner which is more representative, enabling a more inclusive participation of the 
judiciary, as its members are now elected from a wider and more diversified base. This 
body now comprises a broader range of judicial as well as non-judicial actors; prior to the 
reform it was limited to members of the Higher Courts only. The number of Council 
members has also increased (now 22, up from 7).   
</p>
<p>28. Another positive change is that the authority of the Minister of Justice over the High 
Council of Judges and Prosecutors has been reduced, for example, the High Council is now 
detached from the Ministry of Justice. However, the Minister of Justice still retains 
significant powers and influence over the High Council, as he remains its president. The 
Undersecretary to the Minister of Justice is also an ex officio member of the High Council.9 
Despite the fact that the High Council has its own budget in law, this legal provision has 
not been applied in practice. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Functions 
</b></p>
<p>29. Under article 82 of the Law on judges and prosecutors as amended, investigations on 
the conduct of judges and prosecutors are to be carried out by the High Council of Judges 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 9  Article 159 of the Constitution.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>9 
</b></p>
<p>and Prosecutors&#8217; own inspectors upon a proposal of the relevant chamber of the High 
Council. Nevertheless, under that same article&#8212;in accordance with article 159 of the 
Constitution&#8212;the approval of the president of the High Council (that is, the Minister of 
Justice) is still needed to undertake such investigations,  
</p>
<p>30. Another important modification resulting from the reform is that decisions taken by 
the High Council to dismiss judges and prosecutors may now be subject to judicial review. 
This is certainly welcome progress. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that other 
decisions taken by the High Council concerning judges and prosecutors, for example 
suspension, appointment, transfer and disciplinary actions, can only be appealed internally 
before one of the High Council&#8217;s chambers or its plenary. In this respect, one of the main 
concerns heard relates to the way in which judges and prosecutors are transferred ex officio 
from location or duties.10 The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that all disciplinary or 
administrative decisions having an impact on the status of judges and prosecutors should be 
reviewed by an independent judicial body.11 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Elections of the members of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>31. Various concerns were raised in relation to the fact that the elections of the High 
Council members, notably those in October 2010, were influenced in such a way that the 
elected candidates were those closer to or having certain links with the Ministry of Justice, 
where a considerable number of judges and prosecutors are regularly seconded to perform 
administrative or management tasks. Another related concern was that the High Council 
election system conceived by the Constitutional Court leaves no room for the election of 
minority candidates, because candidates who are elected by the majority of the voters take 
all the seats. This system also applies for the elections to the Constitutional Court. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that the election process of High Council members should be 
designed and implemented in a way that is&#8212;and is perceived to be&#8212;fair and transparent. In 
particular, it is important that judicial actors are satisfied with the way in which members of 
the body governing their career are chosen.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The influence of the Minister of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur considers that, despite improvements in the High Council of 
Judges and Prosecutors, the current position and functions of the Minister of Justice within 
the High Council may jeopardize the full respect of the independence and impartiality of 
the judiciary and the perception thereof. Hence, an additional effort would be needed to 
ensure that the High Council is totally independent from the executive branch, both 
structurally and functionally. 
</p>
<p>33. She also notes with concern that the Minister of Justice still has a large influence on 
judicial activities, as he retains a key role in the management of budget administration and 
has a high degree of control over the profession of lawyers. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress that it is the duty of all governmental 
and other institutions to respect and observe the independence of the judicial actors, so as to

</p>
<p><b> C. The role of chief public prosecutors in the administration of courts 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur further notes that the administration of justice in courts is 
governed by chief public prosecutors, who seem to have a decisive role on judicial policies 
and all matters regarding promotion and representation of the judiciary within and outside 
of the judicial system. In addition, chief public prosecutors are responsible for the 
management of several daily activities, such as, inter alia, deciding which room will be 
occupied by each judge and prosecutor and what kind of resources will be made available 
to them. This appears to be an improper inversion of positions between judges and 
prosecutors that should be adjusted, as it affects the appearance of impartiality as well as 
the independence of judges and the fulfilment of their role to guarantee the real balance 
between different interests that come through judicial demands by counterparts, that is, 
between public prosecutors and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>36. This situation also creates an improper dependence of judges on the chief public 
prosecutors and at the same time diminishes the role of lawyers, affecting the principle of 
equality of arms. It also adds to the confusion of judges and prosecutors with regard to their 
different roles and the independence and impartiality that they should have, as illustrated in 
the next section.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The close relationship between judges and prosecutors and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>principle of equality of arms 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur notes that judges and prosecutors in Turkey have the same 
career within the judiciary, from the time of entry into service until retirement, with the 
possibility of switching from one function to another (although it seems that many more 
prosecutors have an interest in becoming judges than vice versa). She underlines that, as 
judges and prosecutors carry out different functions and have very distinct roles, there must 
be a clear distinction between their duties and functions. The competencies and the 
procedural role of public prosecutors should be established by law in such a way that there 
can be no legitimate doubt about the independence and impartiality of the court judges. 
Steps should also be taken to remove any ambiguity about the respective status and roles of 
public prosecutors and judges so that each profession can be clearly identified. Therefore it 
is necessary to tailor accordingly their training upon entry into the judicial career. Judges 
and prosecutors should also be perceived by the general public as actually performing 
different roles and functions. The careers of judges and prosecutors should be separate, in 
order to guarantee their respective necessary autonomy, impartiality and independence. The 
current emerging consensus for a new constitution in the near future could provide a good 
opportunity for promoting the needed separation between the careers of judges and 
prosecutors.  
</p>
<p>38. The close relationship between judges and prosecutors, however, is not limited to 
the way in which their careers begin and progress; it is noticeably reinforced by the fact that 
they often share the same offices and buildings in the courthouse and live in the same 
compounds provided by the Government. The way in which courtrooms are designed is 
also problematic, as both judges and prosecutors sit on a podium during the hearings, 
sometimes next to each other, in a higher position vis-&#224;-vis the lawyers. In addition, 
prosecutors enter and leave the courtroom by the same internal door used by judges. This 
proximity between judges and prosecutors is a matter of concern in relation to the 
principles of impartiality and equality of arms and also has an impact on the society&#8217;s 
perception of the judiciary as a whole. As rightly observed by one interlocutor during the 
mission, &#8213;equality of arms needs to be both physical and psychological&#8214;.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Appointment and transfer system for judges and prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>39. To enter the career, judges and prosecutors must pass a written examination and an 
oral interview, and complete a two-year pre-service training. Concerns were heard that the 
oral interview following the written examination takes place before a board where five of 
the seven members are officials from the Ministry of Justice (the other two members are 
appointed by the Justice Academy of Turkey). 
</p>
<p>40. Concerns were also raised about the mobility system for prosecutors and judges, 
based on a rotation between different geographical areas classified in various categories. 
The Special Rapporteur, for instance, was informed of a case where a prosecutor with more 
than 15 years of experience in criminal cases was transferred ex officio to work as a family 
judge in another region. This example, which does not seem to be an isolated one, shows 
that the transfer and rotation system should be improved and made more effective, fair, 
transparent and coherent in order to avoid possible misuses in its implementation. A 
transfer and rotation process that is public, based on objective criteria and, as a general rule, 
initiated by request would improve trust in the judicial system, especially with regard to 
those judges and prosecutors dealing with sensitive cases, and would contribute to making 
them more accountable in their activities. 
</p>
<p>41. There is also the perception that the appointment and transfer system can be used, 
depending on the case, as a punishment or reward mechanism. The Special Rapporteur has 
been informed that during an eight-month period beginning 25 October 2010&#8212;the date the 
new members of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors took office&#8212;a total of 3,049 
judges and prosecutors changed duty stations, constituting one third of the judges on duty. 
It was reported that many were transferred ex officio. In this process, judges and 
prosecutors who were members of judicial professional organizations seem to have been 
particularly penalized, with little attention being paid to very important issues, such as the 
right to family integrity.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur strongly believes that there is an urgent need to rationalize the 
manner in which judges and prosecutors are moved and to make this process more fair and 
transparent. A decision on the transfer or assignment of judges and prosecutors to other posts 
cannot be based merely on considerations relating to the needs of service; rather, it should be 
guided by objective criteria and adequately take into account the individual&#8217;s family situation, 
personal wishes and aspirations as well as the specialization that judges and prosecutors have 
acquired during their career. Mobility, in particular, cannot be based on arbitrary decisions, 
and judges and prosecutors should have the right to challenge&#8212;including in court&#8212;all 
decisions modifying the status of their conditions of service.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Backlog of cases, judicial delay and access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>43. Almost unanimously, judges and prosecutors have called attention to the issue of 
workload and case backlog. A common concern expressed in relation to the workload 
relates to the fact that judges and prosecutors are often requested to carry out administrative 
tasks, which deprives them of precious time to devote to more substantive duties. The low 
number of prosecutors and judges and infrastructure deficiencies were also mentioned in 
this context, despite the fact that more than 200 judges and prosecutors are working in the 
Ministry of Justice performing administrative or management tasks. These elements also 
have an impact on the length of proceedings, which is one of the long-standing problems of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>the Turkish judiciary. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that the judicial delay 
factor has one of the greatest negative impacts on the judicial system as a whole.12 
</p>
<p>44. These structural problems also affect citizens&#8217; effective access to justice and have an 
impact on the public confidence in the justice system.13 A regrettable consequence of case 
backlog and excessive length of proceedings is the overly long period of pretrial detention 
in a number of cases. Urgent attention should be given to these issues, including by taking 
practical steps to accelerate proceedings and creating a transparent system of indicators and 
benchmarks to assess the performance of the judiciary vis-&#224;-vis specific cases. 
</p>
<p>45. In the first quarter of 2011, some steps were taken to reduce the backlog of cases in 
the judiciary. In fact, Law No. 6110 on amending certain laws increased the number of 
chambers and members of the Court of Cassation and the Council of State. For instance, the 
number of chambers of the Court of Cassation increased from 32 (21 civil and 11 criminal 
chambers) to 38 (23 civil and 15 criminal chambers), while the total number of members of 
the court was increased from 250 to 387. 
</p>
<p>46. Another recent change aimed at helping to solve this long-standing problem was the 
creation of district and regional courts of appeal as an intermediate tier in the structure of 
courts. The legal framework for the creation of these courts was established in 2005, but 
none of them is currently operational, due to, in particular, deficiencies in physical 
infrastructure and human resource capacities. However, in 2011 the High Council of Judges 
and Prosecutors appointed chief public prosecutors for these courts. The Special Rapporteur 
believes that urgent attention should be given to this issue. At the same time, there is the 
need to ensure that, with the creation of courts of appeal, the Supreme Court actually 
receives fewer cases to review and does not become a third instance court, which would 
make the judicial process even longer and more cumbersome. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Procedural guarantees in the legislation applicable to terrorism and 
</b></p>
<p><b>organized crime and the operation of Special Heavy Penal Courts 
</b></p>
<p>47. Special Heavy Penal Courts, or Heavy Penal Courts with &#8213;special authority&#8214;, are 
competent for the investigation, prosecution and trial of cases relating to terrorism, 
organized crime and organized drug trafficking (see para. 25 above).  
</p>
<p>48. Prosecutors and judges working in such courts are reportedly trained and specialized 
to investigate and adjudicate these crimes. These courts also have extended geographic 
scope, which can facilitate the investigation of complex organized crime cases. However, 
the &#8213;special authority&#8214; of these courts appears to transpire from the legislation that is 
applicable to the crimes under their jurisdiction, that is, terrorism and organized crime, 
rather than in respect of their structure or the specialization of the professionals working 
therein. In particular, the law applicable in these cases, mainly contained in article 220 of 
the Criminal Code (dealing with organized crime) and the Anti-Terrorism Law, allows a 
series of possible restrictions to procedural safeguards, which has been a matter of concern 
for several international and regional human rights monitoring bodies and mechanisms.14 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 12  See, inter alia, the 2008 report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/8/4), para. 43.  
 13  According to the annual report published by the European Court of Human Rights in January 2011, 
</p>
<p>more than half of the judgments concerning Turkey in which the court found a violation included a 
violation of article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights&#8212;the right to a fair trial within a 
reasonable time. 
</p>
<p> 14 See, inter alia, the concluding observations of the Committee against Torture on the third periodic 
report of Turkey (CAT/C/TUR/CO/3), para. 11; follow-up letter of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>13 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur shares these concerns, in particular with respect to the various 
possible restrictions that can be applied to the right to defence.  
</p>
<p>49. Under the current legal framework, for instance, there is a limitation on the number 
of lawyers who can assist, during the custody and pretrial investigation period, an 
individual charged under the anti-terrorism legislation.15 Lawyers&#8217; access to documents 
pertaining to the case can be restricted before the trial, and censorship of correspondence 
between the defendants and their lawyer may also be allowed via judicial order. 16 
Furthermore, upon a request from the prosecutor, a suspect&#8217;s right to contact a lawyer may 
be restricted by a judge for the first 24 hours of his or her deprivation of liberty.17 While 
statements cannot be taken from the suspect during this period, the provision may 
nevertheless potentially open the door to abuses, as the first 24 hours following the arrest of 
a criminal suspect is usually when individuals are more exposed to possible violations. In 
addition, the period of initial custody can be extended in cases under the jurisdiction of the 
Special Heavy Penal Courts to 96 hours, as opposed to the 24 hours allowed in &#8213;regular&#8214; 
cases; the pretrial detention period may also be extended.18 
</p>
<p>50. In addition to being a concern per se from a human rights point of view, this is 
particularly alarming due to the broad definition of terrorism and the wide application of 
the anti-terrorism legislation. The Special Rapporteur has been informed, for instance, of 
cases where individuals have been prosecuted and tried under the anti-terrorism legislation 
and article 220 of the Criminal Code simply for having participated in public 
demonstrations by showing banners and shouting slogans, activities that clearly do not 
sufficiently address the personal material link to violence against bystanders that an 
acceptable definition of terrorism would require. 19  Paradoxically, a person accused of 
murder would be tried by a &#8213;regular&#8214; court, while someone shouting slogans during a 
demonstration could be tried before a Special Heavy Penal Court and potentially be subject 
to all the above-mentioned restrictions. Irrespective of any consideration regarding potential 
violations of the right to freedom of expression in such cases,20 this seems quite illogical.  
</p>
<p>51. Another concern related to the special powers granted to these courts is linked to a 
reportedly common use of secret witnesses for the investigation and prosecution of 
organized crime activities. While a person cannot be charged and convicted solely on the 
basis of evidence given by secret witnesses, the identity of such witnesses is kept secret 
from the accused and his or her lawyers throughout the entire proceedings. This is 
problematic as it touches upon, inter alia, the right to equality of arms in criminal trials, 
which requires that an accused be entitled to know who is testifying against him or her.

</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur believes that the judiciary can play an essential role in 
assessing whether such measures are compatible with both national legislation and 
international human rights law, although the supervision role of judicial actors and their 
margin of appreciation may be limited by the legislation itself.21 A further concern in this 
respect relates to the information received by the Special Rapporteur on cases where judges 
and prosecutors who were working in Special Heavy Penal Courts and who expressed 
concerns regarding the respect of fair trial rights and procedural guarantees were transferred 
and replaced with those alleged to be more complacent about the special powers exercised 
by these courts.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur does not underestimate the terrorist threat, which has to be 
fought with the strongest resolve but also with strict adherence to the rule of law and in full 
compliance with international human rights standards.22 
</p>
<p>54. In conclusion, the utmost caution should be applied in allocating terrorism or other 
crimes to special or specialized courts, in particular due to the lower fair trial guarantees 
that often characterize such courts in practice.23 This also applies to the Special Heavy 
Penal Courts.  
</p>
<p><b> H. The mindset of judges and prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur has observed on various occasions that the independence 
and impartiality of the judiciary are not merely structural or organizational problems, but 
rather are also dependent on the approach and mindset of the individual members 
composing the judiciary and the prosecution service. Every judge and prosecutor has her or 
his personal views, beliefs and opinions, which inevitably shape the way she or he 
approaches and examines a case. These subjective elements of independence may in turn 
depend on various factors, including personal background, public exposure, media pressure 
and societal expectations. Another important variable is the relationship between the 
judiciary and the State, that is, the impartiality of the judiciary vis-&#224;-vis the interests of the 
State.  
</p>
<p>56. The impression gathered by the Special Rapporteur in this respect is that a State-
centred mentality is rather prevalent in the Turkish judiciary, as the approach is often to 
favour or protect in the trial what are perceived to be the interests of the State. This 
situation, which is especially true in cases where the security of the State is felt to be at 
stake,24 may actually be a danger (albeit very difficult to quantify or assess), notably in 
cases where the interests of the State and the rights of individuals may be considered to be 
conflicting. In this respect, a distinction must be drawn in order to avoid confusion between 
public and State interests; that is, the exercise of public interest functions, such as criminal 
prosecution, should not be conceived as having the role to protect the interests of the 
Government, a political party or any other State institution.25 The drawing of such a line is 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>made more difficult by, for example, the fact that a large number of prosecutors and judges 
carry out administrative tasks within the Ministry of Justice (see para. 31 above).  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur has observed in a large number of countries that this 
approach&#8212;a sort of cultural resistance&#8212;is not rare in the judiciary. One possible measure 
to address this issue is the provision of a sound legal education with an international human 
rights focus.26 It is in this respect that she would like to stress the importance of initial and 
continuing legal human rights education for all judicial actors who, inter alia, should be 
encouraged to study the relevant case law of international and regional human rights law 
mechanisms and apply it as much as possible in the domestic context. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Investigation of coup-plotting allegations 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur was informed of various high-profile investigations into 
coup-plotting allegations, which have led to several arrests and the initiation of 
prosecutions, including what has been referred to as the Ergenekon case, where a large 
number of individuals&#8212;including serving and retired military officials as well as journalists 
and intellectuals&#8212;have been accused of belonging to a terrorist group allegedly aimed at 
overthrowing the Government of Turkey. Society is polarized on this issue. Many consider 
that these investigations and prosecutions represent a further step towards Government 
consolidation of civilian control over the army, while others suggest that there may be 
political reasons behind these arrests, which would in fact serve to silence opponents to the 
Government. The Special Rapporteur also notes that, in March 2011, three prosecutors 
assigned to the Ergenekon case were reassigned ex officio to other duties by the High 
Council of Judges and Prosecutors.27 
</p>
<p>59. It is not the role of the Special Rapporteur to enter into the merits of the different 
cases. In principle, those investigations may be a potential opportunity to combat impunity 
and strengthen the rule of law and the related public confidence. She would like to stress at 
the same time the need to always respect judicial guarantees for all suspects, including 
regarding the length of the pre-indictment and pretrial detention period, as well as the 
proper collection of evidence and the full respect of the right to defence. The external 
perception regarding the respect of procedural safeguards is especially important in high-
profile cases, as they tend to shape public confidence in the justice system.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Women in the administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur noticed that the representation of women in the judiciary is 
increasing, particularly at the entry and middle levels of the profession. The presence of 
women in higher positions is still insufficient. She has been informed, for instance, that in 
the most recent elections of judges to the Supreme Court of Appeals and the State Council, 
held on 25 February 2011, the issue of the representation of women has been ignored, as 
only 5 of the 160 members elected to the Supreme Court of Appeals were women, and only 
one of the 51 members elected to the State Council was a woman. These figures are 
dramatically low.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur devoted two of her previous reports to the issue of women 
in the administration of justice. She stressed the importance of developing a gender-
</p>
<p>                                                          
 26  See, for instance, A/HRC/17/30/Add.3, para. 67.

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>sensitive judiciary and ensuring an adequate representation of women therein.28 She would 
like to recall in that respect that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent 
legal profession and the integrity of the judicial system based on equal gender opportunities 
are essential prerequisites to effectively protect women&#8217;s human rights and ensure that the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice is free from discrimination on the grounds of gender. At the same 
time, men also have the opportunity to play a crucial role, including as judges, prosecutors 
or lawyers, in making the justice system more accessible to women and therefore more 
equal. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur would like to encourage judges, prosecutors and lawyers to 
promote equal access to justice by combating gender stereotypes and applying non-
discriminatory treatment of women in the criminal justice system, where women can be 
victims, witnesses and offenders; in the non-criminal justice system in cases involving 
family, inheritance, property and land ownership; and in personal status law and 
jurisprudence. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The situation of lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>63. One concern that most lawyers have expressed, as mentioned above (paras. 37-38), 
relates to their perception that they are not treated at the same level as judges and 
prosecutors in the daily performance of their duties. Lawyers need to be treated as equal 
counterparts of judges and prosecutors within the legal professions. It is of the utmost 
importance that justice be not only impartial per se, but that it is also perceived to be 
impartial by the public opinion. The role of prosecutors in Turkey entails that they should 
investigate all circumstances affecting the defendant, irrespective of whether these are to 
the latter&#8217;s advantage or disadvantage. However, it is important that, as a consequence of 
this role, the right of defence is not affected and the role of lawyers is not diminished.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur notes the difficulties that lawyers face in carrying out their 
work, given the obstacles to the effective performance of their professional functions posed 
by restrictions that the legislation allows in some&#8212;in particular anti-terrorism&#8212;cases. She 
observed in particular limitations to access to case files, non-disclosure of evidence and 
delays in the contact with clients.29  
</p>
<p>65. The increase in the number of cases of arrest, detention and prosecution under 
terrorism-related charges of lawyers defending individuals accused of terrorism-related 
crimes is of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur. Principle 18 of the Basic 
Principles on the Role of Lawyers provides that &#8213;lawyers shall not be identified with their 
clients or their clients&#8217; causes as a result of discharging their functions&#8214;, and principle 20 
affirms that &#8213;lawyers shall enjoy civil and penal immunity for relevant statements made in 
good faith in written or oral pleadings or in their professional appearances before a court, 
tribunal or other legal or administrative authority&#8214;. These principles are among the most 
routinely breached, as it is far from uncommon for investigations to be initiated against 
lawyers on grounds of an alleged link to, or the provision of support for, their clients&#8217; 
</p>
<p>alleged criminal activities.30 This regrettably seems to be increasingly the case in Turkey.    
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur further notes with concern that the activities of lawyers are 
controlled by the Ministry of Justice, which deals with lawyers&#8217; registration and 
disciplinary actions. It is recommendable that all aspects of the lawyers&#8217; career be regulated 
by the bar association.   
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3

<p><b>17 
</b></p>
<p>67. With respect to access to the legal profession and admission to the Bar, there is no 
requirement to pass an examination after completing studies in a law faculty. As suggested 
in previous reports, while the Special Rapporteur believes that those admitted to the legal 
profession should have, at minimum, a law degree obtained following an average length of 
four years of study at university, she also advises that a mandatory internship of significant 
length should be required. Only candidates fulfilling those criteria should be permitted to 
take a standardized written bar exam, conducted without their identity being revealed in 
order to guarantee objectivity. The written exam should be supplemented by an oral 
examination before an examining body, preferably primarily composed of lawyers, 
appointed by the bar association (A/64/181, para. 36). 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur heard from the bar associations she met during the visit that 
it would be indeed desirable to establish a public examination to admit lawyers to the Bar. 
Given the large consensus perceived from the main stakeholders on this issue, she believes 
that there would be no serious difficulties in implementing this recommendation, which can 
contribute to improving the quality of the legal services provided by the legal profession. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur considers that legal human rights education for all those 
who participate in the judicial process (judges; prosecutors; public defenders and lawyers) 
is a fundamental issue. This was the subject of her first thematic report to the Human Rights 
Council in June 2010 (A/HRC/14/26). Various stakeholders have expressed concern about 
the fact that legal human rights education remains poor in the country, especially at the 
university level, and highlighted the need for reform of the legal education system.  
</p>
<p>70. The establishment of the Justice Academy of Turkey in 2003 has been a welcome 
development in this respect. The Academy, which has scientific, administrative and 
financial autonomy, is responsible for the initial training of judges and prosecutors as well 
as their continuous in-service training. The initial training lasts two years and includes eight 
months of practical training. The training for judges and prosecutors is separated, after a 
initial segment of training common to both categories. The in-service training includes 
courses, seminars, conferences and other activities to help judges and prosecutors enhance 
their professional knowledge, skills and competences. To date, the Academy has trained 
more than 8,000 candidate judges and prosecutors since its foundation, including over 
1,500 during 2010-2011 alone. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the important work carried out by the Justice 
Academy of Turkey and the efforts it is undertaking to enhance professionalism within the 
judiciary. Cooperation with other institutions, including academia and bar associations, 
should be strengthened with a view to further include academics, jurists and lawyers in the 
training programmes and modules. The continuous training could also be improved and 
shaped to regularly train judges, prosecutors and lawyers in human rights issues and 
juvenile justice, as well as in gender issues, in particular when women are victims of 
crimes. She emphasizes that one of the aims of training and capacity-building should be to 
strengthen the impartiality of the judiciary so that judges and prosecutors can better serve 
both the institutions and the society as a whole. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the efforts made by the Government of 
Turkey to improve the structural independence of the judiciary and to guarantee its 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective functioning, including through the recent adoption of a series of reforms. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Nevertheless, challenges remain in various areas with respect to guaranteeing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective independence and impartiality of judges and prosecutors and the free 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercise of the legal profession by lawyers.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>One of these challenges is that the administration of justice in courts should be 
conducted by judges within the judiciary, not by chief public prosecutors. Public 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors and lawyers play extremely important roles within the judicial system as 
</b></p>
<p><b>equal counterparts, but the adequate balance of their actions in trial should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>guaranteed by independent and impartial judges. It is imperative to clearly separate 
</b></p>
<p><b>the role, functions and career of public prosecutors from those of court judges in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to strengthen their independence, impartiality and autonomy.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Other challenges are related to a number of functional and structural problems 
associated with dispositional factors, including the position and function of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Minister of Justice within the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>mindset of judges and prosecutors, the pressure to which they are exposed in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>context of the appointment and transfer systems, and the excessively close relationship 
</b></p>
<p><b>between them.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Another serious challenge for the judiciary in Turkey is the need to ensure that 
the measures used to combat terrorism are compatible with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights principles and standards. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur believes that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the special authority given to the Special Heavy Penal Courts allows for undue 
</b></p>
<p><b>restrictions on fundamental procedural safeguards. In addition, when defending 
</b></p>
<p><b>clients before those courts, notably in terrorism-related cases, lawyers are faced with 
</b></p>
<p><b>several obstacles and unacceptable risks given, on one hand, the numerous limitations 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the right to defence in these cases and, on the other, the consequences that many of 
</b></p>
<p><b>them may face as a result of the exercise of their professional functions. In this 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect, the Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned at the increasing number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases of arrest, detention and prosecution under terrorism-related charges of lawyers 
</b></p>
<p><b>defending individuals accused of terrorism-related crimes.   
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Structural problems, such as the backlog of cases, a heavy workload for judges 
and prosecutors and a lack of adequate infrastructure impact on the length of 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings and have heavy consequences on citizens</b>&#8217;<b> effective access to justice as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as on the public confidence in the justice system. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The possible adoption of a new constitution could provide a good opportunity for 
strengthening the independence, impartiality and autonomy of both the judiciary and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Prosecution Office and for promoting equality of arms between lawyers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>public prosecutors.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur submits the following recommendations with the aim to 
help strengthen the independence and impartiality of judges, prosecutors and the free 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercise of the legal profession by lawyers in Turkey, as well as the effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>functioning of the justice system as a whole.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Constitutional Court 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The new right to individual petition to the Constitutional Court should serve, 
inter alia, to foster the use of international and regional human rights standards in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial system.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Military justice 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Military courts should not be competent when a crime is committed against a 
civilian, even if the crime is the result of </b>military personnel&#8217;s service or duty<b>.   
</b></p>
<p><b>  High Council on Judges and Prosecutors  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The High Council on Judges and Prosecutors should be totally independent from 
the executive branch, both structurally and functionally. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>All disciplinary or administrative decisions by the High Council having an 
impact on the status of judges and prosecutors</b>&#8212;<b>not only dismissal, as currently is the 
</b></p>
<p><b>case</b>&#8212;<b>should be reviewed by an independent judicial body. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The election process of members of the High Council on Judges and Prosecutors 
should be designed and implemented in such a way that it is</b>&#8212;<b>and is perceived to be</b>&#8212;
</p>
<p><b>fully fair and transparent. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Role of chief public prosecutors in the administration of courts  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The administration of justice in courts should be the responsibility of judges, not 
the chief public prosecutors. The competencies and the procedural role of public 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors must be established by law in such a way that there can be no legitimate 
</b></p>
<p><b>doubt about the independence, impartiality and autonomy of the court judges. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Relation between judges and prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Bearing in mind that judges and prosecutors carry out different functions and 
have very distinct roles, measures should be taken to ensure a clear separation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>duties, functions and careers of the two professions. All necessary steps should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken to remove any ambiguity about the respective status and roles of judges and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors in order to fully ensure their respective independence, impartiality and 
</b></p>
<p><b>autonomy.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The role of prosecutors should not be confused with the role of courts and trial 
judges. Prosecutors and judges should be perceived by the general public as actually 
</b></p>
<p><b>performing different roles and functions, as public confidence in the proper 
</b></p>
<p><b>functioning of the rule of law is best ensured when every State institution respects 
</b></p>
<p>each other&#8217;s<b> sphere of competence. Judges and prosecutors should also have 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent and separated offices. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The judicial system should be conceived and structured in a manner that 
guarantees full respect of the principle of equality of arms vis-&#224;-vis lawyers. One 
</b></p>
<p><b>measure that needs to be taken in this regard is the reshaping of the physical court 
</b></p>
<p><b>design so that prosecutors are not physically placed at a level higher than lawyers.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Appointment and transfer system of judges and prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The rotation system under which judges and prosecutors are moved should be 
rationalized and made more fair and transparent.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The decisions related to the transfer or assignment of judges and prosecutors to 
other posts should not be taken ex officio, but on the request of the individual judge or 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutor. Such decisions should be based on objective criteria and take into 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate consideration the family situation, personal wishes and aspirations of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals concerned, as well as the specialization which judges and prosecutors have 
</b></p>
<p><b>acquired during their career. It should not be based merely on simple considerations 
</b></p>
<p><b>relating to the needs of service.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>Judges and prosecutors should have the right to challenge</b>&#8212;<b>including in court</b>&#8212;
<b>all decisions affecting them.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Allegations that appointments and transfers may be used as a punishment or 
reward mechanism, depending on the level of allegiance of the individual judge or 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutor, should be duly investigated. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Backlog of cases, judicial delays and access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The process of establishment of district and regional courts of appeal in civil and 
criminal courts should be expedited in order to reduce the huge backlog of cases. At 
</b></p>
<p><b>the same time, necessary measures should be taken to ensure that the creation of this 
</b></p>
<p><b>intermediate tier in the judicial structure actually reduces the workload of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Supreme Court, and does not lead to its transformation into a third instance court. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Further measures are urgently needed to reduce the backlog of cases and 
excessive length of proceedings, including speeding up procedures and ensuring that 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedural time limits are respected. Major administrative tasks should not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>carried out by judges and prosecutors, who should be supported by other apposite 
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial staff. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Reliable indicators and benchmarks should be created to monitor the 
performance of the judicial system and improve its efficiency and effectiveness, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in terms of the duration of court proceedings. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Procedural guarantees in the legislation applicable to terrorism and organized crime 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The utmost caution should be applied in allocating terrorism or other crimes to 
special or specialized courts, in particular due to the lower fair trial guarantees that 
</b></p>
<p><b>often characterize those courts in practice. In this respect, serious consideration should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be given to the abolishment of the Special Heavy Penal Courts or to a substantial 
</b></p>
<p><b>modification of the legislation regulating their functioning, in order to bring them into 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with human rights standards on fair trial and procedural guarantees.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Mindset of judges and prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Judges and prosecutors should not confuse the public interest with State 
interests. The Special Rapporteur, noting that this approach is not rare in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>judiciary, would like to stress in this respect the importance of initial and continuing 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal human rights education and training for all judicial actors. Judges, prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p><b>and lawyers should be particularly encouraged to study the relevant case law of 
</b></p>
<p><b>international and regional human rights mechanisms and to apply it as much as 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible in the domestic context in their respective roles.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Investigations into alleged coup-plotting 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Irrespective of the merits of the cases, it is essential that in all instances, and 
particularly in high-profile cases of high visibility to the public opinion, procedural 
</b></p>
<p><b>safeguards are fully respected. It is in fact not only important that justice be done but 
</b></p>
<p><b>also that it is perceived to be done.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Women in the administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The participation of women from various segments of society, as key actors 
within the justice sector in their roles as judges, prosecutors or lawyers, should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>further promoted. In particular, measures should be taken to ensure that women are </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>able to occupy high-level positions within the judiciary and in the justice system in 
</b></p>
<p><b>general, including by setting up temporary special measures, if necessary. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Access to justice should be encouraged, including by establishing specialized 
units within courts and prosecutorial offices to deal with specific gender-based crimes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>All aspects of the </b>lawyers&#8217; career<b> (such as, inter alia, registration and 
disciplinary actions) should be administered by the bar association rather than being 
</b></p>
<p><b>under the control of the Ministry of Justice. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Lawyers exercising their professional duties in terrorism-related or organized 
crime cases should be able to perform all their professional functions without 
</b></p>
<p><b>intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference. Lawyers should have 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to appropriate information, as well as relevant files and documents, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>sufficient time to enable them to provide effective legal assistance for their clients. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Lawyers should not be identified with their clients or their clients</b>&#8217;<b> causes as a 
result of discharging their functions. They should enjoy civil and penal immunity for 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant statements made in good faith or in their professional appearances before a 
</b></p>
<p><b>court, tribunal or other legal or administrative authority. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Lawyers need to be treated as equal counterparts of prosecutors, in order to 
fully respect the principle of equality of arms. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Measures should be taken to improve the quality and professionalism of the 
legal profession. In this respect, it is advisable to introduce a public examination as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirement for entry into the lawyers</b>&#8217;<b> career; candidates should have completed a 
</b></p>
<p><b>law degree as well as a subsequent internship/apprenticeship period.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Judges, prosecutors and lawyers should be given the opportunity of continuing 
education in international human rights principles, standards, norms and 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisprudence; the latter should include not only decisions and judgements from 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional bodies, but also outputs from the United Nations human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Judges, prosecutors and lawyers should also be given the necessary information on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>possibilities of applying, at the domestic level, international human rights principles, 
</b></p>
<p><b>norms and standards.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>The involvement of lawyers and bar associations in the training modules should 
be encouraged. The continuous training should also be improved and shaped so as to 
</b></p>
<p><b>regularly train judges, prosecutors and lawyers in human rights issues, juvenile 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice, and gender issues. 
</b></p>
