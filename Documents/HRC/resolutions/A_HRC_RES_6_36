<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing</i> <i>in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 
</p>
<p>March 2006, and paragraph 84 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 
</p>
<p>of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that, at its sixty-first session, the General Assembly adopted in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 61/295 of 13 September 2007 the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of Indigenous Peoples,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing</i> <i>in mind </i>Human Rights Council resolution 6/16 of 28 September 2007, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Human Rights Council should be cognizant of the work 
</p>
<p>being undertaken on indigenous issues by other bodies in the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides,</i> in order to assist the Human Rights Council in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of its mandate, to establish a subsidiary expert mechanism to provide 
</p>
<p>the Council with thematic expertise on the rights of indigenous peoples in the manner 
</p>
<p>and form requested by the Council: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The thematic expertise will focus mainly on studies and research-based 
</p>
<p>advice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The mechanism may suggest proposals to the Council for its 
</p>
<p>consideration and approval, within the scope of its work as set out by the Council; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also decides </i>that this mechanism shall report annually to the Council 
</p>
<p>on its work; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further decides</i> that the expert mechanism shall consist of five 
</p>
<p>independent experts, the selection of which shall be carried out in accordance with the </p>

<p>procedure established in paragraphs 39 to 53 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1 of 
</p>
<p>18 June 2007; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Strongly recommends</i>  that, in the selection and appointment process, 
</p>
<p>the Council give due regard to experts of indigenous origin; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Decides</i>, in order for the expert mechanism to enhance cooperation and 
</p>
<p>avoid duplicating the work of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people and the Permanent Forum, that it 
</p>
<p>shall invite the Special Rapporteur and a member of the Permanent Forum to attend

<p> 6. <i>Also decides</i> that the members of the expert mechanism shall serve for 
</p>
<p>a three-year period and may be re-elected for one additional period; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Further decides</i> that, within its mandate, the expert mechanism on the 
</p>
<p>rights of indigenous peoples should determine its own methods of work, although the 
</p>
<p>expert mechanism shall not adopt resolutions or decisions; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Decides</i> that the expert mechanism shall meet once annually  three 
</p>
<p>days in its first year and thereafter for up to five days, and that the sessions may be a 
</p>

</p>
<p>regional organizations and mechanisms in the field of human rights, national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions and other relevant national bodies, academics and experts on 
</p>
<p>indigenous issues, non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the 
</p>
<p>Economic and Social Council; the meeting shall also be open to indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>organizations and non-governmental organizations, whose aims and purposes are in 
</p>
<p>conformity with the spirit, purposes and principles of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, based on arrangements, including Economic and Social Council resolution 
</p>
<p>1996/31 of 25 July 1996, and practices observed by the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, through an open and transparent accreditation procedure in accordance with </p>

</p>
<p>information on participation and consultation with States concerned; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the United Nations High
