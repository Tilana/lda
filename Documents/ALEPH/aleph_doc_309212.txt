ITEMS 1. AND 2.(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES
OUR BUSINESS
VISION AND STRATEGY
We are a North American mining company engaged in the full mining cycle, which includes acquisition, exploration, 
development, and operation of mineral properties. In the past several years, we have evolved from being a major primary 
molybdenum producer to becoming a copper and gold mining company with the construction and development of our open-pit 
copper-gold mine and concentrator in British Columbia, Canada (“Mount Milligan Mine”). Mount Milligan Mine commenced 
operations in August 2013 and continues to ramp-up to design capacity. At December 31, 2014, the combined proven and 
probable estimated mineral reserves for Mount Milligan Mine totaled 2.4 billion pounds of contained copper and 6.2 million 
ounces of contained gold. We currently expect to increase our payable copper and gold production in 2015 as compared to 
2014, and to complete our ramp-up of Mount Milligan Mine by year-end.
In addition to our gold and copper mining operation, we own and operate a metallurgical facility in Pennsylvania, USA
(the “Langeloth Facility”), at which we roast molybdenum concentrate and other metals. We expect that the Langeloth Facility 
will operate at approximately 85% capacity in 2015 with the roasting of third-party material.
We have shifted the core focus of our business to copper and gold while at the same time developing a strategy to achieve
positive cash flow from our molybdenum business. This shift in core focus is primarily the result of recent and expected 
ongoing weakness in the molybdenum market due to additional supply of molybdenum from new copper producers that 
produce molybdenum as a by-product. In 2015, we expect to generate sufficient revenue from the Langeloth Facility, together 
with the sale of molybdenum inventory from TC Mine and Endako Mine (defined below), to cover care and maintenance costs 
and/or costs incurred during the temporary suspension of these mines. Please see "Molybdenum Mines" below.
Our current business strategy is to:
•
• 
•
achieve design recoveries and mill throughput at Mount Milligan Mine by the end of 2015 while containing 
costs; 
conduct our operations safely and in an environmentally responsible manner; 
transition Langeloth into one of the largest third party molybdenum conversion plants in the world, which is 
expected to contribute to positive cash flow from our molybdenum business in 2015;
•  maintain the optionality of our molybdenum business; and 
•
improve our balance sheet and our competitive position in the industry.
In the medium term, we intend to seek opportunities to enhance our diverse production profile through accretive acquisitions 
and/or investments.
COPPER AND GOLD MINE
In August 2013, the phased start-up of operations began at the Mount Milligan Mine with the first feed to the concentrator, 
and in September 2013, the first copper-gold concentrate was produced. Mount Milligan Mine reached commercial production 
as of February 18, 2014, defined as operation of the mill at 60% design capacity mill throughput for 30 days, and has been cash 
flow positive since the second quarter of 2014. As previously disclosed, we have determined that additional crushing will be 
necessary to consistently achieve mill throughput of 60,000 tonnes per day ("tpd"), and we expect to construct a permanent 
secondary crushing circuit at Mount Milligan Mine when market conditions improve. In 2015, the detailed engineering phase is 
expected to be completed and commitments are expected to be made for the long lead items. The final capital cost estimate for 
the project will be determined once the detailed engineering is completed, and it is expected to be near the high end of the 
previously announced range of $50 - $75 million, inclusive of the approximately $15 million in costs that we expect to incur in

Table of Contents
2015 for the engineering work and commitments for long lead items. Once construction commences, we estimate that it will 
take approximately 18 months to complete the permanent circuit. Temporary crushing will be utilized during 2015 and, as a 
result, we expect to reach approximately 60,000 tpd by year-end 2015.
MOLYBDENUM MINES
Until the Mount Milligan Mine became operational in the fall of 2013, our business was primarily focused on the
extraction, processing, roasting, and sale of molybdenum. Through the end of 2014, we operated an open-pit molybdenum mine 
and concentrator in Idaho, USA (“TC Mine”), and an open-pit molybdenum mine, and concentrator in British Columbia, 
Canada, in which we own a 75% joint venture interest (“Endako Mine”). TC Mine was placed on care and maintenance in 
December 2014 after the mining and processing of ore from Phase 7 was completed. As previously disclosed, we are 
conducting limited stripping at the mine for the next phase of mining to maintain our options while we continue to evaluate 
alternatives for TC Mine. Effective December 31, 2014, operations at Endako Mine were temporarily suspended due to recent 
and expected ongoing weakness in the molybdenum price. We expect to re-evaluate the status of Endako Mine as market 
conditions warrant. For more information regarding severance and other costs relating to care and maintenance of TC Mine and 
the temporary suspension of Endako Mine, please see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K.
At December 31, 2014, the combined proven and probable estimated mineral reserves for TC Mine and Endako Mine
totaled 141.4 million pounds of contained molybdenum, with 74.7% of these reserves from TC Mine and 25.3% from Endako 
Mine (stated on a 100% basis). For detailed information regarding our mines and their mineral reserves, please see the “Mines” 
and “Mineral Reserves” sections, below.
LANGELOTH FACILITY
Langeloth is one of the largest molybdenum conversion plants in the world. In addition to the 36 million pounds of annual
roasting capacity, Langeloth also can produce 9.5 million pounds of ferromolybdenum (one of only two such plants in the 
United States or three in North America) as well as 3 million pounds of pure moly oxide and 6,000 pounds of rhenium. 
Langeloth’s quality is recognized throughout the world, most especially in the United States. We believe(cid:160)Langeloth(cid:160)is well 
positioned to offer customers a number of competitive advantages(cid:160)relative to other(cid:160)large conversion plants(cid:160)operating in(cid:160)South 
America.
GENERAL
We were organized in 2000 as a corporation under the laws of Ontario, Canada, and were continued as a corporation under
the laws of British Columbia, Canada in 2008. We are a corporation governed by the Business Corporations Act (British 
Columbia). In October 2006, we acquired Thompson Creek Metals Company USA, then a privately-held company incorporated 
and headquartered in the United States, and in so doing acquired TC Mine, Endako Mine and the Langeloth Facility. In October 
2010, we acquired Terrane Metals Corp. (“Terrane”) and in so doing acquired the Mount Milligan development project, which 
is now Mount Milligan Mine. Through the Terrane acquisition we also acquired a copper, molybdenum and silver exploration 
property located in British Columbia, Canada (the “Berg Property”), and a gold exploration property located in Nunavut, 
Canada (the “Maze Lake Property”). Our corporate headquarters are in Littleton, Colorado, USA.

See the Notes to the Consolidated Financial statements in Item 8 for financial information about our operating segments
and by geographic area.
PRODUCTS
Our principal products in 2014 were copper, gold, and molybdenum. In 2014, we produced 68.0 million pounds of copper
in concentrate, containing 64.6 million pounds of payable copper, and 184,027 ounces of gold in concentrate, containing 
177,606 ounces of payable gold. In 2014 and 2013, approximately 22% and 2%, respectively, of our product sales were 
attributable to copper, and approximately 22% and 1%, respectively, of our product sales were attributable to gold. We did not 
produce any copper or gold in 2012, as operations at Mount Milligan Mine did not commence until the fall of 2013.
We produced 26.3 million pounds of molybdenum in 2014. In 2014, 2013, and 2012, approximately 56%, 97%, and 100%
of our product sales were attributable to molybdenum.

Copper and Gold
Concentrate Sales
We produce copper and gold in saleable concentrate form at our Mount Milligan Mine and sell the concentrate to third 
parties, including offtakers and traders, which we refer to as “MTM Customers.”  We are currently party to four multi-year 
concentrate sales agreements. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to sell an aggregate of approximately 140,000 
tonnes in calendar year 2015, 140,000 tonnes in calendar year 2016, and 40,000 tonnes in each of calendar years 2017 and 
2018.
Pricing under all of the sales agreements is determined by reference to specified published reference prices during the 
applicable quotation periods. Payment for the concentrate is based on the price for the agreed copper and gold content of the 
parcels delivered, less smelting and refining charges and certain other deductions, if applicable. The copper smelting and 
refining charges are negotiated in good faith and agreed by the parties for each contract year based on terms generally 
acknowledged as industry benchmark terms. The gold refining charges are as specified in the agreements.
The commitments under our current multi-year concentrate sales agreements cover approximately 85% of our expected 
concentrate production in 2015 and are also less than the total expected production in 2016 and beyond. We intend to either 
extend our current multi-year agreements as the terms expire, or we may enter into additional multi-year sales agreements. To 
the extent that production is expected to exceed the volume committed under these agreements, we will sell the additional 
volume under short-term contracts or on a spot basis.
Gold Stream Arrangement
Pursuant to an agreement dated October 2010, as subsequently amended in December 2011, August 2012, and December 
2014, with a subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. (“Royal Gold”) (referred to as the “Gold Stream Arrangement”), we agreed to sell 
to Royal Gold(cid:160)52.25%(cid:160)of the refined gold production from Mount Milligan Mine for a total upfront payment of(cid:160)$781.5 million, 
plus(cid:160)$435(cid:160)per ounce, or the prevailing market rate if lower than(cid:160)$435(cid:160)per ounce, when the gold is delivered. We used the funds 
we received from Royal Gold in our purchase of Terrane and in the construction of the Mount Milligan Mine. To satisfy our 
obligations under the Gold Stream Arrangement, after we sell copper and gold concentrate from Mount Milligan Mine to MTM 
Customers, we purchase gold ounces in the market for delivery to Royal Gold in an amount based on a portion of the gold 
ounces in the copper and gold concentrate sold to MTM Customers, as determined in accordance with the terms of the Gold 
Stream Arrangement. For more information about the Gold Stream Arrangement, please see Note 10 in Item 8 of this 10-K, for 
a further discussion.

Markets
Copper is a malleable and ductile element that is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity as well as being corrosion-
resistant and antimicrobial. Refined copper is incorporated into wire and cable products for use in the construction, electric 
utility, communications and transportation industries. Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery, consumer 
products and a variety of other electrical and electronic applications and is also used to make brass. Copper substitutes include 
aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an internationally traded commodity. A 
combination of current mine production and recycled scrap material make up the annual copper supply. Copper is an 
internationally traded commodity, and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges: the London Metal Exchange 
(“LME”), the Shanghai Futures Exchange and the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices on these 
exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical. In general, 
demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth, particularly in industrial production and 
construction.
Gold generally is used for fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry,
electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors may buy gold 
bullion, official coins or jewelry or invest through options, futures or exchange-traded funds. A combination of current mine 
production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions, industrial 
organizations and private individuals make up the annual world-wide gold supply. The price of gold is volatile and is affected 
by numerous factors. Factors affecting the market for gold include the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and 
financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the US dollar and foreign currencies, changes in 
global and regional gold demand and political and economic conditions throughout the world.
Molybdenum
Our principal molybdenum products are molybdic oxide (also known as roasted molybdenum concentrate) and
ferromolybdenum. Other products we produce include high soluble technical oxide, pure molybdenum trioxide and high purity 
molybdenum disulfide. Prior to December 31, 2014, we sourced molybdenum from our two primary mines, TC Mine and 
Endako Mine, and from third-party producers. As of January 1, 2015, our principal source for molybdenum concentrate will be 
third-party producers, and we will either purchase the concentrate from such third parties for processing and re-sale or convert 
the concentrate to finished products on behalf of such third parties. Unless and until we recommence operations at our primary 
molybdenum mines, operations at our Langeloth Facility, which has 36 million pounds of annual roasting capacity, will be 
focused on the roasting and tolling of third-party material.
Markets
Molybdenum is an industrial metal principally used for metallurgical applications as a ferro-alloy in steels where high
strength, temperature-resistant or corrosion-resistant properties are sought. The addition of molybdenum enhances the strength, 
toughness and wear- and corrosion-resistance in steels when added as an alloy. Molybdenum is used in major industries 
including chemical and petro-chemical processing, oil and gas for drilling and pipelines, power generation, automotive and 
aerospace. Molybdenum is also widely used in non-metallurgical applications such as petroleum catalysts, lubricants, flame-
retardants in plastics, water treatment and as a pigment. A combination of current mine production and recycled scrap material 
make up the annual molybdenum supply. Molybdenum is mined from both primary mines, ones that contain only molybdenum 
as an economic mineral, and as a by-product from certain copper mines.
Molybdenum prices are determined by transacting parties rather than by a metals exchange. Reference prices for
molybdenum are available in several publications, including(cid:160)Platts Metals Week,(cid:160)Ryan’s Notes(cid:160)and(cid:160)Metal Bulletin. Molybdenum 
prices generally reflect the worldwide balance of molybdenum supply and demand and can be volatile and cyclical. In general, 
demand for molybdenum reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth, particularly in industrial production and 
construction.
SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
Our mining operations require significant energy, principally electricity, diesel and natural gas. Most of our energy is 
obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. Our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for 
mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Although we believe we have sufficient water rights to conduct our mining 
operations, the loss of water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights, 
could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations. For a further discussion of risks associated with the availability of 
water, refer to Item(cid:160)1A. “Risk Factors.”

COMPETITION
The mining industry is intensely competitive. Our competitive position is based on the quality and grade of our estimated 
mineral reserves, our ability to manage our costs compared to other producers throughout the world, our ability to maintain our 
financial integrity through the lows of the metal price cycles, our ability to attract and retain skilled employees, and our ability 
to manage our customer relationships. Our costs are governed to a large extent by the location, grade and nature of our 
estimated mineral reserves, our input costs, including energy, labor, and equipment, and our operating and management skills. 
The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability 
to manage our costs, acquire and develop quality deposits, and hire and retain a skilled workforce. Our substantial indebtedness 
will limit our ability to significantly grow our business in the near term, but we intend to continue to grow our business through 
our exploration program and through future acquisitions in the long term.
Until we began producing concentrate from Mount Milligan Mine in late 2013, we exclusively mined molybdenum, and
were thus subject to unique competitive advantages and disadvantages related to the price of molybdenum. As discussed above, 
the core focus of our business has shifted to copper and gold and away from molybdenum, which makes us less sensitive to 
fluctuations in the price of molybdenum but increases the effects of fluctuations in copper and gold prices on our business. 
Please see Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for further discussion regarding risks that may affect our competitive position.
EMPLOYEES
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, we employed approximately 980 people (approximately 700 in Canada and 280 in the United
States).
Approximately 74% of employees at the Langeloth Facility are members of the International Union, United Automobile,
Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America union through its Local 1311. In January 2013, a new labor 
agreement was reached with the union at the Langeloth Facility to cover the period from March 11, 2013 through March 11, 
2016. Approximately 86% of Endako Mine’s employees are members of the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, 
Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union through its Local 1-424. In January 2014, a 
labor agreement was reached with the union at Endako Mine for the period from April 1, 2013 to March(cid:160)31, 2015. After March 
31, 2015, the labor agreement will automatically renew under existing terms, unless either party gives 90 days' written notice 
prior to the expiration of the then-current term requiring the other party to commence collective bargaining for a renewal 
agreement. We believe that our relations with all of our employees are good.
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
Environment
Our mining and exploration activities are subject to extensive federal, provincial, state and local laws, regulations and
permits governing protection of the environment. Among other things, our Canadian operations must comply with 
authorizations issued under the provincial Mines Act and the Environmental Management Act. We also implement Fish Habitat 
Compensation Plans at Mount Milligan Mine under the Fisheries Act and the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations. In the United 
States, TC Mine has permits issued under the federal Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. Our tailings storage facility at TC 
Mine is governed by an Idaho statute administered by the Idaho Department of Water Resources. Our primary permits at the 
Langeloth Metallurgical Facility are issued under the federal Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, both of which are 
implemented in Pennsylvania by the state Department of Environmental Protection.
Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our
operations are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations in all material respects. Regular monitoring 
and compliance with periodic reporting requirements are integral components of all our environmental permits and 
authorizations. In Canada, we also conduct Environmental Effects Monitoring, which is a cyclical receiving-environment 
monitoring program to assess the potential effects of effluent on the fish population, fish tissue and the benthic invertebrate 
community.
The costs associated with implementation and compliance with environmental requirements are substantial and possible 
future legislation and regulations could cause additional operating expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the 
development and continued operation of our properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted with certainty. In the context of 
environmental permitting, including approval of reclamation plans and compliance with long-term, post-reclamation 
obligations, we are required to comply with known standards and regulations, which may entail significant costs. For further 
discussion of risks associated with environmental matters, refer to Item(cid:160)1A. “Risk Factors.”

Table of Contents
Estimated future reclamation costs are based primarily on legal and regulatory requirements. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014,
we have provided financial assurance for reclamation costs of approximately $42.4 million at TC Mine, $13.2 million at 
Endako Mine (of which our 75% share is approximately $9.9 million) and $25.9 million for Mount Milligan Mine. 
Environmental laws and regulations generally have become more stringent and restrictive during the life of our operations. Our 
reclamation obligations and the related financial assurances we are required to provide will likely increase over time.
Health and Safety; Corporate Responsibility
We are committed to ensuring the health and safety of our employees and operating in a sustainable, socially responsible 
manner in the communities in which we operate. We have adopted an Environmental, Health and Safety Policy under which we 
have, among other things, implemented systems to provide ongoing safety training, promote a proactive culture among our 
employees, and encourage open communication to improve operating practices affecting health and safety issues. To help us 
achieve one of our most important goals and in an effort to be a “Leader in Safety” among our peers, we have launched a 
Company-wide Safety and Leadership Initiative, which combines behavioral-based safety systems with the development of a 
safety-centric culture and safety leadership training. The initiative was first implemented at TC Mine in 2012 and resulted in 
improved safety results. We are rolling out the initiative at our remaining sites, including the corporate office, in 2015.
We have also prepared and implemented an Environmental, Health and Safety Management System at Mount Milligan
Mine that is intended to comply with ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001. In 2014, our All Incident Reportable Rate improved 
to 2.46 from 2.48 in 2013.
In addition, we have adopted a Corporate Responsibility Policy that reflects our commitment to conducting our business
in a manner that, among other things, maximizes positive impacts within the workplace for our employees and within the 
communities in which we work and live. We have developed plans and programs to promote sustainability in our business and 
are committed to building long-term relationships with the communities in which we operate. For example, at Mount Milligan 
Mine, we have implemented a Community Sustainability Committee, by which we meet quarterly with representatives of the 
local communities and First Nations.
In 2014, we issued our inaugural corporate responsibility report, which may be accessed on the “Responsibility” page of 
our website at www.thomsponcreekmetals.com. The Environment, Health and Safety Committee of the Board of Directors is 
responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of the Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, the Corporate 
Responsibility Policy, and other related policies, and to review the performance of the Company with respect to environmental, 
health and safety matters. Information regarding our performance is updated annually and is made available to the public in our 
annual corporate responsibility report, which is posted to our website at www.thompsoncreekmetals.com.
MOUNT MILLIGAN MINE (COPPER AND GOLD)
General
OUR MINES
Mount Milligan Mine is a conventional truck-shovel open-pit copper and gold mine and concentrator with a 60,000 tpd
design capacity copper flotation processing plant. Mount Milligan Mine has an estimated life of approximately 24(cid:160)years (based 
on spot metal prices of $3.00 per pound copper and $1,250 per ounce gold) and estimated average annual production of 
85(cid:160)million pounds of copper and 186,700 ounces of gold in 155,000 tonnes of concentrate, over the life of the mine. For the 
years 2015 through 2019, the average annual production is estimated to be higher at approximately 94 million pounds of copper 
and 285,800 ounces of gold in 165,000 tonnes of concentrate. As of the date of this Form 10-K, Mount Milligan Mine is our 
only material mineral property. On January 21, 2015, we filed an updated NI 43-101 technical report for Mount Milligan Mine. 
Please see "Mineral Reserves" below for more information, including a discussion of certain factors taken into consideration in 
determining the economic viability of the mine.
In October 2010, we acquired the Mount Milligan development project as part of our acquisition of Terrane, and began 
construction shortly thereafter. On August 15, 2013, the phased start-up of the mine operation began with the first feed to the 
concentrator, and in September 2013, the first copper-gold concentrate was produced at the mine. Mount Milligan Mine reached 
commercial production as of February 18, 2014, defined as operation of the mill at 60% design capacity mill throughput for 30 
days. Ramp-up activities continued through 2014 and are ongoing. As previously disclosed, we expect to install a secondary
11
Table of Contents
crushing circuit to reach 60,000 tpd on a consistent basis. Temporary crushing will be utilized during 2015 and, as a result, we 
expect to reach approximately 60,000 tpd by year-end 2015.
Mount Milligan Mine is located within the Omenica Mining Division in North Central British Columbia, Canada,
approximately 153 kilometers northwest of Prince George, 80 kilometers north of Fort St.(cid:160)James and 97 kilometers west of 
Mackenzie. Mount Milligan Mine is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle 
from the east via Mackenzie on the Finlay Philip Forest Service Road and the North Philip Forest Service Road, and from the 
west via Fort St.(cid:160)James on the North Road and Rainbow Forest Service Road. Road travel to the Mount Milligan property site is 
776 kilometers from Prince Rupert and 254 kilometers from Prince George. The forestry-based communities of Mackenzie and 
Fort St.(cid:160)James are within daily commuting distance of the Mount Milligan site, and both of these communities are serviced by 
rail. The infrastructure at Mount Milligan Mine includes a concentrator, a tailings storage facility and reclaim water ponds, an 
administrative building and change house, a truckshop/warehouse, a permanent operations residence, a first aid station, an 
emergency vehicle storage, a laboratory and sewage and water treatment facilities. The power supply is provided by B.C. Hydro 
via a 92-kilometer hydroelectric power line. We transport concentrate from the mine site to Mackenzie via truck, and from there 
transport it by railway to the port of Vancouver for shipment to MTM Customers.
Mount Milligan Mine includes 103 claims and one mining lease with a combined area of 46,271 hectares. The single
mining lease that was issued to Terrane on September(cid:160)9, 2009, expires on September 9, 2029, and requires a lease payment of 
approximately $102,000, due annually on September(cid:160)9. Mineral claims are subject to exploration expenditure obligations, or we 
may choose to pay annual fees to the Province in lieu of exploration expenditures. All mineral claims are in good standing with 
an expiry date of March 2016. We expect to renew such mineral claims in the ordinary course.
A 2% net smelter return royalty, commencing in the third year of commercial production, is payable to a previous owner 
of the property. The royalty holder, H.R.S. Resources Corp. (successor in interest to Richard Haslinger), has the right to receive 
annual advances of C$20,000, first payable on or before December(cid:160)31, 1994, and on each anniversary after the first advance 
until the commencement of commercial production, which payments have been maintained. We have a right of first refusal on 
any proposed disposition of the net smelter return royalty by H.R.S. Resources Corp.
We have also agreed to make certain payments to a First Nation over the course of the life of mine. We do not consider the
amounts of these payments to be material to our business. The terms of the agreement under which we have agreed to make 
these payments are confidential.
As described above, we have entered into a Gold Stream Arrangement with Royal Gold pursuant to which we committed 
to sell an aggregate of 52.25% of the refined gold production from Mount Milligan Mine to Royal Gold. For more information 
about these transactions, see Note 10 in Item 8 of this 10-K, for a further discussion.

History
Limited exploration activity on Mount Milligan was first recorded in 1937. In 1984, prospector Richard Haslinger and BP
Resources Canada Limited located claims on the site. In 1986, Lincoln Resources(cid:160)Inc. (“Lincoln”) optioned the claims and in 
1987 completed a diamond drilling program that led to the discovery of significant copper-gold mineralization. In 1991, Placer 
Development(cid:160)Ltd. (which became Placer Dome(cid:160)Inc.) (“Placer”) acquired Lincoln’s interest in the Mount Milligan property, 
resumed exploration drilling, completed a pre-feasibility study and applied for provincial and federal approvals to develop the 
project. These approvals expired in 2003. Barrick Gold Corporation purchased Placer in 2006 and sold its Canadian assets to 
Goldcorp(cid:160)Inc., which then in turn sold its interest in Mount Milligan to Atlas Cromwell. Atlas Cromwell then changed its name 
to Terrane Metals Corp. In October 2010, we acquired Terrane and the Mount Milligan project.
Geology, Deposit Types and Mineralization
Mount Milligan Mine is a tabular, near-surface, alkalic copper-gold porphyry deposit that measures some 2.6 kilometers 
north-south, 1.6 kilometers east-west and is more than 396 meters thick. It consists of two principal deposits, the Main deposit 
and Southern Star deposit. The Main deposit includes four contiguous zones: MBX, WBX, DWBX and 66, all of which are 
spatially associated with the MBX monzonite stock and Rainbow Dyke. The Southern Star deposit is centered on a monzonite 
stock of the same name and is some 500 meters south of the Main deposit.
Mineralization consists primarily of chalcopyrite with lesser bornite and magnetite in areas of potassic alteration, and 
pyrite in areas of propylitic alteration. In the main deposit, mineralization is best developed in areas of potassic alteration, 
where copper and gold grades are related to chalcopyrite and pyrite. High gold values are found in each deposit, mostly 
associated with pyrite, but the highest gold grades are found in the 66 zone and are related mainly to pyrite mineralization.
Exploration
A 5,590-meter core drilling program was completed in 2011 to follow-up previous holes drilled into the footwall of the 
WBX and other stocks, where potential copper-gold mineralization was indicated at depth. A total of eight holes were drilled, 
testing primarily for down-faulted blocks of mineralized rock below the western portion of the current deposit and pit limits. An 
additional 867 meters of core was drilled in ten holes to provide new samples for metallurgical test work. There was no 
exploration activity at Mount Milligan in 2013. Exploration work was conducted in 2014 on the mining claims and consisted of 
soil sampling, geological mapping, ground geophysical surveying (induced Polarization and magnetics) along with detailed 
follow-up mapping.

THOMPSON CREEK MINE (Molybdenum)
General
TC Mine is an open-pit molybdenum mine and concentrator located approximately 48 kilometers southwest of the town of
Challis, Idaho, USA, with an estimated mine life of approximately seven(cid:160)years (based on a molybdenum price of $10.00 per 
pound). TC Mine is accessible by commercial air carrier into the cities of Idaho Falls, Sun Valley and Boise, Idaho. Vehicle 
access to the mine is available by highway and gravel roads from each of these cities.
The TC Mine land holdings are comprised of 1,589 patented and unpatented lode, mill site and placer claims along with 
fee owned property totaling approximately 9,955 hectares. All current ore reserves are located on patented mineral claims and 
are not expected to be subject to any US federal government royalties that could be enacted in the future. Approximately 50% 
of the mineral claims are located within the boundaries of the Salmon-Challis National Forest, with the remaining 50% located 
within the perimeter of land managed by the United States Bureau of Land Management. Annual assessment fees, totaling 
approximately $170,035 were made to the United States Bureau of Land Management in 2014 to maintain 1,097 unpatented 
mining claims at TC Mine through August 2015. We also paid state and county property taxes of $750,792 in 2014. Currently 
there is no mining taking place on property that requires the payment of a royalty.
The TC Mine operation consists of an open-pit mine, ore crusher and conveyer system, mill and concentrator, tailings and 
containment dam, an administrative building, a truck shop/warehouse and support facilities. Open-pit mining began at TC Mine 
in 1983. Material mined from TC Mine is treated at a processing plant on site, and concentrate material is transported to our 
Langeloth Facility. Electric power is provided to the site by the Salmon River Electric Co-op through a 40 kilometer 230 kV 
power line to the South Butte Substation, then by a 4 kilometer 69 kV line to the mill site. Both of these lines are owned by TC 
Mine. Fresh water for TC Mine is pumped from the Salmon River.
Due to declines in molybdenum prices and projected operating costs at TC Mine, in October 2012, we suspended waste
stripping activity associated with Phase 8. Since that time, the molybdenum market has continued to weaken and, as a result, we 
put TC Mine on care and maintenance in December 2014 when the mining and processing of Phase 7 ore was completed. While 
TC Mine is on care and maintenance, we will conduct limited stripping for Phase 8 to maintain the optionality of the mine.
History
The TC Mine deposit was discovered in 1968 by Cyprus Mines Corporation (“Cyprus”). Surface exploration, diamond 
and reverse circulation drilling were done by Cyprus. Cyprus started construction of the mine in 1981, with full production 
beginning in 1983 and continuing until 1992 when operations were suspended due to depressed molybdenum prices. In 1993, 
Thompson Creek Metals Company USA, whom we acquired in October 2006, purchased the mine and resumed operations in 
1994. The mine operated continuously from 1994 until it was placed on care and maintenance in December 2014; however, 
production was reduced during 2008 and 2009 due to reduced demand for molybdenum during that period.

Table of Contents
Geology, Deposit Types and Mineralization
The TC Mine porphyry molybdenum deposit is located near the structural intersection of two geologic provinces:
continental, arc-related intrusive rocks of the late Cretaceous Idaho Batholith (the “Idaho Batholith”) are exposed to the west of 
the mine, while complexly deformed Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks are dominant to the east. The Idaho Batholith is a multi-
phase, long-lived intrusion with a granitic to granodioritic composition. Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks form the wall-rock 
portions of the TC Mine deposit. Historic mining within the district was associated with syngenetic stratiform base-, precious-
metal (i.e. lead-silver) mineralization which is locally developed in the Paleozoic units. The majority of the TC Mine 
molybdenum deposit is hosted within igneous rocks of the TC Mine intrusive complex, with minor amounts found within 
adjacent metasediments.
The TC Mine deposit is classified as an intrusive-hosted molybdenum porphyry system. Porphyry molybdenum deposits 
are divided into two subtypes: Climax-type and Quartz Monzonite (Endako)-type. TC Mine belongs to the Quartz Monzonite 
category. In contrast to the rift-related (extensional) Climax-type deposits, the Quartz Monzonite-type deposits are formed by 
subduction-related (compressional) processes. Molybdenum mineralization at TC Mine is primarily hosted in a composite 
granodiorite-quartz monzonite stock of Cretaceous age (i.e. TC Mine intrusive complex). This composite stock intruded 
carbonaceous and locally limy argillite (i.e. metasediments) of the Mississippian Copper Basin Formation. Where it is in 
contact with the TC Mine intrusive complex, the argillite has been contact-metamorphosed to hornfels and locally to skarn. The 
intrusive and sedimentary rocks are unconformably overlain by the Eocene Challis Volcanics, a post-mineral sequence of 
andesite to rhyodacite tuffs, flows and agglomerates. Locally, the volcanic cover is up to 305 meters thick. These volcanic rocks 
fill valleys and depressions in the paleotopography around the TC Mine site.
Exploration
On-site 2013 exploration activities around and peripheral to the TC Mine infrastructure consisted of surface mapping and
rock sampling. During 2013, a drilling permit was approved by the United States Forest Service for exploration drilling of 
targets identified within the Bruno Creek drainage east of the current mine infrastructure. There were no exploration activities 
performed on the off-site Long Canyon and Little Fall Creek properties in 2014.
Annual assessment fees, totaling approximately $97,805 were made to the United States Bureau of Land Management in 
2014 to maintain 631 unpatented lode mining claims at both the Long Canyon and Little Fall Creek properties through August 
2015.
On-site exploration activities in the TC Mine area in 2015 are expected to be minimal and may include surface mapping,
rock sampling and target identification. No exploration work other than routine claim maintenance is planned for the off-site 
Long Canyon and Little Fall Creek properties in 2015.
ENDAKO MINE (Molybdenum)
General
Endako Mine is an open-pit molybdenum mine, concentrator and roaster located approximately 161 kilometers west of 
Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, with an estimated mine life of approximately two(cid:160)years (based on a molybdenum 
price of $10.00 per pound).
15
Table of Contents
Endako Mine is accessible by commercial air carrier to Prince George, British Columbia, then by vehicle west on a paved
highway for approximately 161 kilometers, then south on the Endako Mine road for an additional 11 kilometers. In March 
2012, we completed a mill expansion project at Endako Mine. The expansion project included the construction of a new mill to 
replace the previous mill constructed in the 1960’s. The new mill is designed to process 55,000 tons of ore per day compared to 
31,000 tons per day in the old mill. The previous 45-year old mill at the site has been shut down and is currently on care and 
maintenance.
Endako Mine is operated as a joint venture (the “Endako Mine Joint Venture”) between Thompson Creek Mining(cid:160)Ltd. 
(“TCML”), one of our subsidiaries, which holds a 75% interest, and Sojitz Moly Resources, Inc. (“Sojitz”), a subsidiary of 
Sojitz Corporation, which holds the remaining 25% interest. See “Endako Mine Joint Venture” below for further details 
regarding the Endako Mine Joint Venture.
The property is currently comprised of a contiguous group of 58 mineral tenures containing 32 claims and 26 leases, 
covering approximately 12,778 hectares. In addition, the Endako Mine Joint Venture holds surface rights to a portion of the 
mine site area. The mineral leases are subject to annual fees, and the mineral claims are subject to exploration expenditure 
obligations. We may choose to pay annual fees to the Province in lieu of exploration expenditures. All mineral claims are in 
good standing, and expiry dates range from March 2018 to February 2024. We expect to renew such mineral claims in the 
ordinary course.
Endako Mine deposit is divided into four named areas: Northwest, Denak West, Denak East and Endako. Mining is in
progress or has occurred in the Endako and both Denak areas. The Northwest zone is yet to be produced. The property contains 
processing facilities, waste dumps and tailings disposal areas. There are no royalties, back-in rights, encumbrances on title or 
other agreements, other than the agreement governing the Endako Mine Joint Venture. The infrastructure at Endako Mine 
includes a 55,000 ton per day concentrator, a 40,000 to 45,000 pound per day roaster (and an additional non-operating roaster), 
tailings and reclaim water ponds, a crushing plant, an administrative building, a truck shop/warehouse, a change house, a first 
aid station, a laboratory, a garage and other shops. The power supply of the site is provided by a 9 kilometer, 69 kV power line 
owned by B.C. Hydro from a nearby substation. Water for the milling process is re-circulated from the tailings facility while 
make-up water is pumped from François Lake, located nearby.
In mid-December 2014, we announced that we and Sojitz had agreed to place Endako Mine on temporary suspension
effective December 31, 2014, due to continued weakness in the molybdenum market. In connection with the temporary 
suspension, approximately 50% of salaried employees at Endako Mine were terminated by December 31, 2014, and the 
employment of the hourly employees have been temporarily suspended after the required 60-day notice period and will remain 
so suspended while the mine is on temporary suspension.
History
The Endako Mine deposit was discovered in 1927 by local hunters. Minor underground exploration work took place in
subsequent years. In 1962, R&P Metals Corporation(cid:160)Ltd. began a diamond drilling program to evaluate the discovery and,
16
Table of Contents
based on the exploration results, incorporated a company named Endako Mines(cid:160)Ltd. Canadian Exploration Limited, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Placer, entered into an option agreement with Endako Mines(cid:160)Ltd. in August 1962 and continued 
exploration on the property.
In March 1964, Placer decided to place the property into production. Production commenced in June 1965 at a plant
capacity of approximately 10,000 tons per day (combined concentrator and roaster). Expansions in 1967 and improvements in 
1980 increased the concentrator capacity. In 1982, the mine and concentrator were closed due to low molybdenum prices, but 
the roaster continued to operate, processing molybdenum concentrates from other operations on a toll basis.
The mine and mill were re-opened in 1986, and by 1989 production reached approximately 31,000 tons per day. In June
1997, TCML and Sojitz, the parties to the Endako Mine Joint Venture, purchased Endako Mine from Placer. We acquired 
TCML in October 2006 through our acquisition of Thompson Creek Metals Company USA.
Geology, Deposit Types and Mineralization
The Endako Mine deposit is located within the intermontane morphology/tectonic belt of British Columbia, Canada. The
Endako Mine molybdenite deposit is hosted in the Endako quartz monzonite intrusive, a phase of the middle to late Jurassic 
François Lake Intrusions that form(cid:160)a large composite batholith. The deposit is genetically associated with the terminal stages of 
magmatic activity, represented by intrusion of the Casey monzogranite.
Molybdenite is the primary metallic mineral on the Endako Mine property. Minor pyrite, magnetite and chalcopyrite, and 
traces of sphalerite, bornite, specularite and scheelite are also present. Single occurrences of beryl and bismuthinite have been 
reported. Molybdenite occurs in two types of veins. Large veins (up to 1.2 meters wide) contain laminae and fine 
disseminations of molybdenite. The second vein type occurs as stockworks adjacent to the major veins in the form of fine 
fracture-fillings and veinlets of quartz-molybdenite. Pyrite is most abundant along the southern margin of the zone of 
molybdenum mineralization.
Exploration
No exploration activities were completed in 2014, and no exploration activities are planned for 2015, on the Endako Mine
land tenure. A mine lease application filed in November 2013 to convert 24 mineral claims was successfully granted in June 
2014. The new mine lease is required to allow mining in the areas we refer to as the Denak West Extension.
Endako Mine Joint Venture
The Endako Mine Joint Venture was formed on June(cid:160)12, 1997 pursuant to the terms of the Exploration, Development and 
Mine Operating Agreement between TCML and Sojitz (the “Endako Mine Joint Venture Agreement”). We have been appointed 
manager of the Endako Mine Joint Venture with overall management responsibility for operations. As manager, we prepare 
annual budgets and production plans and submit them to Sojitz for approval. In the event Sojitz rejects any or all of a proposed 
budget or production plan, the parties are required to work to develop a mutually acceptable budget and production plan. As 
manager, we manage, direct and control Endako Mine, provided that each of the following actions requires the approval of both 
us and Sojitz: (i)(cid:160)disposition of all or a substantial portion of the Endako Mine assets; (ii)(cid:160)contracts with affiliates over $500,000 
or sales of product to our affiliates or affiliates of Sojitz; (iii)(cid:160)compensation for management of the business; (iv)(cid:160)modification 
of the Endako Mine Joint Venture Agreement; (v)(cid:160)any change in business purpose; (vi)(cid:160)any modifications or replacements to the 
production plan for Endako Mine; (vii)(cid:160)investment in other companies; (viii)(cid:160)any borrowing by the joint venture or loan to any 
third party or any guarantee; (ix)(cid:160)changes in the manager, other than by reasons of default; and (x)(cid:160)except in the case of 
emergency or unexpected expenditures, a discretionary capital expenditure in excess of $1.0(cid:160)million. Our and Sojitz’s 
participating interests in the joint venture are currently 75% and 25%, respectively; those interests may be recalculated under 
certain circumstances set forth in the Endako Mine Joint Venture Agreement.
Langeloth Metallurgical Facility
OTHER OPERATING PROPERTIES
Our wholly-owned Langeloth Facility is located in Langeloth, Pennsylvania, approximately 40 kilometers west of
Pittsburgh, on land we own in fee simple. The facility receives molybdenum disulfide concentrate from TC Mine, Endako Mine 
and from third party producers that is either purchased for processing and re-sale or that is toll converted to finished products 
for third parties. The facility produces and sells ammonium perrhenate and rhenium metal pellets as well as sulfuric acid all

recovered as by-products of processing the molybdenum disulfide. In addition, the Langeloth Facility calcines other metal 
containing materials from various third-party operations.
Four multiple-hearth furnaces are used for the conversion (roasting) of molybdenum disulfide concentrate into technical
grade molybdenum oxide. These four roasters have the annual capacity to process 36 million pounds of molybdenum contained 
in concentrates. The molybdenum oxide can be sold as a finished product to customers or can be upgraded at the facility to 
molybdenum oxide briquettes, pure molybdenum trioxide powder or various sizes of ferromolybdenum products. Two furnaces 
are used to calcine non-hazardous metal containing materials that contain metals other than molybdenum.
The plant has been and continues to be upgraded by an ongoing capital improvement program. Further, an acid plant
shutdown occurs approximately every three years to refurbish acid plant process equipment. Following an extended seven-week 
shutdown in 2012, we have planned a five-week shutdown in 2015.
Berg Property
EXPLORATION PROPERTIES
In October 2010, we acquired the Berg property as part of the Terrane acquisition. The Berg property is a copper,
molybdenum, and silver exploration property that is located in the Omineca Mining Division within the Tahtsa Ranges of west-
central British Columbia, Canada approximately 84 kilometers southwest of Houston and 23 kilometers northwest of the 
Huckleberry Mine. The Berg property is comprised of 115 mineral claims and one mining lease centered at 53° 48’ North 
Latitude and 127° 26’ West Longitude for a total of approximately 45,949 acres.
The Berg property is 100% owned by us with a 1% net smelter return royalty held by Royal Gold on eight of the mineral
claims and one mining lease, including those which host the deposit on the Berg property. All mineral claims and the mining 
lease are in good standing and good to dates ranging from August 2015 to November 2021. Mineral claims are subject to 
exploration expenditure obligations, or we may choose to pay annual fees to the province in lieu of exploration expenditures. 
We expect to renew such mineral claims and mining lease in the ordinary course.
Drilling on the property was initiated by Kennecott in 1965, and this led to the delineation of two main mineralized zones. 
In 1972, exploration and development of the Berg property were taken over by another owner under agreement with Kennecott, 
and by 1980, a total of 119 diamond drill holes for 20,128 meters had been completed on the Berg property. In 2007 and 2008, 
Terrane carried out diamond drill programs totaling 22,948 meters in 60 holes designed to confirm the results of previous work 
and define the resource with infill and step-out drilling, particularly below the historic resource, and provide fresh material for 
metallurgical test work. In 2011, we commissioned additional exploration and drilling delineation to support an advanced 
scoping study. The 2011 drilling program included 10,678 meters of drilling (35,024 feet). In 2014 a helicopter-supported 
surface mapping and sampling program was performed over the Berg property and the environmental baseline monitoring 
programs were maintained. In 2015, certain environmental monitoring programs will continue and additional geologic sampling 
and mapping will be considered.
Maze Lake Property
The Maze Lake property is an early-stage gold exploration project located in the Kivalliq District of Nunavut in Canada,
90 kilometers southwest of Rankin Inlet and 45 kilometers west of Whale Cove, both on Hudson Bay. An interest in the 
property was acquired by Terrane following the discovery of an 29 kilometer long gold trend that was identified by regional till 
sampling in 2000. The Maze Lake property consists of property covered by three Inuit Owned Lands Mineral Exploration 
Agreements with a total area of 12,409 hectares.(cid:160)Such Agreements allow us to terminate our interest in the property at any time.(cid:160)
In 2008, Terrane formed a joint venture (the “MLJV”) with Laurentian Goldfields(cid:160)Ltd. to explore and develop the Maze 
Lake property. Upon formation of the MLJV, Terrane contributed its Maze Lake mining interests to the MLJV in return for a 
43% interest in the MLJV. We acquired Terrane’s interest in the MLJV in October 2010 as part of the Terrane acquisition. In 
June 2013, we acquired Laurentian Goldfields Ltd.’s interest in the MLJV, granted a 1% net smelter return royalty to Laurentian 
Goldfields Ltd., and terminated the MLJV.
The Mineral Exploration Agreements are in good standing, with the next annual holding fee of $49,636 being due April 1, 
2015 and the annual assessment work or payment of assessment work deficiency in the amount of $397,912 being due June 30, 
2015. In 2014, no drilling or field investigations were completed on the property. No additional drilling or field work is planned 
for 2015.

MINERAL RESERVES
Our proven and probable mineral reserves have been estimated in accordance with the definitions of such terms adopted
by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") and incorporated in National Instrument(cid:160)43-101  
("NI(cid:160)43-101") by Canadian securities regulatory authorities. Technical reports have been filed regarding the disclosure of 
mineral reserves for our material property, Mount Milligan Mine, as required by NI(cid:160)43-101. The proven and probable estimated 
mineral reserves are those tonnages contained within economically optimized pits, configured using current and predicted 
mining and processing methods and related operating costs and performance parameters. Mineral reserve estimates reflect our 
reasonable expectation that all necessary permits and approvals will be obtained and maintained. We believe that our proven 
and probable estimated mineral reserves are equivalent to proven and probable reserves as defined by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission's (the "SEC") Industry Guide 7. See the Glossary of Terms below for an explanation of mining terms 
used in this report.
The estimation of mineral reserves is constrained to an economically optimized pit based on all operating costs, including 
the costs to mine. Since all material lying within the optimized pit will be mined, the cut-off grade used in determining mineral 
reserves is estimated based on the material that, having been mined, is economic to transport and process without regard to 
primary mining costs (i.e., mining costs that were appropriately applied at the economic optimization stage).
The QA/QC controls program used in connection with the estimation of our mineral reserves consists of regular insertion
and analysis of blanks and standards to monitor laboratory performance.
The following tables set forth the estimated copper and gold mineral reserves for Mount Milligan as of December(cid:160)31,

(1) The mineral reserve estimates for Mount Milligan Mine were prepared by Robert Clifford, our Director of Mine Engineering,
who is a Qualified Person under NI(cid:160)43-101. The mineral reserve estimates were prepared using an ultimate open pit design 
optimized at spot metal prices of $3.00/lb copper, $1,250/oz gold, an exchange rate of US$1.00/C$1.10, a cut-off grade of 
0.176% copper equivalent, and takes into consideration metallurgical recoveries, concentrate grades, transportation costs, 
smelter treatment charges, and royalty and streaming arrangements in determining economic viability. The mineral reserve 
estimates are based on the cost and price assumptions included in the NI 43-101 technical report entitled "NI 43-101 
Technical Report—Mount Milligan Mine—Northern Central British Columbia" dated January 21, 2015 and filed on SEDAR 
on January 21, 2015. Mill recoveries vary by rock type and region but average 84.2% copper and 72.5% gold. Anticipated 
losses resulting from beneficiation average approximately 4.0% copper and 2.5% gold.

Reconciliation of Estimated Mineral Reserves Under NI(cid:160)43-101 and Under SEC Industry Guide(cid:160)7
As mineral reserves are reported under both NI(cid:160)43-101 and SEC Industry Guide(cid:160)7 standards, it is possible for mineral 
reserve figures to vary between the two standards due to the differences in reporting requirements under each standard. For 
example, NI(cid:160)43-101 has a minimum requirement that mineral reserves be supported by a pre-feasibility study, whereas SEC 
Industry Guide 7 requires support from a detailed feasibility study that demonstrates that economic extraction is justified.
For our estimated mineral reserves at December(cid:160)31, 2014, there is no difference between the mineral reserves as disclosed
under NI(cid:160)43-101 and those disclosed under SEC Industry Guide 7, and therefore no reconciliation is provided.
NON-RESERVES—ESTIMATED MEASURED AND INDICATED MINERAL RESOURCES
Cautionary note to US investors concerning estimates of measured and indicated mineral resources
This section uses the terms "measured mineral resources" and "indicated mineral resources." We advise U.S. investors
that, while those terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize them. U.S. investors 
are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into 
mineral reserves.
The estimated measured and indicated mineral resources which are reported herein do not include that part of our mineral
resources that have been converted to proven and probable mineral reserves as shown above. Measured and indicated mineral 
resources have been estimated in accordance with the definitions of such terms adopted by the CIM and incorporated in 
NI(cid:160)43-101. We have filed a technical report regarding the disclosure of mineral resources for our material property, Mount 
Milligan Mine. Measured and indicated mineral resources are equivalent to mineralized material as such term is defined in SEC 
Industry Guide 7. See the Glossary of Terms below for an explanation of mining terms used in this report.
The total estimated measured and indicated mineral resources for all properties have been estimated at variable economic
cut-off grades based on the metal prices provided below, and on economic parameters deemed realistic. The economic cut-off 
grades for mineral resources are lower than those for mineral reserves and are indicative of the fact that the mineral resource 
estimates include material that may become economic under more favorable conditions, including increases in metal prices.

NON-RESERVES—ESTIMATED INFERRED MINERAL RESOURCES
Cautionary note to US investors concerning estimates of inferred mineral resources
This section uses the term "inferred mineral resources." We advise US investors that while this term is recognized and
required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize it. "Inferred mineral resources" have a great amount of 
uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or 
any part of inferred mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves. In accordance with Canadian rules, 
estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. US investors are 
cautioned not to assume that part or all of the inferred mineral resources exists, or is economically or legally mineable.
Inferred mineral resources have been estimated in accordance with the definitions of such terms adopted by the CIM and
incorporated in NI(cid:160)43-101. We have filed technical reports regarding the disclosure of mineral resources for TC Mine and 
Endako Mine, Mount Milligan, and the Berg property. See the Glossary of Terms below for an explanation of mining terms 
used in this report.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS
reserve
proven reserve
probable reserve
mineralized material (2)
non-reserves
The term "reserve" refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and 
legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Reserves must be supported 
by a feasibility(1) study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction. 
("Bankable standards" implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements 
developed in the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing.) A 
reserve includes adjustments to the in-situ tonnes and grade to include diluting materials and 
allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined.
The term "proven reserve" refers to reserves for which (a)(cid:160)quantity is computed from dimensions
revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the
results of detailed sampling and (b)(cid:160)the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced
so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape depth and mineral content
of reserves are well-established.
The term "probable reserve" refers to reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are
computed from information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for
inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced.
The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume
continuity between points of observation.
The term "mineralized material" refers to material that is not included in the reserve as it does not
meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction.
The term "non-reserves" refers to mineralized material that is not included in the reserve as it does
not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction.
_______________________________________________________________________________
(1) For SEC Industry Guide 7 purposes, the feasibility study must include adequate information on mining, processing,
metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is 
justified.
(2) This category is substantially equivalent to the combined categories of measured mineral resource and indicated mineral
resource specified in NI(cid:160)43-101.

Qualified Person (1)
The term "mineral reserve" refers to the economically mineable part of a measured or
indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. The study
must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other
relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be
justified. A mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may
occur when the material is mined.
The term "proven mineral reserve" refers to the economically mineable part of a measured
mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study. This study must
include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other
relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is
justified.
The term "probable mineral reserve" refers to the economically mineable part of an indicated
mineral resource, and in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource demonstrated by
at least a preliminary feasibility study. This study must include adequate information on
mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at
the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.
The term "mineral resource" refers to a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural
solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized organic material, including base and
precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals, in or on the Earth's crust, in such form and
quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a
mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and
knowledge.
The term "measured mineral resource" refers to that part of a mineral resource for which
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are so well established
that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of
technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the
economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration,
sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations
such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to
confirm both geological and grade continuity.
The term "indicated mineral resource" refers to that part of a mineral resource for which
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with
a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and
economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of
the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops,
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and
grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.
The term "inferred mineral resource" refers to that part of a mineral resource for which
quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and
limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.
The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
The term "Qualified Person" refers to an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist with at
least five years of experience in mineral exploration, mine development or operation or
mineral project assessment, or any combination of these, has experience relevant to the
subject matter of the mineral project and the technical report, and is a member in good
standing of a professional association.

ITEM 1A.(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our 
common stock. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that 
we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business.
Financial Risks
Extended declines in the prices of copper, gold and/or molybdenum would have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
and cash flows and could affect our ability to repay our debt. Fluctuations in the prices of copper, gold and/or molybdenum 
can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and materially and adversely affect the trading prices of our 
debt and common stock.
Our business is dependent on the prices of copper, gold and molybdenum, and given the fact that we are only operating 
Mount Milligan Mine at the present time, fluctuations of copper and gold prices will have a greater impact on our operating 
performance in the near future. The prices of copper, gold and molybdenum are volatile and are affected by numerous factors 
beyond our control. Factors tending to influence such prices include the following:
the rates of global economic growth;
regional and worldwide supply, including the start-up of new primary and bi-product mines;
regional and worldwide demand for products containing copper, gold and/or molybdenum;
the availability and cost of substitute materials;
inventory levels;
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  our production costs and the production costs of our competitors;
•  expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;
• 
• 
•  global or regional political or economic conditions, including interest rates and currency values; and
•  sales by central banks and other holders, speculators and producers in response to any of the above factors.
the relative strength of the US dollar and certain other currencies;
interest rates;
The prices of copper, gold and molybdenum have fluctuated historically. During the three years ended December 31,
2014, the average spot copper price on the London Metals Exchange ranged from a low of $3.01 to a high of $3.96 per pound, 
the average London(cid:160)P.M. fixed prices for gold per ounce on the London Bullion Market ranged from a low of $1,195 to a high 
of $1,792 and the average price for molybdenum quoted in(cid:160)Platts Metals Week ranged from a low of $8.70 to a high of $15.20 
per pound. There is no assurance that any hedging transactions designed to reduce the risk associated with fluctuations in metal 
prices will be successful.
Any decline in the prices of copper, gold or molybdenum adversely impacts our revenues, net income and cash flows and
could affect our ability to make necessary capital investments, repay our debt and meet our debt service and other fixed 
obligations, and depress the trading prices of our common stock and our publicly traded debt securities. Sustained declines in 
prices could also:
•  cause us to revise our operating plans, resulting in reduced output, temporary suspension of operations or closure of
•
•
one or more of our mines or other facilities;
further reduce revenues through production declines due to cessation of mining of deposits that have become 
uneconomic;
reduce funds available for capital expenditures, including installation of a secondary crushing circuit at Mount 
Milligan Mine;
•  delay or prevent our ability to make accretive acquisitions or conduct exploration work;
• 
•  cause us to write down assets and accelerate depletion, reclamation and closure charges.
reduce existing reserves due to economic viability; and

Extended delays and additional material capital requirements to fully ramp up operations at Mount Milligan Mine could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
While we achieved commercial production at Mount Milligan Mine (defined as 30 days of 60% design capacity mill 
throughput) as of February 18, 2014 and reached approximately 80% of design throughput in the second half of December 
2014, ramp-up efforts continue, and we will need to make certain additional capital investments to reach on a consistent basis 
throughput of 60,000 tpd. As previously disclosed, we have determined that a secondary crushing circuit at Mount Milligan 
Mine will be necessary to consistently reach 60,000 tpd, but due to current metal prices, construction will not commence until 
market conditions improve. If we experience extended delays in completing the ramp-up phase, experience other operational 
challenges requiring additional material capital expenditures, and/or copper and gold prices decline significantly, we may need 
to write down Mount Milligan Mine's assets or make the decision to cease mining operations and production at Mount Milligan 
Mine, each or both of which would have a material adverse impact on our business. Our profitability will be substantially 
impacted by our ability to successfully operate Mount Milligan Mine at design capacity within our projected time frame and 
budget.
Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, our total debt was approximately $944.7 million, including equipment lease obligations, and
we have unused net funding commitments of $12.6 million available under the Caterpillar equipment financing facility. We also 
have $761.5 million in deferred revenue under our Gold Stream Arrangement. Until the deposits received in the Gold Stream 
Arrangement have been fully offset against Royal Gold’s purchases of gold under the agreement, the deposits will be secured 
by our Mount Milligan Mine assets. After the deposits have been fully offset, Royal Gold will continue to have a security 
interest in 52.25% of the refined gold produced from Mount Milligan Mine.
Subject to the limits contained in the indentures that govern our outstanding 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, the
amended and restated gold stream agreement with Royal Gold, and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur 
additional debt. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our high level of debt could 
have important negative consequences, including:
•
•
•
•  making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt and increasing the risk that we default on
our debt obligations;
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or 
other general corporate requirements;
requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, 
thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other 
general corporate purposes;
increasing our vulnerability to declines in the prices of our commodities, general adverse economic and industry 
conditions;
limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;
limiting management's discretion in operating our business;
• 
• 
•  placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; 
• 
•
increasing our cost of borrowing; and
limiting our ability to pursue certain types of strategic opportunities.
We may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and meet our ongoing liquidity needs, and we 
may not be able to refinance all or a portion of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and other 
liquidity needs depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to multiple factors, including prevailing 
economic conditions and commodity prices, some of which are beyond our control. There is no assurance that we will generate 
sufficient cash flow from operations or be able to obtain additional financing, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, to 
service our debt and fund our ongoing liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt on or 
before maturity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt depends on the condition of the capital markets and our 
financial condition, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
The indentures that govern our outstanding 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes and our Amended and Restated Gold 
Stream Agreement with Royal Gold contain covenants that restrict our current and future operations and limit our flexibility 
and ability to respond to changes or take certain actions.
The indentures that govern our outstanding 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes contain certain restrictive covenants
that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and, in some circumstances, limit our ability to engage in 
actions that may be in our long-term best interest, including, among other things, our ability to:
29
Table of Contents
incur additional debt;
• 
•  sell, lease or transfer our assets;
•  pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;
•  prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;
•  make loans or investments;
•  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends;
•  make capital expenditures and investments;
•  guarantee debts or other obligations;
•  create liens;
•  enter into transactions with our affiliates; and
•  enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganization transactions.
In addition, our amended and restated gold stream agreement with Royal Gold contains restrictions on our ability to incur
additional secured debt.
These restrictions could limit our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy or secure the needed working capital to 
withstand future downturns in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities 
that may arise, any of which could place us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors that may have less debt and are not 
subject to such restrictions.
A default under any of our indebtedness arrangements could trigger cross defaults to our other agreements, which could 
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
A failure to satisfy any of our debt obligations could be exacerbated by cross default provisions. For example, a default
under the Caterpillar equipment financing facility will trigger cross defaults to our amended and restated gold stream agreement 
with Royal Gold, and vice versa, and could also trigger cross defaults to the indentures governing our outstanding notes and 
other material agreements. In the event of a default under the Caterpillar equipment financing facility, Caterpillar could: (1) 
terminate the lease by us of equipment purchased by the lender and leased to us pursuant to the facility; (2) terminate the 
lender's obligation to purchase additional equipment and lease such equipment to us pursuant to the terms of the facility; (3) 
accelerate the payment of all lease payments unpaid under the facility, together with default interest; (4) accelerate the payment 
of the balance of the purchase price for equipment, which would have been due and payable from the date of termination; and 
(5) foreclose on the equipment purchased and leased under the facility and apply the proceeds from the sale of such equipment 
to any shortfall in the payment by us of amounts due. In the event of default under our amended and restated gold stream 
agreement with Royal Gold, Royal Gold could require us to repay the amounts Royal Gold has invested in Mount Milligan 
Mine, as adjusted and reflected in the deposit record maintained in accordance with the agreement, which amounts totaled 
$734.4 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014. In the event of a default under the indentures governing the 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes 
and 2019 Notes, the trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal of the outstanding 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, 
as applicable, may declare the principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to be immediately due 
and payable. If we were to default under any of these arrangements, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such 
indebtedness upon a default or have access to sufficient alternative sources of funds. If we are unable to repay the indebtedness, 
the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
We may enter into provisionally-priced sales contracts, which could have a negative impact on our revenues if prices 
decline.
From time to time, we enter into provisionally-priced sales contracts, whereby the contracts settle at prices to be
determined at a future date. The future pricing mechanism of these agreements constitutes an embedded derivative, which is 
bifurcated and separately marked to estimated fair value at the end of each period. Changes to the fair value of embedded 
derivatives related to sales agreements are included in sales revenue in the determination of net income. To the extent final 
prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to sales, respectively, is 
recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of falling commodities prices, our revenues 
are negatively impacted by lower prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from a decrease related to 
the final pricing of provisionally-priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior years; in times of rising commodities 
prices, the opposite occurs.

A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future 
borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.
Our debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by
a rating agency if, in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse 
changes, so warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our 
outstanding debt securities. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to 
obtain additional debt financing and could lead our suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business to require us to 
provide financial assurance in the normal course of our operations.
Our operations are subject to currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial 
condition.
Exchange rate fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in our operations. Our costs for Endako Mine and Mount 
Milligan Mine are incurred principally in Canadian dollars. However, our future revenue is tied to market prices for copper, 
gold, molybdenum, and silver, which are denominated in US dollars. The appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US 
dollar can increase the cost of our production and capital expenditures in US dollars, and our results of operations and financial 
condition could be materially adversely affected. Although we have in the past used, and may in the future use, hedging 
strategies to limit our exposure to currency fluctuations, there can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be 
successful or that they will mitigate the risk of such fluctuations.
Mine closure and reclamation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made and our inability 
to provide reclamation bonding or maintain insurance could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
We are required by US federal and state laws and Canadian federal and provincial laws to provide financial assurance
sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so. These laws are 
complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and 
reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance. The amount and nature of the financial assurances are 
dependent upon a number of factors, including our financial condition and reclamation cost estimates.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, we had provided the appropriate regulatory authorities in the United States and Canada with
approximately $79 million in reclamation financial assurance for our share of mine closure obligations in the various 
jurisdictions in which we operate. As our operations expand or reclamation expenses increase, our reclamation obligations and 
the financial assurances that we are required to provide may increase accordingly. Changes to these amounts, as well as the 
nature of the security to be provided, could significantly increase our costs, making the maintenance and development of 
existing and new mines less economically feasible. To the extent that the value of the security provided to the regulatory 
authorities is or becomes insufficient to cover the amount of financial assurance we are required to post, we would be required 
to replace or supplement the existing security with more expensive forms of security, which might include cash deposits, which 
would reduce our cash available for operations and financing activities.
We have initiated discussions with relevant US federal and state agencies concerning additional bonding or funding of a 
trust agreement to cover long-term water treatment at TC Mine, although we are not currently under any requirement to do so. 
The amount of funding required is subject to numerous variables, potentially including an appropriate discount rate, and cannot 
be determined at this time. We may be required to engage in a similar discussion with provincial authorities in British Columbia 
with respect to the Endako Mine.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or add to our current level of financial assurance. Failure to
provide regulatory authorities with the required financial assurances could potentially result in the closure of one or more of our 
operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
We are required, from time to time, to post financial assurances, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be 
able to obtain financial assurances on acceptable terms.
In addition to our reclamation bonding obligations, we are from time to time required to post other financial assurance in 
the normal course of conducting our daily activities. This financial assurance can take several forms, including, but not limited 
to, letters of credit, performance bonds, deposits into escrow accounts for the benefit of the counterparty, trust funds or other 
funding mechanisms for long-term, post-reclamation obligations or the posting of cash collateral directly with the counterparty. 
In each case, the form of financial assurance to be provided is dictated by several factors, including expected length of time the 
financial assurance obligation is expected to remain outstanding, the amount of the obligation, the cost to us of providing the 
various forms of financial assurance and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Our ability to obtain certain forms of 
financial assurance going forward will be impacted by our future financial performance, changes to our credit rating and other 
factors that may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain certain forms of financial
31
Table of Contents
assurance going forward or that we will be able to post cash collateral in lieu of being able to secure one of these other forms of 
financial assurance.
We will rely on a few key customers for our copper-gold concentrate from Mount Milligan Mine, and the loss of any one key 
customer could reduce our revenues.
We have entered into four multi-year concentrate sales agreements for the sale of copper-gold-silver concentrate produced 
at Mount Milligan Mine. Pursuant to these agreements, we have agreed to sell an aggregate of approximately 140,000 tonnes of 
concentrate in calendar year 2015, 140,000 tonnes in calendar year 2016, and 40,000 tonnes in each of calendar years 2017 and 
2018. A breach of the applicable sales agreement by us or the applicable customer, a significant dispute with one of these 
customers, a force majeure event affecting the parties' respective performances under the agreement, early termination of the 
agreement, or any other event significantly negatively impacting the contractual relationship with one of these customers could 
harm our financial condition. If, in such an event, we are unable to sell the affected concentrate volume to another customer, or 
we sell the affected concentrate to another customer on terms less advantageous terms to us, our revenues could be negatively 
impacted. 
Our commodity hedging activities may reduce the realized prices we receive for our copper and gold, and involve market risk 
for the fair value of the derivatives, credit risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us, and 
financial risk due to fluctuations in the fair value of the derivatives.
In order to manage our cash flow exposure to copper and gold price volatility in selling production from Mount Milligan 
Mine, we enter into commodity derivatives from time to time for a portion or all of our expected production. Additionally, we 
receive cash provisional payments in selling production for Mount Milligan Mine, thus requiring that we purchase gold in order 
to satisfy our obligation to pay Royal Gold in gold. We enter into commodity derivatives from time to time in order to manage 
our gold price risk that arises when physical purchase and concentrate sales pricing periods do no match. We currently have in 
place unsecured hedging lines with various banks and trading companies in order to manage these exposures.
Commodity derivatives may limit the prices we actually realize and therefore could reduce our copper and gold revenues in 
the future. Our commodity hedging activities could impact our earnings in various ways, including recognition of certain mark-
to-market gains and losses on derivative instruments. The fair value of our derivative instruments could fluctuate significantly 
between periods.
Our commodity derivatives may expose us to significant market risk, which is the risk that the fair value of a commodity 
derivative might be adversely affected by a change in underlying commodity prices or a change in our expected production, which 
may result in a significant financial loss on the derivative. We mitigate the potential market risk by establishing trading agreements 
with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or make any margin calls on our derivatives. Our 
counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. We also mitigate the 
risk of having commodity derivative transactions in excess of our production by entering into derivatives for only a portion of our 
expected production.
Our commodity derivatives also expose us to credit risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to 
us. We mitigate the potential credit risk by entering into derivatives with a number of counterparties, limiting the amount of 
exposure to any one counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties. If any of our counterparties were 
to default on its obligations to us under the derivative transaction or seek bankruptcy protection, it could result in a larger 
percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes which may have a significant adverse effect on 
our cash flow, our earnings and our financial condition. The risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic 
environment.
The estimates contained in our production and cost guidance may not be achieved.
We provide estimates of future production, cash costs and capital costs for our operations. No assurance can be given that
such estimates will be achieved. Many of the factors described in this Item 1A may result in our failure to achieve our 
production estimates or materially increase our costs, either of which would have an adverse impact on our future cash flows, 
results of operations, and financial condition.
An extended decline in metals prices, an increase in operating or capital costs, or a reduction in mineral reserve estimates, 
among other things, may cause us to record additional write downs, which could negatively impact our results of operations.
When events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we
evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value by comparing it to the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or 
asset group. Under U.S. GAAP, the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the 
anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. The economic environment,
32
Table of Contents
copper, gold and molybdenum prices, and our stock price may be considered as impairment indicators for the purposes of these 
impairment assessments. As disclosed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K, we have recorded an aggregate of $104.8 million in non-
cash write downs of our exploration properties and our molybdenum fixed assets and materials and supplies inventory in 2014, 
primarily as a result of adverse conditions in the molybdenum market. If prices of copper, gold, and molybdenum decline for an 
extended period of time, if we fail to contain costs, or if we are required to reduce our mineral reserve estimates at our mines, 
we may be required to recognize further asset impairments and record additional write downs in the future, which would have 
an adverse impact on our results of operations.
Operational Risks
Our business is subject to production and operational risks that could adversely affect our business and our insurance may 
not cover these risks and hazards adequately or at all.
Mining and metals processing involve significant production and operational risks, some of which are outside of our
control, including the following:
•  unanticipated ground and water conditions;
•  adverse claims to water rights and shortages of water to which we have rights;
•  adjacent or adverse land or mineral ownership that results in constraints on current or future mine operations;
•  geological problems, including earthquakes and other natural disasters;
•  metallurgical and other processing problems;
•  unusual or unexpected rock formations;
•  ground or slope failures;
• 
•  structural cave-ins, wall failures or rock-slides;
• 
•  equipment failures;
•  periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or operating conditions and other force
tailings design or operational issues, including dam breaches or failures;
flooding or fires;
majeure events;
lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates;
the results of litigation, including appeals of agency decisions;
• 
•  accidents;
•  delays in the receipt of or failure to receive necessary government permits;
• 
•  delays in transportation;
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
interruption of energy supply;
labor disputes;
inability to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage;
the availability of drilling and related equipment in the area where mining operations will be conducted; and
the failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or expectations.
These risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, our mines, mills and roasting facilities, resulting in partial or 
complete shutdowns, personal injury or death, environmental or other damage to our properties or the properties of others, 
delays in mining, reduced production, monetary losses and potential legal liability. Milling operations are subject to hazards, 
such as equipment failure or failure of retaining dams around tailings disposal areas that may result in personal injury or death, 
environmental pollution and consequential liabilities.
In addition, we rely on a few key vendors for the transportation of concentrate from Mount Milligan Mine to our
customers. Concentrate is transported from the mine site to Mackenzie, British Columbia, Canada by truck pursuant to a 
contract with a single trucking company, then to Vancouver by rail pursuant to a contract with a single railway operator, stored 
at the Port of Vancouver pursuant to a contract with the Port of Vancouver terminal operator, and shipped to our customers 
pursuant to a contract with a single shipping provider. A breach of the applicable contract by any of these vendors, a significant 
dispute with any of these vendors, a force majeure event or other operational or financial issues affecting one or more of these 
vendors, including labor strikes or work stoppages, or any other event that would significantly impede the ability of these 
vendors to perform their contractual obligations to us or that would have a significant negative impact on our contractual 
relationship with them would adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations to our customers, which could have a 
material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Our insurance will not cover all the potential risks associated with our operations. In addition, although certain risks are
insurable, we may be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. Moreover, insurance
33
Table of Contents
against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally 
available to us or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable terms. We might also become subject to liability for 
pollution or other hazards that may not be insured against or that we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs 
or other reasons. Losses from these events may cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon 
our business. Furthermore, should we be unable to fund fully the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be 
required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy.
Increased operating costs could affect our profitability.
Costs at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as changing ore grade, 
changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body. In addition, 
costs at our mines and at our
Facility are affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, grinding media,
mill liners, explosives, steel and concrete. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including 
increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable and changes in laws and regulations affecting their 
price, use and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at 
any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.
Our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies.
Our operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Continuous 
production at our mines depends on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims. Although each operation has sufficient 
water rights and claims to cover current operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of future legal 
proceedings affecting our water rights, claims and uses. The failure to obtain needed water permits, the loss of some or all water 
rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights due to weather, equipment issues 
or other factors could require us to curtail or close mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion 
opportunities.
The temporary shutdown of any of our operations could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our access to 
skilled labor.
From time to time, we may have to temporarily shut down one or more of our operating sites if they are not commercially
viable due to factors such as declines in metal prices, increased costs, and adverse changes in interest rates or currency 
exchange rates. For example, effective December 31, 2014, we and our joint venture partner temporarily suspended operations 
at Endako Mine due to recent and expected ongoing weakness in the molybdenum price. During this temporary suspension and 
other temporary shutdowns that may arise in the future, we will have to continue to expend capital to maintain the site or 
facility and equipment. In addition, reductions in workforce, advance notice requirements under collective labor agreements or 
applicable law, and severance obligations arising from such suspension could cause us to incur significant labor costs. 
Furthermore, temporary shutdowns may adversely affect our future access to skilled labor, as employees who are laid off may 
seek employment elsewhere.
In addition, if our operations are shut down for an extended period of time, we may be required to engage in
environmental remediation of the plant sites or accelerated reclamation of our mines, which would require us to incur additional 
costs. The costs of ramping up production at one of our operations following a temporary shutdown could be significant. Given 
the costs involved in a temporary shutdown of our operations, we may instead choose to continue to operate those operations at 
a loss. Such a decision could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to substantial government regulation. Changes to regulation or more stringent implementation could have a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our mining, processing, development and mineral exploration activities are subject to various laws governing
prospecting, development, production, taxes, labor standards and occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances and other 
matters. Mining and exploration activities are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the 
environment. No assurance can be given that we will remain in compliance with applicable regulations or that new rules and 
regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules and regulations will not be applied in a manner that could limit or curtail 
production or development of our properties. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing our operations and 
activities or more stringent implementation thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and 
results of operations.
Over the course of the last several years, significant new corporate governance and disclosure regulations and
requirements have been adopted by US federal and state and Canadian federal, state and provincial governments, as well as the
34
Table of Contents
stock exchanges on which our common stock is listed. We are required to expend significant resources to monitor and 
implement these new rules and regulations. These additional compliance costs and related diversion of the attention of 
management and key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of 
operations.
Estimates of mineral reserves and projected cash flows may prove to be inaccurate, which could negatively impact our 
results of operations and financial condition.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves and the future cash flows that might be derived
from their production. Accordingly, the figures for mineral reserves and future cash flows contained in this Form(cid:160)10-K are 
estimates only. In respect of mineral reserve estimates, no assurance can be given that the anticipated tonnages and grades will 
be achieved, that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably. 
The ore grade actually recovered may differ from the estimated grades of the mineral reserves and mineral resources.
In addition, actual future cash flows may differ materially from estimates. Estimates of mineral reserves, and future cash
flows to be derived from the production of such mineral reserves, necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and 
assumptions, including, among others, geological and mining conditions that may not be fully identified by available 
exploration data or that may differ from experience in current operations; historical production from the area compared with 
production from other producing areas; the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and assumptions 
concerning metal prices; exchange rates; interest rates; inflation; operating costs; development and maintenance costs; 
reclamation and post-reclamation costs; and the availability and cost of labor, equipment, raw materials and other services 
required to mine and refine the ore. Market price fluctuations of copper, gold and molybdenum, as well as increased production 
costs or reduced recovery rates, may render mineral reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomical 
to recover and may ultimately result in a restatement of mineral resources. In addition, there can be no assurance that mineral 
recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production.
For these reasons, estimates of our mineral reserves contained in this Form(cid:160)10-K, including classifications thereof based
on probability of recovery, and any estimates of future cash flows expected from the production of those mineral reserves, 
prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially. The actual volume and grade 
of mineral reserves mined and processed, and the actual cash flows derived from that production, may not be as currently 
anticipated in such estimates. If our actual mineral reserves or cash flows are less than our estimates, our results of operations 
and financial condition may be materially impaired.
Future growth depends on our ability to bring new mines into production and to expand mineral reserves at existing mines.
Our ability to replenish our reserves is important to our long-term viability. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several
ways, including by expanding known ore bodies, locating new deposits or acquiring new reserves from third parties. 
Exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of sufficient 
additional mineral deposits that can be mined profitably. Once a site with mineralization is discovered, it may take several years 
from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, if ever, during which time the economic feasibility of production 
may change. As a result, there is no assurance that current or future exploration programs, such as the Berg property, and 
additional drilling at our existing operating mines, will be successful.
We intend to grow our business by acquiring quality mining assets. However, our capital available for new exploration
projects and acquisitions is constrained due in large part to our substantial indebtedness incurred in connection with the 
development of Mount Milligan Mine and declines in metals prices. In addition, there can be no assurance that suitable 
acquisition opportunities will be identified or, if identified, that acquisitions will be consummated on favorable terms or at all. 
Our ability to identify, consummate and to integrate effectively any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be 
limited by the number of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources, competition from other mining 
companies and, to the extent necessary, our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, we compete 
for attractive acquisition targets with other potential buyers that have more financial and other resources than us. There is a risk 
that depletion of reserves will not be offset by discoveries or acquisitions. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that our 
exploration, development or acquisition efforts will result in any new commercial mining operations or yield new mineral 
reserves to replace or expand current mineral reserves. If we are not able to replace depleted reserves, it could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.
Certain of our mines and exploration properties are located on land that is or may become subject to traditional territory 
and/or title claims by certain First Nations, and such claims and the attendant obligations of the provincial and federal 
governments to those First Nations may affect our current and future operations.
35
Table of Contents
Mount Milligan Mine, Endako Mine, the Berg property, and certain of our other properties are located on land in British 
Columbia and Nunavut that is or may become subject to various use and/or title claims by First Nations. The nature and extent 
of First Nations' rights and title to territory in Canada has been, and continues to be, the subject of extensive debate, claims, and 
litigation. In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized, for the first time in history, aboriginal title to a certain tract of 
land in British Columbia. While this recognition does not legally change the consultation and accommodation obligations of the 
provincial and federal governments with respect to actions affecting the land, including actions to approve or grant mining 
rights or permits, the decision may impact governmental actions and processes relating to economic development on such lands 
going forward, which could adversely impact our ability to obtain permits, licenses, and other approvals for our operations or 
exploration and development projects. Opposition by First Nations to our presence, operations or development on land subject 
to their traditional territory or title claims could negatively impact us in terms of public perception, costly legal proceedings, 
potential blockades or other interference by third parties in our operations, or court-ordered relief impacting our operations. In 
addition, we may be required to, or may voluntarily, enter into certain agreements with such First Nations in order to facilitate 
development of our properties, which could reduce the expected earnings or income from any future production. 
Shortages of critical parts, equipment and skilled labor may adversely affect our operations and development projects.
The mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input 
commodities, drilling equipment, milling equipment, tires and skilled labor. These shortages have, at times, impacted the 
efficiency of our operations and resulted in cost increases and delays related to construction of the new mill at Endako Mine 
and the construction of Mount Milligan Mine. Such cost increases and delays affect operating costs, capital expenditures and 
production and construction schedules.  
We are required to obtain government permits in order to conduct operations.
Government approvals and permits are currently required in connection with all of our operations, and further approvals
and permits may be required in the future. We must obtain and maintain a variety of licenses and permits, which include or 
cover without limitation air quality, water quality, water rights, dam safety, emergency preparedness, hazardous materials, waste 
rock management, solid waste and tailings operations. The duration and success of our efforts to obtain permits are contingent 
upon many variables outside of our control. Obtaining governmental permits may increase costs and cause delays depending on 
the nature of the activity to be permitted and the applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority. There can be 
no assurance that all necessary permits will be obtained or timely obtained and, if obtained, that the costs involved will not 
exceed our estimates or that we will be able to maintain such permits. To the extent such approvals are required and not 
obtained or maintained, our operations may be curtailed, or we may be prohibited from proceeding with planned exploration, 
development or operation of our mineral properties.
Our Langeloth Facility is currently operating with a National Pollutants Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES")
permit, the terms of which have expired. However, the Langeloth Facility is authorized to continue to operate under its existing 
permit until a renewed permit is issued. On June 30, 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection 
("PaDEP") issued to us a final Title V air quality permit for the Langeloth Facility. A new NPDES permit, or revisions to our air 
quality permit, may contain more onerous requirements with which we must comply, and we could be required to install costly 
new pollution control equipment or to curtail or cease our operations, and our business may be adversely affected. Violations of 
the existing, or new, air quality or NPDES permit conditions at the Langeloth Facility could result in a range of criminal and 
civil penalties under the federal Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act or the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law or Air Pollution 
Control Act.
TC Mine is also currently operating with an expired NPDES permit. TC Mine is authorized by federal regulation to
continue to operate under its existing permit until the renewed permit is issued. A renewed NPDES permit may contain more 
onerous requirements with which we must comply, and we could be required to install costly new pollution control equipment 
or to curtail or cease our operations, and our business may be adversely affected. Violations of the existing, or new, NPDES 
permit conditions at TC Mine could result in a range of criminal and civil penalties under the federal Clean Water Act.
Our operations plan for Mount Milligan Mine provides that employees have the option to live in an operations residence
located on the minesite, and that copper-gold concentrate from the mill will be transported to the District of Mackenzie (as 
opposed to Fort St. James) to be loaded onto railcars for transport to the Port of Vancouver. To construct and operate an 
operations residence and to load out concentrate in Mackenzie, we applied for and obtained an amendment to our 
Environmental Assessment Certificate for Mount Milligan Mine. Any failure to comply with the amendment as issued may 
have a material adverse effect on our business.
Obtaining and maintaining the various permits for our mine development operations and exploration projects, including 
the Berg property, will be complex, time-consuming and expensive. Changes in a mine's design, production rates, quality of 
material mined and many other matters often require submission of the proposed changes for agency approval prior to
36
Table of Contents
implementation, and these may not be obtained. In addition, changes in operating conditions beyond our control, changes in 
agency policy and federal and state laws, litigation or community opposition could further affect the successful permitting of 
operations.
Title to some of our mineral properties may be challenged or defective. Any impairment or defect in title could have a 
negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
The acquisition of title to mineral properties is a very detailed and time-consuming process. There is no guarantee that
title to any of our properties will not be challenged or impaired. Third parties may have valid claims underlying portions of our 
interests, including prior unregistered liens; agreements; transfers or claims, including aboriginal land claims; and title may be 
affected by, among other things, undetected defects. As a result, we may be constrained in our ability to operate our properties 
or unable to enforce our rights with respect to our properties. An impairment to, or defect in, title to our properties could have a 
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Major network failures could have an adverse effect on our business.
Major equipment failures, natural disasters including severe weather, terrorist acts, acts of war, cyber attacks or other
breaches of network systems or security that affect computer systems within our network could disrupt our business functions, 
including our production activities. Our mines and mills are automated and networked such that a cyber incident involving our 
information systems and related infrastructure could negatively impact our operations. A corruption of our financial or 
operational data or an operational disruption of our production infrastructure could, among other potential impacts, result in: (i) 
loss of production or accidental discharge; (ii) expensive remediation efforts; (iii) distraction of management; (iv) damage to 
our reputation or our relationship with customers; or (v) in events of noncompliance, which events could lead to regulatory 
fines or penalties. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial 
condition.
Environmental Risks  
We must comply with comprehensive environmental statutes, regulations and other governmental controls, and we face 
significant environmental risks.
All phases of our operations are subject to environmental regulation. In Canada and the United States, environmental laws 
provide for, among other things, restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases, emissions and discharges of various substances 
produced in association with, or resulting from, our operations. These laws also require that facility sites and mines be operated, 
maintained and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities, including long-term obligations. Compliance 
with such laws, including without limitation, detailed monitoring and reporting requirements, can require significant 
expenditures. An exceedance of a permit limitation or failure to comply with a permit requirement may result in the imposition 
of fines and penalties, some of which may be material. Companies engaged in the exploration, development and operation of 
mineral properties often experience increased costs and delays as a result of the compliance with applicable laws, regulations 
and permits.
For example, a decision to mine Phase 8 (the next phase of production) at TC Mine, would entail expansion of some
facilities, with additional permitted surface disturbance on approximately 300 acres of US Bureau of Land Management 
("BLM") administered land, 185 acres of National Forest System land and approximately 85 acres of private land owned by us. 
As a result, the mining of Phase 8 is subject to environmental analysis and preparation of an environmental impact statement 
("EIS") pursuant to the federal National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). The EIS would also cover a proposed land 
exchange in which we would receive approximately 5,000 acres of BLM land in exchange for 900 acres of private lands owned 
by us. The BLM is the lead agency for preparation of the EIS and other federal and state agencies are cooperating agencies. If 
and when completed, the EIS would be the basis for Records of Decision (RODs) by both the BLM and the United States 
Forest Service to approve our proposed Modified Mine Plan of Operations, by the BLM to approve the proposed land exchange 
(including a related amendment of the Resource Management Plan for the BLM's Challis Resource Area) and by the US Army 
Corps of Engineers to approve issuance of a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. There is no assurance that the 
EIS will be completed, or that the RODs will be issued, or that these documents will be completed or issued on terms and 
conditions acceptable to us. The agencies' preferred alternatives in the EIS, or consultation pursuant to the Endangered Species 
Act, may include terms and conditions that impose regulatory or reclamation requirements that will materially increase our 
costs during operations and closure of TC Mine. Moreover, litigation may be filed challenging the NEPA process for the mine 
expansion or the land exchange and the result thereof, which could materially increase our costs, or prevent or delay our ability 
to implement the expansion or the land exchange.
Environmental regulation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and
penalties for noncompliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of
37
Table of Contents
training and responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Existing or future environmental 
regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We own or have 
owned, manage or have been in care or control of properties that may result in a requirement to environmentally remediate such 
properties that could involve material costs. In addition, environmental conditions or hazards may exist on the properties in 
which we hold interests that are unknown to us at present or that have been caused by previous or existing owners or operators 
of the properties. We may also acquire properties with environmental risks, and the indemnification proceeds we receive from 
the entity we acquire such properties from, if any, may not be adequate to pay all the fines, penalties and costs (including costs 
of remediation or removal and related response costs) incurred at or related to such properties.
Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions,
including compliance and other orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, 
and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, operation or 
administration costs or other remedial actions. Parties engaged in mining operations, including us, may be required to 
compensate those suffering loss or damage to person or property by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or 
criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Amendments to current laws, regulations 
and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies, or more stringent implementation or enforcement thereof, 
could have a material adverse impact on us and cause increases in exploration expenses, remedial and reclamation obligations, 
capital expenditures or production costs, reduction in levels of production at producing properties, or abandonment of or delays 
in development of new mining properties.
Regulation of greenhouse gas emissions effects and climate change issues may adversely affect our operations and markets.
Global climate change continues to attract considerable public, scientific and regulatory attention, and greenhouse gas
emission regulation is becoming more commonplace and stringent. As energy, including energy produced from the combustion 
of carbon-based fuels, is a significant input to our mining and processing operations, we must also comply with emerging 
climate change regulatory requirements, including programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our principal energy sources 
are electricity, purchased petroleum products and natural gas. In addition, our processing facilities and mobile mining 
equipment emit carbon dioxide.
On July(cid:160)1, 2008, the Province of British Columbia introduced a carbon tax on the purchase or use of fossil fuels within the 
province. The current carbon tax rate is $30 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. British Columbia has determined 
to maintain the carbon tax, but not to increase the rate. Endako Mine and Mount Milligan Mine are located in British Columbia, 
and the carbon tax may have a material impact on our energy and compliance costs.
The US federal and state governments may also enact an emission trading or similar program for greenhouse gas 
emissions, which could significantly increase our energy and regulatory compliance costs. For example, the US federal 
government has considered legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system of allowances and 
credits, among other provisions. In addition, the EPA has developed final rules requiring certain emitters of greenhouse gases to 
collect and report data with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions.
We are in the process of evaluating the potential impacts on our operations of these new and potential regulations. Either a
carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program will likely result in increased future energy costs. The regulations will also likely 
increase our compliance costs. For example, we may be required to install new equipment to reduce emissions from our 
processing facilities in order to comply with new regulatory standards or to mitigate the financial impact of a new climate 
change program. We also may be subject to additional and extensive monitoring and reporting requirements. It is uncertain at 
this time how provincial and regional initiatives will interact with any federal climate change regulations.
The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and may be particular to the 
unique geographic circumstances associated with each of our facilities. These may include changes in weather and rainfall 
patterns, water shortages, changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperatures. These physical impacts could 
require us to curtail or close mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion opportunities. These effects may 
adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations.
We must remove and reduce impurities and toxic substances naturally occurring in copper, gold and molybdenum and 
comply with applicable law relating thereto, which could result in remedial action and other costs.
Mineral ores and mineral products, including copper, gold and molybdenum ore and products, contain naturally occurring
impurities and toxic substances. Although we have implemented procedures that are designed to identify, isolate and safely 
remove or reduce such impurities and substances, such procedures require strict adherence and no assurance can be given that 
employees, contractors or others will not be exposed to or be affected by such impurities and toxic substances, which may 
subject us to liability. Standard operating procedures may not identify, isolate and safely remove or reduce such substances.
38
Table of Contents
Even with careful monitoring and effective control, there is still a risk that the presence of impurities or toxic substances in our 
products may result in such products being rejected by our customers, penalties being imposed due to such impurities or the 
products being barred from certain markets. Such incidents could require remedial action and could result in curtailment of 
operations. Legislation requiring manufacturers, importers and downstream users of chemical substances, including metals and 
minerals, to establish that the substances can be handled and used without negatively affecting health or the environment may 
impact our operations and markets. These potential compliance costs, litigation expenses, regulatory delays, remediation 
expenses and operational costs could negatively affect our financial results.
Other Risks
We own certain assets through joint ventures, and any disagreement or failure of partners to meet obligations could have a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Endako Mine is operated as a joint venture between our subsidiary, TCML, which holds a 75% interest, and Sojitz, which
holds the remaining 25% interest. As a result, our interest in Endako Mine is subject to the risks normally associated with the 
conduct of joint ventures. While we are the operator of Endako Mine, Sojitz has certain consent and veto rights pursuant to the 
agreement governing the joint venture. Any disagreement between us and Sojitz or Sojitz's failure to meet its obligations to the 
joint venture could have a material adverse impact on our profitability or the viability of our interests held through joint 
ventures, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial 
condition. 
Intense competition could reduce our market share or harm our financial performance.
The mining industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with many companies that have more financial and
technical resources than we do. Our competitive position is based on the quality and grade of our mineral reserves, our ability to 
manage our costs compared to other producers throughout the world, our ability to maintain our financial integrity through the 
lows of the metal price cycles and our ability to manage our customer relationships. Our costs are governed to a large extent by 
the location, grade and nature of our mineral reserves; our input costs including energy, labor and equipment; and our operating 
and management skills. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term 
is based on our ability to manage our costs, acquire and develop quality deposits and hire and retain a skilled workforce. We 
intend to continue to grow our business through our exploration program and through future acquisitions; however, in the near 
term our substantial indebtedness will limit our ability to significantly grow our business. Our competitors may have an 
advantageous market position and have greater financial and other resources and may, therefore, be able to better withstand 
poor and volatile market conditions, obtain financing on better terms and attract better or more qualified employees, any of 
which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are dependent upon key management personnel and executives.
We are dependent upon a number of key management personnel. Our ability to manage our exploration, development and 
operating activities, and hence our success, depend in large part on the efforts of these individuals. We face intense competition 
for qualified personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. We do not 
maintain "key person" life insurance. Accordingly, the loss of the services of one or more of such key management personnel 
could have a material adverse effect on our business.  
Our business depends on good relations with our employees.
Production at our operations depends on the efforts of our employees. Endako Mine and Langeloth Facility each have
certain unionized employees. The labor agreement currently in place with respect to the unionized employees at our Langeloth 
Facility is effective through March 11, 2016, and the labor agreement currently in place with respect to the unionized 
employees at Endako Mine is effective through March 31, 2015, with automatic annual renewals until either party provides 
notice requiring negotiation of a new collectively bargaining agreement. Although our unionized employees have agreed to "no-
strike" clauses in their respective union agreements, there can be no assurance that Endako Mine and Langeloth Facility will not 
suffer from work stoppages. A strike, lockout or other work stoppage at one or both of these operations could have a material 
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that one or both union 
agreements will be renewed on a timely basis and on terms favorable to us. There is also a possibility that our employees at TC 
Mine and Mount Milligan Mine will unionize in the future.
Further, changes in governmental regulations relating to labor relations, or otherwise in our relationship with our
employees, including our unionized employees, may result in strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages, any of which could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition.
39
Table of Contents
We are from time to time involved in or subject to legal proceedings related to our business. Such legal proceedings can
be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and 
other key personnel. The assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly 
subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. The outcome of litigation, 
arbitration or other legal proceedings, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ 
materially from management's outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual 
outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition, operating results, or cash flows.
Our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.
Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating
performance. Factors that could cause fluctuation in the price of our common stock may include, among other things:
•  changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;
•  speculation about our business in the press or the investment community;
•  conditions or trends in our industry or the economy generally;
•  changes in the prices of copper, gold or molybdenum;
•  stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in the
mining industry;
•  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;
•  capital commitments;
•  additions or departures of key personnel; and
•  sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors, officers or significant stockholders.
In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in
their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our management’s attention and 
resources.
If we cannot meet the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") or Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX") continued listing 
requirements, our common stock may be delisted.
Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). In the future, we may be
unable to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE and the TSX. For example, if the average closing price of our 
common stock falls below $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, our common stock may be delisted by the NYSE. The average 
closing price of our common stock during January 2015 was $1.39.
A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market
price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could 
negatively impact our ability to raise equity or debt financing; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage for the 
Company; and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.(cid:160)In addition, delisting 
from the NYSE and/or the TSX might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business.

ITEM 3.(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are from time to time involved in or subject to legal proceedings related to our business. While it is not feasible to
predict or determine the outcome of such proceedings, it is the opinion of management that the resolution of such proceeding is 
not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
ITEM 4.(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
Under Section(cid:160)1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, mine operators are required
to include in their periodic reports filed with the SEC certain information concerning mine safety violations and other 
regulatory matters. The required information is included in Exhibit(cid:160)95 to this report.

•  Open market bond repurchases from December 2014 through the first week of January 2015 resulted in the
principal retirement of $32.9 million of our outstanding principal amount of unsecured bonds, reducing future interest 
payments by approximately $13.3 million. Total cash used through December 31, 2014 for this program was $23.4 
million, with the total cash used for the program through the first week of January 2015 of $30.4 million. These bond 
repurchases in December 2014 and January 2015, combined with the execution of the tMEDS exchange offer in the 
second quarter of 2014, have reduced our outstanding principal debt by $43.8 million and extinguished future interest 
payments by $14.1 million.
•  Capital expenditures in 2014 were $82.1 million, comprised of $77.0 million for Mount Milligan Mine (including 
payment of approximately $21.0 million related to 2013 accruals in connection with the construction and development) 
and $5.1 million of other capital costs for Endako Mine, TC Mine, the Langeloth Facility and corporate combined, 
compared to $428.9 million in 2013.
See "Financial Review" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this MD&A for additional information related to
highlights.
Overview
We are a North American mining company. Through 2014 we operated a copper and gold mine, two primary
molybdenum mines and a metallurgical roasting facility. Our Mount Milligan Mine is a conventional truck-shovel open-pit 
copper and gold mine and concentrator with a 60,000 tpd copper-gold flotation processing plant in British Columbia, Canada. 
Our molybdenum properties are TC Mine, an open-pit molybdenum mine and concentrator in Idaho, USA, and Endako Mine, 
an open-pit molybdenum mine, concentrator and roaster in British Columbia, Canada in which we own a 75% joint venture 
interest. We also operate the Langeloth Facility in Pennsylvania, USA.
Through December 31, 2014 we had three reportable segments, based on products and geography: Copper-Gold, US
Operations Molybdenum and Canadian Operations Molybdenum. The Copper-Gold segment includes all expenditures, 
including all mining, milling, on-site general and administration and transportation from Mount Milligan Mine. The US 
Operations Molybdenum segment includes all mining, milling, mine site administration, transportation, roasting (at the 
Langeloth Facility) and sale of molybdenum products from TC Mine, as well as all roasting and sales of third-party purchased 
material from the Langeloth Facility. The Canadian Operations Molybdenum segment includes all mining, milling, on-site 
general and administration, transportation, roasting (at the Langeloth Facility) and sale of molybdenum products from the 75% 
owned Endako Mine.
Commencing in 2015, we are shifting the core focus of our business to copper and gold while at the same time developing 
a strategy to achieve positive cash flow from our molybdenum business. This shift is primarily the result of recent and expected 
ongoing weakness in the molybdenum market due to additional supply of molybdenum from new copper producers that 
produce molybdenum as a by-product. Please see Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K for further discussion about our business.
Commodity Prices
Our financial results can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and
molybdenum and fluctuations in our production. World market prices for our products have fluctuated historically and are 
affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Any significant weakness in demand or reduction in prices may have a 
material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.
The average published price for our products has fluctuated as follows for the periods shown:

We have a hedging program in place to provide downside protection for copper and gold prices for 2015. We have hedged 
(using forward sales contracts) approximately 8 million pounds of Mount Milligan Mine’s monthly copper production through 
May 2015 at an average price of approximately $3.10 per pound. In addition, as of December 31, 2014 we have hedged (using 
zero cost collars) approximately 22,000 ounces of our share of the gold for January through December 2015 at floor prices 
ranging from $1,150 per ounce to $1,175 per ounce and at ceiling prices ranging from $1,237 per ounce to $1,267 per ounce. 
We also hedged an additional 3,300 ounces of our share of the gold at $1,230 per ounce for January 2015 (using a forward sales 
contract). Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we entered into additional zero cost copper and gold collars as described below:

Copper-Gold
Mount Milligan Mine reached commercial production as of February 18, 2014. Ramp-up activities continued through
2014 and are ongoing. As of December 31, 2014, Mount Milligan Mine has an estimated life of approximately 24(cid:160)years (based 
on an assumed spot copper price of $3.00 per pound and an assumed spot gold price of $1,250 per ounce) and estimated 
average annual production of approximately 85 million pounds of copper and 186,700 ounces of gold in 155,000 tonnes of 
concentrate over the life of the mine. For the years 2015 through 2019, the average annual production is estimated to be higher 
at approximately 94 million pounds of copper and 285,800 ounces of gold in 165,000 tonnes of concentrate. As discussed in 
Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K, the updated Mount Milligan Mine mineral reserve estimates increase ore tonnes by 
approximately 14%, increase contained copper by approximately 15%, and increase contained gold by approximately 4%, in 
each case, as compared to the mineral reserve estimates reported in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 
31, 2013. These updated reserves are expected to positively impact DD&A in the future. Please see “Mineral Reserves” in 
Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K for important information regarding the calculation of mineral reserves for Mount Milligan 
Mine.
As previously disclosed, we have determined that additional crushing will be necessary to consistently achieve mill 
throughput of 60,000 tonnes per day ("tpd"), and we expect to construct a permanent secondary crushing circuit at Mount 
Milligan Mine when market conditions improve. In 2015, the detailed engineering phase is expected to be completed and 
commitments are expected to be made for the long lead items. The final capital cost estimate for the project will be determined 
once the detailed engineering is completed, and it is expected to be near the high end of the previously announced range of $50 
- $75 million, inclusive of the approximately $15 million in costs that we expect to incur in 2015 for the engineering work and 
commitments for long lead items. Once construction commences, we estimate that it will take approximately 18 months to 
complete. Temporary crushing will be utilized during 2015 and, as a result, we expect to reach approximately 60,000 tpd by 
year-end 2015. Once installed and commissioned, we expect that the permanent secondary crushing circuit will not only allow 
us to achieve mill throughput of 60,000 tpd on a consistent basis but also increase mill throughput to approximately 62,500 tpd.

US Operations Molybdenum
TC Mine was placed on care and maintenance in December 2014 after the mining and processing of ore from Phase 7 was 
completed. In connection with the placement of the mine on care and maintenance, during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, 
we reduced the work force at TC Mine by 77% and recognized severance costs of approximately $2.1 million. We expect to 
incur approximately $6 - $8 million in care and maintenance costs on an annual basis. While TC Mine is on care and 
maintenance, we will conduct limited stripping for Phase 8, which is expected to cost approximately $8 - $10 million in 2015. 
Although we had initially expected to incur certain costs relating to tailings dam slope management at TC Mine during 2015 
and 2016, we do not expect to incur these costs before 2020 after which the requirement for this work will be reassessed.
See “Selected Consolidated Financial and Operational Information” and “Segment Discussion” in this MD&A for
production and financial information for the US Operations Molybdenum segment for the quarter and year ended December 31, 
2014.
Canadian Operations Molybdenum
Effective December 31, 2014, operations at Endako Mine were temporarily suspended due to recent and expected
ongoing weakness in the molybdenum price. As a result, approximately 50% of salaried employees at the Endako Mine were 
terminated during December 2014, resulting in severance costs of approximately $1.2 million. Hourly employees received sixty 
days’ notice that their employment would be temporarily suspended and will remain so suspended while the Endako Mine is on 
temporary suspension. We continued to pay wages for the hourly employees during the sixty-day notice period, of which our 
share totals approximately $1.5 million, which has been accrued as of December 31, 2014. As of the date of this report Endako 
Mine operations continue to be temporarily suspended.

production and financial information for the Canadian Operations Molybdenum segment for the quarter and year ended 
December 31, 2014.
Liquidity
Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $265.6 million at December 31, 2014 which was substantially the same as the
September 30, 2014 cash balance of $266.6 million, despite a cash outflow of $23.4 million for open market repurchases of 
bonds in December 2014. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $216.1 million, $202.7 million and $233.9 million at June 
30, 2014, March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. With expected cash flow from Mount Milligan Mine at current 
copper and gold prices and foreign exchange rates, expected cash flow from our residual molybdenum operations at current 
molybdenum prices, and cash on hand as of December 31, 2014, we believe there will be sufficient liquidity to fund planned 
capital expenditures, working capital needs and scheduled debt and interest payments during 2015. Please refer to the 
"Liquidity and Capital Resources" section in this MD&A for further discussion.
Outlook
We currently estimate that in 2015 our payable copper production will increase approximately 40% to 55% and payable
gold production will increase approximately 25% to 30% from 2014 and that unit cash costs on a by-product basis will decrease 
by approximately 26% to 48%, making Mount Milligan Mine a low cost producer of copper on a by-product basis. While our 
molybdenum business has been scaled back significantly due to the placement of TC Mine on care and maintenance and the 
temporary suspension of Endako Mine, we believe that cash flows from the Langeloth Facility, together with the sale of 
inventory from the molybdenum mines at current prices, will be more than sufficient to cover the cash costs and cash capital 
expenditures of the our molybdenum business during 2015.
The following table presents our guidance for the full year 2015.

(1)  The Mount Milligan Mine guidance assumes that the mill will reach throughput of approximately 60,000 tpd, by year-end
2015.
(2)  Copper by-product unit cash cost is calculated using copper payable production and deducts a gold by-product credit, which
is determined based on expected revenue from payable gold production assuming a gold price of approximately $800 per 
ounce, which takes into account the contractual price of $435 per ounce under the Gold Stream Arrangement.(cid:160)
(3)  Estimates for cash costs, molybdenum cash inflow (outflow) and cash capital expenditures assume a foreign exchange rate
of US$1.00 = C$1.15.
(4)  Excludes cash capital expenditures related to 2014 accruals paid in 2015.
(5)  If the Endako Mine is placed on care and maintenance, our share of expected severance costs of approximately $10 to $12
million would be incurred.
See Item 1A for a discussion of risk factors relating to our production and cost guidance.

Three Months Ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 (Unaudited)
Net Income (Loss)
Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $135.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $210.5 
million, or $1.24 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2013. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2014 was primarily the result 
of non-cash write downs of the molybdenum fixed assets and materials and supplies inventory of $79.5 million, exploration 
property write downs of $25.3 million, lower-of-cost-or-market molybdenum product inventory write downs of $25.5 million 
and non-cash foreign currency losses of $35.3 million primarily related to intercompany notes, partially offset by higher copper 
and gold sales volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, and a consolidated income and mining tax benefit of $16.4 
million.
Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2013 was primarily the result of, non-cash asset impairments of $194.9 million, lower-of-
cost-or-market molybdenum product inventory write downs of $57.8 million, and non-cash foreign currency losses of $40.8 
million, primarily related to intercompany notes.
Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014 (which excluded asset impairments, net of tax impacts, and 
the non-cash impact of foreign exchange losses related to intercompany notes, net of tax impacts) was $10.0 million, or $0.05 
per share. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2013 (which excluded asset impairments, net of tax impacts, 
and the non-cash impact of primarily unrealized foreign exchange losses, net of tax impacts) was $29.3 million, or $0.17 per 
share.
Revenues
Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $168.0 million, up 43.5% compared to revenues of $117.1 million for the
fourth quarter of 2013. This increase in revenues was driven by the increased copper and gold sales from Mount Milligan Mine, 
partially offset by lower molybdenum sales, which was primarily driven by lower molybdenum sales volumes. During the 
fourth quarter of 2014, we sold 15.5 million pounds of payable copper and 38,910 ounces of payable gold at average realized 
sales prices of $2.75 per pound of copper and $1,003 per ounce of gold, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we sold 
2.8 million pounds of payable copper and 5,541 ounces of payable gold at average realized sales prices of $3.29 per pound of 
copper and $1,006 per ounce of gold, respectively.
We sold approximately 8.1 million pounds and 9.7 million pounds of molybdenum in the fourth quarters of 2014 and
2013, respectively, of which 5.8 million pounds and 9.2 million pounds, respectively, were from our mines. In the fourth quarter 
of 2014, the average realized sales price for molybdenum was $10.79 per pound compared to $10.11 per pound for the fourth 
quarter of 2013. 
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2014 were $128.6 million, which were up 11.2% from the same quarter in 
2013. The increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014 was driven by $41.4 million of operating expenses at 
Mount Milligan Mine related to copper and gold production and an increase in lower-of-cost-or-market molybdenum product

Operating expenses in the comparable periods were impacted by foreign exchange rates. Foreign exchange rates at
December(cid:160)31, 2014 were US$1.00 = C$1.16 compared to US$1.00 = C$1.06 at December(cid:160)31, 2013. The foreign exchange rate 
averaged US$1.00 = C$1.14 for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to an average rate of US$1.00 = C$1.05 for the same 
period in 2013.
The non-GAAP financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from Mount Milligan Mine in the fourth quarter of
2014 was $1.16 per pound of payable copper produced, on a by-product basis, and $1.88 per pound of payable copper produced 
on a co-product basis and $506 per ounce of payable gold produced on a co-product basis. The by-product cash cost for copper 
for the fourth quarter of 2014 was negatively impacted by a lower volume of gold ounces sold during the fourth quarter when 
compared to the third quarter of 2014; which was somewhat offset by a higher average realized sales price for gold in the fourth 
quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2013.
The non-GAAP financial measure of cash cost per pound produced from our molybdenum mines was $10.34 per pound
in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $6.91 per pound for the same quarter in 2013. Cash cost per pound produced was 
higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to lower production at Endako Mine as a result of significantly lower than 
anticipated ore grades and mill recoveries coupled with higher cash costs at TC Mine due to significantly lower ore grades and 
mill recoveries associated with processing stockpiled material as discussed above.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense ("DD&A")
DD&A in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $21.6 million compared to $13.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to the
increase of DD&A from Mount Milligan Mine, partially offset by lower DD&A for TC Mine and our share of Endako Mine. 
During the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012, we recognized our share of a non-cash asset impairment, which significantly 
lowered the carrying value and depreciable base of our share of the assets at Endako Mine, which, in turn, lowered DD&A for 
our share of Endako Mine in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized 
a non-cash asset impairment at TC Mine, which significantly lowered the carrying value and depreciable base of the assets at 
TC Mine, which, in turn, lowered DD&A for TC Mine in the fourth quarter of 2014.

General and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $6.6 million compared to $3.9 million in the fourth
quarter of 2013. Higher general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2014 was primarily due to an increase of 
$2.3 million in compensation expense in connection with severance costs and bonuses. General and administrative expense for 
the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013 included $0.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in stock-based compensation expense. 
Under US(cid:160)GAAP, stock-based compensation is included in the specific operating statement categories that include the 
compensation costs of the employees, officers and directors for which the stock-based award applies.

Given the temporary suspension of the Endako Mine due to recent and expected ongoing weakness in the molybdenum
price and a decrease in the Endako Mine molybdenum proven and probable reserves resulting from mining performance in 
2014, we re-evaluated the long-lived assets at the Endako Mine for impairment as of December 31, 2014. This evaluation 
indicated that our share of the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from Endako Mine's assets were less than our share of the 
carrying value of the fixed assets due to the expected future molybdenum price and anticipated production and cash costs from 
the Endako Mine. This resulted in estimating our share of the assets’ estimated fair value, which was also less than our share of 
their carrying values and long lived asset impairment was recorded as shown above.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, we evaluated the fair value of our exploration properties, the remaining materials 
and supplies inventory at TC Mine, and other long-lived assets, given the significant decline in commodity prices in the fourth 
quarter of 2014. As a result of these evaluations, we determined that the fair values of the exploration properties and the 
remaining materials and supplies inventory at TC Mine were less than our carrying values of such assets. We recognized non-
cash asset impairments, as discussed above, representing a write-down to the assets’ estimated fair values as of December 31, 
2014. Our impairment analysis did not result in any other long-lived asset impairments during the fourth quarter of 2014. 
However, there can be no assurance that there will not be further asset impairments related to future operational challenges and/
or if commodity prices further decline.
For the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment representing a write down to TC Mine assets' 
estimated fair value as of December(cid:160)31, 2013. In addition, as of December(cid:160)31, 2013, we updated the molybdenum reserves for 
Endako Mine using price of $10 per pound of molybdenum oxide compared to $12 per pound used previously, resulting in a 
significant reduction in the reserves. The reduction constituted a triggering event, requiring us to evaluate our long-lived assets 
for impairment in the fourth quarter. This evaluation resulted in a non-cash asset impairment at Endako Mine representing a 
write down to the assets' estimated fair value as of December(cid:160)31, 2013.
Interest and Finance Fees
Interest and finance fees were $22.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $23.2 million in the fourth quarter 
of 2013. Beginning in September 2013, in conjunction with the start-up phase of Mount Milligan Mine, we ceased capitalizing 
a large portion of the incurred interest and debt issuance costs related to the our secured and unsecured notes, Tangible Equity 
Units ("tMEDS") and equipment financing facility.
In the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $0.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively of interest and
amortization of debt issuance costs. We capitalize interest expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to 
construct new facilities until assets are ready for their intended use. This capitalized interest will be amortized using the units-
of-production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on recoverable quantities to be mined from proven and 
probable reserves.
Gain from Debt Extinguishment
Gain from debt extinguishment of $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 was due to the retirement of unsecured 
notes repurchased in the open market at less than their outstanding principal amount net of the effect of writing off deferred 
financing costs associated with such notes. Please refer to Note 9 in Item 8 of this 10-K, for further discussion.
Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses
54
Table of Contents
For the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, we recognized $35.3 million and $40.8 million, respectively, of foreign
exchange losses. These non-cash foreign currency losses were primarily unrealized and related to intercompany notes that were 
entered into as part of a strategy to manage cash balances to fund our operations and provide future tax benefits. The increase in 
foreign exchange losses was primarily due to the weakening of the C$ against the US$. The foreign exchange rate at which the 
notes were revalued was US$1.00 = C$1.16 at December(cid:160)31, 2014 compared to US$1.00 = C$1.06 at December(cid:160)31, 2013. The 
foreign exchange rate averaged US$1.00 = C$1.14 for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to an average rate of US$1.00 = C
$1.05 for the same period in 2013.
Income and Mining Tax (Benefit) Expense
For the fourth quarter of 2014, we had a tax benefit of $16.4 million compared to a benefit of $66.4 million for the fourth
quarter of 2013. The primary difference in the effective tax rate between the two periods is driven by the change in our 
valuation allowances by jurisdiction due to the asset impairments.
As a result of the asset impairments of our exploration properties for the fourth quarter of 2014, we recognized a tax
benefit of $7.0 million through a reduction of deferred tax liabilities. However, the asset impairment for Endako Mine and TC 
Mine assets for the fourth quarter of 2014 did not have a tax impact due to a valuation allowance. This yielded a net effective 
tax rate of 6.7% on $104.8 million of asset impairments.
As a result of the asset impairment at TC Mine for the fourth quarter of 2013, we recognized a tax benefit of $47.4 million 
through a reduction of deferred tax liabilities, offset with a valuation allowance impact associated with the asset impairment of 
$1.5 million expense. However, the asset impairment for Endako Mine for the fourth quarter of 2013 did not have a tax impact 
due to a valuation allowance. This yielded a net effective tax rate of 23.6% on $194.1 million of asset impairments.
The tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2014 was also increased due to a $0.5 million gain on foreign 
exchange recorded as a component of deferred tax benefit. The tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2013 was 
also decreased due to a $0.1 million loss on foreign exchange recorded as a component of deferred tax benefit.
Three Years Ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 
Net Income (Loss)
Net loss for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 was $124.2 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to net loss of
$215.0 million, or $1.26 per share, for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013 and net loss of $546.3 million, or $3.24 per share, for 
the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2012.
The net loss for 2014 was primarily the result of non-cash asset impairments of $104.8 million, discussed previously and
non-cash foreign currency losses of $99.8 million primarily on intercompany notes. The net loss was partially offset by net 
income generated from Mount Milligan Mine, an income and mining tax benefit of $21.7 million, higher molybdenum sales 
due to higher average molybdenum realized sales prices and lower molybdenum cost of sales compared to 2013.
The net loss for 2013 was primarily the result of non-cash asset impairments of  $194.9 million, discussed previously. The
net loss was also the result of non-cash foreign currency losses of $70.8 million primarily on intercompany notes and negative 
operating margins from Mount Milligan Mine. The net loss was partially offset by an income tax benefit of $63.4 million, 
higher molybdenum sales volume somewhat offset by lower average molybdenum realized sales prices and lower molybdenum 
operating expenses compared to 2012.
The net loss for 2012 was primarily the result of a $530.5 million non-cash asset impairments at Endako Mine and $47.0 
million in non-cash impairment of goodwill. Lower sales volume, lower average realized sales prices and higher cash costs also 
contributed to net loss for the year. Net loss for 2012 was partially offset by an income tax benefit, non-cash foreign currency 
gains of $12.2 million on intercompany notes and a non-cash unrealized gain on common stock purchase warrants of $1.8 
million.
The net loss for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 also included lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write downs
of $25.5 million compared to lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write downs of $57.8 million in 2013 and $73.8 
million in 2012.
Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 was $54.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share,
non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013 was $5.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, and non-
GAAP adjusted net loss for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2012 was $44.8 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. See "Non-GAAP 
Financial Measures" below for the definition and reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss).

Table of Contents
Revenue
Revenues for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 were $806.7 million, up 85.7% compared to 2013, primarily driven by 
the addition of a full year of copper and gold revenues from Mount Milligan Mine and higher molybdenum sales due to higher 
average realized molybdenum sales prices. During 2014, we sold 64.7 million pounds of payable copper and 172,741 ounces of 
payable gold for total revenue of $350.7 million compared to the sale of 2.8 million pounds of payable copper and 5,541 ounces 
of gold for total revenue of $14.3 million during 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we made 12 shipments to 
MTM Customers and received provisional payments for 12 of these shipments and final settlement payments for 8 shipments.
During 2014 and 2013, we sold 36.6 million pounds and 36.5 million pounds of molybdenum, respectively, of which 28.5
million pounds and 31.5 million pounds, respectively, were from our molybdenum mines. The average realized sales price for 
molybdenum in 2014 was $12.06 per pound, which was $1.09 per pound, or 9.9% higher than in 2013.
Revenues for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013 were $434.4 million, up 8.2% compared to 2012. During 2013, we sold
36.5 million pounds of molybdenum, which was 7.8 million pounds more than the volume sold in 2012. Increases in 
molybdenum sales volumes were the result of higher production at TC Mine due to higher grade ore, and mill recoveries as 
well as improved operating efficiency, and higher ore grade and mill recoveries at Endako Mine. The average realized sales 
price for molybdenum in 2013 was $10.97 per pound, which was $2.51 per pound lower compared to the average realized sales 
price for molybdenum in 2012.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses in 2014 were $523.8 million, up 59.6% compared to 2013. The increase in operating expenses in
2014 was primarily the result of operating Mount Milligan Mine for an entire year, which was partially offset by a decrease in 
lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write-downs and lower costs at TC Mine.
Operating expenses in 2013 were $328.2 million, down 12.4% compared to 2012. The decrease in operating expenses in
2013 was primarily the result of significantly lower costs at TC Mine due to the suspension of waste stripping activities, 
resulting in a reduction in costs for the year of $28.6 million and decreased lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write 
downs, which were partially offset by operating costs for Mount Milligan as we entered the production phase during the fourth 
quarter of 2013.
Lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write downs within operating expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as

Product inventory write downs for the Canadian Operations Molybdenum segment in 2014 were primarily the result of
higher cost production from Endako Mine due to lower than anticipated ore grades and recoveries. Product inventory write 
downs for the US Operations Molybdenum segment in 2014 were primarily the result of higher cost production from TC Mine 
in the fourth quarter of 2014 as we processed stockpiled ore from Phase 7, which resulted in higher unit cash costs in relation to 
molybdenum market prices.
Copper-gold product inventory write downs in 2013 were the result of the start-up of the mine, with higher unit cash costs
in relation to copper and gold market prices.
Canadian Operations Molybdenum product inventory write downs in 2013 were primarily due to various operational
issues experienced in the first half of 2013, discussed in the Segment Discussion, together with materials and supplies surplus 
and obsolete inventory write downs in the fourth quarter of 2013, which resulted in higher unit cash costs in relation to 
molybdenum market prices.
US Operations Molybdenum product inventory write downs in 2012 were the result of planned mine pit sequencing from 
Phase 6 to Phase 7, which resulted in significantly higher waste removal costs and lower grade ore in the last half of 2011 and 
first nine months of 2012, which, in turn, reduced production and increased cash costs per pound produced at TC Mine.
56
Table of Contents
Canadian Operations Molybdenum product inventory write down in 2012 was primarily due to higher unit cash costs at Endako 
Mine, caused by lower production as a result of lower-than-anticipated ore grades and mill recoveries.

See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for the definition and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced.
For Copper-Gold, 2014 production increased over 2013 as the Mount Milligan Mine had a full year of production in
2014 compared to four months of production in 2013 due to the start-up of the mine. Mount Milligan unit cash costs were lower 
primarily as a result of the higher production and favorable foreign exchange rates, as discussed below in the Segment 
Discussion. For molybdenum, the increase in the cash cost per pound produced was primarily due to lower production from 
Endako Mine, which was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates for costs at Endako Mine. For Endako Mine, our 
share of the production was lower due to lower than anticipated ore grades and recoveries, which was somewhat offset by 
higher ore tonnes milled.
For Copper-Gold, cash cost per pound produced for 2013 reflects production for the fourth quarter of 2013 only, due to
the start-up of Mount Milligan Mine. For molybdenum, the decrease in cash cost per pound produced in 2013, as compared to 
2012 was primarily driven by lower cash costs at TC Mine. Cash cost per pound produced at TC Mine decreased due to the 
absence of costs for waste stripping and higher production from a higher ore grade. Cash cost per pound produced was also 
lower at Endako Mine in 2013, as compared to 2012, due to increased recovery and higher ore grade and lower operating costs, 
which was partially offset by of a write down of surplus and obsolete materials and supplies inventory at Endako Mine of $2.0 
million, or $0.23 per pound produced. During the first half of 2012, the new mill at Endako Mine was in the start-up phase, and 
the new mill had lower than anticipated recovery rates throughout 2012 that resulted in low production and high cash costs. 
DD&A
DD&A in 2014 was $99.9 million, an increase of 92.5%, compared to 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to
the addition of a full year of DD&A at Mount Milligan Mine, which was partially offset by lower DD&A at TC Mine and 
Endako Mine due to the fourth quarter 2013 non-cash write-downs of the property, plant and equipment at TC Mine and 
Endako Mine, which reduced the carrying value and depreciable base of our molybdenum assets (or our share of the carrying 
value and depreciable base of the assets, in the case of Endako Mine), and a lower volume of molybdenum pounds sold from 
our mines compared to 2013. Additionally, DD&A was impacted by reduced lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write 
downs in 2014 compared to 2013.
DD&A in 2013 was $51.9 million, a decrease of 18.9%, compared to 2012. This decrease was primarily attributable to 
lower DD&A at Endako Mine as a result of the fourth quarter 2012 non-cash write down of our share of the Endako property, 
plant and equipment assets, which significantly lowered the carrying value and depreciable base of our share of assets at 
Endako Mine, offset by a higher volume of molybdenum pounds sold from our mines compared to 2012 and the start-up of the 
production phase at Mount Milligan Mine during the fourth quarter of 2013. Additionally, DD&A was impacted by reduced 
lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write downs in 2013 compared to 2012.
Lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write downs within DD&A for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

General and administrative expense in 2014 was $23.5 million compared to $21.6 million and $27.6 million in 2013 and
2012, respectively. General and administrative expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $3.6(cid:160)million, $3.3 million and 
$3.9(cid:160)million, respectively, of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. General and administrative expense increased in 
2014 from 2013 primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in compensation expense in connection with severance costs and 
bonuses, a $1.3 million increase in tax consulting and audit services which were partially offset by other lower consulting fees. 
General and administrative expenses were lower in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower salaries and benefits and 
consulting fees.
Exploration Expense
Exploration expense in 2014 was $0.9 million compared to $1.4 million in 2013 and $2.2 million in 2012. The 2014
expenses were primarily comprised of mineral tenure payments of $0.5 million relating to the Berg and Maze Lake properties, 
and $0.4 million relating to exploration activities at TC Mine and Mount Milligan Mine.
The 2013 expenses were comprised primarily of $0.6 million in mineral tenure payments for the Berg property,
exploration drilling activities at TC Mine, Endako Mine and Mount Milligan Mine of $0.2 million, and $0.6 million for 
property payments on the Davidson property. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we terminated the vending agreement through 
which we had held an interest in the Davidson property.
The 2012 exploration expenses were comprised of $1.1 million for the Berg property; exploration drilling activities at TC
Mine, Endako Mine and Mount Milligan Mine of $0.6 million; and $0.5 million for property payments on the Davidson 
property.

Please see the discussion above in "Three Months Ended December 31, 2014 (Unaudited) - Asset Impairments" for more
information regarding the non-cash asset impairments in the US Operations Molybdenum and Canadian Operations 
Molybdenum segments for 2014 and 2013 and the impairments to mineral reserves of exploration properties, which were 
recorded in the fourth quarter of the respective fiscal year.

Table of Contents
During 2013, we negotiated a contract with US Energy to sell land originally acquired by one of our subsidiaries for
easements related to the Mt. Emmons project, in respect of which we terminated our interest in 2011. We assessed the impact of 
this contract on the carrying value of the land, and during the third quarter of 2013, recorded a non-cash impairment 
representing a write down to the land's fair value.
In 2012, the significant decline in molybdenum prices and the performance of TC Mine and Endako Mine caused us to
closely monitor and evaluate potential write downs throughout the year. During the third quarter of 2012, we suspended waste 
stripping activity associated with the next phase of production at TC Mine. This decision and the decline in molybdenum prices 
represented significant changes in our business, requiring us to evaluate for potential impairments on an enterprise-wide basis at 
September 30, 2012. For purposes of the impairment evaluation, management considered estimates of after-tax discounted 
future cash flows of the individual reporting units, life-of-mine plans developed using long-term analyst pricing reflective of the 
then-current price environment, management's projections for operating costs and the market value of our equity. As a result of 
this evaluation, an impairment charge representing the remaining balance of goodwill, was recorded in the third quarter of 
2012. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment of Endako Mine long lived 
assets, as discussed above. 
Interest and Finance Fees
Interest and finance fees of $92.3 million in 2014 were composed of $87.0 million in interest and finance fees on tMEDS 
and secured and unsecured notes, $5.1 million in interest on mobile mining equipment loans and $0.2 million in debt issuance 
cost amortization and commitment fees. In 2014, we capitalized interest and debt issuance costs totaling $4.1 million.
Interest and finance fees of $24.1 million in 2013 were composed of approximately $21.7 million in interest and finance
fees on tMEDS and secured and unsecured notes, $2.2 million in interest on mobile mining equipment loans and $0.2 million in 
debt issuance cost amortization and commitment fees. Beginning in September 2013, in conjunction with the start-up phase at 
Mount Milligan, we ceased capitalizing a large portion of incurred interest and debt issuance costs related to our secured and 
unsecured notes, tMEDS and equipment financing facility. In 2013, we capitalized interest and debt issuance costs totaling 
$75.2 million.
Interest and finance fees of $12.8 million in 2012 were composed of approximately $2.7 million commitment fees on the
unused revolving credit facility prior to its termination, $9.5 million of debt issuance cost amortization and $0.6 million of 
interest on the mobile mining equipment loans. In 2012, we capitalized interest and debt issuance costs totaling $45.8(cid:160)million.
In 2014, we made cash interest payments of $91.3 million related to our secured and unsecured notes, tMEDS and
equipment financing facility. In 2013, we made cash interest payments of $81.8 million related to our unsecured notes, tMEDS, 
equipment financing facility and revolving credit facility. In 2012, we made cash interest payments of $41.3 million.
Gain from debt extinguishment
Gain from debt extinguishment of $1.6 million in 2014 was due to the retirement of unsecured notes repurchased in the 
open market at less than their outstanding principal amount, net of the effect of writing off  deferred financing costs associated 
with such notes. This gain was partially offset by a loss from debt extinguishment of $0.5 million in the first nine months of 
2014 due to the extinguishment of the senior amortizing notes component of the tMEDS units tendered in the Exchange Offer. 
See Note 9 in Item 8 of this 10-K, for a further discussion.
Other
Other income in 2014 was $8.1 million compared to $1.1 million for 2013. The 2014 increase was due primarily to a
settlement in 2014 associated with interest on a state tax refund received in 2010 and $4.7 million in favorable mark-to-market 
income related to copper and gold commodity price hedges, of which $2.0 million was realized and $2.7 million was 
unrealized.
Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses
During 2014, we recognized foreign exchange losses of $99.8 million compared to foreign exchange losses of $70.8
million in 2013 and foreign exchange gains of $12.2 million in 2012.
During 2014, the US$ strengthened against the C$, which resulted in an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $101.3
million primarily on increased borrowings on the intercompany notes that are denominated in C$ but are measured in US$. The  
unrealized foreign exchange loss discussed above was offset by a realized foreign exchange gain of $1.5 million on C$ cash 
balances which have the US$ as their measurement currency and on US$ payables and receivables which have the C$ as their 
measurement currency.

Table of Contents
During 2013, the US$ strengthened against the C$, which resulted in an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $70.4 million
primarily on increased borrowings on the intercompany notes that are denominated in C$ but are measured in US$. The 
remaining foreign exchange loss was the result of C$ cash balances that have the US$ as their measurement currency and on 
US$ payables and receivables that have the C$ as their measurement currency.
During 2012, the US$ weakened against the C$, which resulted in an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $13.3 million 
on intercompany notes that are denominated in C$ but are measured in US$ and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $1.7 
million on foreign currency derivative instruments. The remaining foreign exchange gain was the result of C$ cash balances 
that have the US$ as their measurement currency and on US$ payables and receivables that have the C$ as their measurement 
currency.
The foreign exchange rate was US$1.00 = C$1.16 at December(cid:160)31, 2014 compared to US$1.00(cid:160)= C$1.06 at
December(cid:160)31, 2013 and US$1.00(cid:160)= C$0.99 at December(cid:160)31, 2012.
Income and Mining Tax (Benefit) Expense
We had a tax benefit of $21.7 million in 2014 compared to a benefit of $63.4 million in 2013 and a benefit of $111.1 
million in 2012. The primary difference effective tax rate between the three years is driven by the change in our valuation 
allowances by jurisdiction due to the asset impairments.
As a result of the asset impairments of our exploration properties in 2014, we recognized a tax benefit of $7.0 million 
through a reduction of deferred tax liabilities. The asset impairments for Endako Mine and TC Mine assets for 2014 did not 
have a tax impact due to a valuation allowance. This yielded a net effective tax rate on impairments of 6.7% on $104.8 million 
of asset impairments.
As a result of the asset impairments in the US for 2013, we recognized a tax benefit of $47.7 million through a reduction
of deferred tax liabilities, offset with a valuation allowance impact associated with the asset impairments of $1.5 million 
expense. The asset impairment for Endako Mine in 2013 did not have a tax impact due to a valuation allowance. This yielded a 
net effective tax rate of 23.7% on $194.9 million of asset impairments.
As a result of the asset impairment for Endako Mine for 2012, we recognized a tax benefit of $183.3 million through a
reduction of our deferred tax liabilities, offset with a valuation allowance impact associated with the asset impairment by 
$119.2 million expense. This yielded a net effective tax rate of 12.1% on $530.5 million of asset impairments.
The tax benefit for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 was also increased by $7.4 million due to a change in various tax
positions and by $1.1 million due to a gain on foreign exchange recorded as a component of deferred tax benefit. The tax 
benefit for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013 was also decreased due to the change in the British Columbia provincial income 
tax rate and a $0.5 million loss on foreign exchange recorded as a component of deferred tax benefit.

General
Mount Milligan Mine began the commissioning and start-up phase during the third quarter of 2013 and reached
commercial production as of February 18, 2014, defined as operation of the mill at 60% design capacity mill throughput for 30 
days. Ramp-up activities continued throughout 2014 and are ongoing. The full year of production and sales in 2014, as 
compared to the partial year of production and sales in 2013, impacts comparability of the operating and financial results for 
the Copper-Gold segment year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter from 2013 to 2014. As supplemental disclosure, we provide 
certain operating and financial results for, and discusses comparability between, the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter 
of 2014.
Copper and Gold Production and Cash Costs
Due to the timing of Mount Milligan Mine start-up and production, as discussed above, concentrate production, payable
copper production, and non-GAAP unit cash costs for the year and three months ended December 31, 2014 improved 
significantly in relation to the comparable 2013 periods.
For the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2014, there was a 16.2% increase in concentrate
production (dry tonnes), a 10.8% increase in payable copper production, and an 8.3% increase in mill throughput. Non-GAAP 
unit cash costs for the 2014 fourth quarter compared to the 2014 third quarter were $1.16 per pound compared to $0.77 per 
pound on a copper by-product basis, respectively, $1.88 per pound compared to $1.80 per pound on a co-product basis for 
payable copper, respectively, and $506 per ounce compared to $477 per ounce on a co-product basis for payable gold, 
respectively. By-product cash costs in the fourth quarter of 2014 were negatively impacted by lower ounces of gold sold due to 
lower gold produced in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to third quarter of 2014, which was somewhat offset by favorable 
movements in exchange rates and fuel prices.

Table of Contents
The US$ strengthened against the C$ in the fourth quarter of 2014. Rates at December(cid:160)31, 2014 were US$1.00 = C$1.16
and the average foreign exchange rate was US$1.00 = C$1.14 for the fourth quarter of 2014.
Operating costs were positively impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates, as the US$ strengthened against the C$ in 
2014. The average foreign exchange rate was US$1.00 = C$1.14 for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to US$1.00 = C$1.09 
for the third quarter of 2014, resulting in a favorable impact on operating costs of approximately $2.1 million. The average 
foreign exchange rate was US$1.00 = C$1.10 for 2014 compared to US$1.00 = C$1.06 for 2013 resulting in a favorable impact 
on operating costs of approximately $14.1 million.
Copper and Gold Sold
During the three months and year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 15.5 million pounds and 64.7 million pounds of
copper, respectively, and 38,910 ounces and 172,741 ounces of payable gold, respectively when compared to 2.8 million 
pounds of copper and 5,541 ounces of gold for each of the comparable periods in 2013. During the three months and year 
ended December 31, 2014 we made three and twelve shipments and sales, respectively, compared to one shipment and sale 
during each of the comparable periods in 2013.
As outlined in the table above, the copper and gold sales were lower in the fourth quarter of 2014 when compared to the 
third quarter of 2014 primarily due to less concentrate shipped and sold in the 2014 fourth quarter together with lower metal 
content. Additionally, copper sales were negatively impacted from lower average realized copper prices in the fourth quarter of 
2014 while gold sales were positively impacted from higher average realized gold prices in the fourth quarter of 2014. While 
we recorded three sales in both the fourth and third quarter of 2014 the average realized prices were $2.75 per pound of payable 
copper and $1,003 per ounce of payable gold in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $3.02 per pound of payable copper and 
$952 per ounce of payable gold in the third quarter of 2014. The average realized prices for copper and gold for the three 
months and year ended December 31, 2014 were impacted by the final settlement of certain provisional payments together with 
mark-to-market adjustments for provisional payments not yet settled.
Capital Expenditures
During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we made C$11.5 million of capital expenditures for Mount Milligan 
Mine, consisting of C$3.7 million for the permanent operations residence, C$7.2 million for operations and C$0.6 million for 
the construction project. During 2014, we made C$85.6 million of cash capital expenditures for Mount Milligan, consisting of 
C$32.9 million for the permanent operations residence, C$34.0 million for operations and C$18.7 million for the construction 
project. Total cash capital expenditures of C$85.6 million during 2014 included C$22.2 million in cash payments of accruals 
related to 2013.
The permanent operations residence was completed in 2014. Residents commenced moving into the facilities beginning
early October 2014, with the move complete by the end of November 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we have incurred 
approximately C$52.0 million in aggregate capital expenditures for the construction of the permanent operations residence of 
which C$0.3 million was accrued at December 31, 2014 and still remains to be paid in cash.

As previously disclosed, effective December 31, 2014, TC Mine was placed on care and maintenance after completing the
processing of stockpiled ore from Phase 7. We are conducting limited stripping at the mine for the next phase of mining to 
maintain options while we continue to evaluate alternatives for TC Mine. During the third and fourth quarters of 2014, as a 
result of the completion of the mining of Phase 7 ore and the processing of stockpiled material and in connection with the 
placement of TC Mine on care and maintenance, we reduced our work force at TC Mine by 77% and recognized severance 
costs of approximately $2.1 million.
As discussed above, we recognized non-cash asset impairments on the remaining materials and supplies inventory at TC
Mine of $3.3 million in 2014, and non-cash asset impairments representing a write down to TC Mine assets' estimated fair 
value as of December(cid:160)31, 2013 of $129.4 million.
Molybdenum Production and Cash Costs
For the fourth quarter of 2014, molybdenum production at TC Mine was 2.5 million pounds compared to production of 
4.8 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2013. The 2014 fourth quarter production was lower primarily due to significantly 
lower ore grades and mill recoveries associated with the processing of stockpiled material. TC Mine completed the processing 
stockpiled ore in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the mine was placed on care and maintenance, as previously noted.
Molybdenum production at TC Mine for 2014 was 17.4 million pounds compared to 20.9 million pounds for 2013. 
Production was negatively affected in 2014 by lower ore grades and mill recoveries primarily related to the processing of 
stockpiled ore in the fourth quarter of 2014, as previously noted. Lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write downs at TC 
Mine were $2.3 million and nil during 2014 and 2013, respectively.
For 2013, molybdenum production from TC Mine was up 28.6% from 2012. For the full year of 2013 compared to the 
full year of 2012, production in 2013 was favorably impacted by significantly higher grade ore, which resulted in higher mill 
recovery and higher production, compared to 2012. Production in the second and third quarters of 2012 was negatively 
impacted by a pit wall slough in May 2012, which was more than offset by the mining of higher grade ore in the fourth quarter 
of 2012. Lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write downs at TC Mine were nil and $15.6 million during 2013 and 2012, 
respectively.
The non-GAAP financial measure of cash cost per pound produced in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $6.52 per pound
compared to $4.69 per pound for the same quarter in 2013. The cash costs were 39% higher in the 2014 fourth quarter primarily 
due to lower production which was somewhat offset by lower operating costs related to the completion of mining Phase 7 and 
processing stockpiled ore, including postponed maintenance repairs and major equipment rebuilds, fewer wear part
63
Table of Contents
replacements, lower diesel consumption and decreased blasting costs. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for the 
definition and calculation of cash cost per pound produced.
In 2014, the non-GAAP financial measure of cash cost per pound produced decreased by 2.8% from 2013. The cash cost 
in 2014 was lower than 2013 primarily due to lower operating costs as discussed above, which was somewhat offset by lower 
production. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for the definition and calculation of cash cost per pound produced.
In 2013, the non-GAAP financial measure of cash cost per pound produced decreased by 43.3% compared to 2012. The 
cash cost in 2013 was lower due to the absence of stripping costs and higher production from a significantly higher ore grade. 
Cash cost in 2012 included stripping costs of $28.6 million, or $1.76 per pound produced, compared nil in 2013. Additionally, 
during 2012, TC Mine incurred costs associated with a new access road to work around a pit wall slough that occurred in May 
2012. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for the definition and calculation of cash cost per pound produced.
Molybdenum Sold
Molybdenum pounds sold from TC Mine in the fourth quarter of 2014 was down 49.4% from the fourth quarter of 2013. 
Lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2014 were mainly the result of lower production during the fourth quarter of 2014 
compared to the same period in 2013. The average realized sales price in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $12.26 per pound 
versus $10.27 per pound in the same period in 2013.
For 2014, TC Mine, sales volumes decreased 20.9% compared to 2013 mainly due to lower production. The average
realized sales price for 2014 was $12.30 per pound versus $11.07 per pound in 2013.
For 2013, TC Mine sales volumes increased 103.4% compared to 2012 mainly due to higher production. The average
realized sales price for 2013 was $11.07 per pound compared to $13.71 per pound in 2012. Production and sales in 2012 were 
adversely impacted by planned stripping activities at TC Mine in the first half of 2012. To accommodate 2012's lower 
production, we entered into annual sales contracts for lower volumes of product and supplemented production in the first half 
of 2012 with product purchased from third parties. Also contributing to lower sales volumes in 2012 was a weaker spot market 
in the second half of 2012, which in turn led to a build-up of inventory during that period. 
Langeloth Facility
Operating results for the Langeloth Facility represent activities related to the roasting and processing of third-party 
concentrate and other metals at the Langeloth Facility and excludes product volumes and costs related to the roasting and 
processing of TC Mine and Endako Mine product. The Langeloth Facility costs associated with roasting and processing of TC 
Mine and Endako Mine product are included in each Mine's respective operating results. In spite of TC Mine being placed on 
care and maintenance and Endako Mine's suspended operations we expect the Langeloth Facility to operate at approximately 
85% capacity in 2015 from a supply of third party product and tolling arrangements.
The following is a summary of the Langeloth Facility's operating results for the three months ended December(cid:160)31, 2014

Molybdenum sold from third-party purchased molybdenum concentrate increased for the quarter and fiscal year ended
December 31, 2014, as compared to the same periods in 2013, as a result of lower production and sales from our molybdenum 
mines in 2014. The average realized sales price was $9.16 per pound and $12.02 per pound for the 2014 fourth quarter and 
fiscal year, respectively, compared to $10.15 per pound and $11.35 per pound for the 2013 fourth quarter and fiscal year, 
respectively, primarily due to changes in the market price of molybdenum oxide during the 2014 periods.
64
Table of Contents
Molybdenum sold from purchased product for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013 was down 52.1%  from 2012 primarily 
due to substantially lower molybdenum purchases in 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 as a result of higher production 
at both of our molybdenum mines. Additionally Langeloth processed all Endako Mine concentrates in 2013 due to the Endako 
roaster shutdown in the first quarter of 2013. The average realized sales price on molybdenum sold from purchased product in 
2013 was down 15.9% compared to the same period in 2012 due to a decrease in the market price of molybdenum oxide 
throughout 2013.
The volume of toll roasted and upgraded molybdenum processed during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the fiscal year
2014 decreased 89.1% and 80.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013, primarily due to lower capacity for toll 
roasted third-party material due to higher volume of third party purchased material.
The volume of toll roasted molybdenum processed during 2013 decreased 39.9% compared to 2012 primarily due to
lower capacity for third-party material due to higher volume of material processed from our own molybdenum mines.
The volume of roasted metal products processed during the 2014 fourth quarter and fiscal year decreased 77.0%  and
44.1%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013 due to decreased customer demand and the lack of available 
material. The volume of roasted metal products increased 46.3% for 2013 compared to 2012 due to increased customer 
demand.

As discussed above, due to adverse conditions in the molybdenum market, our Endako Mine was placed on temporary 
suspension, effective December 31, 2014. We recognized non-cash asset impairments on our share of the Endako Mine assets 
of $76.2 million in 2014, $64.7 million in 2013 and $530.5 million in 2012.
Molybdenum Production and Cash Costs
Our 75% share of molybdenum production at Endako Mine in the 2014 fourth quarter and fiscal year was decreased by
24.2% and 1.9%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2013, primarily due to lower ore grades and mill 
recoveries.
Our 75% share of molybdenum production at Endako Mine in 2013 was 46.3% higher compared to 2012 primarily due to 
higher ore grades and higher mill recoveries as a result of mining fresh ore in the last half of 2013 versus processing stockpiled
65

ore. During 2012, production was negatively affected by lower than anticipated mined ore grade in the first eight months of 
2012 from the Denak West pit, a lower than expected recovery rate from the new mill and lower ore grade from stockpiled ore 
processed in the last five months of 2012, which were partly offset by higher mill throughput in 2012.
Lower-of-cost-or-market product inventory write downs at Endako Mine were $12.6 million and $8.1 million for the
fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $23.2 million, $28.2 million and $58.2 million for fiscal year 2014, 2013 and 
2012, respectively.
The non-GAAP financial measure of cash cost per pound produced increased 37.5% and 7.2% in the 2014 fourth quarter
and fiscal year, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2013. These higher cash costs were primarily driven by lower 
production from lower ore grades and recoveries together with higher mining costs associated with longer truck hauls, partially 
offset by lower diesel costs and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. The foreign exchange rate averaged US$1.00 = 
C$1.14 for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to an average rate of US$1.00 = C$1.05 for the same period in 2013. Foreign 
exchange rates averaged US$1.00 = C$1.06 for fiscal 2014 compared to US$1.00 = C$1.03 for fiscal 2013, See "Non-GAAP 
Financial Measures" below for the definition and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced.
For 2013, the cash cost per pound produced decreased 29.1% compared to 2012. Cash cost per pound produced was
lower due to higher ore grades and recoveries, lower operating costs and favorable foreign exchange rates in 2013 compared to 
2012. Foreign exchange rates averaged US$1.00 = C$1.03 for fiscal 2013 compared to US$1.00 = C0.99 for fiscal 2012. See 
"Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for the definition and reconciliation of cash cost per pound produced.
Molybdenum Sold
Our share of molybdenum sold from Endako Mine in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 6.0% lower than the fourth quarter 
of 2013. The average realized sales price in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $10.34 per pound, which was higher than the fourth 
quarter of 2013 average realized sales price of $9.67 per pound as a result of improved market prices for molybdenum oxide.
For 2014, our share of molybdenum sold from Endako Mine was 25.6% higher compared to 2013 together with 11.4%
higher average realized sales prices over the same period. Higher sales volumes were primarily due to the sale of molybdenum 
inventory from 2013 production. Higher average realized prices were the result of improved market prices for molybdenum 
oxide.
For 2013, our share of molybdenum sold from Endako Mine was 19.7% higher compared to 2012 while the average 
realized sales price was down 19.9% over the same period. Higher sales volumes were the result of higher production, as 
discussed above, while lower prices were the result of declining market prices for molybdenum oxide.

We monitor our positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions and companies in which we invest our 
cash and cash equivalents. We manage our credit risk from accounts receivable through our collection activities. As of the date 
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not experienced any material delinquencies regarding the collection of accounts 
receivable.
During 2014, our debt and liquidity positions were primarily affected by the following:
•  Cash generated by operating activities of $184.8 million;
•  Capital expenditures of $82.1 million, primarily related to the construction of the permanent residence, operating
capital and the payment of amounts accrued during 2013 related to the construction and development of Mount 
Milligan Mine; and
66
Table of Contents
•  Principal payments of $56.1 million.
We monitor our exposure to the prices of our products as well as the currencies in which we operate. During the year
ended December 31, 2014, we entered into hedges to manage exposure to fluctuations in the prices of copper and gold 
(particularly the exposure between the provisional and final payments from our customers), and also purchased gold to satisfy 
our obligations under the Gold Stream Arrangement. During 2014, we also entered into hedges to manage exposure to the 
potential strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar. See Note 6 in Item 8 for further discussion.
As described more fully in Note 11 in Item 8, during 2014, in connection with the settlement of the Exchange Offer, we
extinguished $10.9 million of the senior amortizing notes component of the tendered tMEDS by making a principal payment of 
$1.2 million and issuing common stock to the senior amortizing note holders. This transaction resulted in future principal and 
interest cash payment savings of $11.7 million. As described more fully in Note 9 in Item 8, during the fourth quarter of 2014 
we repurchased $25.7 million of our senior unsecured notes in open market transactions. These transactions resulted in cash 
savings of $12.4 million, of which $2.5 million related to the discounted purchase and $9.9 million related to future interest 
savings. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2015, we repurchased an additional $7.3 million of our senior unsecured notes, 
resulting in cash savings of $3.8 million, of which $0.4 million related to the discounted purchase and $3.4 million related to 
future interest saving. With the exchange of the tMEDS and the recent note repurchases, we have reduced our outstanding debt 
by $43.8 million and extinguished future interest payments by $14.1 million. We may from time to time redeem, retire and/or 
purchase more outstanding debt, depending upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual 
restrictions and other factors. However, there can be no assurance that we will take any of these actions.
With expected cash flow from the Mount Milligan Mine at current copper and gold prices and foreign exchange rates, 
expected cash flow from our residual molybdenum operations at current molybdenum prices, and the $265.6 million of cash 
and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2014, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our planned capital 
expenditures, working capital needs and our scheduled debt and interest payments during 2015. We expect our molybdenum 
business to generate positive cash flow in 2015. In addition, we will defer capital investment and/or exploration activities, as 
necessary, for cost containment purposes, as evidenced by our recent decision to defer the full capital investment for the 
secondary crusher at Mount Milligan Mine until copper prices recover. None of our outstanding notes begin to mature until 
December 2017. Please refer to the discussion in “Overview” and “Outlook” sections above for further discussion.
In the long term, our ability to fund capital expenditures, working capital needs and scheduled debt and interest payments 
will primarily depend on cash flow from Mount Milligan Mine. As our outstanding notes approach maturity, we will likely need 
to refinance the notes or seek additional financing, which may include debt or equity issuances, to ensure that we can maintain 
sufficient liquidity. We may also seek financing in the future to fund ongoing operations and/or capital requirements, make 
acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. In April 2014, the SEC declared effective our shelf registration statement on 
Form S-3 pursuant to which we may issue from time to time up to $1 billion of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, 
guarantees of debt securities, and other securities. In July 2014, we filed a renewal of our existing short form base shelf 
prospectus in Canada, which qualifies the distribution of up to $1 billion of securities. However, there are many factors that will 
impact our ability to access the capital markets on acceptable terms, or at all, including general market conditions and 
prevailing metals prices. Please see Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these risks.
Operating Cash Flows
Cash generated by operating activities was $184.8 million and $44.8 million for the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 
2013, respectively, and cash used in operating activities was $28.2 million in 2012. The increase in cash flow from operations 
from 2013 to 2014 was primarily a result of copper and gold sales at Mount Milligan Mine, while the increase in cash flow 
from operations from 2012 to 2013 was primarily the result of higher revenues and lower unit costs from our molybdenum 
mines, with the increase in revenues partially offset by the 2013 related copper and gold operating expenses. For the years 
ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, cash flow from operations benefited from $27.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively in 
net payables related to the Gold Stream Arrangement for undelivered ounces. 
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities in 2014 was $93.9 million compared to $449.1 million(cid:160)in 2013 and $811.9 million in
2012. The decline in 2014 is primarily related to the completion of the construction and development of Mount Milligan Mine. 
During 2014, we spent $82.1 million on property, plant, equipment and development expenditures primarily related to the 
construction of the permanent operations residence at Mount Milligan Mine, the construction and development of the Mount 
Milligan project (which was primarily related to the payment of accruals as of December 31, 2013) and operating capital. 
During 2013, we spent $428.9 million on property, plant, equipment and development expenditures primarily related to the 
construction and development of Mount Milligan Mine. During 2012, we spent $771.5 million on property, plant, equipment 
and development expenditures primarily related to Endako Mine mill expansion and the construction and development of
67
Table of Contents
Mount Milligan Mine. Payments of capitalized interest primarily related to development of Mount Milligan Mine were $9.1 
million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $74.7 million and $40.7 million during the years ended 
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Reclamation deposits for 2014 represented $10.0 million of cash collateral that was 
posted against existing surety bonds for reclamation bonds compared to $7.0 million and $5.3 million for 2013 and 2012, 
respectively.
Reclamation deposit activity for 2014 represented $2.9 million of net cash collateral, net of a $7.1 million refund of cash 
collateral previously provided, that was posted against existing surety bonds for reclamation bonding. During 2013, we replaced 
certain reclamation bond deposits with letters of credit arrangements secured by a guarantee from a surety bond provider 
resulting in a $21.1 million net refund of reclamation cash deposits. Reclamation deposit activity for 2012 represented $5.3 
million of cash deposits for reclamation bonding.
As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $5.7 million outstanding under letters of credit/demand guarantees
facility for an environmental bond with Fisheries and Oceans Canada related to Mount Milligan. All letters of credit outstanding 
under this facility were secured by cash collateral which were included in the net reclamation deposit activity for 2013 
described above. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, these letters of credit were terminated and replaced with letters of credit 
arrangements secured by a guarantee from a surety bond provider, and the $5.7 million cash collateral was refunded.
Financing Activities
Summary of Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities for 2014 was $55.8 million compared to cash generated of $110.8 million for 2013. The
decrease was due primarily to cash proceeds received in 2013 from the Gold Stream Arrangement and equipment financing 
transactions. During 2014, financing activities consisted of repurchases of senior unsecured notes in the fourth quarter, as 
discussed above, and payments on long-term debt and equipment financings.
Cash generated by financing activities in 2013 was $110.8 million compared to $1,071.8 million in 2012. The decrease 
was due primarily to the 2012 issuance of the senior secured and unsecured notes and tMEDS described below. Additionally, 
we received lower proceeds from the Gold Stream Arrangement and equipment financing transactions, as planned, during 2013.
Cash generated by financing activities in 2012 was $1,071.8 million primarily related proceeds from the Gold Stream 
Arrangement, equipment financing transactions and the 2012 issuance of the senior secured and unsecured notes and tMEDS 
described below. These proceeds were partially offset by debt and capital lease obligation repayments and debt and equity 
issuance costs.
Gold Stream Arrangement
Pursuant to the Gold Stream Arrangement, we agreed to sell Royal Gold 52.25% of the refined gold production from
Mount Milligan Mine for a total upfront payment of $781.5 million, plus $435 per ounce, or the prevailing market rate if lower 
than $435 per ounce, when the gold is delivered. Pursuant to the Gold Stream Arrangement, we received total cash payments 
from Royal Gold through December 31, 2014 of $781.5 million, comprised of payments of $111.9 million in 2013, $305.0 
million in 2012, $138.1 million in 2011 and $226.5 million in 2010.
The Gold Stream Arrangement restricts our ability to incur debt that is secured by the Mount Milligan Mine assets.
Subject to the exceptions discussed below, we cannot incur debt that is secured by the Mount Milligan Mine assets in excess of 
$350.0 million until the earlier of the date upon which 425,000 ounces of refined gold have been sold and delivered to Royal 
Gold or the date upon which the aggregate dollar amount of the difference between the market price for the gold delivered to 
Royal Gold and the price actually paid by Royal Gold exceeds $280.0 million. Per the December 2014 amendment, discussed 
in Note 10 of Item 8, we are additionally permitted to pledge the Mount Milligan Mine assets to secure up to $25.0 million of 
hedging obligations incurred in connection with gold and copper production from Mount Milligan Mine, foreign currency 
exchange risk relating to Mount Milligan Mine and one or more corporate credit facilities utilized in connection with Mount 
Milligan Mine. Provided that Mount Milligan Mine meets specified throughput, recovery and delivery conditions, the $25.0 
million could increase to $50.0 million.
We must maintain a deposit record during the term of the Gold Stream Arrangement wherein the $781.5 million total
amount paid by Royal Gold is reduced by the difference between the current market price at the time of sale of refined gold to 
Royal Gold and $435 per ounce, multiplied by the amount of refined gold sold in such sale (referred to as “the Remaining 
Deposit”). If, at the end of the initial 50-year term of the agreement, the Remaining Deposit has not been reduced to nil, we 
must pay to Royal Gold the remaining balance reflected in the Remaining Deposit. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, the Remaining 
Deposit was $734.4 million. In the event of any default under our agreement with Royal Gold, Royal Gold could require us to 
repay the Remaining Deposit.

Table of Contents
In connection with our first 12 shipments of concentrate from Mount Milligan Mine, we were required to pay to Royal 
Gold a percentage of the provisional payments that we receive from the applicable offtakers. We were obligated to make such 
payments to Royal Gold in the form of gold. As our agreements with the offtakers provide that we will receive provisional 
payments in cash, we will be required to buy gold to satisfy our obligation to pay Royal Gold in gold. The percentage of the 
provisional payments that we were required to pay to Royal Gold declined by shipment, declining to nil after the 12th shipment 
for the life of the agreement. After the 12th shipment (which was made in the fourth quarter of 2014), we are required to pay 
Royal Gold upon receipt of final payment from the applicable offtakers.
We receive provisional payments in cash, thus requiring that we purchase gold in order to satisfy the obligation to pay
Royal Gold in gold. In order to hedge our gold price risk that arises when physical purchase and concentrate sales pricing 
periods do not match, we have and will continue to hedge our exposure to gold prices in connection with these provisional 
payments to Royal Gold. We currently have in place unsecured hedging lines with various banks in order to manage this 
exposure.
Royal Gold has a security interest in all of the Mount Milligan Mine assets until its total deposit amount has been reduced
to nil. Royal Gold's security interest is subject to subordination to project or corporate financings by us, except that in such 
circumstances, Royal Gold retains a first priority interest in 52.25% of the refined gold from Mount Milligan. After the total 
deposit amount has been reduced to nil, Royal Gold's security will consist solely of its first priority interest in 52.25% of the 
refined gold. The cash payments received under the Gold Stream Arrangement are recorded as deferred revenue and classified 
as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Mount Milligan Mine began delivering gold to Royal Gold in the fourth 
quarter of 2013, as such the deferred revenue is being recognized over the life of the mine based on the amount of gold 
delivered.
9.75% Senior Secured Notes
On November 27, 2012, we issued $350.0 million of 9.75% senior secured notes (the “2017 Notes”), which mature on
December(cid:160)1, 2017 and began accruing interest upon issuance. The proceeds received in the offering were $336.8 million, net of 
financing fees of $10.0 million and a discount of $3.2 million. The net proceeds from the offering were used to fund the 
completion of Mount Milligan and for general working capital purposes. The 2017 Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by 
substantially all of our subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority lien subjected to permitted liens on substantially all of our 
and the guarantors' property and assets. See Note 9 in Item 8 for further discussion.
12.5% Senior Unsecured Notes
On May(cid:160)11, 2012, we issued $200.0 million of 12.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2019 (the “2019 Notes”), which
mature on May 1, 2019 and began accruing interest upon issuance. The proceeds received in the offering were $193.1 million, 
net of financing fees of $6.9 million. The net proceeds from the offering were used to fund the completion of Mount Milligan 
and for general working capital purposes. The 2019 Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by substantially all of our 
subsidiaries. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $11.5 million of its 2019 Notes in an open market transaction. 
In connection with the repurchase of these notes, we recorded a debt extinguishment loss $0.2 million and wrote-off $0.2 
million of unamortized debt issuance costs. See Note 9 in Item 8 for further discussion.
Tangible Equity Units (tMEDS)
On May 11, 2012, we completed a public offering of 8,800,000 tangible equity units (“tMEDS”) with a stated value of 
$25.00 per unit. The proceeds received in the offering were $212.3 million, which were net of financing fees of $7.7 million. 
The net proceeds from the offering were used to fund the completion of Mount Milligan Mine and for general working capital 
purposes. On May 21, 2014, we commenced an offer ("Exchange Offer") to exchange any and all of the 8,340,000 then 
outstanding units of tMEDS for a number of shares of our common stock. See Note 9 in Item 8 for further discussion.
7.375% Senior Unsecured Notes
On May(cid:160)20, 2011, we issued $350.0(cid:160)million of 7.375% senior unsecured notes (the "2018 Notes"), which mature on June 
1, 2018 and began accruing interest upon issuance. The proceeds received in the offering were $339.9(cid:160)million, net of financing 
fees of $10.1(cid:160)million. The net proceeds from the offering were used to fund the development of Mount Milligan and for general 
working capital purposes. The 2018 Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries. During the 
fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $14.2 million of its 2018 Notes in an open market transaction. In connection with the 
repurchase of these notes, we recorded a debt extinguishment gain $2.3 million and wrote-off $0.3 million of unamortized debt 
issuance costs. See Note 9 in Item 8 for further discussion.
Caterpillar Equipment Financing Facility
69
Table of Contents
On March(cid:160)30, 2011, we entered into an equipment financing facility, as amended from time to time (the "Equipment
Facility"), pursuant to which Caterpillar Financial Services Limited ("Caterpillar") agreed to underwrite up to $132.0 million in 
mobile fleet equipment financing for Mount Milligan Mine. Each borrowing under the Equipment Facility represents a capital 
lease and has a term of 48 or 60 months. Interest on the amounts borrowed under the Equipment Facility is payable at either 
floating or fixed rates, at our option. At the end of each 48 or 60 month lease period, we have the option to purchase the 
underlying equipment for a nominal sum. The Equipment Facility includes non-financial covenants, and as of December 31, 
2014, we were in compliance with these covenants. Our ability to finance additional equipment under the Equipment Facility 
expired in September 2014 per the terms of the Equipment Facility agreement. On January 15, 2015 we entered into an 
amendment with Caterpillar which extends our ability to finance $12.6 million of additional equipment under the Equipment 
Facility through December 2015. As of December 31, 2014, we had drawn down $109.0 million under the Equipment Facility.
Endako Sale-Leaseback
In 2013, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with Caterpillar Financial Services Limited ("Caterpillar") with
respect to certain Endako Mine equipment ("Endako Sale Lease-Back"). We received $5.3 million in cash from Caterpillar for 
the sale of this equipment, which was subsequently leased back, after an upfront down payment of $1.4 million. The lease is 
considered to be a capital lease, with interest payments based on a fixed rate. The agreement includes certain non-financial 
covenants, and as of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with these covenants. As of December 31, 2014, this resulted 
in a capital lease obligation of $2.3 million.
Mobile Mining Equipment Loans
On December(cid:160)8, 2010, we executed an equipment financing agreement with Caterpillar in the amount of $12.8 million
secured by six units of mobile mining equipment purchased by us during 2010. This fixed-rate loan bears interest at 3.6% and is 
scheduled to mature no later than December(cid:160)8, 2015.

See Note(cid:160)6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, we have commitments to purchase approximately 14.8 million pounds of molybdenum sulfide
concentrate from 2015 to 2017 to be priced at the time of purchase. In addition, we have fixed-priced contracts, under which 
we have committed to sell approximately 599.7 thousand pounds of molybdenum in 2015 at an average market price of $12.05 
per pound.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with US(cid:160)GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP 
financial measures to assess our operating performance for the reasons described further below. These measures do not have 
standard meanings prescribed by US(cid:160)GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The 
presentation of these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to, the 
financial information prepared and presented in accordance with US(cid:160)GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have 
limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the results of operations as determined in accordance 
with US(cid:160)GAAP. 
Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share—Basic and Diluted
Management of the Company uses adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share—basic and diluted
to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company 
believes the use of these measures allows investors and analysts to compare results of the continuing operations of the 
Company to similar operating results of other mining companies, by excluding unusual or infrequent items that are considered 
non-core to our business.
Adjusted net income (loss) represents the income (loss) prepared in accordance with US(cid:160)GAAP, adjusted for significant
non-cash items.
For 2014, the significant non-cash items were the asset impairments, the net realized and unrealized gain and losses
related to the impact of foreign exchange due primarily to intercompany notes, and related tax effects. For 2013 and 2012, the 
significant non-cash items were the asset impairments, goodwill impairment, and the non-cash gain and losses related to the 
impact of foreign exchange due primarily to intercompany notes, and related tax effects.
We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment using a two-step approach when events and changes in
circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be recoverable. We have experienced non-cash 
impairment write downs of our long-lived assets of different types during 2014, 2013 and 2012, as described in Note 5 within 
Item 8, and, therefore, these charges should not be considered non-recurring. However, management does not consider these 
impairment charges in its evaluation of our financial performance and excludes non-cash asset write-downs and related tax 
impacts from adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share — basic and diluted. We believe that 
presentation of our non-GAAP measures excluding these non-cash impairment losses provides useful information to our 
investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations.
During 2012, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, as described in Note 5 within Item 8. In addition we
recognized a non-cash loss related to our common stock purchase warrants. Management does not consider the impairment 
charge or the non-cash loss on warrants in its evaluation of our financial performance and excludes the expense from adjusted 
net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share — basic and diluted. We believe that presentation of our non-GAAP 
measures excluding this charge provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of 
operations.
In connection with our strategy to manage cash balances, fund our operations and provide future tax benefits, we may
enter into intercompany loan arrangements. At times, the loans are denominated in currencies other than the measurement 
currency of one of the parties. US GAAP requires that notes that are intended to be repaid should not be considered a capital 
contribution, and, therefore, the foreign exchange fluctuations related to these loans impact net income (loss) each period. At 
each period end, we compare the exchange rate between the Canadian and US dollars to the exchange rate at the end of the 
prior reporting period. The difference between those rates is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss on the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) at each period end. Settlement of these intercompany loans results 
in realized foreign exchange gains or losses recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
71
Income (Loss). As the loans between the parent company and its subsidiaries are the primary driver of our foreign exchange 
gains and losses, as discussed above, management does not consider gains or losses on foreign exchange in its evaluation of our 
financial performance. We believe that presentation of our non-GAAP measures excluding these gains or losses provides useful 
information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations.
We follow the guidance issued by the Emerging Issues Task Force that common stock purchase warrants with a strike 
price denominated in a currency other than the entity's reporting currency are not considered linked to equity, and as a result, 
are to be accounted for as derivatives, as discussed in Note 6 within Item 8. In connection with our acquisition of Terrane 
during 2011, we agreed to pay holders of warrants issued by Terrane certain share and cash consideration. A cash payment was 
not required by us at settlement; therefore, management does not consider gains or losses on these warrants in its evaluation of 
our financial performance. The last of these warrants expired in June 2012.
Adjusted net income (loss) per share (basic and diluted) is calculated using adjusted net income (loss), as defined above,
divided by the weighted-average basic and weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the period as determined in 
accordance with US(cid:160)GAAP. If the adjustments to net (loss) on a US GAAP basis result in non-GAAP adjusted net income, we 
calculate weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in accordance with US GAAP and use that to calculate adjusted net 
income per share—diluted. If the adjustments to net income on a US GAAP basis result in non-GAAP adjusted net (loss), we 
utilize weighted-average basic shares outstanding to calculate adjusted net income per share—diluted, in accordance with US 
GAAP.
The following tables reconcile net income (loss) presented in accordance with US(cid:160)GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures 
of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share—basic and diluted, for the years ended December(cid:160)31, 
2014, 2013 and 2012 and for all of the previous eight quarters. All figures within the tables are unaudited and are presented in

Copper-Gold Operations - Unit Cash Cost and Average Realized Price per Payable Pound or Payable Ounce Sold
Unit cash cost on a by-product and co-product basis are considered key measures in evaluating operating performance in
our Copper-Gold operations, as well as measures of profitability and efficiency on a consolidated basis. Although, unit cash 
cost on a by-product and co-product basis are not measures of financial performance, do not have standardized meaning 
prescribed by US(cid:160)GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, we believe these non-
GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to investors.
Unit cash cost on a by-product and co-product basis represent the mining, milling, on-site general and administration,
truck and rail transportation, warehousing, refining and treatment, and ocean freight and insurance costs; and exclude the 
effects of changes in inventory; non-cash corporate allocations; other non-cash employee benefits, such as stock-based 
compensation; depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion.
On a by-product basis, sales of by-product metals are deducted when computing cash costs in accordance with the cash
cost standard endorsed by the World Gold Council and, previously, the Gold Institute.
On a co-product basis, cash costs are allocated between copper and gold based on production. Copper production is stated 
in thousands of pounds. Gold production has been converted to thousands of copper equivalent (Cu eq.) pounds using the gold 
production for the periods presented, as well as the most recent quarterly average prices for copper and gold. The price used for
73
copper is the most recent quarterly average of the Metals Bulletin Daily published price for LME settlement per tonne. The 
price used for gold is a weighted average of the most recent quarterly average of the Metals Bulletin Daily published prices for 
daily average London price per ounce adjusted for the fixed price established under the Gold Stream Arrangement ($435 per 
oz).
The following tables provide a reconciliation of cash costs, unit cash costs, and operating expenses for Copper-Gold
operations included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the determination of 
net income (loss).

Molybdenum Operations - Cash Cost per Pound Produced, Weighted-Average Cash Cost per Pound Produced and Average 
Realized Sales Price per Pound Sold
Cash cost per pound produced, weighted-average cash cost per pound produced and average realized sales price per
pound sold are considered key measures in evaluating our operating performance in our Molybdenum operations, as well as 
profitability and efficiency on a consolidated basis. Although cash cost per pound produced, weighted-average cash cost per 
pound produced and average realized sales price per pound sold are not measures of financial performance, do not have 
standardized meanings prescribed by US(cid:160)GAAP, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, 
we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to investors.
Cash cost per pound produced represents the mining, milling, on-site general and administration, transportation to
Langeloth Facility, and allocation of roasting and packaging from the Langeloth Facility for molybdenum oxide and HPM 
produced; and excludes the effects of purchase price adjustments; changes in inventory; non-cash corporate allocations; other 
non-cash employee benefits, such as stock-based compensation; and depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. 
Mining includes all stripping costs. Stripping costs that provide access to mineral reserves that will be produced in future 
periods are expensed as incurred under US(cid:160)GAAP.
The weighted-average cash cost per pound produced represents the cumulative total of the cash costs for TC Mine and
Endako Mine divided by the cumulative total production from TC Mine and Endako Mine.

In preparing financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Critical accounting assumptions affect the consolidated financial statements materially and 
require a significant level of judgment by management. There is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could 
be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions and estimates.
Asset Impairments
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used, using a fair-value based approach when events 
and circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. The economic environment 
and copper, gold and molybdenum prices may be considered as impairment indicators for the purposes of these impairment 
assessments. In accordance with US GAAP, the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when 
the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss will 
be recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based on the difference between 
book value and the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group computed using discounted estimated future cash flows, or 
the application of an expected fair value technique in the absence of an observable market price. Future cash flows include
78
Table of Contents
estimates of recoverable quantities to be produced from estimated proven and probable mineral reserves, commodity prices 
(considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production quantities and capital expenditures, all 
based on life-of-mine plans and projections. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which 
identifiable cash flows exist that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. Generally, in estimating future 
cash flows, all assets are grouped at a particular mine for which there are identifiable cash flows.
Effective December 31, 2014, we placed the Endako Mine on temporary suspension due to adverse molybdenum market
conditions. Additionally, given mining performance for 2014, there was a decrease in the Endako Mine molybdenum proven 
and probable reserves. The temporary suspension and reserve decrease constituted triggering events, requiring us to re-evaluate 
long-lived assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2014. This evaluation indicated that our share of the anticipated 
undiscounted cash flows from Endako Mine assets were less than its share of the carrying value of the fixed assets due to the 
expected future molybdenum price and anticipated production and cash costs from the Endako Mine. This resulted in 
estimating our share of the assets’ estimated fair value, which was also less than our share of their carrying values. As a result, 
this evaluation resulted in non-cash asset impairments to our share of Endako Mine's assets in the fourth quarter of 2014, 
representing write downs to the assets' estimated fair value as of December(cid:160)31, 2014.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, we evaluated the fair value of our exploration properties given the significant
decline in commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2014. As a result, the fair value of those properties was less than the 
carrying values and we recognized non-cash asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2014, representing a write-down to the 
assets’ estimated fair value as of December 31, 2014.
We also evaluated the fair value of the remaining materials and supplies inventory at our TC Mine as of December 31, 
2014, given recent weakness in commodity markets. As a result, the fair value of TC Mine’s materials and supplies inventory 
was less than the carrying value and we recognized a non-cash asset impairment in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Given recent declines in commodity prices, we assessed all of our other long-lived assets for impairment in the fourth
quarter of 2014. Our impairment analysis did not result in any other long-lived asset impairments during the fourth quarter of 
2014. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be further asset write downs related to future operational 
challenges and/or if commodity prices further decline.
As of December 31, 2013 our decision to place TC Mine on care and maintenance and the update to the Endako Mine
molybdenum reserves using a price of $10 per pound of molybdenum oxide compared to $12 per pound used previously, 
constituted triggering events, requiring us to evaluate its long-lived assets at these mines for impairment in the fourth quarter of 
2013. As a result of these analyses, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment, representing a write down to the assets' estimated 
fair value as of December(cid:160)31, 2013.
Additionally during 2013, we negotiated a contract with US Energy to sell land originally acquired by one of our
subsidiaries for easements related to the Mt. Emmons project, in respect of which we terminated our interest in 2011. We 
assessed the impact of this contract on the carrying value of the land, and recorded a non-cash impairment representing a write 
down to the land's fair value.
For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2012, we recorded a non-cash write down of our share of the Endako property, plant,
equipment and development assets representing a write down to the assets' estimated fair value.
During the third quarter of 2012, we suspended waste stripping activity associated with the next phase of production at 
TC Mine. This decision and the decline in molybdenum prices represented significant changes in our business, requiring an 
evaluation for potential impairments on an enterprise-wide basis in accordance with US GAAP at September 30, 2012. For 
purposes of the impairment evaluation, estimates of after-tax discounted future cash flows of the individual reporting units were 
used. The estimated cash flows were derived from life-of-mine plans developed using long-term analyst pricing reflective of the 
then-current price environment and management's projections for operating costs. We also considered the market value of its 
equity. As a result of this evaluation, a goodwill impairment charge representing the entire balance of goodwill, was recorded in 
other expense and (income) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2013.
These impairments were included in total costs and expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss) and excluded from the non-GAAP measures of adjusted net income (loss) per share-basic and 
diluted. See Note 5 in Item 8 for more information. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in Item 7 for the definition and 
calculation of adjusted net income (loss).

Table of Contents
Mineral Reserves and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Property, plant, equipment and development are recorded at cost. Expenditures for property, plant, equipment and
development relating to new assets or improvements are capitalized if they extend useful lives or extend functionality. Fixed 
plant and machinery are amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on 
contained pounds to be produced from estimated proven and probable mineral reserves. Facilities, mobile and other equipment 
are depreciated on either a declining-balance basis or a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the 
life of the mine. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred, except when these repairs extend the life or 
functionality of the asset. In these instances, that portion of the expenditure is capitalized and amortized over the period 
benefited.
The estimate that most significantly affects the units-of-production rate is the quantity of proven and probable 
molybdenum mineral reserves. The estimation of mineral reserves is complex and involves the use of estimates and 
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include the use of geological modeling and sampling, as well as estimates of 
long-term copper, gold and molybdenum prices and future mining costs. These estimates and assumptions can change as a 
result of numerous factors, including new information gained from development activities, evolving production history and a 
reassessment of the viability of production under different economic conditions. Significant judgment is involved in the reserve 
estimates, and actual results may differ significantly from current assumptions.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates of the future costs we 
will incur to complete the work required to comply with existing laws and regulations at each mining operation. Actual costs 
may differ from the amounts estimated. Also, future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of 
reclamation and remediation work required.
Revenue Recognition
For concentrate sales, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss pass and when collectability is reasonably assured. 
For concentrate, this is typically when a provisional payment is received. The passing of title and risk of loss are based on terms 
of the sales contract, generally upon shipment or delivery of product. Revenues from our concentrate sales are recorded based 
on a provisional sales price, with an adjustment made for a final sales price calculated in accordance with the terms specified in 
the relevant sales contract. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in copper-gold concentrates is unrecoverable as 
a result of the smelting process, revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based on the quantity and 
value of these unrecoverable metals. Revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and all refining charges and 
the impact of derivative contracts. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments that are 
contractually negotiated, as typical in the industry. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in concentrate is 
unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, our revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances based 
on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals.
Under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the industry, metals contained in concentrate are
generally provisionally priced at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in a specified future month 
(generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average spot copper prices on the London 
Metal Exchange (LME) or the London Bullion Market association (LBMA). We receive market prices based on prices in the 
specified future month, which results in mark-to-market price fluctuations recorded to revenues until the date of settlement. We 
have hedging arrangements in place to limit the exposure to such pricing fluctuations.
To satisfy our obligations under the Gold Stream Arrangement, we purchase unallocated refined gold and arrange for
delivery to Royal Gold's designated account. We recognize revenue for sales of refined gold when title and risk of loss passes 
and when collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from and costs for unallocated refined gold delivered under the Gold 
Stream Arrangement and gains and losses related to forward commodity gold contracts to hedge our exposure under the Gold 
Stream Arrangement are netted and recorded to gold sales.
We recognize revenue from molybdenum sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is
determinable, the product has been delivered, title has transferred and collection is reasonably assured. Our sales contracts 
specify the point in the delivery process at which title transfers to the customer (shipping point or destination). Shipping and 
handling fees are accounted for on a gross basis under the terms of the contract. We recognize tolling and calcining revenue 
under contractual arrangements as the services are performed on a per-unit basis.
We enter into provisionally-priced molybdenum sales contracts, whereby the contracts settle at prices to be determined at 
a future date based upon quoted prices. The future pricing mechanism of these agreements constitutes an embedded derivative,

Table of Contents
which is bifurcated and separately marked to an estimated fair value at the end of each period. Changes to the fair value of 
embedded derivatives related to molybdenum sales agreements are included in molybdenum sales revenue in the determination 
of net income (loss).
Income and Mining Taxes
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable,
as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying 
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be 
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates and laws is recognized in net 
income (loss) in the period in which such changes are enacted.
A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits
will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income, 
reversal of taxable temporary differences, carry backs and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If 
we determine that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance will be increased with a 
charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we make a determination that we ultimately will be able to realize all or a portion 
of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance 
will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense.
At December 31, 2014, tax valuation allowances totaled $279.4 million. Of this amount, $74.9 million related to
allowances covering our foreign tax credit and alternative minimum tax credit carry-forwards in the US, $15.1 million related 
to allowances covering some of the capital and non-capital tax loss carry-forwards in Canada, $22.4 million related to 
allowances covering unrealized foreign exchange capital losses and $167.0 million related to allowances covering some of our 
tax basis in previous capital expenditures, primarily associated with the mill expansion project at Endako Mine and the 
stripping costs at TC Mine.
The determination of our tax expense for the year and future tax assets and liabilities involves significant management
estimation and judgment involving a number of assumptions. In determining these amounts, management interprets tax 
legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and makes estimates of the expected timing of the reversal of future tax assets and 
liabilities. We also make estimates of future earnings that affect cross border tax rate assumptions, tax planning strategies and 
the extent to which potential future tax benefits may be used. We are subject to assessments by various taxation authorities who 
may interpret tax legislation differently. These differences may affect the final amount or the timing of the payment of taxes. 
We provide for such differences where known based on management's best estimate of the probable outcome of these matters.
ITEM 7A.(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Commodity Price Risk
Our consolidated revenues include the sale of concentrate from Mount Milligan mine and the sale of molybdenum in 
various forms from TC and Endako Mines and from third-party material that is purchased, processed and sold from our and 
other mines as well as the Langeloth Facility. Our financial results can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the 
market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum.
Copper and Gold
Substantially all of our concentrate sales contracts provide final pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four 
months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted LBMA monthly average spot gold prices or quoted LME monthly 
average spot copper prices. We receive market prices based on prices in the specified future period, which results in price 
fluctuations recorded through revenues until the date of settlement. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was 
recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final 
pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising copper and gold prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of 
provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper and gold prices, the 
opposite occurs.
At December(cid:160)31, 2014, we had copper sales totaling 64.7 million pounds of copper recorded at an average realized price 
of $3.02 per pound, of which approximately 21.2 million pounds are subject to final pricing over the next several months. We 
estimate that each $0.10 change in the price realized from the December(cid:160)31, 2014 provisional price recorded would have a net 
impact on 2014 consolidated revenues of approximately $6.3 million. Additionally, at December(cid:160)31, 2014, under derivative
81
Table of Contents
contracts designed to hedge our copper price risk, we had contracts to sell 7.7 million pounds of copper at prices between 
$3.05-$3.19 per pound through May, 2015.
At December(cid:160)31, 2014, we had gold sales totaling 172,741 ounces of gold recorded at an average realized price of $1,002
per ounce, of which approximately 11,356 ounces are subject to final pricing over the next several months. We estimate that 
each $25 change in the price realized from the December(cid:160)31, 2014 provisional price recorded would have a net impact on our 
share of the 2014 consolidated revenues of approximately $2.0 million.
To satisfy our obligation under the Gold Stream Arrangement, we purchase unallocated refined gold and arrange for
delivery to Royal Gold's designated account. We are currently required to pay Royal Gold upon receipt of final payment from 
the applicable offtakers. We receive final payments in cash, thus requiring the purchase of gold in order to satisfy the obligation 
to pay Royal Gold in gold.
In order to hedge our gold price risk that arises when physical purchase and concentrate sales pricing periods do not
match, we enter into certain forward gold purchase and sales contracts where we purchase gold at an average price during a 
quotational period (QP) and sell gold at a spot price. We record our commodity contracts at fair value using a market approach 
based on observable quote market prices and contracted prices.
At December(cid:160)31, 2014, under derivative contracts designed to hedge gold price risk, we had contracts to purchase 31,060
ounces of gold at prices to be determined and to sell 31,761 ounces at prices between $1,150-$1,230 per ounce.
Molybdenum
We enter into provisionally-priced sales contracts, whereby the contracts settle at prices to be determined at a future date.
The future pricing mechanism of these agreements constitutes an embedded derivative, which is bifurcated and separately 
marked to estimated fair value at the end of each period. Changes to the fair value of embedded derivatives related to 
molybdenum sales contracts are included in molybdenum sales revenue in the determination of net income (loss). To the extent 
final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to molybdenum sales is 
recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. Accordingly, in times of rising molybdenum prices, molybdenum 
sales benefit from higher prices received for contracts priced at current market rates and also from an increase related to the 
final pricing of provisionally-priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior years; in times of falling molybdenum 
prices, the opposite occurs. We also enter into certain molybdenum sales contracts to sell future molybdenum production at 
fixed prices. These fixed prices may be different than the quoted market price at the date of sale.
For the year ending December(cid:160)31, 2014, we estimate that for each $1 per pound change in the price realized for
molybdenum sales (using molybdenum pounds sold from our mines), our 2014 revenue would change by approximately $28.5 
million.
The following table sets forth our outstanding provisionally-priced molybdenum contracts as of December 31, 2014:

For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we treated these contracts as normal purchase and normal sales
contracts.
In the normal course of operations, we enter into agreements for the purchase of molybdenum. As of December 31, 2014, 
we had commitments to purchase approximately 14.8 million pounds of molybdenum sulfide concentrate from 2015 to 2017, to 
be priced at a discount to the market price for molybdenum oxide at the time of purchase.
Other

Table of Contents
In the normal course of operations, we enter into agreements for the purchase of natural gas for use at the Langeloth 
facility. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, we had commitments to purchase approximately 147.9 thousand dekatherms (dt) from 
October 2015-September 2016 at prices ranging from $2.91-$3.38.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We transact business in various currencies in the normal course of operations. All of our revenues are denominated in the 
US dollar; however, we pay certain expenses attributable to its Canadian operations in the Canadian dollar. As a result, we have 
ongoing foreign exchange translation risk with respect to its Canadian operations. A decrease of 10% in the value of the US 
dollar relative to the Canadian dollar would have impacted operating income (loss), (excluding the impact of non-cash asset 
impairments), during the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 by approximately $39.9 million.
To help mitigate this risk, from time to time, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, in which we have agreed
to buy Canadian dollars at an agreed-upon rate. Please refer to Note 6 within Item 8 of this 10-K for further discussion. We 
record our currency contracts at fair value using a market approach based on observable quoted exchange rates and contracted 
notional amounts. As of December 31, 2014, we had 8 open foreign currency contracts.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 2012
(US dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
1. Description of Business
Thompson Creek Metals Company(cid:160)Inc. ("TCM") is a North American mining company incorporated under the laws of 
British Columbia with copper, gold and molybdenum mining, milling, processing and marketing operations in Canada and the 
United States ("US").
The Copper-Gold operations consist of Mount Milligan Mine, a conventional truck-shovel open-pit copper and gold mine
and concentrator in British Columbia. The US operations for molybdenum include the Thompson Creek Mine ("TC Mine") 
(mine and mill) in Idaho and the Langeloth Metallurgical Roasting Facility (the "Langeloth Facility") in Pennsylvania. The 
Canadian operations for molybdenum consist of a 75% joint venture interest in the Endako Molybdenum Mine Joint Venture 
("Endako Mine") (mine, mill and roaster) in British Columbia. As previously disclosed, effective December 31, 2014, TC Mine 
was placed on care and maintenance after completing the processing of stockpiled ore from Phase 7. TCM is conducting limited 
stripping at the mine for the next phase of mining  (referred to as “Phase 8”) to maintain its options while TCM continue to 
evaluate alternatives for TC Mine. Additionally, due to adverse conditions in the molybdenum market, TCM's Endako Mine 
was placed on temporary suspension, effective December 31, 2014. TCM will continue to closely monitor market conditions 
and re-evaluate the status of the Endako Mine as market conditions warrant.
TCM also has a 100% interest in a copper and molybdenum exploration property located in British Columbia (the “Berg 
property”), a 100% interest in a gold exploration project located in Nunavut, Canada (the "Maze Lake property"), and a 0.51% 
net smelter return royalty and a 10.2% net profits interest in a zinc and lead exploration project located in Canada (the 
"Howards Pass property").
2. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Preparation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States ("US(cid:160)GAAP"). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TCM 
and its subsidiaries, and intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. TCM also consolidates 
its 75% proportionate interest in the accounts of the unincorporated Endako Mine joint venture.
Certain prior year amounts in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Financial amounts are presented in United 
States (“US”) dollars unless otherwise stated. References to C$(cid:160)are Canadian dollars.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US(cid:160)GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. As the estimation 
process is inherently uncertain, actual future outcomes could differ from current estimates and assumptions, potentially having 
material effects on future financial statements. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include 
mineral reserve estimation; useful asset lives for depreciation, depletion and amortization; reclamation and closure costs; 
environmental obligations; deferred taxes and valuation allowances; asset fair values in evaluating asset impairments and 
estimates of recoverable copper, gold and other minerals.
Currency Translation
The functional currency of TCM and its US operations is the US dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with resulting gains or 
losses reported in (gain) loss on foreign exchange in the computation of net income (loss). Other non-monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated at historic rates. Revenues, expenses and cash flows in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars 
at average exchange rates.

(US dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
The functional currency of TCM's Canadian operations is the Canadian dollar. The assets and liabilities for those
subsidiaries with a Canadian dollar functional currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and 
revenues and expenditures are translated at average exchange rates. Differences arising from these foreign currency translations 
are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' 
equity.
Change in Estimate
On January 1, 2014, the Life of Mine Plan ("LOM") for the Endako Mine was revised to reflect long term molybdenum
pricing expectations. As a result, Endako Mine's estimated mine life was reduced to approximately 3.5 years from 15 years. 
During the second quarter of 2014, in light of the reduced mine life and to better reflect the economic utilization of property, 
plant and equipment assets at the Endako Mine, TCM reduced the depreciable lives of Endako Mine's property, plant and 
equipment assets using the straight line and declining balance depreciation convention (the depreciable lives of assets using the 
units-of-production depreciation convention had been reduced in the first quarter of 2014) and began considering the salvage 
values of these assets when recognizing its share of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. This change in estimate, 
effective as of April(cid:160)1, 2014, was accounted for prospectively in accordance with ASC 205,(cid:160)Accounting Changes and Error 
Corrections. This change lowered depreciation expense and increased net income by $2.3 million, or approximately $0.01 per 
diluted share, and $7.4 million, or approximately $0.04 per diluted share, respectively, for the three months and year ended 
December(cid:160)31, 2014.
Fair Value Measurement
US(cid:160)GAAP accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standards establish a fair value 
hierarchy that distinguishes between (1)(cid:160)market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from 
independent sources (observable inputs) and (2)(cid:160)an entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed 
based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three 
broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
(Level(cid:160)1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level(cid:160)3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described 
below:
Level(cid:160)1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities.
Level(cid:160)2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for
substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level(cid:160)3 Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash is comprised of cash deposits held at banks. Cash equivalents are financial instruments issued or guaranteed by 
major financial institutions and governments that have an original maturity date of less than 90(cid:160)days. Cash equivalents are 
stated at cost, which approximates market value. Restricted cash is primarily comprised of amounts withheld related to certain 
construction contracts and amounts to fund TCM's deferred compensation program.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Accounts receivable included trade receivables of
$45.1 million and $41.6 million and other receivables of $1.0 million and $6.2 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. Other receivables as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 primarily consisted of $2.0 million of Goods and Services Sales Tax 
refunds receivable; $0.9 million of Langeloth Facility receivables; $0.3 million of third party molybdenum receivables; $1.3 
million in settlement receivables on hedges and other miscellaneous receivables, partially offset by $3.5 million of mark-to-
market adjustments relating to provisional invoices for Mount Milligan Mine copper and gold concentrate sales. Other 
receivables as of December(cid:160)31, 2013 primarily consisted of $3.3 million of Goods and Services Sales Tax refunds and Canadian

(US dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
Harmonized Sales Tax refunds and $0.3 million of mark-to-market adjustments relating to provisional invoices for Mount 
Milligan Mine copper and gold concentrate sales.
Product Inventories
Product inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market and assessed monthly to determine if a write down is
required; through the first quarter of 2012, the assessment was performed quarterly. Cost is comprised of production costs for 
copper-gold concentrate ("concentrate") and molybdenum concentrate ("molybdenum") produced and processed from TCM's 
mines, as well as amounts paid for molybdenum concentrate purchased from third parties. Production costs include the direct 
mining, milling and on-site general and administrative costs; costs of processing and roasting; transportation, shipping, freight 
and insurance costs; refining and treatment costs; warehouse costs; stock-based compensation and depreciation, depletion and 
amortization. Stripping costs (i.e.,(cid:160)the costs of removing overburden and waste material to access mineral deposits) incurred 
during the production phase of a mine are considered variable production costs and are included as a component of inventory 
produced during the period in which stripping costs are incurred. For concentrate, TCM uses the weighted-average cost method 
for production and sales of product inventory. For molybdenum, TCM uses the first-in, first-out cost method for production and 
sales of product inventory. For both the copper-gold operations and molybdenum operations, the weighted-average cost method 
is used for stockpiled ore.
Obsolescence
TCM routinely evaluates materials and supplies inventory for obsolescence. When necessary, obsolete and surplus
materials and supplies are written down in a manner that reduces the inventory value to an amount that does not exceed its net 
realizable value, which may be considered salvage value, with the difference charged to current period expenses. During 2014, 
2013 and 2012, TCM recorded write downs for obsolete materials and supplies inventory of $2.8 million, $2.4 million and $0.2 
million, respectively.
Property, Plant, Equipment and Development
Mineral Properties
TCM capitalizes the costs to acquire mineral properties. On acquisition of a mineral property, TCM estimates the fair
value of proven and probable mineral reserves, as well as the value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves, and records 
any costs incurred as assets at the date of acquisition. The costs assigned to mineral properties in production are amortized over 
the life of the mine using the units-of-production method based on the volume of mineral produced in relation to the total 
estimated proven and probable mineral reserves. The cost assigned to the value beyond proven and probable mineral reserves is 
not amortized. However, as new information is obtained or economic conditions change, mineralized material may be 
converted into proven and probable mineral reserves at which time the capitalized costs associated with mineralized material 
are reclassified as costs subject to amortization.
Mine Development
Capitalization of mine development costs that meet the definition of an asset begins once all operating permits have been
secured, mineralization is classified as proven and probable reserves and a final feasibility study has been completed. Mine 
development costs include engineering and metallurgical studies, drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore body and 
the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body at open pit surface mines. Costs incurred before mineral resources are 
classified as proven and probable reserves are expensed and classified as exploration expense, unless it can be substantiated 
prior to the commencement of a drilling program that the drilling costs will result in the conversion of a mineral resource into 
proven and probable reserves. All capitalized costs are amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life 
of the ore body based on recoverable quantities to be produced from estimated proven and probable mineral reserves. Interest 
expense allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to construct new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready 
for their intended use. Gains or losses from sales or retirements of assets are included in costs and expenses on the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Tax credits, which will be used to offset future taxable income, 
generated from qualifying new mine development costs are included as reductions to property, plant, equipment and 
development and increases to deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The benefit from these tax incentives will

be reflected in net income over the estimated life of the ore body, along with the capitalized mine development costs which 
generated the credits.
Facilities and Equipment
Mining facilities and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for facilities and equipment relating to new assets or
improvements are capitalized if they extend useful lives or extend functionality. Fixed plant and machinery are amortized using 
the units-of-production method over the lesser of the estimated life of the equipment or the ore body based on recoverable 
quantities to be produced from estimated proven and probable mineral reserves. Facilities, mobile and other equipment are 
depreciated on either a declining-balance or straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the life of the 
mine. The declining-balance percentages range from 10% to 50%, and the estimated useful lives range from 3(cid:160)years to life-of-
mine. Processing facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 20(cid:160)years. 
Tax allowances, which will be used to offset future taxable income, generated from qualifying new mine facilities and 
equipment expenditures are included as reductions to property, plant, equipment and development and increases to deferred tax 
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The benefit from these tax incentives will be reflected in net income over estimated 
life of the facilities and equipment, along with the associated expenditures which generated the allowances.
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred, except when these repairs extend the life or
functionality of the asset. In these instances, expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the period benefited.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization is allocated to product inventory cost and then included in depreciation,
depletion and amortization as inventory is sold.
Additionally, interest expense and financing fees allocable to the cost of developing mining properties and to constructing
new facilities is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. For the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 
2012, $4.1 million, $75.2 million and $52.3 million, respectively, of interest expense and financing fees were capitalized and 
$9.1 million, $74.7 million, $40.7 million, respectively of interest that had been formerly capitalized was paid.
Exploration
Exploration includes geological and geophysical work on areas without identified reserves, together with drilling and
other related costs. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Asset Impairments
TCM reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment using a two-step approach when events and changes in
circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be recoverable. If total estimated future cash 
flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the assets (step 1), TCM performs an evaluation of the 
estimated fair value of the asset or asset group (step 2). An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the difference 
between book value and the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is estimated using discounted estimated 
future cash flows, or the application of an expected fair value technique in the absence of an observable market price. Future 
cash flows include estimates of recoverable quantities to be produced from estimated proven and probable mineral reserves, 
commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), production quantities and capital 
expenditures, all based on life-of-mine plans and projections. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest 
level for which identifiable cash flows exist that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. Generally, in 
estimating future cash flows, all assets are grouped at a particular mine for which there are identifiable cash flows. The 
assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Any differences between 
TCM's assumptions and market conditions and/or TCM's operating performance could have a material effect on the 
determination of ore reserves or the ability to recover the carrying amounts of TCM's long-lived assets, thus resulting in 
impairment charges.
During 2014, 2013 and 2012, TCM experienced triggering events that caused management to update its impairment 
evaluation. As a result of this evaluation, in 2014 TCM further impaired the value of the remaining materials and supplies 
inventory at TC Mine and TCM's share of the property, plant and equipment assets and materials and supplies inventory at 
Endako Mine. Additionally in 2014, TCM also wrote down the value of the TCM exploration properties. In 2013 TCM wrote 
down to the assets’ fair value  the property, plant and equipment assets and materials and supplies inventory at TC Mine and

TCM's share of those assets at Endako Mine. In 2012 TCM wrote down TCM's share of the assets at Endako Mine. See Note 5 
for further discussion.
Goodwill
During 2012, TCM suspended waste stripping activity associated with the next phase of production at TC Mine, which, 
coupled with declines in molybdenum prices, represented significant changes in TCM's business, thereby requiring TCM to 
evaluate goodwill for impairment on an enterprise-wide basis. As a result of this evaluation, the then-remaining balance of 
goodwill was impaired during 2012. See Note 5 for further discussion.
Legal Fees
TCM generally recognizes legal expenses as incurred; when it is determined that a contingency meets the criteria for
recognition as a liability on the balance sheet, TCM also accrues for the related incurred legal fees associated with that probable 
contingency.
Debt Issuance Costs
Included in other long-term assets are costs associated with the issuance of TCM's secured and unsecured senior notes
and tangible equity units ("tMEDS"). The remaining unamortized issuance costs at December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013 totaled $15.3 
million and $21.3 million, respectively, and are being amortized over the life of the senior notes or the tMEDS, as applicable. 
Amortization costs for the secured and unsecured senior notes and tMEDS were capitalized to Mount Milligan Mine until the 
underlying assets became ready for their intended use.
Equipment Financings
TCM is the lessee of equipment under the Equipment Facility with Caterpillar (see Note(cid:160)8). In 2013, TCM entered into an 
equipment financing transaction with Caterpillar with respect to certain Endako Mine equipment. In 2013 and 2012, TCM also 
entered into equipment financing transactions with Caterpillar with respect to certain equipment at Mount Milligan Mine 
pursuant to the Equipment Facility. On January 15, 2015 TCM entered into an amendment with Caterpillar which extends its 
ability to finance additional equipment under the Equipment Facility through December 2015. The assets and liabilities under 
these capital leases are recorded at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the asset. 
Once ready for their intended use, the assets are depreciated over the lower of their related lease terms or their estimated 
productive lives. Beginning in September 2013, in conjunction with the start-up phase of Mount Milligan Mine, TCM ceased 
capitalizing the interest and debt issuance costs associated with the leases under the Equipment Facility for Mt. Milligan Mine 
as the related assets were placed in service.
Financial Instruments
From time to time, TCM enters into various arrangements, such as forward commodity contracts, foreign currency 
forward contracts and fixed- and provisionally-priced purchase and sale contracts. TCM does not account for any of these 
arrangements using hedge accounting.
Financial and derivative instruments (including embedded derivatives) and any outstanding common stock purchase
warrants are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded 
each period in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). All of TCM's once-outstanding 
common stock purchase warrants were exercised or expired as of December 31, 2012.
Provision for Income and Mining Taxes
TCM computes income taxes using the asset and liability approach that results in the recognition of deferred tax assets 
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences or benefits of temporary differences between the financial reporting 
basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards, using enacted tax rates in 
effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax

liabilities, projected future taxable income, carryback of losses and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A 
valuation allowance is provided for the portion of TCM's net deferred tax assets for which it is not more likely than not that 
they will be realized.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Future obligations to retire an asset, including site closure, dismantling, remediation and ongoing treatment and
monitoring, are recorded as a liability at fair value at the time of construction or development. The fair value determination is 
based on estimated future cash flows, the current credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate and an estimated inflation factor. The 
value of asset retirement obligations is evaluated on an annual basis or as new information becomes available on the expected 
amounts and timing of cash flows required to discharge the liability. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying 
amount of the associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated or amortized over the estimated life of the 
asset. An accretion cost, representing the increase over time in the present value of the liability, is recorded each period as 
accretion expense. As reclamation work is performed or liabilities are otherwise settled, the recorded amount of the liability is 
reduced.
Revenue Recognition
TCM sells its products pursuant to sales contracts entered into with its customers. For concentrate sales, revenue is 
recognized when title and risk of loss pass and when collectability is reasonably assured. For concentrate, this is when a 
provisional payment is received. The passing of title and risk of loss are based on terms of the sales contract, generally upon 
shipment or delivery of product. Revenues from TCM’s concentrate sales are recorded based on a provisional sales price, with 
adjustments made for a final sales price calculated in accordance with the terms specified in the relevant sales contract, 
including the price to be received under the Gold Stream Arrangement, as well as any potential losses from TCM's commitment 
under the Gold Stream Arrangement. Revenues from concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment and all refining charges 
and the impact of derivative contracts. Treatment and refining charges represent payments or price adjustments that are 
contractually negotiated, as is typical in the industry. Moreover, because a portion of the metals contained in concentrate is 
unrecoverable as a result of the smelting process, TCM's revenues from concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances 
based on the quantity and value of these unrecoverable metals.
Under the long-established structure of sales agreements prevalent in the industry, metals contained in concentrate are
generally provisionally priced at the time of shipment. The provisional prices are finalized in a specified future month 
(generally one to four months from the shipment date) based on quoted monthly average spot gold prices on the London Metal 
Exchange ("LME") or spot copper prices on the London Bullion Market Association ("LBMA"). TCM receives market prices 
based on prices in the specified future month, which results in mark-to-market price fluctuations recorded to revenues until the 
date of settlement. To the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or 
decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing.
To satisfy its obligations under the Gold Stream Arrangement, TCM purchases unallocated refined gold and arranges for
delivery to Royal Gold's designated account. TCM recognizes revenue for sales of refined gold when title and risk of loss 
passes and when collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from and costs for unallocated refined gold delivered under the 
Gold Stream Arrangement and gains and losses related to TCM's forward commodity gold contracts to hedge the Company's 
exposure under the Gold Stream Arrangement are netted and recorded to gold sales.
TCM recognizes revenue from molybdenum sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed
and determinable, the product has been delivered, title has transferred and collection is reasonably assured. TCM's sales 
contracts specify the point in the delivery process at which title transfers to the customer (shipping point or destination). 
Shipping and handling fees are accounted for on a gross basis under the terms of the contract. TCM recognizes tolling and 
calcining revenue under contractual arrangements as the services are performed on a per-unit basis.
TCM enters into provisionally-priced molybdenum, copper and gold sales contracts, whereby the contracts settle at prices
to be determined at a future date based upon quoted prices. The future pricing mechanism of these agreements constitutes an 
embedded derivative, which is bifurcated and separately marked to an estimated fair value at the end of each period. Changes to

the fair value of embedded derivatives related to molybdenum sales agreements are included in molybdenum sales revenue in 
the determination of net income (loss).
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock Options
TCM measures compensation related to stock options based on the fair value of instruments issued. The fair value of
stock options at grant date is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation expense is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the stock option vesting period and included in the specific income statement categories that include the 
costs and benefits of the employees granted the stock-based award. Proceeds arising from the exercise of stock options are 
credited to common stock.
Performance Share Units
Performance share units ("PSUs") are accounted for at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model on the
date of grant. The Monte Carlo model is based on random projections of stock price paths. Expected volatility is calculated 
using a weighted average of historical daily volatilities and represents the extent to which TCM's stock price performance is 
expected to fluctuate during each of the calendar periods of the award's anticipated term. The fair value is recognized as an 
expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) and included in the specific income 
statement categories that include the costs and benefits of the employees granted PSUs. Upon vesting, common shares are 
issued to the employee from authorized but unissued common stock. According to the provisions of(cid:160)ASC 718, Compensation—
Stock Compensation, stock based compensation expense is reversed for unvested and forfeited PSUs.
Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units ("RSUs") are accounted for at fair value, which is based on the market value of TCM's common 
shares on the day of grant. The total fair value is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and 
included in the specific income statement categories that include the costs and benefits of the employee and directors granted 
RSUs. Upon vesting, common shares are issued to the employee or director from authorized but unissued common stock. 
According to the provisions of(cid:160)ASC 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, stock based compensation expense is reversed 
for unvested and forfeited RSUs.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
TCM's employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") provides an opportunity for TCM's employees to purchase its common
shares at 85% of the closing price at the beginning of the offering period or at the end of the offering period, whichever is 
lower. The ESPP was suspended effective July 1, 2013 pending approval of an amended plan by the TCM shareholders. 
Effective May(cid:160)13, 2014, TCM shareholders approved the Amended and Restated Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. 2010 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan that makes additional shares of TCM's common stock available for issuance.
Earnings per Share
Earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted-average number of common shares issued and outstanding 
during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method, which assumes that outstanding 
stock options and warrants with an average exercise price less than the average market price of TCM's common shares are 
exercised, and the proceeds are used to repurchase common shares at the average market price of the common shares for the 
period. In years in which a loss is incurred, the effect of potential issuances of shares under the exercise of options, warrants 
and RSUs would be anti-dilutive, and therefore, are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations.

(1) Included an impairment charge on development assets for Endako Mine for the year ended December 31, 2012.
Effective December 31, 2014, TCM and its joint venture partner temporarily suspended operations at Endako Mine due to 
recent and expected ongoing weakness in the molybdenum price. Additionally, given mining performance for 2014, there was a 
decrease in the Endako Mine molybdenum proven and probable reserves. The temporary suspension and reserve decrease 
constituted triggering events, requiring TCM to re-evaluate its proportionate share of Endako Mine's long-lived assets for 
impairment in the fourth quarter of 2014. This evaluation indicated that TCM's share of the anticipated undiscounted cash flows 
from Endako Mine assets, using the two-step approach discussed in Note 2, were less than its share of the carrying value of the 
fixed assets due to the expected future molybdenum price and anticipated production and cash costs from the Endako Mine. 
This resulted in estimating TCM's share of the assets’ estimated fair value, which was also less than TCM's share of their 
carrying values. As a result, this evaluation resulted in non-cash write downs of the Endako Mine property, plant and equipment 
assets and materials and supply inventory.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, TCM evaluated the fair value of its exploration properties given the significant 
decline in commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2014. This evaluation indicated that the fair value of these properties was 
less than TCM's carrying values and non-cash write downs were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014, representing a write-
down to the assets’ estimated fair value as of December 31, 2014.

(US dollars in millions, except per share amounts)
5. Asset Impairments (Continued)
TCM also evaluated the fair value of its remaining materials and supplies inventory at TC Mine as of December 31, 2014, 
given recent weakness in commodity markets. As a result, the fair value of TC Mine’s materials and supplies inventory was less 
than the carrying value and TCM recognized non-cash write downs in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Given recent declines in commodity prices, TCM assessed all long-lived assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of
2014. The impairment analysis did not result in any other long-lived asset impairments during the fourth quarter of 2014.
As of December 31, 2013 TCM's decision to place TC Mine on care and maintenance and the update to its Endako Mine
molybdenum reserves using a price of $10 per pound of molybdenum oxide compared to $12 per pound used previously, 
constituted triggering events, requiring TCM to evaluate the long-lived assets at these mines for impairment in the fourth 
quarter of 2013. As a result of these analyses, TCM recorded a non-cash asset impairment, representing a write down to the 
assets' estimated fair value as of December(cid:160)31, 2013.
Additionally during 2013, TCM negotiated a contract with US Energy to sell land originally acquired by one of its
subsidiaries for easements related to the Mt. Emmons project, in respect of which TCM terminated its interest in 2011. TCM 
assessed the impact of this contract on the carrying value of the land, and recorded a non-cash write down of the land 
representing a write down to the land's fair value.
For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2012, TCM recorded a non-cash write down of its share of the Endako Mine's property,
plant, equipment and development assets representing a write down to the assets' estimated fair value.
These impairments were included in total costs and expenses in TCM's Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss) and excluded from TCM's non-GAAP measures of adjusted net income (loss) per share-basic 
and diluted. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in Item 7 for the definition and calculation of adjusted net income (loss).
Goodwill
On October(cid:160)26, 2006, TCM acquired Thompson Creek Metals Company USA, a private company that owned, among
other assets, TC Mine, Endako Mine and the Langeloth Facility. This acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method, 
whereby the purchase consideration was allocated to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at 
the effective date of the purchase. Because the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, 
TCM recorded goodwill related to this transaction.
During the third quarter of 2012, TCM suspended waste stripping activity associated with the next phase of production at
TC Mine. This decision and the decline in molybdenum prices represented significant changes in TCM's business, requiring 
TCM to evaluate for potential impairments on an enterprise-wide basis at September 30, 2012. For purposes of the impairment 
evaluation, estimates of after-tax discounted future cash flows of the individual reporting units were used. The estimated cash 
flows were derived from life-of-mine plans developed using long-term analyst pricing reflective of the then-current price 
environment and management's projections for operating costs. TCM also considered the market value of its equity. As a result 
of this evaluation, a goodwill impairment charge representing the entire balance of goodwill, was recorded in other (income) 
expense in its Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in 2012.
6. Financial Instruments
TCM enters into various derivative financial instruments in the normal course of operations to manage exposure to the
market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum. TCM does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative instruments. 
Accordingly, changes in fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and 
Comprehensive Income (Loss), except those contracts for which TCM has elected to apply the normal purchases and normal 
sales scope exception.
The following table provides details about the fair values of TCM's derivative assets and liabilities:

(1)TCM's derivative assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and derivative liabilities are included in
other current liabilities. TCM is exposed to credit risk when counterparties with which it has entered into derivative 
transactions are unable to satisfy their obligations. To reduce counterparty credit exposure, TCM deals primarily with large, 
credit-worthy financial institutions and companies and limits credit exposure to each. TCM believes the counterparties to the 
contracts to be credit-worthy entities and, therefore, TCM believes credit risk of counterparty non-performance is relatively 
low, and as such, the fair value of the derivatives has not been adjusted.

Gold Hedges Related to Gold Stream Arrangement and Other Commodity Contracts
TCM must satisfy its obligation under the Gold Stream Arrangement (discussed in Note 10) by delivering gold to Royal 
Gold after TCM receives payment from third-party purchasers, including offtakers and traders, that purchase concentrate from 
Mount Milligan Mine ("MTM Customers"). During 2014, in connection with TCM's first 12 shipments of concentrate from 
Mount Milligan Mine, TCM delivered gold to Royal Gold based on a percentage of the gold ounces included in each 
provisional sale of gold to MTM Customers within two days of receiving a provisional payment.
TCM receives payment from MTM Customers in cash, thus requiring the purchase of gold in order to satisfy the
obligation to pay Royal Gold in gold. In order to hedge its gold price risk that arises when physical purchase and concentrate 
sales pricing periods do not match, hereafter referred to as the Gold Stream Risk, TCM has entered into certain forward gold 
purchase and sales contracts pursuant to which it purchases gold at an average price during a quotational period and sells gold 
at a spot price. TCM records its forward commodity contracts at fair value using a market approach based on observable quoted 
market prices and contracted prices.
In addition to the Gold Stream Risk and in connection with the sale of concentrate from Mount Milligan Mine, TCM is
exposed to copper and gold price fluctuations between the dates of concentrate shipment, provisional payment and final 
payment. In order to hedge the price risk for the metals contained in concentrate, TCM has entered into certain forward copper 
and gold purchase and sale contracts pursuant to which it purchases copper or gold at an average price during a quotational 
period and sells copper or gold at a spot price. Additionally, TCM has entered into zero cost collars pursuant to which it agrees 
with a counterparty to a floor and ceiling relative to future prices of gold. If the gold price is below the floor, the counterparty 
pays TCM the difference between the price and the floor. If the gold price is above the ceiling, TCM pays the counterparty the 
difference between the ceiling and the price. TCM records its commodity contracts at fair value using a market approach based 
on observable quoted market prices and contracted prices. These activities are intended to protect against the price risk related 
to the MTM Customer purchase contracts.

Certain molybdenum, copper and gold sales contracts provide for provisional pricing. These sales contain an embedded
derivative related to the provisional-pricing mechanism, which is bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative. TCM also enters 
into provisionally-priced molybdenum purchase contracts that also contain an embedded derivative, which is bifurcated and 
accounted for as a derivative.
TCM determines the fair value of its provisionally-priced contracts using a market approach based upon observable inputs
from published market prices and contract terms. Changes to the fair values of the embedded derivatives related to 
provisionally-priced molybdenum purchases are included in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations 
and Comprehensive Income (Loss) as the product is sold.

TCM transacts business in various currencies in the normal course of its operations and for capital expenditures. In 
addition, with all of its revenues denominated in US dollars, TCM has an ongoing foreign exchange risk with respect to its 
Canadian operations. To help mitigate this risk, TCM has entered into foreign currency forward contracts pursuant to which it 
has agreed to buy Canadian dollars at an agreed-upon rate. TCM records its currency contracts at fair value using a market 
approach based on observable quoted exchange rates and contracted notional amounts. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM had 8 
open foreign currency option contracts. As of December(cid:160)31, 2013 and 2012, TCM had no open foreign currency contracts.

Fixed-Priced Contracts
TCM has entered into certain sales contracts pursuant to which it sells future molybdenum production at fixed prices.
These fixed prices may be different than the quoted market prices at the date of sale. TCM has elected to treat these contracts as 
normal purchase and normal sale contracts.
The Gold Stream Arrangement contains an agreement to sell gold at a fixed price, but it does not meet the definition of a
derivative instrument. See discussion of the Gold Stream Arrangement in Note 10.

November 2015
US(cid:160)GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standards establish a fair value hierarchy that 
distinguishes between (1)(cid:160)market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources 
(observable inputs) and (2)(cid:160)an entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best 
information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The sensitivity to changes in inputs and their impact on the 
fair value measurement can be significant. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest 
priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level(cid:160)1) and the lowest priority to 
unobservable inputs (Level(cid:160)3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level(cid:160)1
Level(cid:160)2
Level(cid:160)3
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical,
unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for
substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
The following table sets forth TCM's financial liabilities measured at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy. As
required, liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement, as discussed in Note 2.

TCM classified its senior secured and unsecured notes within Level 2 because they are valued using a mix of inputs,
including a risk-free interest rate input that is quoted in an active market and credit spread inputs that are observable but are not  
quoted market prices for identical liabilities. Both inputs are negatively correlated to the fair value measure; an increase 
(decrease) in the input will decrease (increase) the fair value measure.
TCM classified its tMEDS within Level 3 because they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. TCM
determined the fair value of the debt component of tMEDS using a discounted cash flow model by obtaining yields for 
comparably-rated issuers trading in the market, considering the market yield of existing TCM debt and the credit rating of 
TCM.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, the carrying values of the 9.75% senior secured notes were lower than their fair values of
approximately $393.2 million, while the carrying value of the 7.375% senior unsecured notes, the 12.5% senior unsecured notes 
and tMEDS were higher than their fair values of $273.0 million, $180.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively. TCM 
determined the fair value of the notes using a discounted cash flow valuation model, consisting of inputs such as risk-free 
interest rates and credit spreads.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, the carrying values of the 9.75% senior secured notes were lower than their fair values of
approximately $397.2 million, while the carrying value of the 7.375% senior unsecured notes, the 12.5% senior unsecured notes 
and tMEDS were higher than their fair values of $297.7 million, $194.7 million and $12.7 million, respectively. TCM 
determined the fair value of the notes using a discounted cash flow valuation model, consisting of inputs such as risk-free 
interest rates and credit spreads.
There were no transfers into or out of Level 1, 2 or 3 during the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013. TCM's policy
is to recognize transfers as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances.

On March(cid:160)30, 2011, TCM entered into an equipment financing facility, as amended from time to time (the "Equipment
Facility"), pursuant to which Caterpillar Financial Services Limited ("Caterpillar") agreed to underwrite up to $132.0 million in 
mobile fleet equipment financing for Mount Milligan Mine. Each borrowing under the Equipment Facility represents a capital 
lease and has a term of 48 or 60 months. Interest on the amounts borrowed under the Equipment Facility is payable at either 
floating or fixed rates, at TCM's option. At the end of each 48 or 60 month lease period, TCM has the option to purchase the 
underlying equipment for a nominal sum. The Equipment Facility includes non-financial covenants, and as of December(cid:160)31, 
2014, TCM was in compliance with these covenants. TCM's ability to finance additional equipment under the Equipment 
Facility expired in September 2014 per the terms of the Equipment Facility agreement. On January 15, 2015, TCM entered into 
an amendment with Caterpillar which extends its ability to finance additional equipment under the Equipment Facility through 
December 2015.
During 2013, TCM entered into three leases with Caterpillar with respect to certain equipment pursuant to the Equipment
Facility, of which two are considered sale-leaseback transactions. Interest payments are based on a fixed rate of 5.50%
Also during 2013, TCM entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with Caterpillar with respect to certain Endako Mine
equipment (the "Endako Sale Leaseback"), which is separate from the Equipment Facility. TCM received $5.3 million in cash 
from Caterpillar for the sale of this equipment, which was subsequently leased back, after an upfront down payment of $1.4 
million. Interest payments are based on a fixed rate of 5.85%. The agreement includes certain non-financial covenants, and as 
of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM was in compliance with these covenants.
TCM received $37.8 million in cash from Caterpillar for the sale of equipment, including the Endako Sale Leaseback, 
which was subsequently leased back. These leases resulted in an increase to TCM's capital lease obligation at December 31, 
2013 of $33.2 million after upfront payments of $4.6 million.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, TCM had $66.2 million and $87.0 million, respectively, in outstanding borrowings
under the Equipment Facility. Interest pertaining to the Equipment Facility is allocable to the cost of developing mining 
properties and to constructing new facilities and is capitalized until assets are ready for their intended use. Beginning in 
September 2013, in conjunction with the start-up phase of Mount Milligan Mine, TCM ceased capitalizing the interest and debt 
issuance costs associated with the leases under the Equipment Facility for Mount Milligan Mine as the related assets were 
placed in service.
Interest and debt issuance costs on the equipment financings, as described above, consisted of the following:

2017 Notes Indenture, the trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal of the outstanding 2017 Notes may declare the 
principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the 2017 Notes to be due and payable immediately. Certain 
events of bankruptcy or insolvency are events of default that would result in the 2017 Notes being due and payable immediately 
upon the occurrence of such events of default.

TCM may redeem the 2018 Notes at any time upon the occurrence of specified events relating to Canadian tax law at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the 2018 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the 
date of redemption.
The 2018 Notes Indenture contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the
2018 Notes Indenture, the trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal of the outstanding 2018 Notes may declare the 
principal, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the 2018 Notes to be due and payable immediately. Certain 
events of bankruptcy or insolvency are events of default that would result in the 2018 Notes being due and payable immediately 
upon the occurrence of such events of default. In December 2011, TCM completed an exchange offer of the original 2018 Notes 
for a like principal amount of exchange notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, pursuant to a registration rights 
agreement with the initial purchasers.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, TCM repurchased $14.2 million of its 2018 Notes in a open market transactions. In 
connection with the repurchase of these notes, TCM recorded a debt extinguishment gain of $2.3 million and reduced $0.3 
million of the related unamortized debt issuance costs.
Mobile Mining Equipment Loans
On December(cid:160)8, 2010, TCM executed an equipment financing agreement with Caterpillar in the amount of $12.8 million 
secured by six units of mobile mining equipment purchased by TCM during 2010. This fixed-rate loan bears interest at 3.6%, is 
scheduled to mature no later than December(cid:160)8, 2015 and has an outstanding payable amount of $2.8 million as of December(cid:160)31,

Pursuant to an agreement dated October 2010, as subsequently amended in December 2011, August 2012 and December
2014, with a subsidiary of Royal Gold, Inc. ("Royal Gold") (referred to as the "Gold Stream Arrangement"), TCM agreed to sell 
to Royal Gold 52.25% of the refined gold production from Mount Milligan Mine for a total upfront payment of $781.5 million, 
plus $435 per ounce, or the prevailing market rate if lower than $435 per ounce, when the gold is delivered. The upfront cash 
payments received under the Gold Stream Arrangement, of $111.9 million in 2013, $305.0 million in 2012, $138.1 million in 
2011 and $226.5 million in 2010, were recorded as deferred revenue and classified as a liability on TCM's Consolidated 
Balance Sheets.
The Gold Stream Arrangement restricts TCM's ability to incur debt that is secured by the Mount Milligan Mine assets.
Subject to the exceptions discussed below, TCM cannot incur debt that is secured by the Mount Milligan Mine assets in excess 
of $350.0 million until the earlier of the date upon which 425,000 ounces of refined gold have been sold and delivered to Royal 
Gold or the date upon which the aggregate dollar amount of the difference between the market price for the gold delivered to

10. Gold Stream Arrangement (Continued)
Royal Gold and the price actually paid by Royal Gold exceeds $280.0 million. Per the December 2014 amendment, discussed 
in Note 10 of Item 8, TCM is additionally permitted to pledge the Mount Milligan Mine assets to secure up to $25.0 million of 
hedging obligations incurred in connection with gold and copper production from Mount Milligan Mine, foreign currency 
exchange risk relating to Mount Milligan Mine and one or more corporate credit facilities utilized in connection with Mount 
Milligan Mine. Provided that Mount Milligan Mine meets specified throughput, recovery and delivery conditions, the $25.0 
million could increase to $50.0 million.
TCM must maintain a deposit record during the term of the Gold Stream Arrangement wherein TCM reduces the $781.5
million total amount paid by Royal Gold by the difference between the current market price at the time of sale of refined gold to 
Royal Gold and $435 per ounce, multiplied by the amount of refined gold sold in such sale. If, at the end of the initial 50-year 
term of the agreement, the total deposit amount reflected in the deposit record has not been reduced to nil, TCM must pay to 
Royal Gold the remaining balance reflected in the deposit record. As of December 31, 2014, the remaining deposit per the Gold 
Stream Arrangement totaled $734.4 million. In the event of any default under the Company's agreement with Royal Gold, 
Royal Gold could require TCM to repay the outstanding deposit.
Royal Gold has a security interest in all of the Mount Milligan Mine assets until its total deposit amount has been reduced 
to nil. Royal Gold's security interest is subject to subordination to project or corporate financings by TCM, except that in such 
circumstances, Royal Gold retains a first priority interest in 52.25% of the refined gold from Mount Milligan Mine. After the 
total deposit amount has been reduced to nil, Royal Gold's security will consist solely of its first priority interest in 52.25% of 
the refined gold. The cash payments received under the Gold Stream Arrangement are recorded as deferred revenue and 
classified as a liability on TCM's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
TCM sells copper and gold concentrate from Mount Milligan Mine to MTM Customers, and then purchases gold ounces 
in the market for delivery to Royal Gold, in an amount based on a portion of the gold ounces in the copper and gold concentrate 
sold to MTM Customers as determined in accordance with the terms of the Gold Stream Arrangement. Mount Milligan Mine 
began selling copper and gold concentrate to MTM Customers and delivering gold ounces to Royal Gold in the fourth quarter 
of 2013, at which time TCM began to recognize an amount of the deferred revenue as gold ounces are delivered to Royal Gold, 
as explained further below. In connection with TCM's first 12 shipments of copper and gold concentrate (which concluded in 
the fourth quarter of 2014) from Mount Milligan Mine to MTM Customers, TCM was required to deliver gold ounces to Royal 
Gold based on a percentage of gold ounces in each provisional sale of gold to MTM Customers within two days of receiving a 
provisional payment for the sale of the copper and gold concentrate, with subsequent delivery of the remaining gold ounces 
upon final settlement. Hereinafter, all deliveries of gold to Royal Gold will be based solely on the final settlement of provisional 
sales of concentrate to MTM Customers and payable at the time of final settlement. The gold ounces delivered to Royal Gold 
under the Gold Stream Arrangement are based on the contained gold ounces in the provisional payments and final settlements 
multiplied by a 97% payable factor.
Revenues from the Gold Stream Arrangement are recognized upon the provisional sale of the copper and gold concentrate
delivered to MTM Customers based on the amount of the provisional gold ounces in such sale, with adjustments made for the 
$435 per ounce price, the per ounce price for the deferred revenue that was received upfront pursuant to the terms of the Gold 
Stream Arrangement and certain adjustments.
The components of revenue under the Gold Stream Arrangement are as follows:
•
•
•
recognition of an amount of deferred revenue based on the amount of gold ounces delivered to Royal Gold in the 
applicable period compared to total expected gold deliveries over the life of the mine; 
recognition of receipts of $435 per ounce, or the prevailing market rate if lower than $435 per ounce, when the gold 
ounces are delivered; 
recognition of any unrealized losses resulting from the difference between the $435 per ounce plus the deferred 
revenue per ounce price and the prevailing spot price at the end of any period, net of purchase costs for the gold 
ounces delivered to Royal Gold; and
gains or losses related to TCM's commodity gold contracts used to hedge TCM’s Gold Stream Risk, as defined above.
• 
The following table presents the revenue under the Gold Stream Arrangement for the years ended December 31, 2014  and 
2013, respectively in the form of (i) cash receipts based on gold sales during the applicable period, and (ii) deferred revenue for 
gold ounces delivered and deferred revenue to be recognized upon final settlement during the applicable period:

and 2013, respectively. Revenue ultimately to be recognized upon delivery of gold is $12.0 million and $0.7 million for the 
years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
11. Tangible Equity Units ("tMEDS")
On May(cid:160)11, 2012, TCM completed a public offering of 8,800,000 tMEDS with a stated value of $25.00. Each tMEDS 
unit consisted of a prepaid common stock purchase contract and a senior amortizing note due May(cid:160)15, 2015. Each prepaid 
common stock purchase contract will automatically settle on May(cid:160)15, 2015, unless settled earlier as described below. At any 
time prior to the third business day immediately preceding May 15, 2015, the holder may settle the purchase contract early. 
Each contract settled prior to November 10, 2012 was settled for 4.3562 shares of common stock, which is 95% of the 
minimum settlement rate. Each contract settled on or after November 11, 2012 but prior to the third business day preceding 
May 15, 2015 will be settled for 4.5855 shares of common stock, subject in either case to certain adjustments.
On May 21, 2014, TCM commenced an offer ("Exchange Offer") to exchange any and all of the 8,340,000 then
outstanding units of tMEDS for a number of shares of TCM’s common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer, as 
amended, each holder of tMEDS could tender all or a portion of such holder's tMEDS in exchange for (i) 5.3879 shares of 
common stock plus (ii) a number of shares of common stock equal to $1.25 divided by $2.73, which is the five day arithmetic 
daily volume-weighted average price of the TCM common stock over the trading period beginning on June 16, 2014 and 
ending on June 20, 2014. The Exchange Offer expired on June 24, 2014, and 7,206,862 units, or 86.4%, of the tMEDS were 
tendered for exchange, and accepted by TCM. In exchange for the tendered tMEDS, TCM issued 42,129,829 shares of its 
common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2013, holders settled 460,000 purchase contracts for which TCM issued 
2,109,330 shares of common stock.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, 1,133,138 tMEDS remained outstanding. Such tMEDS will continue to be held pursuant to 
their original terms and conditions, including mandatory conversion on May 15, 2015, as described above. Additionally, on 
July 8, 2014, TCM filed an application to notify the SEC of its delisting of any and all units of tMEDS which remained 
outstanding following settlement of the Exchange Offer, and the delisting became effective 10 days after such filing. TCM does 
not intend to re-list its tMEDS on another securities exchange.
Although each outstanding unit of tMEDS was treated as one unit for purposes of the Exchange Offer, the accounting
treatment considers each component of each unit of tMEDS, a prepaid common stock purchase contract and a senior amortizing 
note, separately. In June 2014, in connection with shares of common stock issued in exchange for the prepaid common stock 
purchase contract components of the tendered tMEDS, TCM recorded a $145.5 million increase to common stock and a $145.5 
million decrease to additional paid-in capital equal to the value of the shares issued in exchange for the prepaid common stock 
purchase contract components of the tendered tMEDS, net of a $0.2 million decrease to additional paid-in capital for issuance 
costs incurred by TCM.
In connection with the settlement of $10.9 million of the senior amortizing notes component of the tendered tMEDS,
TCM issued $9.3 million in TCM common stock and made a principal payment of $1.2 million to the senior amortizing note 
holders. Additionally, TCM recorded $0.5 million in debt extinguishment losses due to the difference between consideration 
offered for extinguished debt net of $0.5 million of fees and expenses incurred by TCM in connection with the Exchange Offer, 
and the write off of $0.3 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.
The senior amortizing note component of the tMEDs that remained outstanding as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 was $1.2 
million, which is included in the current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The unamortized

11. Tangible Equity Units ("tMEDS") (Continued)
deferred financing costs related to the remaining tMEDS were nil and $0.6 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. For the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, TCM paid $1.3 million and $3.1 million; capitalized $0.1 
million and $2.7 million, respectively; and expensed $1.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of the interest and debt 
issuance costs associated with the tMEDS.
For purposes of the fair market value disclosed in Note 7, the carrying value of the tMEDS as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 was
higher than the fair value of approximately $0.4 million. TCM determined the fair value of the debt component of tMEDS 
using a discounted cash flow model by obtaining yields for comparably-rated issuers trading in the market, considering the 
market yield of existing TCM debt and the credit rating of TCM.
12. Asset Retirement Obligations
Asset retirement obligations arise from the acquisition, development, construction and normal operation of mining
property, plant, equipment and development due to government controls and regulations that protect the environment on the 
closure and reclamation of mining properties. The exact nature of environmental issues and costs, if any, which TCM may 
encounter in the future are subject to change, primarily because of the changing character of environmental requirements that 
may be enacted by governmental agencies.
The following table details items affecting asset retirement obligations for future mine closure and reclamation costs in 
connection with TCM's Mount Milligan Mine, TC Mine, Endako Mine (reflecting 75% ownership) and its now-terminated 
interest in the Davidson property:

(1) At December 31, 2014 the downward revision to the asset retirement obligation at TC Mine resulted in a $6.2 million 
decrease to depreciation, depletion and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive 
Income (Loss).
TCM is required by US federal and state laws and Canadian provincial laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to 
allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if TCM is unable to do so. These laws are complex 
and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The laws govern the determination of the scope, cost of the closure, reclamation 
obligation and the amount and forms of financial assurance. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, TCM has provided the 
appropriate regulatory authorities in the US and Canada with $78.6 million and $81.8 million, respectively, in non-cash 
reclamation financial assurance for mine closure obligations which are secured by $10.3 million and $7.4 million in cash 
deposits as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
In connection with the development of Mount Milligan Mine, the Province of British Columbia has required us to provide
a reclamation deposit in the amount of $25.9 million and $28.2 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 
estimated future reclamation costs for Mount Milligan Mine have been discounted using rates from 11.0% to 13.9%. As of

12. Asset Retirement Obligations (Continued)
December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM anticipates that these costs will be incurred beginning in the year 2037. The total inflated and 
undiscounted estimated reclamation costs for Mount Milligan Mine were $43.1 million and $45.6 million as of December(cid:160)31, 
2014 and 2013, respectively.
The current reclamation bonding for TC Mine is $42.4 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014. TCM has provided surety bonds 
to satisfy these obligations. The estimated future reclamation costs for TC Mine have been discounted using rates from 6.7% to 
12.0%. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM anticipates that these costs will be incurred from 2031 to 2045. The total inflated and 
undiscounted estimated reclamation costs for TC Mine were $44.6 million and $43.7 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 
2013, respectively.
For Endako Mine, the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources has required TCM to
provide a reclamation deposit in the amount of $13.2 million and $14.4 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, 
respectively. TCM's proportionate share is $9.9 million and $10.8 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
TCM's share of total inflated and undiscounted estimated reclamation costs for Endako Mine were $35.6 million and $32.7 
million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM estimates its proportionate share of 
these costs will be incurred from 2015 to 2031. The estimated future reclamation costs for Endako Mine have been discounted 
using rates from 2.94% to 13.86%.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM's reclamation deposits related to Mount Milligan Mine and Endako Mine were in the
form of letters of credit secured by a guarantee and cash collateral. Under the arrangements, the ACE Group, a surety company, 
provided a guarantee to Export Development Canada ("EDC"), who provided a guarantee to Royal Bank of Canada ("RBC"), 
who issued letters of credit to the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines. In exchange for the surety company's 
guarantee, TCM has provided $7.1 million of cash collateral and will pay total annual fees of approximately 1.7% of the total 
reclamation bond guarantee to the surety company, EDC and RBC. On December 18, 2014 TCM received a refund of the entire 
$7.1 million of the cash collateral previously provided to the surety company.
TCM's Berg property was acquired in the 2010 acquisition of Terrane. The Province of British Columbia has required
TCM to provide a reclamation deposit in the amount of $0.1 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 for the Berg property.
In October 2013, TCM relinquished the option to develop the Davidson exploration property located in British Columbia,
Canada that TCM had held since 2005. TCM believes that all reclamation obligations have been met that arose during TCM's 
option period, and TCM has asked the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines to release the reclamation bond of $0.3 
million. The funds and TCM's obligation were not released as of December(cid:160)31, 2014; however, discussions are on-going with 
the Ministry.
13. Employee Benefits
Retention and Severance
In 2012, TCM terminated a retention and severance arrangement under which certain of its employees were
participants.(cid:160)The retention and severance arrangement was put into place in 2004.(cid:160)Under the terms of the severance portion of 
the arrangement, the participants accrued severance benefits based on years of service that were to be paid upon termination of 
the employees by TCM without cause and under certain other circumstances.(cid:160)In connection with termination of the plan that 
occurred on September 30, 2012, TCM agreed to pay the participants severance amounts that had accrued to such individuals as 
of September(cid:160)30, 2012 on the earlier of October(cid:160)15, 2013 or the applicable participant's separation of service with the Company. 
On June 30, 2012, the retention portion of the arrangement was terminated, and TCM agreed to make additional payments to 
the participants of 100% of current eligible retention amounts on June 30, 2013 for the period of July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 
and 100% of current eligible retention amounts on June 30, 2014 for the period of July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014. During 2014 
and 2013, TCM paid $2.9 million and $13.5 million, respectively in severance and retention payments and had severance and 
retention liability amounts of nil and $1.0 million, as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, respectively related to this program. No 
further severance or retention payments were made under the arrangement after June 30, 2014.
In 2012, TCM entered into retention arrangements with certain eligible employees of TC Mine in anticipation of the
deferral of Phase 8 stripping activities and the placement of TC Mine on care and maintenance when the mining and processing 
of Phase 7 ore was completed, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. Pursuant to these arrangements, eligible employees

would be paid a certain amount if they stayed at TC Mine until the completion of Phase 7, with such payment to be made within 
60 days of the end of Phase 7, as determined by the Company. TCM's liability at December(cid:160)31, 2014 with respect to such 
severance arrangements amounted to $0.2 million and TCM paid $3.6 million in such bonus payments during 2014.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, TCM's total liability amounted to $1.5 million and $5.4 million, respectively, related 
to retention and severance arrangements. For the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, TCM recognized an expense 
of $7.2 million, $6.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for retention and severance arrangements.
Defined Contribution Pension Plans
TCM, through its subsidiaries, maintains defined contribution pension plans available to certain employees. TCM's 
Thompson Creek Metals Company Thrift Plan (the "Plan") is a defined contribution pension plan and covers all eligible 
employees employed in the US. The Plan is subject to the provisions of the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974, as amended, and Section(cid:160)401(k) of the US Internal Revenue Code. The assets of the Plan are held and the related 
investment transactions are executed by the Plan's trustee. Administrative fees, including accounting and attorney fees, are paid 
by TCM on behalf of the Plan. TCM contributed approximately $1.7 million, $1.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, to the 
Plan for the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. TCM may make additional contributions to the Plan at its sole 
discretion; however, TCM has no further obligation relating to benefits under this Plan.
TCM has formed the Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. Registered Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all
Canadian employees. The assets of the Pension Plan are held and the related investment transactions are executed by the 
Pension Plan's trustee. Administrative fees, including any accounting and legal fees, are paid by TCM on behalf of the Pension 
Plan. All participating locations of the Pension Plan contributed C$2.7 million, C$2.4 million and C$1.7 million to the Pension 
Plan for the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. TCM has recorded its proportionate 75.0% share 
related to Endako Mine contributions. TCM has no further obligation relating to pension benefits under this Pension Plan.
Postretirement Benefits
Under the union agreement at the Langeloth Facility, TCM is required to provide postretirement medical benefits for
certain retired former employees and their dependents by making the monthly medical insurance premium payments on their 
behalf. Substantially all of TCM's current unionized employees may become eligible for this benefit if certain age and service 
requirements are met at the time of retirement, as specified in the union agreement. The benefit ceases when the eligible retired 
employee reaches 65 years of age. TCM does not have any obligation related to eligible retired unionized employees beyond 
the monthly medical insurance premiums. TCM follows current accounting guidance related to postretirement benefits for this 
plan. Prior service costs, actuarial gains and losses and transition obligations are amortized over the average life expectancy of 
the plan's participants.
The following table sets forth the actuarial present value of postretirement medical benefit obligations and amounts
recognized in TCM's consolidated financial statements:

13. Employee Benefits (Continued)
The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 included a measurement date of
December(cid:160)31, 2014 and a discount rate of 3.8%. The yield curve matching TCM's benefit obligation was derived using a cash 
flow analysis under the Citigroup pension liability index. The Citigroup pension discount curve shows the relationship between 
interest rates and the duration for hypothetical zero coupon investments. This yield curve was used in determining the discount 
rate for TCM's postretirement benefit obligation.
The components of net periodic benefit costs for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014 included $0.3 million of service cost
and $0.1 million of interest cost for a total net periodic benefit cost of $0.4 million.
The health care cost trend assumed that average cost of coverage was 7.0% for 2014, reduced by 0.25% annually through
2020 and from there being reduced by 0.5% to an ultimate trend of 4.5% in 2023 and beyond. The assumed health care cost 
trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement medical benefits. The effect of a one percent 
change in the health care cost trend rate used to calculate periodic postretirement medical costs and the related benefit 
obligation would be insignificant to this benefit obligation.
The expected postretirement medical benefits provided below were based on actuarial assumptions.

The ESPP, which was initially approved by TCM's shareholders in May 2010, provides an opportunity for TCM's
employees to purchase its common shares at 85% of the closing price at the beginning of the offering period or at the end of the 
offering period, whichever is lower. The ESPP was suspended effective July 1, 2013 pending approval of an amended plan by 
TCM's shareholders. Effective May 13, 2014, TCM's shareholders approved the Amended and Restated Thompson Creek 
Metals Company Inc. 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended and restated, the "ESPP"), which (i) makes an 
additional 2,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock available for issuance; (ii) changes the frequency of offering 
periods to four consecutive three-month offering periods per year; (iii) allows the Compensation Committee to establish sub-
plans or special rules designed to achieve desired tax or other objectives for employees outside of the U.S.; (iv) allows the 
Compensation Committee to exclude from any sub-plan the limit on an employee's right to accrue common stock pursuant to 
the ESPP at a rate that exceeds $25,000 in market value of common stock per calendar year; (v) allows the Compensation 
Committee to change the frequency and/or duration of offering periods with respect to future offerings; (vi) caps the number of 
shares that any employee may purchase in any offering period and in any calendar year at 5,000 and 20,000 shares, 
respectively; (vii) allows for participation in the ESPP by any employee employed as of an enrollment date; and (viii) permits 
participants in the ESPP to change their contribution rates during offering periods, subject to limitations imposed by the 
Compensation Committee.
As of December 31, 2014 there are 2,054,117 shares authorized for purchase by TCM's employees under the ESPP.
Compensation expense is measured based on the fair value using a Black-Scholes model of the employees' option to purchase 
shares of common stock at the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized over the future periods in which the related 
employee service is rendered. TCM estimated a fair value of employee options to purchase shares under the ESPP of $0.75 for 
the first two three-month offering periods of 2014. TCM recorded $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million of expense related 
to the ESPP plan for the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 
TCM issued 160,952 shares of common stock under the ESPP. No tax benefit is realized for ESPPs unless there is a 
disqualifying disposition.

14. Shareholders' Equity
The authorized share capital of TCM is comprised of an unlimited number of common shares and an unlimited number of 
preferred shares, issuable in series with terms determinable upon issuance. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM has not issued any 
preferred shares.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, TCM issued 42,129,828 and 2,109,330 shares of common stock, respectively in
settlement of certain prepaid common stock purchase contracts for a total of 44,239,158 common shares. These prepaid 
common stock purchase contracts were issued as part of the 2012 issuance of 8.8 million units of tMEDS, which were recorded 
as a $177.7 million increase to additional paid-in-capital, net of issuance costs. No purchase contracts were settled and no 
shares of common stock were issued related to the tMEDS during 2012. The remaining unsettled units will automatically settle 
on May 15, 2015 and delivery of outstanding shares of common stock will be required based on the applicable market value. 
See Note 11 for further discussion.
15. Stock-Based Compensation
On May 13, 2014, TCM's shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 
"LTIP"). The LTIP allows TCM to grant stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, RSUs, PSUs or shares 
granted as bonus compensation. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, the number of common shares authorized for awards under the LTIP 
plan is 11.0 million. Effective November 21, 2013, Mr. Perron, TCM's Chief Executive Officer, was granted a one-time 
inducement award comprised of stock options to purchase 400,000 shares of TCM's common stock and 300,000 RSUs, each 
vesting in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The stock options will be 
exercisable for five years from the date of grant. These grants were made as an employment inducement award outside of the 
LTIP.(cid:160)
TCM does not realize a tax benefit for stock-based awards granted to Canadian employees under the current Canadian tax
law. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM has granted stock options, PSUs and RSUs, as discussed below.
Stock Options
The expiration date and vesting provisions of stock options granted are established at the time an award is made. Stock
options vest over 3 years and are exercisable over a period of time not to exceed 10 years from the grant date but generally 
expire 5 years from the grant date. When an option is exercised, TCM issues the requisite shares from authorized but unissued 
common stock. The exercise price of options granted prior to March 1, 2011 is equal to the greater of: (i)(cid:160)the volume weighted-
average trading price of the underlying shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange over the five consecutive trading days 
immediately before the grant date and (ii)(cid:160)if the award date occurs in a trading black-out period, the weighted-average trading 
price over the five consecutive trading days immediately after the black-out period has been lifted. The exercise price of options 
granted after March 1, 2011 is equal to the volume weighted-average trading price of the underlying shares over the five 
consecutive trading days immediately before the grant date.

For the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, TCM recorded compensation expense related to stock options of
$0.4 million, $0.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, approximately 0.7 million outstanding 
options had not vested and were not exercisable. The total unrecognized compensation cost related to these options was $0.6 
million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2(cid:160)years.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, approximately 0.6 million options had vested and were exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic
value of these exercisable awards was nil as of December(cid:160)31, 2014.
The weighted-average fair value of stock options on the date of grant, and the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the 
stock options using a Black-Scholes option valuation model were as follows:

Performance Share Units
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM had issued a total of 3,305,345 PSUs under the LTIP, which have been granted to eligible 
employees. The vesting of the PSUs granted prior to January 1, 2012 is contingent upon employee service and the performance 
of TCM's share price relative to the established award price. At each anniversary date during the vesting period, if the per share 
closing price of TCM's common stock on such date is at or higher than the award price, then the awards will vest one-third on 
each anniversary date, and the requisite shares will be issued from authorized but unissued common stock. If the closing price is 
less than the award price, and therefore, the market condition is not achieved, then those PSUs do not vest and are carried 
forward to the following anniversary date. Any PSUs not vested at the end of the three-year vesting period will expire.
The vesting of the PSUs granted subsequent to January 1, 2012 and prior to January 1, 2014 is contingent upon two 
performance metrics: 1) TCM's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the Russell 2000 Index during the three-year 
performance period and 2) the proven and probable mine reserves replaced by TCM during the three-year performance period 
as measured by the replacement reserves percentage determined by the plan administrator. The PSUs cliff vest three years from 
the date of issuance upon achievement of the above metrics. Any PSUs not vested at such time will expire.
The vesting of the PSUs granted subsequent to January 1, 2014 is contingent upon two performance metrics: 1) TCM's 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the S&P TSX Global Base Metals Index during the three-year performance period 
and 2) cash flow from operations, defined as TCM's aggregate "cash generated by (used in) operating activities" less aggregate 
"capital expenditures" as reported for the calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016 in the Statements of Cash Flows in the 
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The PSUs cliff vest approximately three years from the date of issuance, or on the 
date in the first quarter of 2017 that the plan administrator determines and certifies the achievement of the above metrics. Any 
PSUs not vested at such time will expire.
All PSUs granted are accounted for at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model on the date of grant.
The Monte Carlo model is based on random projections of stock price paths. Expected volatility is calculated using a weighted 
average of historical daily volatilities and implied volatility and represents the extent to which TCM's stock price performance 
is expected to fluctuate during each of the three calendar-year periods of the award's anticipated term.
For the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, TCM recorded compensation expense related to the PSUs of
$2.7 million, $2.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively. At December(cid:160)31, 2014, unrecognized compensation expense related to 
PSUs totaled $4.2 million that will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of 2.2(cid:160)years.

As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM had issued 3,021,973 RSUs under the LTIP and under the employment inducement
award, which have been granted to certain eligible employees and directors.
TCM accounts for RSUs at fair value, which is based on the market value of TCM's common shares on the day of grant
and recognized over the vesting period of 3 years. Upon vesting, TCM will issue the requisite shares from authorized but 
unissued common stock. TCM recorded $2.4 million, $2.5 million and $2.4 million of compensation expense related to its 
RSUs for the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. At December(cid:160)31, 2014, unrecognized compensation 
expense related to restricted stock units totaled $2.8 million that will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-
average period of 1.9 years.

TCM is from time to time involved in or subject to legal proceedings related to its business. While it is not feasible to
predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, it is the opinion of management that the resolution of such proceedings 
is not expected to have a material adverse effect on TCM's consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows.
Concentrate Sales Agreements
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM is party to three multi-year concentrate sales agreements for the sale of concentrate
produced at Mount Milligan Mine. Pursuant to these agreements, TCM has agreed to sell an aggregate of the copper and gold 
concentrate produced at Mount Milligan Mine of approximately 120,000 tonnes in 2015 and 120,000 tonnes in 2016. During 
February 2015, TCM entered into a fourth multi-year concentrate sales agreement, pursuant to which TCM agreed to sell to the 
counterparty approximately 20,000 tonnes of concentrate in each of calendar years 2015 and 2016 and 40,000 tonnes of 
concentrate in 2017 and 2018. Pricing under these concentrate sales agreements will be determined by reference to specified 
published reference prices during the applicable quotation periods. Payment for the concentrate will be based on the price for 
the agreed copper and gold content of the parcels delivered, less smelting and refining charges and certain other deductions, if 
applicable. The copper smelting and refining charges will be negotiated in good faith and agreed by the parties for each contract 
year based on terms generally acknowledged as industry benchmark terms. The gold refining charges are as specified in the 
agreements. Remaining(cid:160)concentrate produced at Mount Milligan Mine will be sold under short-term contracts or on a spot 
basis.
Molybdenum Purchases
In the normal course of operations, TCM enters into agreements for the purchase of molybdenum. As of December(cid:160)31,
2014, TCM had commitments to purchase approximately 14.8 million pounds of molybdenum as unroasted molybdenum 
concentrate from 2015 to 2017 primarily priced at the time of purchase at a set discount to the market price for roasted 
molybdenum concentrate.
Molybdenum Sales
In the normal course of operations, TCM enters into certain molybdenum sales contracts pursuant to which it sells future
production at fixed prices. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM had commitments to sell approximately 600 thousand pounds of 
molybdenum oxide in 2015 at an average price of $12.05 per pound.
Capital Purchase Commitments
As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM had open capital purchase commitments of $0.5 million related to the Mount Milligan
Mine.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for
financial reporting and tax purposes. The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of 
December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:

In connection with the preparation of TCM’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014,
TCM determined a change in the presentation of certain deferred income tax liabilities was necessary to conform to the 
guidance outlined in ASC 740. This guidance states that for balance sheet presentation, net deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities, current and long term, should be reported as a single amount for each tax-paying component of TCM and within a 
particular tax jurisdiction. In the prior year, TCM netted assets and liabilities across multiple jurisdictions. The revised change 
in presentation to appropriately net these balances for 2013 is detailed below and relates primarily to the construction of Mount 
Milligan Mine. Due to balances in the current year, the prior period balances were reclassified on the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet for comparability.

At December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM had $232.1 million in loss and $101.8 million in credit carry-forwards available for tax
purposes. The loss and credit carry-forwards per the income tax returns filed, due to uncertain tax benefits, are larger than the 
carry-forward benefits for which a deferred tax asset is recognized for financial statement purposes. While an insignificant 
portion of TCM's losses expire beyond 2015, substantially all of the carry-forwards expire beyond 2025.
A valuation allowance is recorded on some of the benefits associated with tax losses, credits and unrealized foreign 
exchange losses. Some of TCM's capital expenditures, primarily at Endako Mine and TC Mine, have a recorded valuation 
allowance as it is not more likely than not that the benefit related to the specific deferred tax assets will be realized based on the 
available sources of taxable income.
TCM intends to indefinitely reinvest earnings from certain foreign operations. Accordingly, US and non-US income and
withholding taxes for which deferred taxes might otherwise be required have not been provided on a cumulative amount of 
temporary differences (including, for this purpose, any difference between the tax basis in the stock of a consolidated subsidiary 
and the amount of the subsidiary's net equity determined for financial reporting purposes) related to investments in foreign 
subsidiaries of approximately $1,233.5 million and $1,232.4 million as of December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 
additional US and non-US income and withholding tax that would arise on reversal of the temporary differences could be 
offset, in part, by tax credits. Because the determination of the amount of available tax credits and the limitations imposed on 
the annual utilization of such credits are subject to a highly complex series of calculations and expense allocations, it is 
impractical to estimate the amount of net income and withholding tax that might be payable if a reversal of temporary 
differences occurred.
Income Tax Uncertainties
A summary of the activities associated with TCM's uncertainty in income taxes reserve for unrecognized tax benefits
were as follows:
Balance as of January 1, 2014
  Additions for tax positions of prior years
  Reductions for tax positions of prior years:
   Settlements
   Lapse of statute of limitations

Included in the balanced of unrecognized tax benefits at December(cid:160)31, 2014 are potential benefits of $2.0 million that, if
recognized, would affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations.
TCM recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in operating expenses. During the years ended
December(cid:160)31, 2014 and 2013, TCM did not recognize any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, approximately 1.3 million stock options were excluded from the computation of
diluted weighted-average shares as the exercise prices exceeded the price of the common stock. For the year ended 
December(cid:160)31, 2014, 1.9 million PSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares because the 
underlying market and performance metrics had not been met. For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 1.5 million RSUs were 
excluded from the computation of diluted weighted-average shares as the effect would have been anti-dilutive under the 
treasury stock method. For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, the assumed issuance of 26.3 million shares upon the conversion 
of the stock purchase contract component of the remaining outstanding tMEDS units was considered in the calculation of 
diluted weighted-average shares; however due to the net loss position of TCM for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, such 
assumed issuance has not been reflected above as the effect would be anti-dilutive.

TCM's total revenues for these respective years.
For the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, TCM recorded management fee income of $0.4 million, $0.3
million and $0.3 million, and selling and marketing costs of $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, from 
Sojitz.

22. Concentration of Credit Risk
TCM is exposed to counterparty risk from its cash and cash equivalent balances and its reclamation deposits held by
financial institutions and governmental entities. TCM monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial 
institutions and companies in which it invests its cash, cash equivalents and that hold its reclamation deposits. Counterparties to 
cash balances and its reclamation deposits, other than balances maintained in various bank operating accounts, are US and 
Canadian institutions and the US and Canadian governments.
TCM manages its credit risk from its accounts receivable through its collection activities. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, TCM 
had five customers who owed TCM more than $3.0 million and accounted for approximately 52.6% of total accounts and other 
receivables outstanding. Another five customers had balances greater than $1.0 million but less than $3.0 million that accounted 
for approximately 20.1%  of total accounts and other receivables. As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, all of these customers were 
compliant with credit terms and scheduled payment dates.
TCM's maximum counterparty and credit risk exposure is the carrying value of its cash and cash equivalents and accounts 
receivable. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and fixed-rate debt, excluding the 
2017 Notes, 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes and tMEDS, as discussed in Note(cid:160)7, approximate fair value as of December(cid:160)31, 2014.
23. Segment Information
TCM has three reportable segments, based on products and geography: Copper-Gold, US Operations Molybdenum and 
Canadian Operations Molybdenum. The Copper-Gold segment includes all expenditures, including all mining, milling, mine 
site administration, transportation, shipping, concentrate selling and refining costs, and sale of concentrate from Mount Milligan 
Mine. The US Operations Molybdenum segment includes all mining, milling, mine site administration, transportation, roasting 
(at the Langeloth Facility) and sale of molybdenum products from TC Mine, as well as all roasting and sales of third-party 
purchased material from the Langeloth Facility. The Canadian Operations Molybdenum segment includes all mining, milling, 
mine site administration, transportation, roasting (at the Langeloth Facility) and sale of molybdenum products from the 75% 
owned Endako Mine. The Inter-segment represents the elimination of management fee income, revenue and cost of sales of 
product transported from the Canadian Operations to the US Operations for processing.
TCM's chief operating decision makers (President and CEO) evaluates segment performance based on segment revenue
less costs and expenses. TCM attributes other income and expenses to the reporting segments if the income or expense is 
directly related to segment operations, as described above. TCM does not allocate corporate expenditures such as general and

administrative, exploration and interest income and expense items to its reporting segments, unless such expenditures are 
directly related to segment operations. Gains and losses on foreign exchange are calculated on transactions denominated in a 
different currency than the segment's functional currency; the Copper-Gold segment's unrealized foreign exchange balance is 
primarily comprised of its intercompany notes.

TCM has not presented separate combined financial statements of subsidiary guarantors that guarantee the 2017 Notes,
2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, because (1)(cid:160)each of the subsidiary guarantors is wholly owned by TCM; (2)(cid:160)the guarantees are full 
and unconditional; (3)(cid:160)the guarantees are joint and several and (4)(cid:160)TCM has no independent assets and operations, and all 
subsidiaries of TCM other than the subsidiary guarantors are immaterial.
Pursuant to the indentures governing the 2017 Notes, 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, a guarantor may be released from its
guarantee obligations only under certain customary circumstances specified in the indentures, namely upon (1)(cid:160)the sale or other 
disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation or consolidation) of such guarantor, (2)(cid:160)the designation of such 
guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the indentures, (3)(cid:160)upon a legal defeasance or covenant 
defeasance or (4)(cid:160)upon the full satisfaction of TCM's obligations under the respective indenture.
26. Subsequent Events
During February 2015, TCM entered into a fourth multi-year concentrate sales agreement, pursuant to which TCM 
agreed to sell to the counterparty approximately 20,000 tonnes of concentrate in each of calendar years 2015 and 2016 and

Table of Contents
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
TCM's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports 
that are filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized 
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such 
information is accumulated and communicated to TCM's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from management, have evaluated the effectiveness of disclosure controls and 
procedures as of December 31, 2014. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer 
have concluded that TCM's disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December 31, 2014.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The management of TCM is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting.  TCM’s internal control over financial reporting is a system designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US GAAP.  
TCM’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets; (ii) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with US GAAP, and that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 
and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention and timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, 
or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
Management assessed the effectiveness of TCM’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 based
on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-
Integrated Framework (1992) (“Framework”).  Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 
2014, TCM’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting, other than the remediation of the material
weakness described below that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over 
financial reporting.
Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness
As previously disclosed in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, management had concluded there was a 
material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting related to financial information sourced from its Mount Milligan 
site.
Remediation actions previously disclosed within “Item 4. Controls and Procedures” section of the Form(cid:160)10-Q during the 
first three quarters of 2014, were fully implemented and executed through year end.  As of December(cid:160)31, 2014, the Company 
has completed the documentation and testing of the design and effectiveness of the corrective actions taken; and therefore, 
management concluded that, as of December 31, 2014 the material weakness related to its Mount Milligan Mine site was 
remediated.
TCM's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG(cid:160)LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of
TCM's internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.
In connection with the preparation of this annual report on Form 10-K, management, under the supervision and with the 
participation of the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in, Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992), established by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company plans to adopt the updated 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) and effective as of December 15, 2014 during its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting 
for the year ending December 31, 2015.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Thompson Creek Metals Company(cid:160)Inc.:
131
We have audited Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based 
on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining 
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial 
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility 
is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control 
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control 
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 
consolidated balance sheets of Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and 
the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each 
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, and our report dated February 19, 2015 expressed an unqualified 
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

subsequently reborrowed, and that the terms of the Senior Debt Obligations and any Senior Debt Agreement or any 
provision thereof may be waived, modified, extended, amended, restated or supplemented from time to time, and that 
the aggregate amount of the Senior Debt Obligations may be increased, replaced or refinanced, in each event, without 
notice to or consent by the Purchaser and without affecting the provisions hereof.  The Senior Debt Representative on 
behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties acknowledges that the amount of any Royal Gold Obligations

anything to the contrary in any other Royal Gold Document, be deemed to also hold and have held such lien for the 
benefit of the Senior Debt Representative as security for the Senior Debt Obligations (subject to the Lien Priority and 
other terms hereof) and shall promptly notify the Senior Debt Representative in writing of the existence of such Lien.

(nonetheless and in breach hereof) acquire or hold any Lien on any assets of any Note Party securing any Senior Debt

acknowledge and agree that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of Senior Debt Obligation 
claims and Royal Gold Obligation claims against the Vendor (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate 
value of the Senior Debt Priority Collateral or Royal Gold Priority Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring 
all claims held by the other Secured Parties), the Senior Debt Secured Parties or the Purchaser, respectively, shall be 
entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other 
claims, all amounts owing in respect of Post-Petition Interest that are available from each pool of Priority Collateral 
for each of the Senior Debt Secured Parties and the Purchaser, respectively, before any distribution is made in respect 
of the claims held by the other Secured Parties, with the other Secured Parties hereby acknowledging and agreeing to
turn over to the respective other Secured Parties amounts otherwise received or receivable by them to the extent 
necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the aggregate 
recoveries). The Purchaser further agrees that it will not support or vote in favor of any plan or similar arrangement

proposal, compromise or similar arrangement pursuant to or relating to any Insolvency Proceeding (a “Plan”) (a) pays 
off, in immediately available funds, all Senior Debt Obligations or (b) is accepted by the Senior Debt Creditors voting 
thereon or (c) is supported by the Senior Debt Representative for the Senior Debt Creditors and the Senior Debt 
Representative for the Senior Debt Creditors so advises the Purchaser in writing (a “Senior Supported Plan”).  In the 
event that the Plan is supported by the Senior Debt Representative and the Senior Debt Representative has so advised 
the Purchaser in writing, the Purchaser shall vote in favor of such Senior Supported Plan so long as (i) in the event a 
Royal Gold Trigger Event has not occurred, the Plan provides that the rights of the Purchaser and the obligations of 
the  Vendor  under  the  Royal  Gold  Purchase Agreement  and  the  Royal  Gold  Security  Documents  (whether  such 
obligations are to be performed by the Vendor or a designee or other successor of the Vendor reasonably acceptable 
to Purchaser) are preserved in all material respects or (ii) in the event a Royal Gold Trigger Event has occurred, the 
Plan provides for the Purchaser receiving (A) all Royal Gold Priority Collateral (which, for greater certainty, the 
Purchaser has not already received) calculated and determined as at the date the Plan becomes effective in accordance 
with its terms or the equivalent value thereof in cash, and (B) without duplication, cash equal to the value of the Royal 
Gold Liens on all Collateral on the date set in the Insolvency Proceedings as the date for proving and valuing claims 
generally.
2.6
Agreements  Regarding Actions  to  Perfect  Liens.    (a)   The  Purchaser    agrees  that  all  mortgages, 
debentures, deeds of trust, deeds and similar instruments (collectively, “mortgages”) now or hereafter filed against 
Real Property in favor of or for the benefit of the Purchaser shall contain the following notation:  “The lien created by 
this mortgage on the property described herein is junior and subordinate to the lien on such property created by any 
mortgage, deed of trust or similar instrument now or hereafter granted to Valiant Trust Company, as Senior Debt 
Representative, in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement dated as of November 27, 2012, as 
amended from time to time.”
(b)  Each of the Senior Debt Representative and the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that, to the extent that it 
holds, or a third party holds on its behalf, physical possession of or “control” (as defined in the UCC and the PPSA) 
over Collateral pursuant to the Senior Debt Security Documents or the Royal Gold Security Documents, as applicable, 
such possession or control is also for the benefit of the Purchaser or the Senior Debt Representative and the other 
Senior Debt Secured Parties, as applicable, solely to the extent required to perfect their security interest in such 
Collateral.  Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to impose any duty on the Senior Debt Representative 
or the Purchaser (or any third party acting on either such Person's behalf) with respect to such Collateral or provide 
the Purchaser, the Senior Debt Representative or any other Senior Debt Secured Party, as applicable, with any rights 
with respect to such Collateral beyond those specified in this Agreement, the Senior Debt Security Documents and the 
Royal  Gold  Security  Documents,  as  applicable,  provided  that  subsequent  to  the  occurrence  of  the  Senior  Debt 
Obligations Payment Date (so long as the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date shall not have occurred), the Senior 
Debt Representative shall (i) deliver to the Purchaser, at the Vendor’s sole cost and expense, the Collateral in its 
possession or control together with any necessary endorsements to the extent required by the Royal Gold Documents 
or (ii) direct and deliver such Collateral as a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise directs; provided, further, that 
subsequent to the occurrence of the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date (so long as the Senior Debt Obligations 
Payment Date shall not have occurred), the Purchaser shall (i) deliver to the Senior Debt Representative, at the Vendor’s 
sole cost and expense, the Collateral in its possession or control together with any necessary endorsements to the extent 
required by the Senior Debt Documents or (ii) direct and deliver such Collateral as a court of competent jurisdiction 
otherwise directs; provided, further, that (i) prior to the occurrence of the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date, upon 
the request of the Purchaser, the Senior Debt Representative shall turn over to the Purchaser any Royal Gold Priority 
Collateral of which it has physical possession, and (ii) prior to the occurrence of the Senior Debt Obligations Payment 
Date, upon the request of the Senior Debt Representative, the Purchaser shall turn over to the Senior Debt Representative 
any Senior Debt Priority Collateral of which it has physical possession.  The provisions of this Agreement are intended 
solely to govern the respective Lien priorities as between the Senior Debt Secured Parties and the Purchaser and shall
not impose on the Senior Debt Secured Parties or the Purchaser any obligations in respect of the disposition of any 
Collateral (or any proceeds thereof) that would conflict with prior perfected Liens or any claims thereon in favor of 
any other Person that is not a Secured Party.
SECTION 3.  Enforcement Rights.
3.1
Exclusive Enforcement. Until the Senior Obligations Payment Date has occurred, whether or not an 
Insolvency Proceeding has been commenced by or against the Vendor, the Senior Secured Parties shall have the 
exclusive right to take and continue any Enforcement Action (including the right to credit bid their debt) with respect 
to the Senior Collateral, without any consultation with or consent of any Junior Secured Party, but subject to Section 
3.2(b) and Section 4.1 and the provisos set forth in Section 3.2(a) and Section 5.1.  Upon the occurrence and during 
the continuance of a default or an event of default under the Senior Documents but subject to the terms and conditions 
of the Senior Documents, the Senior Representative and the other Senior Secured Parties may take and continue any 
Enforcement Action with respect to the Senior Obligations and the Senior Collateral in such order and manner as they 
may determine in their sole discretion.
3.2
Standstill and Waivers.  (a) Each Junior Representative, on behalf of itself and the other Junior Secured 
Parties, agrees that, until the Senior Obligations Payment Date has occurred, but subject to the proviso set forth in 
Section 5.1:
(i)  they will not take or cause to be taken any action, the purpose or effect of which is to make any 
Lien on any Senior Collateral that secures any Junior Obligation pari passu with or senior to, or to give any 
Junior Secured Party any preference or priority relative to, the Liens on the Senior Collateral securing the 
Senior Obligations;
(ii)  they will not contest, oppose, object to, interfere with, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether 
by judicial proceedings (including without limitation the filing of an Insolvency Proceeding) or otherwise, 
any foreclosure, sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of the Senior Collateral by any Senior 
Secured Party or any other Enforcement Action taken (or any forbearance from taking any Enforcement Action) 
in respect of the Senior Collateral by or on behalf of any Senior Secured Party;
(iii)  they have no right to (x) direct either the Senior Representative or any other Senior Secured Party 
to exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to the Senior Collateral or pursuant to the Senior Security 
Documents  in  respect  of  the  Senior  Collateral  or  (y)  consent  or  object  to  the  exercise  by  the  Senior 
Representative or any other Senior Secured Party of any right, remedy or power with respect to the Senior 
Collateral or pursuant to the Senior Security Documents with respect to the Senior Collateral or to the timing 
or manner in which any such right is exercised or not exercised (or, to the extent they may have any such right 
described in this clause (iii), whether as a junior lien creditor in respect of the Senior Collateral or otherwise, 
they hereby irrevocably waive such right);
(iv)  they will not institute any suit or other proceeding or assert in any suit, Insolvency Proceeding 
or other proceeding any claim against any Senior Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way 
of specific performance, instructions or otherwise, with respect to, and no Senior Secured Party shall be liable 
for, any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Senior Secured Party with respect to the Senior Collateral 
or pursuant to the Senior Documents in respect of the Senior Collateral;
(v)  they will not commence judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to 
have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession 
of any Senior Collateral, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to 
enforce their interest in or realize upon, the Senior Collateral; and
(vi)  they will not seek, and hereby waive any right, to have the Senior Collateral or any part thereof
marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of the Senior Collateral.
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may exercise its rights and remedies in respect of 
the Collateral under the Royal Gold Security Documents or applicable law after the passage of a period of 120 days 
(the “Standstill Period”) from the date of delivery of a notice in writing to the Senior Debt Representative of its intention 
to exercise such rights and remedies, which notice may only be delivered following the occurrence of a Royal Gold 
Trigger Event; provided, further, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Purchaser exercise 
or continue to exercise any such rights or remedies if, notwithstanding the expiration of the Standstill Period, (i) the 
Senior Debt Representative shall have commenced and be diligently pursuing the exercise of any of its rights and 
remedies with respect to all or any material portion of the Collateral (prompt notice of such exercise to be given to the 
Purchaser), (ii) there is a stay or prohibition against the Senior Debt Representative’s exercise of any of its rights and 
remedies with respect to all or material portion of the Collateral and the Senior Debt Representative shall be diligently 
attempting in good faith to vacate such stay or prohibition, or (iii) an Insolvency Proceeding in respect of the Vendor 
shall have been commenced and the Senior Debt Representative is continuing to monitor and taking other reasonable 
actions as are necessary to diligently pursue and protect its rights and interest in such Insolvency Proceeding; and 
provided, further, that (x) in any Insolvency Proceeding commenced by or against the Vendor, the Purchaser may take 
any action expressly permitted by Section 5 and (y) the Purchaser may, prior to a Royal Gold Trigger Event, seek 
remedies intended to ensure performance by the Vendor of its obligations under the Royal Gold Purchase Agreement 
so long as such remedies do not involve the appointment of a Receiver or similar Person with respect to the Vendor 
or any Collateral or do not involve any Enforcement Action with respect to the Collateral or any sale, foreclosure, 
restriction or limitation on the Collateral or otherwise impair or interfere with the rights of the Senior Secured Parties 
under the Senior Debt Documents or this Agreement (it being understood that in no event may the Purchaser exercise 
remedies as a “secured party” in violation of this Agreement).
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the 
Senior Debt Representative, on behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties, in an Insolvency Proceeding 
or otherwise, from commencing, taking and continuing any Enforcement Action against all Collateral; provided that, 
any sale or disposition of the Royal Gold Priority Collateral pursuant to such Enforcement Action shall be in accordance 
with the requirements set forth in Section 4.1(a)(i) and the proceeds thereof shall be distributed in the order set forth 
in Section 4.1(a)(ii).
3.3
Judgment Creditors.  In the event that the Purchaser becomes a judgment lien creditor in respect of 
Collateral as a result of its enforcement of its rights as an unsecured creditor, such judgment lien shall be subject to 
the terms of this Agreement for all purposes (including in relation to the Senior Debt Liens and the Senior Debt 
Obligations) to the same extent as all other Liens securing the Royal Gold Obligations are subject to the terms of this 
Agreement.  In the event that any Senior Debt Secured Party becomes a judgment lien creditor in respect of Collateral 
as a result of its enforcement of its rights as an unsecured creditor, such judgment lien shall be subject to the terms of 
this Agreement for all purposes (including in relation to the Royal Gold Liens and the Royal Gold Obligations) to the 
same extent as all other Liens securing the Senior Debt Obligations are subject to the terms of this Agreement.
3.4
Cooperation.  The Purchaser agrees that it shall take such actions as the Senior Debt Representative 
shall request in connection with the exercise by the Senior Debt Secured Parties of their rights set forth herein in respect 
of the Senior Debt Priority Collateral. The Senior Debt Representative, on behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt 
Secured Parties, agrees that each of them shall take such actions as the Purchaser shall request in connection with the 
exercise by the Purchaser of their rights set forth herein in respect of the Royal Gold Priority Collateral.
3.5
No Additional Rights For the Vendor Hereunder.  Except as provided in Section 3.6 hereof, if any 
Senior Debt Secured Party or the Purchaser shall enforce its rights or remedies in violation of the terms of this Agreement, 
the Vendor shall not be entitled to use such violation as a defense to any action by any Senior Debt Secured Party or 
the Purchaser, nor to assert such violation as a counterclaim or basis for set off or recoupment against any Senior Debt 
Secured Party or the Purchaser.
3.6
Actions  Upon  Breach.    (a)    If  any  Senior  Debt  Secured  Party  or  the  Purchaser,  contrary  to  this 
Agreement, commences or participates in any action or proceeding against the Vendor or the Collateral, the Vendor, 
with the prior written consent of the Senior Debt Representative or the Purchaser, as applicable, may interpose as a
defense or dilatory plea the making of this Agreement, and any Senior Debt Secured Party or the Purchaser, as applicable, 
may intervene and interpose such defense or plea in its or their name or in the name of such Note Party.
(b)  Should any Senior Debt Secured Party or the Purchaser, contrary to this Agreement, in any way take, 
attempt to or threaten to take any action with respect to the Collateral (including, without limitation, any attempt to 
realize upon or enforce any remedy with respect to this Agreement), or fail to take any action required by this Agreement, 
any Senior Debt Secured Party or the Purchaser (in its own name or in the name of the relevant Note Party), as applicable, 
or the relevant Note Party, may obtain relief against such Senior Debt Secured Party or the Purchaser, as applicable, 
by injunction, specific performance and/or other appropriate equitable relief, it being understood and agreed by each 
of the Senior Debt Representative on behalf of each Senior Debt Secured Party and the Purchaser that (i) the Senior 
Debt Secured Parties' or Purchaser', as applicable, damages from its actions may at that time be difficult to ascertain 
and may be irreparable, and (ii) the Purchaser or Senior Debt Secured Party, as applicable, waives any defense that 
the Vendor and/or the Purchaser and/or Senior Debt Secured Parties, as applicable, cannot demonstrate damage and/
or be made whole by the awarding of damages.
SECTION 4.  Application of Proceeds of Senior Collateral; Dispositions and Releases of Lien; Notices and Insurance.
4.1
Disposition and Application of Proceeds.
(a)  Disposition and Application of Proceeds of Senior Collateral.
(i)
Prior to the occurrence of a Royal Gold Trigger Event, the Purchaser agrees that it will not 
oppose any sale or disposition of any Collateral consented or made by the Senior Debt Representative so long as (A) 
the transferee pursuant to such sale or disposition agrees in writing that (x) such transferee’s interests in the Collateral 
are subject to the rights of the Purchaser under the Royal Gold Purchase Agreement and the liens granted pursuant to 
the Royal Gold Security Documents and (y) such transferee acknowledges and agrees to the terms of this Agreement 
and (B) such sale or disposition does not result in a breach of the obligations of the Vendor under the Royal Gold 
Purchase Agreement. The Purchaser further agrees that prior to the Royal Gold Trigger Event, the Purchaser shall not 
sell or dispose of, in whole or in part, its interests in or rights under the Royal Gold Purchase Agreement, including 
the Royal Gold Priority Collateral, or release the Royal Gold Lien in connection with such sale or disposal, unless the 
transferee pursuant to such sale or disposition shall acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Agreement, it being 
understood and agreed by the parties hereto that the Purchaser or any affiliate of the Purchaser may sell, transfer or 
otherwise  dispose  of  Refined  Gold  (not  obtained  as  a  result  of  an  Enforcement Action,  unless  the  Senior  Debt 
Representative shall agree to such further sale, transfer or disposition) in the ordinary course without any further action 
or agreement by the transferee of such Refined Gold, which sale, transfer or other disposition shall be made free and 
clear of all liens or other encumbrances arising under the Royal Gold Documents or the Senior Debt Documents.  The 
Senior Debt Secured Parties agree that transferees of their interests shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement as 
a result of the execution of this Agreement by the Senior Debt Representative on their behalf.
(ii)
After the occurrence of a Royal Gold Trigger Event, the Senior Representative and Junior 
Representative hereby agree that all Senior Collateral, and all Proceeds thereof, received by either of them in connection 
with the collection, sale or disposition of Senior Collateral shall be applied:
first, to the payment of costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and
court costs) of the Senior Representative in connection with such Enforcement Action,
second, to the payment of the Senior Obligations in accordance with the Senior Documents until the
Senior Obligations Payment Date,
third, to the payment of the Junior Obligations in accordance with the Junior Documents, and
fourth, the balance, if any, to the Vendor or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same
or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.
(b)  Limited Obligation or Liability.  In exercising remedies, whether as a secured creditor or otherwise, the 
Senior Representative shall have no obligation or liability to the Junior Representative or to any Junior Secured Party, 
regarding the adequacy of any Proceeds or for any action or omission, save and except solely for an action or omission 
that breaches the express obligations undertaken by each party under the terms of this Agreement.
(c)  Segregation of Collateral.  Until the occurrence of the Senior Obligations Payment Date, any Senior 
Collateral that may be received by any Junior Secured Party in violation of this Agreement shall be segregated and 
held in trust and promptly paid over to the Senior Representative, for the benefit of the Senior Secured Parties, in the 
same form as received, with any necessary endorsements, and each Junior Secured Party hereby authorizes the Senior 
Representative to make any such endorsements as agent for the Junior Representative (which authorization, being 
coupled with an interest, is irrevocable).
4.2
Releases of Liens.   (a) (i) Upon any release, sale or disposition of Senior Debt Priority Collateral 
permitted pursuant to the terms of the Senior Debt Documents that results in the release of the Senior Debt Lien (other 
than release of the Senior Debt Lien due to the occurrence of the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date, and any 
release of the Senior Debt Lien after the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default under the Royal 
Gold Purchase Agreement) on any Senior Debt Priority Collateral, the Royal Gold Lien on such Senior Debt Priority 
Collateral (excluding any portion of the proceeds of such Senior Debt Priority Collateral remaining after the Senior 
Debt Obligations Payment Date occurs) shall be automatically and unconditionally released with no further consent 
or action of any Person so long as such release, sale or disposition of Senior Debt Priority Collateral is permitted 
pursuant to the terms of the Royal Gold Documents.
(ii)  Upon any release, sale or disposition of Senior Debt Priority Collateral pursuant to any Enforcement 
Action that results in the release of the Senior Debt Lien (other than release of the Senior Debt Lien due to the occurrence 
of the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date) on any Senior Debt Priority Collateral pursuant to any Enforcement 
Action, the Royal Gold Lien on such Senior Debt Priority Collateral (excluding any portion of the proceeds of such 
Senior Debt Priority Collateral remaining after the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date occurs) shall be automatically 
and unconditionally released with no further consent or action of any Person so long as the proceeds of such Senior 
Debt Priority Collateral are applied in accordance with Section 4.1(a)  (with, in the case of Senior Debt Obligations 
consisting of debt of a revolving nature, a corresponding permanent reduction in the commitments thereto).
(iii)  The Purchaser shall promptly execute and deliver such release documents and instruments and 
shall take such further actions as the Senior Debt Representative shall request in writing to evidence any release of the 
Royal Gold Lien described herein.  The Purchaser hereby appoints the Senior Debt Representative and any officer or 
duly authorized person of the Senior Debt Representative, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-
in-fact with full irrevocable power of attorney in the place and stead of the Purchaser and in the name of the Purchaser 
or in the Senior Debt Representative’s own name, from time to time, in the Senior Debt Representative’s sole discretion, 
for the purposes of carrying out the terms of this Section 4.2, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute and 
deliver any and all documents and instruments as may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this 
Section 4.2, including, without limitation, any financing statements, endorsements, assignments, releases or other 
documents or instruments of transfer (which appointment, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable).
(b)  (i) Subject to the next succeeding sentence, upon any release, sale or disposition of Royal Gold Priority 
Collateral permitted pursuant to the terms of the Royal Gold Documents that results in the release of the Royal Gold 
Lien (other than release of the Royal Gold Lien due to the occurrence of the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date, 
and any release of the Royal Gold Lien after the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default under 
the Senior Debt Agreement) on any Royal Gold Priority Collateral, the Senior Debt Lien on such Royal Gold Priority 
Collateral (excluding any portion of the proceeds of such Royal Gold Priority Collateral remaining after the Royal 
Gold Obligations Payment Date occurs) shall be automatically and unconditionally released with no further consent 
or action of any Person so long as such release, sale or disposition of Royal Gold Priority Collateral is permitted 
pursuant to the terms of the Senior Debt Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any sale, release or disposition 
of Royal Gold Priority Collateral prior to the Royal Gold Trigger Event, shall be subject to the requirements set forth 
in Section 4.1(a)(i).
(ii)  Upon any release, sale or disposition of Royal Gold Priority Collateral pursuant to any Enforcement 
Action that results in the release of the Royal Gold Lien (other than release of the Royal Gold Lien due to the occurrence 
of the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date) on any Royal Gold Priority Collateral pursuant to any Enforcement 
Action, the Senior Debt Lien on such Royal Gold Priority Collateral (excluding any portion of the proceeds of such 
Royal Gold Priority Collateral remaining after the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date occurs) shall be automatically 
and unconditionally released with no further consent or action of any Person so long as the proceeds of such Royal 
Gold Priority Collateral are applied in accordance with Section 4.1(a) (with, in the case of Royal Gold Obligations 
consisting of debt of a revolving nature, a corresponding permanent reduction in the commitments thereto).
(iii)  The Senior Debt Representative shall promptly execute and deliver such release documents and 
instruments and shall take such further actions as the Purchaser shall request in writing to evidence any release of the 
Senior Debt Lien described herein.  The Senior Debt Representative hereby appoints the Purchaser and any officer or 
duly authorized person of the Purchaser, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with 
full irrevocable power of attorney in the place and stead of the Senior Debt Representative and in the name of the 
Senior Debt Representative or in the Purchaser’s own name, from time to time, in the Purchaser’s sole discretion, for 
the purposes of carrying out the terms of this Section 4.2, to take any and all appropriate action and to execute and 
deliver any and all documents and instruments as may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of this 
Section 4.2, including, without limitation, any financing statements, endorsements, assignments, releases or other 
documents or instruments of transfer (which appointment, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable).
4.3
Certain Real Property Notices; Insurance.  (a)  The Senior Debt Representative shall give the Purchaser 
at least 30 days notice prior to commencing any Enforcement Action against any Real Property owned by the Vendor 
at which Royal Gold Priority Collateral is stored or otherwise located or to dispossess any Note Party from such Real 
Property.
(b)  Proceeds of Collateral include insurance proceeds and therefore the Lien Priority shall govern the ultimate 
disposition of casualty insurance proceeds.  The Senior Debt Representative and Purchaser shall be named as additional 
insureds and loss payees with respect to all insurance policies relating to Collateral.  The Senior Debt Representative 
shall have the sole and exclusive right, as against the Purchaser, to adjust settlement of insurance claims in the event 
of any covered loss, theft or destruction of Senior Debt Priority Collateral.  The Purchaser shall have the sole and 
exclusive right, as against the Senior Debt Representative, to adjust settlement of insurance claims in the event of any 
covered loss, theft or destruction of Royal Gold Priority Collateral.  All proceeds of such insurance shall be remitted 
to the Senior Debt Representative or the Purchaser, as the case may be, and each of the Purchaser and Senior Debt 
Representative shall cooperate (if necessary) in a reasonable manner in effecting the payment of insurance proceeds 
in accordance with Section 4.1.
SECTION 5.  Insolvency Proceedings.
5.1
Filing of Motions.  Subject to Section 3.2(b), until the Senior Obligations Payment Date has occurred, 
the Junior Representative agrees on behalf of itself and the other Junior Secured Parties that no Junior Secured Party 
shall, in or in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding, file any pleadings or motions, take any position at any 
hearing or proceeding of any nature, or otherwise take any action whatsoever, in each case in respect of any of the 
Senior Collateral, including, without limitation, with respect to the determination of any Liens or claims held by the 
Senior Representative (including the validity and enforceability thereof) or any other Senior Secured Party in respect 
of any Senior Collateral or the value of any claims of such parties under Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or 
similar provision of any other applicable Insolvency Law; provided that the Junior Representative may (i) file a proof 
of claim in an Insolvency Proceeding, (ii) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in 
opposition of any motion or other pleadings made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance 
or subordination, in whole or in part, of its claims, subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, and (iii) take 
any other action with the consent of the Senior Representative.
5.2
Financing Matters.  (a)  If the Vendor becomes subject to any Insolvency Proceeding at any time 
prior to the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date, and if the Senior Debt Representative or the other Senior Debt 
Secured Parties desire to consent (or not object) to the use of cash collateral under any Insolvency Law, to the
extent applicable or to provide financing to the Vendor under applicable Insolvency Laws or to consent (or not 
object) to the provision of such financing to any Note Party by any third party (any such financing, “Senior Debt 
DIP Financing”), then the Purchaser agrees  that the Purchaser (i) (x) will consent and (and will be deemed 
hereunder to have consented) to, will raise no objection to, nor support any other Person objecting to, the use of 
such cash collateral or to such Senior Debt DIP Financing on the grounds of a failure to provide “adequate 
protection” for the Royal Gold Lien on the Collateral to secure the Royal Gold Obligations or on any other grounds 
and (y) will not request any adequate protection, to the extent applicable in subject Insolvency Proceeding, solely as 
a result of such Senior Debt DIP Financing except, to the extent applicable, as set forth in Section 5.4 below and (ii) 
will subordinate (and will be deemed hereunder to have subordinated) the Royal Gold Liens on any Senior Debt 
Priority Collateral (A) to such Senior Debt DIP Financing on the same terms as the Senior Debt Liens are 
subordinated thereto (and such subordination will not alter in any manner the terms of this Agreement), (B) to any 
adequate protection provided to the Senior Debt Secured Parties, (C) to any “carve-out” agreed to by the Senior 
Debt Representative or the other Senior Debt Secured Parties and (D) to any court-ordered charge ranking senior to 
the Senior Debt Liens agreed to by the Senior Debt Representative or other Senior Debt Parties, so long as (x) the 
Purchaser retains its Lien on the Collateral to secure the Royal Gold Obligations (in each case, including Proceeds 
thereof arising after the commencement of the Insolvency Proceeding) and, as to the Royal Gold Priority Collateral 
only, such Lien has the same priority as existed prior to the commencement of the case under applicable Insolvency 
Law and any Lien securing such Senior Debt DIP Financing is junior and subordinate to the Lien of the Purchaser 
on the Royal Gold Priority Collateral, (y) all Liens on Senior Debt Priority Collateral securing any such Senior Debt 
DIP Financing shall be senior to or on a parity with the Liens of the Senior Debt Representative and the Senior Debt 
Lenders securing the Senior Debt Obligations on Senior Debt Priority Collateral and (z) if the Senior Debt 
Representative receives a replacement or adequate protection Lien on post-petition assets of the debtor to secure the 
Senior Debt Obligations, and such replacement or adequate protection Lien is on any of the Royal Gold Priority 
Collateral, (1) such replacement or adequate protection Lien on such post-petition assets which are part of the Royal 
Gold Priority Collateral (the “Royal Gold Post-Petition Assets”) is junior and subordinate to the Lien in favor of the 
Purchaser on the Royal Gold Priority Collateral and (2) the Purchaser also receives a replacement or adequate 
protection Lien on such Royal Gold Post-Petition Assets of the debtor to secure the Royal Gold Obligations.  In no 
event will any of the Senior Debt Secured Parties seek to obtain a priming Lien to secure any Senior Debt DIP 
Financing on any of the Royal Gold Priority Collateral and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a 
consent by the Purchaser to any adequate protection payments using Royal Gold Priority Collateral.  Without 
prejudice to the rights of the Purchaser under this Agreement, the Senior Debt Representative may seek the 
appointment of a Receiver by the court over all of the Collateral (including all or any part of the Royal Gold 
Priority Collateral) and propose to the court that it grant the Receiver priming liens over all such Collateral for 
funding the costs of the receivership as is customary in Canadian receivership proceedings; provided, however, the 
Senior Debt Representative will not commence any Insolvency Proceeding for the appointment of a Receiver by a 
court with less notice to the Purchaser than is required by the applicable rules of court procedure, unless (i) the 
Senior Debt Representative reasonably determines that such an action is necessary to preserve and/or protect such 
Collateral from immediate damage or significant diminution in value and (ii) the Senior Debt Representative 
provides the Purchaser with no less than three (3) business day’s prior written notice of the hearing of the 
application to the court, to the extent possible; provided, however, that the Senior Debt Representative will not have 
any personal liability to the Purchaser for failure to provide the Purchaser with such prior written notice.  The 
immediately forgoing sentence is not intended and shall not be construed as a waiver by the Purchaser of any 
statutory right to receive earlier notice from the Senior Debt Representative or other Person in connection with the 
appointment of a Receiver or an application to the court for the appointment of a Receiver.  In no event shall the 
Purchaser sell or obtain a priming lien on any Senior Debt Priority Collateral in any Insolvency Proceedings or 
otherwise.  Notwithstanding the granting of any priming liens by a court in favor of a Receiver over such Collateral, 
all rights and obligations of the Purchaser and the Senior Debt Representative are intended to be and shall be 
deemed to be subject to the Lien Priority and other terms and conditions of this Agreement.
(b)  All Liens granted to the Purchaser or the Senior Debt Representative in any Insolvency Proceeding, 
whether as adequate protection or otherwise, are intended to be and shall be deemed to be subject to the Lien Priority 
and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement.
5.3
Relief from the Automatic Stay.  Until the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date, the Purchaser 
agrees, that it will not seek relief from the automatic stay or from any other stay in any Insolvency Proceeding or take 
any action in derogation thereof, in each case in respect of any Senior Debt Priority Collateral, without the prior written 
consent  of  the  Senior  Debt  Representative.    Until  the  Royal  Gold  Obligations  Payment  Date,  the  Senior  Debt 
Representative agrees, on behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties, that none of them will seek relief 
from the automatic stay or from any other stay in any Insolvency Proceeding or take any action in derogation thereof, 
in each case in respect of any Royal Gold Priority Collateral, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.  In 
addition, neither the Purchaser nor the Senior Debt Representative shall seek any relief from the automatic stay with 
respect to any Collateral without providing 30 days’ prior written notice to the other, unless otherwise agreed by both 
the Senior Debt Representative and the Purchaser.
5.4
Adequate Protection.  (a)  The Purchaser agrees that, prior to the Senior Debt Obligations Payment 
Date, so long as the Senior Debt Representative and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties comply with Section 5.4
(b), it shall not object, contest, or support any other Person objecting to or contesting, (i) any request by the Senior 
Debt Representative or the other Senior Debt Secured Parties for adequate protection of its interest in the Collateral 
or any adequate protection provided to the Senior Debt Representative or the other Senior Debt Secured Parties or (ii) 
any objection by the Senior Debt Representative or any other Senior Debt Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action 
or proceeding based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection in the Collateral or (iii) the payment of interest, fees, 
expenses or other amounts to the Senior Debt Representative or any other Senior Debt Secured Party under Section 
506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or similar provision of any other applicable Insolvency Law; provided that 
any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) does not violate Section 5.2.  The Purchaser, further agrees 
that, prior to the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date, none of them shall assert or enforce any claim under Section 
506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or similar provision of any other applicable Insolvency Law that is senior to 
or on a parity with the Senior Debt Liens for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Senior Debt Priority 
Collateral.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section and in Section 5.2(a)(i)(y), but subject 
to all other provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 5.2(a)(i)(x) and Section 5.3), in any 
Insolvency Proceeding, if the Senior Debt Secured Parties (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection 
consisting of additional collateral that constitutes Senior Debt Priority Collateral (with replacement liens on such 
additional collateral) and superpriority claims in connection with any Senior Debt DIP Financing or use of cash 
collateral, and the Senior Debt Secured Parties do not object to the adequate protection being provided to them, then 
in connection with any such Senior Debt DIP Financing or use of cash collateral the Purchaser, may, as adequate 
protection of their interests in the Senior Debt Priority Collateral, seek or accept (and the Senior Debt Representative 
and the Senior Debt Secured Parties shall not object to) adequate protection consisting solely of (x) a replacement Lien 
on the same additional collateral, subordinated to the Liens securing the Senior Debt Obligations and such Senior Debt 
DIP Financing on the same basis as the other Royal Gold Liens on the Senior Debt Priority Collateral are so subordinated 
to the Senior Debt Obligations under this Agreement and (y) superpriority claims junior in all respects to the superpriority 
claims granted to the Senior Debt Secured Parties, provided, however, that the Purchaser shall have irrevocably agreed, 
pursuant to Section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code or similar provision of any other applicable Insolvency Law 
in any stipulation and/or order granting such adequate protection, that such junior superpriority claims may be paid 
under any plan of reorganization in any combination of cash, debt, equity or other property having a value on the 
effective date of such plan equal to the allowed amount of such claims.
(b)  The Senior Debt Representative, on behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties, agrees that, 
prior to the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date, so long as the Purchaser  complies with Section 5.4(a), none of 
them shall object, contest, or support any other Person objecting to or contesting, (i) any request by the Purchaser for 
adequate protection of its interest in the Collateral or any adequate protection provided to the Purchaser  or (ii) any 
objection by the Purchaser  to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim of a lack of adequate protection 
in the Collateral or (iii) the payment of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts to the Purchaser  under Section 506
(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or similar provision of any other applicable Insolvency Law; provided that any 
action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) does not violate Section 5.2.  The Senior Debt Representative, on 
behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties, further agrees that, prior to the Royal Gold Obligations 
Payment Date, none of them shall assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code 
or similar provision of any other applicable Insolvency Law that is senior to or on a parity with the Royal Gold Liens
for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Royal Gold Priority Collateral.  Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary set forth in this Section and in Section 5.2(b)(i)(y), but subject to all other provisions of this Agreement 
(including, without limitation, Section 5.2(b)(i)(x) and Section 5.3), in any Insolvency Proceeding, if the Purchaser is 
granted adequate protection consisting of additional collateral that constitutes Royal Gold Priority Collateral (with 
replacement liens on such additional collateral) and superpriority claims in connection with any DIP Financing or use 
of cash collateral, and the Purchaser does not object to the adequate protection being provided to it, then in connection 
with any such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral the Senior Debt Representative, on behalf of itself and any of 
the Senior Debt Secured Parties, may, as adequate protection of their interests in the Royal Gold Priority Collateral, 
seek or accept (and the Purchaser shall not object to) adequate protection consisting solely of (x) a replacement Lien 
on the same additional collateral, subordinated to the Liens securing the Royal Gold Obligations on the same basis as 
the other Senior Debt Liens on the Royal Gold Priority Collateral are so subordinated to the Royal Gold Obligations 
under this Agreement and (y) superpriority claims junior in all respects to the superpriority claims granted to the 
Purchaser, provided, however, that the Senior Debt Representative shall have irrevocably agreed , pursuant to Section 
1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code or similar provision of any other applicable Insolvency Law, on behalf of itself 
and the Senior Debt Secured Parties, in any stipulation and/or order granting such adequate protection, that such junior 
superpriority claims may be paid under any plan of reorganization in any combination of cash, debt, equity or other 
property having a value on the effective date of such plan equal to the allowed amount of such claims.
5.5
Avoidance Issues.  If any Senior Secured Party is required in any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise 
to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Vendor, because such amount was avoided or ordered to be 
paid or disgorged for any reason, including without limitation because it was found to be a fraudulent or preferential 
transfer, any amount (a “Recovery”), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of set-off or 
otherwise, then the Senior Obligations shall be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding 
as if such payment had not occurred and the Senior Obligations Payment Date shall be deemed not to have occurred.  
If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force 
and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations 
of the parties hereto.  The Junior Secured Parties agree that none of them shall be entitled to benefit from any avoidance 
action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in accordance with this Agreement, whether 
by preference or otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable 
to them shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in this 
Agreement.
5.6
Asset  Dispositions  in  an  Insolvency  Proceeding.      (a) The  Purchaser  shall  not,  in  an  Insolvency 
Proceeding or otherwise, oppose any sale or disposition of any Senior Debt Priority Collateral that is supported by the 
Senior Debt Secured Parties, and the Purchaser will consent (and will be deemed hereunder to have consented), under 
the applicable Insolvency Laws to any sale of any Senior Debt Priority Collateral supported by the Senior Debt Secured 
Parties and to have released the Junior Liens on such assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is agreed that no Senior 
Debt Secured Party shall convey or approve a transfer of any mineral tenures necessary or desirable for the extraction 
of gold at the Milligan Property without requiring such transferee to agree in writing that its interests in such mineral 
tenures are subject to the obligations of the Vendor under the Royal Gold Purchase Agreement; provided that the 
Purchaser shall not oppose any such transfer of mineral tenures in compliance with the foregoing requirement.
(b)  Neither  the  Senior  Debt  Representative  nor  any  Senior  Debt  Secured  Party  shall,  in  an  Insolvency 
Proceeding or otherwise, oppose any sale or disposition of any Royal Gold Priority Collateral that is supported by the 
Purchaser, and the Senior Debt Representative and the Senior Debt Secured Parties will consent (and will be deemed 
hereunder to have consented) under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or similar provision of any other applicable 
Insolvency Law, to any sale of any Royal Gold Priority Collateral supported by the Purchaser and to have released the 
Junior Liens on such assets.
5.7
Other Matters.   To the extent that the Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party has or acquires 
rights, under Section 363 or Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or similar provision of any other applicable Insolvency 
Law, with respect to any of the Collateral on which it has a Junior Lien, such Senior Representative agrees, on behalf 
of itself and the other Senior Secured Parties, not to assert any of such rights without the prior written consent of the 
Junior Representative; provided that if requested by the Junior Representative, such Senior Representative shall timely
exercise such rights in the manner requested by the Junior Representative, including any rights to payments in respect 
of such rights.
5.8
Effectiveness  in  Insolvency  Proceedings.    This  Agreement,  which  the  parties  hereto  expressly 
acknowledge is a “subordination agreement” under section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or similar provision of any 
other applicable Insolvency Law, shall be effective before, during and after the commencement of an Insolvency 
Proceeding.
SECTION 6.  Royal Gold Documents and Senior Debt Documents.
(a)  The Vendor and the Purchaser agrees that it shall not at any time execute or deliver any amendment or
other modification to any of the Royal Gold Documents in violation of this Agreement.
(b)  The Vendor and the Senior Debt Representative, on behalf of itself and the Senior Debt Secured Parties, 
agrees that it shall not at any time execute or deliver any amendment or other modification to any of the Senior Debt 
Documents in violation of this Agreement.
(c)  In the event the Senior Debt Representative enters into any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of 
any of the Senior Security Documents for the purpose of adding to, or deleting from, or waiving or consenting to any 
departures from any provisions of, any Senior Security Document or changing in any manner the rights of any parties 
thereunder, in each case solely with respect to any Senior Collateral, then such amendment, waiver or consent shall 
apply automatically to any comparable provision of the Comparable Security Document without the consent of or 
action by any Junior Secured Party (with all such amendments, waivers and modifications subject to the terms hereof); 
provided that, (i) no such amendment, waiver or consent shall have the effect of removing assets subject to the Lien 
of any Junior Security Document, except to the extent that a release of such Lien is permitted by Section 4.2, (ii) any 
such amendment, waiver or consent that materially and adversely affects the rights of the Junior Secured Parties and 
does not affect the Senior Secured Parties in a like or similar manner shall not apply to the Junior Security Documents 
without the consent of the Junior Representative, (iii) no such amendment, waiver or consent with respect to any 
provision applicable to the Junior Representative under the Junior Note Documents shall be made without the prior 
written consent of the Junior Representative, (iv) notice of such amendment, waiver or consent shall be given to the 
Junior Representative no later than 30 days after its effectiveness, provided that the failure to give such notice shall 
not affect the effectiveness and validity thereof and (v) such amendment, waiver or modification to the applicable 
Junior Security Documents shall be approved by the Issuer in writing.
SECTION 7.  Reliance; Waivers; etc.
7.1
Reliance.  The Senior Debt Documents are deemed to have been executed and delivered, and all 
extensions of credit thereunder are deemed to have been made or incurred, in reliance upon this Agreement.  The 
Purchaser  expressly  waives  all  notice  of  the  acceptance  of  and  reliance  on  this Agreement  by  the  Senior  Debt 
Representative and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties.  The Royal Gold Documents are deemed to have been 
executed and delivered and all extensions of credit thereunder are deemed to have been made or incurred, in reliance 
upon this Agreement.  The Senior Debt Representative, on behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties,

provided in this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Senior Debt Representative will be entitled to manage and supervise 
the respective extensions of credit to the Vendor in accordance with law and their usual practices, modified from time 
to time as they deem appropriate.
7.3
No Waivers.  No right or benefit of any party hereunder shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or 
impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of such party or any other party hereto or by any noncompliance by 
the Vendor with the terms and conditions of any of the Senior Debt Documents or the Royal Gold Documents.
SECTION 8.  Obligations Unconditional.
All rights, interests, agreements and obligations hereunder of the Senior Representative and the Senior Secured 
Parties in respect of any Collateral and the Junior Representative and the Junior Secured Parties in respect of such 
Collateral shall remain in full force and effect regardless of:
(a)
any lack of validity or enforceability of any Senior Document or any Junior Document and regardless 
of whether the Liens of the Senior Representative and Senior Secured Parties are not perfected or are voidable for any 
reason;
(b)
any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other terms of, all or any of the Senior 
Obligations or Junior Obligations, or any amendment or waiver or other modification, including any increase in the 
amount thereof or any refinancing, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, of the terms of any Senior Document 
or any Junior Document;
(c)
any exchange, release, order of perfection or lack of perfection of any Lien on any Collateral or any 
other asset, or any amendment, waiver or other modification, whether in writing or by course of conduct or otherwise,

(d)
the commencement of any Insolvency Proceeding in respect of the Vendor; or
(e)

SECTION 9.  Miscellaneous.
9.1
Rights of Subrogation.  The Purchaser agrees that no payment to the Senior Debt Representative or 
any Senior Debt Secured Party pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall entitle the Purchaser to exercise any 
rights of subrogation in respect thereof until the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date.  Following the Senior Debt 
Obligations  Payment  Date,  the  Senior  Debt  Representative  agrees  to  execute  such  documents,  agreements,  and 
instruments as the Purchaser  may reasonably request to evidence the transfer by subrogation to any such Person of 
an interest in the Senior Debt Obligations resulting from payments to the Senior Debt Representative by such Person, 
so long as all costs and expenses (including all reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred in connection therewith 
by the Senior Debt Representative are paid by such Person upon request for payment thereof.  The Senior Debt 
Representative, for and on behalf of itself and the Senior Debt Secured Parties, agrees that no payment to the Purchaser 
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement shall entitle the Senior Debt Representative or any Senior Debt Secured 
Party to exercise any rights of subrogation in respect thereof until the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date.  Following 
the  Royal  Gold  Obligations  Payment  Date,  the  Purchaser  agrees  to  execute  such  documents,  agreements,  and 
instruments as the Senior Debt Representative or any Senior Debt Secured Party may reasonably request to evidence 
the transfer by subrogation to any such Person of an interest in the Royal Gold Obligations resulting from payments 
to the Purchaser by such Person, so long as all costs and expenses (including all reasonable legal fees and disbursements) 
incurred in connection therewith by the Purchaser are paid by such Person upon request for payment thereof.
9.2
Further Assurances.  Each of the Purchaser and the Senior Debt Representative will, at their own 
expense and at any time and from time to time, promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, 
and take all further action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that the other party may reasonably request, in order 
to protect any right or interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable the Senior Debt Representative 
or the Purchaser to exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder; provided, however, that no party shall be 
required to pay over any payment or distribution, execute any instruments or documents, or take any other action 
referred to in this Section 9.2, to the extent that such action would contravene any law, order or other legal requirement 
or any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and in the event of a controversy or dispute, such party may 
interplead any payment or distribution in any court of competent jurisdiction, without further responsibility in respect 
of such payment or distribution under this Section 9.2.
9.3
Conflicts.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions
of any Senior Debt Document or any Royal Gold Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.
9.4
Continuing Nature of Provisions.  Subject to Section 5.5, this Agreement shall continue to be effective, 
and shall not be terminable by any party hereto, until the earlier of (i) the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date and 
(ii) the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date; provided that if an Additional Senior Debt Agreement or Replacement 
Royal Gold Agreement, as applicable, is entered into following such termination, the relevant Secured Parties agree 
to, upon the request of the Vendor, restore this Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth herein until the earlier 
to occur of the next following Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date or Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date.  This 
is a continuing agreement and the Senior Debt Secured Parties and the Purchaser may continue, at any time and without 
notice to the other parties hereto, to extend credit and other financial accommodations, lend monies and provide 
indebtedness to, or for the benefit of, the Vendor on the faith hereof.  In furtherance of the foregoing:
Upon receipt of a notice from the Vendor stating that the Vendor have entered into entered into an Additional 
Senior Debt Agreement (which notice shall include the identity of the new Senior Debt Representative), the Purchaser 
shall promptly (i) enter into such documents and agreements (including amendments or supplements to this Agreement) 
as the Vendor or the new Senior Debt Representative shall reasonably request in order to provide to the new Senior 
Debt Representative the rights contemplated hereby, in each case consistent in all material respects with the terms of 
this Agreement, (ii) deliver to the new Senior Debt Representative any Senior Debt Priority Collateral held by it, 
together with any necessary endorsements (or otherwise allow the new Senior Debt Representative to obtain control 
of such Senior Debt Priority Collateral), and (iii) take such other actions as the Vendor or the new Senior Debt 
Representative may reasonably request to provide the new Senior Debt Representative or the applicable the Senior 
Debt Creditors the benefits of this Agreement.  The new Senior Debt Representative shall agree in a writing addressed 
to the Purchaser to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
9.5
Amendments; Waivers.  (a)  No amendment or modification of or supplement to any of the provisions 
of this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Senior Debt Representative

Senior Debt Secured Party or the Purchaser, may in their discretion determine that a supplemental agreement (which 
may take the form of an amendment and restatement of this Agreement) is necessary or appropriate to facilitate having 
additional indebtedness or other obligations (“Additional Debt”) of the Vendor become Senior Debt Obligations or 
Royal Gold Obligations, as the case may be, under this Agreement, which supplemental agreement shall specify whether 
such Additional Debt constitutes Senior Debt Obligations or Royal Gold Obligations, provided, that such Additional 
Debt is permitted to be incurred by the Senior Debt Agreement and Royal Gold Purchase Agreement then extant, and 
is permitted by such agreements to be subject to the provisions of this Agreement as Senior Debt Obligations or Royal 
Gold Obligations, as applicable, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 8.6(a) of the Royal Gold Purchase 
Agreement.
(c)
Notwithstanding the terms of Section 9.5(a) and (b), in the event that the Purchaser does not take the 
actions contemplated by clause (i) of the second paragraph of Section 9.4 in connection with any permitted Additional 
Debt within 10 days after the delivery of a written request to do so, the Senior Debt Representative, without the consent 
of the Purchaser, may modify this Agreement (which modification may take the form of an amendment and restatement 
of this Agreement) solely for the purpose of having any Additional Senior Debt Agreement or Additional Debt of the 
Vendor become Senior Debt Obligations under this Agreement, which agreement shall specify that such Additional 
Senior Debt Agreement or Additional Debt constitutes Senior Debt Obligations, provided, that such Additional Debt 
is permitted to be incurred pursuant to each Royal Gold Purchase Agreement then extant, and is permitted by such
agreements (as determined by the Senior Debt Representative in good faith and certified by an officer of the Issuer to 
the Purchaser) to be subject to the provisions of this Agreement as Senior Debt Obligations, as applicable.

information to such other party or any other party on any subsequent occasion, (b) to undertake any investigation not

Purchaser hereby agrees to promptly notify the Senior Debt Representative in writing of any material breach under 
any Royal Gold Document, including a Vendor Event of Default or any other event of default as defined in any 
document, instrument or agreement delivered by the Vendor in connection with any Royal Gold Document and (ii)

defined in any Senior Debt Document or any other document, instrument or agreement delivered by the Vendor in 
connection with any Senior Debt Document; provided that failure by the Purchaser or the Senior Debt Representative 
to deliver such notice shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any of its respective rights or remedies under this Agreement.

3.  Amendments to Article 8 of the Amended and Restated Agreement.
A.  Section 8.6(a) of the Amended and Restated Agreement is hereby amended as follows:
By deleting the first sentence in its entirety and replacing it with the following:
(a) 
“Until the earlier of (i) the date on which 425,000 ounces of Refined Gold have been sold and Delivered 
to the Purchaser under this Agreement and (ii) the date on which the outstanding balance of the 
Payment Deposit, as set forth in the Deposit Record, has been reduced by US$280,000,000 (such 
earlier date, the “Cap Expiration Date”), neither the Vendor nor any Affiliate of the Vendor shall 
grant or incur Encumbrances against the assets of the Milligan Project (excluding, for the avoidance 
of doubt, any Financing described in Section 8.6(e)(i) or any Encumbrance described in Section 8.6
(g)), which Encumbrances are senior to or pari passu with the liens granted to the Purchaser under 
the  Security Agreements  in  aggregate  principal  amount  exceeding  US$350,000,000,  whether  in 
respect of any Financing or any other secured financing (the “Existing Encumbrance Cap”).  For 
the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, on the Cap Expiration Date, the 
Existing Encumbrance Cap set forth in the preceding sentence and the Special Encumbrance Cap set 
forth in Section 8.6(g)(i) shall terminate.”
B.  Section 8.6 of the Amended and Restated Agreement is hereby amended by inserting the following as a
new Section 8.6(g):
“(g)
(i)
Commencing on the Second Amendment Effective Date and ending on the Cap 
Expiration Date (the “Special Encumbrance Period”), the Vendor and/or any of 
its Affiliates may incur Encumbrances against the assets of the Milligan Project, 
which  Encumbrances  are  senior  to  or  pari  passu  with  the  liens  granted  to  the 
Purchaser under the Security Agreements, and such Encumbrances will not be 
subject to the Existing Encumbrance Cap, provided that (A) such Encumbrances 
(x) secure hedging obligations of the Vendor or any of its Affiliates incurred in 
connection with (a) gold and copper production solely from the Milligan Project 
or (b) foreign currency exchange risk relating solely to the Milligan Project or (y) 
secure one or more corporate credit facility(ies) provided to the Vendor or any of 
its Affiliates, the proceeds of which are utilized by Vendor solely in connection
3
with the Milligan Project and (B) the aggregate amount of the obligations secured 
by such Encumbrances does not exceed the Special Encumbrance Cap at any given 
time  during  the  Special  Encumbrance  Period.  “Special  Encumbrance  Cap” 
means: (1) from and after the Second Amendment Effective Date, $25,000,000, 
and, (2) from and after the Determination Date, $50,000,000.  For avoidance of 
doubt, the cumulative Special Encumbrance Cap shall not exceed $50,000,000.
As soon as practicable after the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with 
the first calendar quarter ending after the Second Amendment Effective Date and 
ending on the Determination Date (as defined below), the Vendor shall provide to 
the  Purchaser  a  report  summarizing  the  average  daily  mill  throughput  at  the 
Milligan Facilities and the average daily gold metallurgical recovery rate, in each 
case, for the calendar quarter just completed (the “Throughput and Recovery 
Report”). 
If the Throughput and Recovery Report appears to evidence the satisfaction of the 
Gold Recovery Condition and the Throughput Condition for the applicable calendar 
quarter, then, within five Business Days following its receipt of the Throughput 
and  Recovery  Report  (the  “Response  Period”),  the  Purchaser  shall  (acting 
reasonably) notify the Vendor that it accepts or rejects the Throughput and Recovery 
Report. If the Purchaser rejects the Throughput and Recovery Report or any aspect 
thereof, the Purchaser, acting in good faith, shall discuss its objections with the 
Vendor in a bona fide effort to resolve such objections within five Business Days 
after the expiration of the Response Period. A failure of the Purchaser to notify the 
Vendor by the expiration of the Response Period that it rejects the Throughput and 
Recovery Report or any aspect thereof shall be construed as an acceptance of the 
Throughput and Recovery Report.  Effective as of the earlier of (A) the Purchaser’s 
acceptance  of  the Throughput  and  Recovery  Report,  (B)  the  expiration  of  the 
Response Period, during which period the Purchaser fails to notify the Vendor that 
it rejects the Throughput and Recovery Report, and (C) the date on which the 
Vendor and the Purchaser resolve any objections of the Purchaser with respect to 
the Throughput and Recovery Report and agree that it evidences the satisfaction 
of the Gold Recovery Condition and the Throughput Condition (such date, the 
“Determination  Date”),  the  Special  Encumbrance  Cap  shall  be  increased  to 
$50,000,000, and no additional Throughput and Recovery Reports will be required 
from the Vendor. For avoidance of doubt, if the Purchaser rejects the Throughput 
and Recovery Report or any aspect thereof prior to the expiration of the Response 
Period, the Determination Date shall not occur unless and until the Vendor and the 
Purchaser  have  resolved  any  objections  of  the  Purchaser  with  respect  to  the 
Throughput and Recovery Report and agree that it evidences the satisfaction of the 
Gold Recovery Condition and the Throughput Condition.
If the Determination Date does not occur, then the Special Encumbrance Cap will 
remain at $25,000,000, and the Vendor will submit a Throughput and Recovery 
Report for the following quarter(s) until the Determination Date.
(ii)

“The Lessee shall throughout the relevant Lease Period pay or procure payment of, and without

(4) years, as specified in the applicable Lease Contract, from and including the Start Date and 
terminating either five (5) years or four (4) years, as specified in the applicable Lease Contract,

Date, the Tranche(cid:160)C Maturity Date or the Tranche(cid:160)D Maturity Date, as applicable. With the 
consent of the Lessee, availability under a Tranche may be terminated with the unused balance 
of that Tranche added to the next succeeding Tranche for all purposes hereof.”
2.7
Section(cid:160)10.4 of the Original Agreement is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following:
“Each Lease Payment shall have an additional charge added thereto on the Due Date therefor. 
Such additional charge shall be equal to the amount of interest that would be payable on such
Lease Payment on the basis that the interest rate applicable to all outstanding Lease Payments 
was either i)(cid:160)ninety (90) day LIBOR plus 3.45% per annum (3.65% per annum in respect of 
the Tranche(cid:160)D Facility) where LIBOR is determined on the applicable Start Date in respect 
of the first Lease Payment payable under the relevant Lease and for each subsequent Lease 
Payment on each Due Date following such Start Date; or ii)(cid:160)the CDOR(cid:160)Rate in respect of 
90(cid:160)day  bankers’  acceptances  plus  3.90%  per  annum  (4.10%  per  annum  in  respect  of  the 
Tranche(cid:160)D Facility) where the CDOR(cid:160)Rate is determined on the applicable Start Date in respect 
of the first Lease Payment payable under the relevant Lease and for each subsequent Lease 
Payment on each Due Date following such Start Date. Said additional charge shall accrue 
from day to day and shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in 
a year of 360(cid:160)days, in respect of an additional charge based on LIBOR and a year of 365(cid:160)days 
or the actual number of days in the year in respect of an additional charge based on the 
CDOR(cid:160)Rate.
At the time of execution of each Lease, the Lessor shall furnish to the Lessee an indicative 
amortization schedule for the entire Lease Period showing payments of (i)(cid:160)Lease Payments; 
(ii)(cid:160)the Upfront Payment, if any; (iii)(cid:160)the additional charge set forth above, based on LIBOR 
or on the CDOR(cid:160)Rate in respect of the Start Date; and (iv)(cid:160)all applicable Taxes. The payments 
of the Price and thus the amortization schedule shall be amended for each ninety (90)(cid:160)day 
period to reflect increases or decreases to LIBOR or the CDOR(cid:160)Rate, as applicable, and thus 
the applicable additional charge, without the Lessor being under any obligation to provide a 
new amortization schedule to the Lessee. Any such adjustment to the additional charge, if not 
made on the applicable Due Date, shall be paid by or credited to the Lessee on the following 
Due Date.
The Lessee may, twenty (20)(cid:160)days prior to the issue of any Utilisation Notice to the Lessor, 
request in writing that the Lessor furnish it with a quotation for the additional charge described 
in this Section(cid:160)10.4 as a function not of LIBOR or the CDOR(cid:160)Rate but rather Lessor’s Fixed 
Rate. Within five (5)(cid:160)Business Days, Lessor shall furnish Lessee with a quotation for the 
additional charge for the entire term of the applicable Lease Period in USD(cid:160)or C$, as requested 
by the Lessee. If Lessee accepts such quotation, its Utilisation Notice shall reflect the quotation 
based on the Lessor’s Fixed Rate for the Lease Period, with the Lease Payments reflecting 
five (5) or four (4) year amortization and twenty (20) or sixteen (16), as specified in the Lease 
Contract, equal consecutive quarterly blended payments of principal and interest. Prepayment 
of any Lease in which the additional amount is calculated by reference to the Lessor’s Fixed 
Rate shall be subject to payment of an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the then outstanding 
principal balance under the Lease during the first (1st)(cid:160)year thereof, four percent (4%) thereof 
in the second (2nd)(cid:160)year, three percent (3%) in the third (3rd)(cid:160)year, two percent (2%) in the 
fourth (4th)(cid:160)year and, for a five (5) year term, one percent (1%) in the fifth (5th) year thereof, 
all as a genuine pre estimate of damages and not as a penalty.
If, prior to the first (1st)(cid:160)day of any Lease Period, Lessor shall determine in good faith (which 
determination shall be certified by the Lessor to the Lessee and conclusive and binding upon 
the Lessee) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, (i)(cid:160)adequate and 
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR or the CDOR(cid:160)Rate for such Lease 
Period; or (ii)(cid:160)the additional charge calculated hereinabove by reference to LIBOR or the 
CDOR(cid:160)Rate for such Lease Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lessor 
(in  reasonable  detail  by  Lessor)  of  making  or  maintaining  its  affected  Leases  with  such 
additional charge, Lessor shall notify Lessee as soon as practicable and furnish Lessee with 
a quotation in reasonable detail for the said additional charge based on the Lessor’s cost of 
funds plus 3.45%(cid:160)per annum (3.65% per annum in respect of the Tranche(cid:160)D Facility). Lessor 
shall, together with that quotation, provide written evidence of the increased cost of funds to 
the Lessee and, within the forty five (45)(cid:160)days following the delivery of such quotation, the 
parties shall negotiate an annual rate to apply within the aforesaid market disruption period. 
In the absence of agreement, Lessor’s quotation shall remain in effect until the termination of 
the circumstances causing the said market disruption and if the Lessee is dissatisfied with that 
rate, its sole recourse is to not enter into the Lease Contract in question or to prepay, without 
interest or penalty, the affected Lease.”
2.8
Section(cid:160)18.6 is added as follows:
“The  Lessor  may  apply  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  the  Equipment,  either  returned  or 
repossessed, or any other proceeds or recovery regarding the Equipment owned by the Lessor 
to the payment of all existing and future indebtedness, liability and obligations of the Lessee 
to  the  Lessor  pursuant  to  the  Master Agreement,  any  Lease  Contract  or  any  other  Lease 
Document.”
2.9
Section(cid:160)35 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended by striking the first clause of the first line and replacing the

the cure period.
AGREEMENT TO EMPLOY
2.  Thompson Creek agrees to employ the Executive in connection with the Business on the terms and

represents that Executive is entering into this Agreement voluntarily and that Executive’s employment

bound or any legal duty that the Executive owes or may owe to another.
TERM
3.  The term of this Agreement and the Executive’s Employment shall commence on the date hereof and 
terminate on the third anniversary of the date hereof; provided, however, that commencing on the third 
anniversary of the date hereof, and on each anniversary thereafter, the term of this Agreement will 
automatically be extended for one additional year unless not later than 180 days prior to the expiration 
of the current term, Thompson Creek has given written notice to the Executive that it does not wish to 
extend this Agreement and provided further that:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
Thompson Creek may terminate this Agreement and the Executive’s Employment at any time 
as set out in paragraphs 15 (With Cause), 16 (Without Cause) and 19 (Disability) hereof;
the Executive may terminate this Agreement and the Executive’s Employment at any time as 
set out in paragraph 18 (Resignation/Retirement) hereof;
Thompson Creek or the Executive may terminate this Agreement and the Executive’s

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
4.  The Executive shall serve as Vice President, Human Resources and HR Systems and shall perform 
such duties and assume such responsibilities inherent in and consonant with Executive’s position as an 
executive  of  Thompson  Creek,  and  further  will  perform  such  reasonable  additional  duties  and 
responsibilities as the Chief Executive Officer may require and assign to Executive including serving as 
an officer of Affiliates, including the Parent, of Thompson Creek at no additional compensation.  The 
Executive shall report to the Chief Executive Officer of Thompson Creek.  The Executive’s regular place

CONFLICT OF INTEREST/DUTY OF LOYALTY
6.
(a)  The  Executive  agrees  to  devote  all  of  Executive’s  working  time  during  Executive’s 
Employment to the Business and shall not engage or have an interest in any other enterprise,

occupation or profession, directly or indirectly, or become a principal, agent, director, officer or 
employee of another company, firm or Person, as applicable, which will or may interfere with or 
conflict with the Executive’s duties and responsibilities hereunder without the written approval, 
not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Chief Executive Officer.
(b)
If Thompson Creek determines that the Executive is in breach of this provision and such 
breach is capable of cure, it shall provide written notice of the breach and afford the Executive 
10 days to cure the breach.  Failure by the Executive to cure the breach within such 10-day 
period shall constitute Cause for Termination of the Executive’s Employment.  In the event 
of breach not capable of cure, the breach by the Executive of this provision shall constitute 
immediate grounds for Termination of the Executive’s Employment for Cause.
CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-SOLICITATION
7.
(a)  The Executive agrees to keep the affairs of the Business, financial and otherwise, strictly 
confidential and shall not disclose the same to any Person, company or firm, directly or indirectly, 
during or after Executive’s Employment by Thompson Creek except as reasonably necessary 
to carry out Executive’s Employment duties or as otherwise authorized in writing by the Chief 
Executive Officer or the Board or an authorized committee thereof.  The Executive agrees not 
to use such information, directly or indirectly, for Executive’s own interests, or any interests other 
than those of the Business, whether or not those interests conflict with the interests of the 
Business, during or after Executive’s Employment by Thompson Creek.  The Executive agrees 
that  all  trade  secrets,  trade  names,  financial  information,  client  information,  client  files  and 
processing and marketing techniques, mineral properties, mineral exploration data or information 
or mining or exploration proposals relating to the Business or disclosed to the Executive in the 
course of Executive’s Employment shall become, on execution of this Agreement, and shall be 
thereafter, as the case may be, the sole property of Thompson Creek whether arising before or 
after the execution of this Agreement.
(b)
The Executive covenants and agrees with Thompson Creek that he will not, at any time 
during the term of this Agreement and for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter, 
without the prior written consent of Thompson Creek, either directly or indirectly solicit (for 
the  purposes  of  enticing  away  from Thompson  Creek  or  its Affiliates),  interfere  with  or 
endeavor to entice away from Thompson Creek or its Affiliates any customer, supplier or 
employee of or consultant to Thompson Creek or its Affiliates.
REMUNERATION
8.
The Executive shall be remunerated as follows during the term of this Agreement:
(a)
(b)
(c)
initial base salary of US $235,000 per annum payable bi-weekly which shall be reviewed 
annually by the Board but in any event shall not be less than the previous year’s base salary;
all benefits generally provided to executives of Thompson Creek effective as of the date of 
this Agreement, or such other benefits that may be generally provided to executives of 
Thompson Creek from time to time on terms determined by the Board or its designee, subject 
to the regular eligibility requirements with respect to each of such benefit plans or programs; 
and
four (4) weeks of vacation earned each year (hereinafter referred to as a “Vacation Year”).  
Such amount shall be prorated for the Executive’s first partial year of Employment; thereafter, 
the Executive’s Vacation Year shall commence on January 1 and end on December 31 of 
the same year.  Vacation must be taken in the Vacation Year in which it is earned.  If less 
than two weeks of vacation are taken in any Vacation Year, then two weeks of unused
5
vacation time from that Vacation Year shall be carried forward into the next Vacation Year; 
provided,  however,  Executive  shall  never  have  more  than  six  (6)  weeks  of  vacation  in 
Executive’s vacation bank.  All other unused vacation shall be forfeited.  Executive shall be 
paid upon Termination of Employment for any unused vacation then existing in Executive’s 
vacation bank, but shall not be paid for vacation that was previously forfeited.
9. 
The Executive shall be eligible to participate in the Parent’s performance bonus plan, as in effect 
from time to time, at the sole discretion of the Parent; provided, however, that if there is a bonus awarded 
for 2014, Executive’s bonus payment will be pro-rated from date of employment.
10. 
The Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Parent’s long term incentive plan, as in effect 
from time to time.  The Executive may be granted from time to time, at the sole discretion of the Board, any 
form of compensation permitted under such plan.
12. 
applicable, including without limitation for income and payroll taxes.
All payments required to be made under this Agreement are subject to statutory deductions, as
13.
(a)
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if (i) on the date of
Termination of Executive’s Employment with Thompson Creek, any of the Parent’s stock is 
publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise (within the meaning of Code 
section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i)), and (ii) as a result of such Termination, Executive would receive 
any payment under this Agreement that, absent the application of this provision, would be 
subject  to  additional  tax  imposed  pursuant  to  Code  section  409A(a)  as  a  result  of  the 
application of Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), then such payment shall be payable on the 
date that is the earliest of (x) six (6) months after Executive’s Termination date, (y) Executive’s 
death or (z) such other date as will not result in such payment being subject to Code section 
409A sanctions.
(b)
It is the intention of the Parties that payments or benefits payable under this Agreement not 
be subject to the additional tax imposed pursuant to Code section 409A.  Each amount to 
be paid or benefit to be provided to Executive shall be construed as a separate payment 
for purposes of Code section 409A to the fullest extent permitted therein.  To the extent such 
potential payments or benefits could become subject to such section, Thompson Creek shall 
cooperate to amend the Agreement with the goal of giving the Executive the applicable 
economic  benefits  in  a  manner  that  does  not  result  in  such  sanctions  being  imposed.  
Thompson Creek does not guarantee or warrant that such cooperation will result in such 
sanctions not being imposed.
(c)
Except  as  otherwise  permitted  under  Code  section  409A,  Thompson  Creek  shall  not 
accelerate or defer any payment under this Agreement.
REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES
14. 
All  the  Executive’s  reasonable  expenses  related  to  the  Business  approved  in  accordance  with 
Policies  will  be  reimbursed  upon  the  submittal  by  the  Executive  of  an  expense  report  with  appropriate 
supporting documentation to Thompson Creek.
TERMINATION BY EMPLOYER WITH CAUSE
This Agreement and the Executive’s Employment may be terminated by Thompson Creek summarily 
15. 
and without notice, and without payment of any performance bonus, Without Cause Payment, Change of 
Control Payment, benefits, damages or any other sums or payments whatsoever, except for unused vacation 
as provided in paragraph 8 and except as otherwise required by law, in the event that there is Cause for 
Termination of the Executive’s Employment.
6
TERMINATION BY EMPLOYER WITHOUT CAUSE
16.
Despite the Term of this Agreement and the Executive’s Employment set forth in paragraph 3:
(a)
(b)
(c)
This Agreement and the Executive’s Employment may be terminated without Cause on 
notice by Thompson Creek to the Executive, in which case Thompson Creek shall pay the 
Executive, within sixty days of the Executive’s Termination:  a lump sum equal to 12  months’  
base salary (the “Without Cause Payment”) in effect on the date that the notice of Termination 
is given (“Notice Date”); plus accrued but unused vacation as of the Notice Date; plus a 
lump sum equivalent of 12 multiplied by the last monthly premium amount that Thompson 
Creek paid on the Executive’s behalf for long-term disability insurance before the Termination 
of the Executive’s Employment.  The Executive shall also be paid a pro-rated bonus with 
respect to the year of Termination if a bonus otherwise would have been awarded to the 
Executive had the Executive remained employed, with payment to be made at the time the 
bonus  would  have  been  paid  to  Executive  had  the  Executive  remained  employed.   All 
amounts paid by Thompson Creek hereunder shall be less required withholdings.
Upon Termination of the Executive’s Employment pursuant to this paragraph 16, Executive 
shall be entitled to elect to continue coverage for himself (and Executive’s eligible dependents 
who were receiving coverage immediately prior to Termination), for up to  12 months following 
Employment Termination, under the medical and dental plans of Thompson Creek in which 
Executive was participating immediately prior to such Employment Termination.  Executive’s 
cost for such coverage shall be the applicable COBRA premium for such coverage.  Following 
Thompson Creek's administrative procedures for COBRA, Thompson Creek shall pay  the 
Executive's monthly COBRA premium directly to Thompson Creek's COBRA administrator 
for up to 12 months. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that Executive’s 
right  to  elect  COBRA  coverage  is  not  subject  to  execution  of  a  release.   The  monthly 
payments  and  coverage  described  in  this  paragraph  shall  cease  upon  the  Executive’s 
obtaining  or  being  eligible  to  obtain  alternate  coverage  under  the  terms  of  any  new 
employment.
If the Executive elects to convert the life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance 
policy to an individual policy upon Termination of Employment pursuant to this paragraph 
16, Thompson Creek shall pay to the Executive, by the end of each month, the Executive’s 
cost to continue such individual policy, so long as the Executive maintains the individual 
policy and provides proof of each monthly payment to Thompson Creek, but in no event 
shall Thompson Creek pay such amount to Executive beyond the  first anniversary of the 
Executive’s Termination date.
(d)
The Executive shall only be paid the payments provided for in this paragraph 16 if the 
Executive has signed a general release of claims in a form satisfactory to Thompson Creek, 
similar to the form of general release attached hereto as Exhibit A.  If the Executive does 
not sign a general release within 60 days of Termination of Employment, no payments shall 
vest and no payments shall be made to Executive pursuant to this paragraph 16.
(e)
Notwithstanding paragraph 17, if the Executive receives the payments provided for in this 
paragraph 16, the Executive is not entitled to any payments pursuant to paragraph 17.
7
CHANGE OF CONTROL
17.
(a) 
If at any time during the term of this Agreement there is a Change of Control and 
within 12 months after such Change of Control (or in anticipation of a Change of Control), 
Thompson Creek gives written notice of termination of this Agreement and the Executive’s 
Employment for any reason other than Cause, or a Triggering Event occurs and the Executive 
elects to terminate this Agreement and Executive’s Employment by providing Thompson 
Creek with written notice which Termination shall be effective on any date that the Executive 
provides in the written notice to Thompson Creek in accordance with the procedure set forth 
in the definition of Triggering Event (provided such date is within 12 months  after such 
Change  of  Control),  then  the  Executive  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  what  is  set  forth  in 
paragraph (b) below.
(b)
Subject to paragraph (a) above, upon Termination of Executive’s Employment pursuant to 
this paragraph 17, the Executive shall be entitled to receive from Thompson Creek the 
following:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
within sixty (60) days of Termination of the Executive’s Employment, a lump sum 
equal to  24 months’  base salary in effect on the date of the Executive’s Termination 
(the “Change of Control Payment”); plus any unused vacation then existing in the 
Executive’s vacation bank upon Termination of Employment, but the Executive shall 
not be paid for vacation that was previously forfeited; plus a lump sum equivalent 
to 24 multiplied by the last monthly premium amount that Thompson Creek paid on 
the Executive’s behalf for long-term disability insurance before the Termination of 
the Executive’s Employment, all amounts of which are less required withholdings.
a lump sum equal to 2 times the Executive’s target bonus in effect for the year of 
Termination if a bonus otherwise would have been awarded to the Executive had 
the Executive remained employed, with payment to be made at the time the bonus 
would have been paid to Executive had the Executive remained employed, less 
required withholdings.
Executive shall be entitled to elect to continue coverage for the Executive (and 
Executive’s eligible dependents who were receiving coverage immediately prior to 
Termination), for up to  24 months following Employment Termination, under the 
medical and dental plans of Thompson Creek in which Executive was participating 
immediately  prior  to  such  Employment  Termination.    Executive’s  cost  for  such 
coverage shall be (i) the applicable COBRA premium for such coverage (which cost 
shall be applicable during the eighteen (18) month period following Termination) 
and (ii) the monthly cost determined by Thompson Creek for Executive’s coverage 
(which cost shall be applicable following expiration of the 18 month COBRA period).  
Thompson  Creek  shall  pay  to  Executive  at  the  end  of  each  applicable  month 
following Termination, an amount in a lump sum equal to the Executive’s monthly 
cost for all such coverage (based upon the rates in effect on the date of Termination, 
reduced by the applicable monthly premium paid by active employees).  For the 
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge that Executive’s right to elect COBRA 
coverage  is not subject to execution  of a release.  The monthly payments  and 
coverage described in this paragraph shall cease upon the Executive’s obtaining 
or  being  eligible  to  obtain  alternate  coverage  under  the  terms  of  any  new 
employment.
(iv)
If the Executive elects to convert the life and accidental death and dismemberment 
insurance policy to an individual policy upon Termination of Employment pursuant 
to this paragraph 17, Thompson Creek shall pay to the Executive, by the end of 
each month, the Executive’s cost to continue such individual policy, so long as the
8
Executive  maintains  the  individual  policy  and  provides  proof  of  each  monthly 
payment to Thompson Creek, but in no event shall Thompson Creek pay such 
amount to Executive beyond the  second anniversary of the Executive’s Termination 
date.
(v)
The Executive shall only be paid the payments provided for in this paragraph 17 if 
the  Executive  has  signed  a  general  release  of  claims  in  a  form  satisfactory  to 
Thompson Creek, similar to the form of general release attached hereto as Exhibit 
A.  If the Executive does not sign a general release within 60 days of Termination 
of Employment, payment shall not vest and shall not be paid to Executive and no 
payments shall be made pursuant to this paragraph 17.
(vi)
Notwithstanding paragraph 16, if the Executive receives the payments provided for 
in this paragraph 17, the Executive is not entitled to any payments pursuant to 
paragraph 16.
RESIGNATION/RETIREMENT
18.  
Subject to paragraph 17, this Agreement and the Executive’s Employment may be terminated on 
notice by the Executive to Thompson Creek by giving ninety (90) days’ written notice.  Should the Executive 
terminate this Agreement and Executive’s Employment, the Executive shall not be entitled to any performance 
bonus, Without Cause Payment, Change of Control Payment, benefits, damages or any other payments or 
sums whatsoever, except for unused vacation as provided in paragraph 8, as may be provided pursuant to 
Thompson Creek or the Parent’s bonus program, and except as otherwise required by law; provided, however, 
that  should  the  Executive  terminate  this Agreement  and  the  Executive’s  Employment  pursuant  to  this 
paragraph 18, Thompson Creek in its sole discretion may designate an effective date of the Executive’s 
Termination of Employment earlier than the 90th day and shall pay the Executive the equivalent number of 
days base salary in lieu of notice.  Such amount shall be payable upon Thompson Creek’s next regularly 
scheduled payday.
DISABILITY
19. 
If the Executive suffers a physical or mental impairment that renders the Executive unable to perform 
the essential functions of the Executive’s position, Thompson Creek may deem Executive’s Employment 
and this Agreement to have been Terminated, consistent with applicable law.  The Executive’s eligibility for 
long-term disability and other such benefits, if any, will be determined pursuant to the applicable benefit plans 
or programs and/or applicable law.  The Executive shall be paid for any unused vacation pursuant to paragraph 
8.  The Executive shall also be paid a pro-rated bonus with respect to the year of Termination, if a bonus 
otherwise would have been awarded to the Executive had the Executive remained employed, with payment 
to be made at the time the bonus would have been paid to Executive had the Executive remained employed.
9
DEATH
20. 
Should this Agreement and the Executive’s Employment Terminate by virtue of the Executive’s death, 
a pro-rated bonus shall be paid to the Executive’s beneficiary, as designated by the Executive, if a bonus 
otherwise would have been awarded to the Executive had the Executive not died, with payment to be made 
at the time the bonus would have been paid to Executive had the Executive remained employed.  The only 
other payments due to the Executive’s beneficiary shall be for any earned compensation and any unused 
vacation and as otherwise required by law.
COOPERATION WITH RESPECT TO INVESTIGATIONS, CLAIMS OR LITIGATION.
21. 
During Executive’s employment and at all times thereafter, should Thompson Creek become involved 
in any investigation, claim or litigation relating to or arising out of Executive’s past, present, or future duties 
with Thompson Creek or with respect to any matters of which Executive has knowledge, Executive agrees 
to fully, truthfully and in good faith, cooperate with Thompson Creek with respect to such investigation, claim 
or litigation.  Subject to the provisions of applicable law, and provided that such investigation, claim or litigation 
is not the result of the Executive engaging in business practices which qualify as Cause under this Agreement, 
Thompson Creek shall reimburse Executive for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred to provide such 
cooperation, and shall provide hourly compensation at a rate not to exceed the equivalent hourly rate of 
Executive’s base salary at Termination for each hour of Executive’s time spent in such cooperation not 
including travel.
DETERMINATION OF BENEFITS UNDER CODE SECTION 280G
In the event that any payment or benefits received or to be received by Executive pursuant to this 
22. 
Agreement ("Benefits") would (a) constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Code section 280G, 
and (b) but for this subsection, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Code section 4999, or any 
comparable successor provisions (the "Excise Tax"), then the Benefits shall be either: (i) provided to Executive 
in full, or (ii) provided to Executive as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such Benefits 
being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, when taking into account applicable 
federal, state, local and foreign income and employment taxes, the Excise Tax, and any other applicable 
taxes,  results  in  the  receipt  by  Executive,  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  the  greatest  amount  of  Benefits, 
notwithstanding that all or some portion of such Benefits may be taxable under the Excise Tax.  To the extent 
Benefits need to be reduced pursuant to the preceding sentence, reductions shall come from taxable amounts 
before  non-taxable  amounts  and  beginning  with  the  payments  otherwise  scheduled  to  occur  soonest.  
Executive agrees to cooperate fully with Thompson Creek to determine the benefits applicable under this 
paragraph.
SEVERABILITY
23. 
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the validity or 
enforceability of any other provision, and any invalid provision will be modified to the extent necessary to 
make it enforceable, or if not possible, will be severed from this Agreement.
GOVERNING LAW

RECOURSE ON BREACH
The Executive acknowledges that damages would be an insufficient remedy for a breach of this 
26. 
Agreement and agrees that Thompson Creek and the Parent may apply for and obtain any relief available 
to it in a court of law or equity, including injunctive relief, to restrain breach or threat of breach of this Agreement

enforcement  of  this  Agreement  by  Thompson  Creek  and  the  Parent.    Furthermore,  the  Executive 
acknowledges and agrees that the Executive’s obligations to Thompson Creek and its Affiliates, including 
the Parent, under this Agreement are material to Thompson Creek’s willingness to provide Termination and 
other benefits to the Executive and, without prejudice to any other rights Thompson Creek and the Parent

EXHIBIT A
CONFIDENTIAL WAIVER AND RELEASE AGREEMENT
This Confidential Waiver and Release Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between
[INSERT NAME OF OFFICER] ("Executive") and Thompson Creek Metals Company USA ("Thompson 
Creek").  For the purpose of this Agreement, the term “Thompson Creek” includes any company or 
affiliate related to Thompson Creek Metals Company USA, in the past or present, including but not limited 
to Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc.; the past and present officers, directors, executives, 
employees, shareholders, attorneys, agents and representatives of Thompson Creek; any present or past 
executive or employee benefit plan sponsored by Thompson Creek and/or the officers, directors, trustees, 
administrators, executives, employees, attorneys, agents and representatives of such plan; and any 
person who acted on behalf of Thompson Creek or on instruction from Thompson Creek.
Executive and Thompson Creek agree as follows:
Executive's Termination of Employment.  Executive’s employment with Thompson
Creek was terminated effective __________, 20__.
1.
2.
Executive’s Continuing Obligations to Thompson Creek and Agreement Not to
Disparage Thompson Creek.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive has, and will abide 
by, continuing obligations to Thompson Creek, including the obligations set forth in Executive’s 
Employment Agreement.
Executive further acknowledges and agrees that by reason of Executive’s position with 
Thompson Creek, Executive was given access to confidential information, including trade secret 
information, with respect to the business affairs of Thompson Creek.  Executive represents that Executive 
has held all such information confidential and will continue to do so.  Executive has not retained any 
confidential information or documents, including but not limited to trade secret information, obtained as a 
result of or in connection with Executive’s employment.  Further, Executive will not defame, slander or 
otherwise disparage Thompson Creek, its business, or its representatives.
3.
Consideration for Executive.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that Thompson
Creek has paid Executive all amounts, and has provided Executive with all benefits, to which Executive is 
entitled through and including the date that Executive executes this Agreement, and that Executive is not 
entitled to any further payments or benefits, other than as set forth below.
Thompson Creek will provide Executive with the following additional specified items as
consideration in exchange for this Agreement, including Executive’s waiver and release of Thompson 
Creek:
(a)
(b)
Upon Executive’s execution of this Agreement and upon expiration of the time period for 
revocation set forth in paragraph 11(e) below, Thompson Creek will provide Executive 
with:  [set forth applicable consideration provided for in the Employment 
Agreement, depending on the nature of Executive’s termination (e.g., retirement, 
without cause, change of control, etc.)]
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if (i) on the date of termination of 
Executive’s employment with Thompson Creek, any of Thompson Creek’s stock is 
publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise (within the meaning of 
U.S. Internal Revenue Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i)), and (ii) as a result of such 
termination, Executive would receive any payment under this Agreement that, absent the 
application of this provision, would be subject to additional tax imposed pursuant to 
section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of 
the Code, then such payment shall be payable on the date that is the earliest of (i) six (6)
14
(c)
(d)
(e)
months after Executive’s termination date, (ii) Executive’s death or (iii) such other date as 
will not result in such payment being subject to Code section 409A sanctions.
It is the intention of the parties that payments or benefits payable under this Agreement 
not be subject to the additional tax imposed pursuant to section 409A of the Code.  To the 
extent such potential payments or benefits could become subject to such section, 
Thompson Creek shall cooperate to amend the Agreement with the goal of giving the 
Executive the applicable economic benefits in a manner that does not result in such 
sanctions being imposed.  Thompson Creek does not guarantee or warrant that such 
cooperation will result in such sanctions not being imposed.
Except as otherwise permitted under Code section 409A, Thompson Creek shall not 
accelerate or defer any payment under this Agreement.
Executive will indemnify and hold Thompson Creek harmless from any costs, liability or 
expense, including reasonable attorney's fees, arising from the taxation, if any, of any 
amounts received by Executive pursuant to this Agreement, including but not limited to 
any penalties or administrative expenses.
4.
Executive Waiver and Release of Thompson Creek.  In exchange for the consideration
set forth in this Agreement, Executive, and Executive’s representatives, successors and assigns, waive, 
release and forever discharge Thompson Creek from any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, 
obligations, rights and causes of action, whether known or unknown, including but not limited to, all 
claims, causes of action or administrative complaints that Executive now has or has ever had against 
Thompson Creek relating in any way to Executive’s employment or termination of employment with 
Thompson Creek.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing terms, the scope of Executive’s waiver and release
under the Agreement specifically includes but is not limited to: any and all claims for breach of contract 
and any other claim under the common law, including but not limited to claims for tort, breach of implied 
contract, wrongful discharge, breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional infliction of 
emotional distress, or defamation; any and all claims under any state or local statutory or common law, 
including but not limited to claims under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act; any and all claims under

applicable law; (b) receive any benefits in which Executive may have vested in under any retirement plan; 
(c) make any claim for unemployment benefits; (d) make any claim relating to the validity of this 
Agreement under the ADEA as amended by the OWBPA (however, nothing in this Agreement is intended 
to reflect any party’s belief that the waiver of Executive's claims under the ADEA is invalid or 
unenforceable, it being the intent of the parties that such claims are waived); (e) file an administrative
15
charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) (however, Executive agrees that 
Executive will not be entitled to any further recovery of any kind from Thompson Creek in the event the 
EEOC or any other administrative agency pursues a claim on Executive's behalf or arising out of 
Executive's administrative charge); (f) to make any claim under workers’ compensation; or (g) to make 
any other claim that cannot be released by law.

and will not communicate the terms of this Agreement, the facts or circumstances giving rise to this 
Agreement, or the fact that such Agreement exists, to any third party except, as necessary, Executive’s 
immediate family, accountants, or legal or financial advisors, provided that they agree to be bound by this 
paragraph 6, or otherwise as required by law or court order.
7.
Enforcement.  In the event that there has been a breach of any provisions of this
Agreement by Executive, Thompson Creek will be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorneys' 
fees in any legal proceeding to enforce this Agreement.

jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this 
Agreement, which shall be fully severable, and given full force and effect.
9.
Governing Law and Venue.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Colorado.  Any dispute regarding, relating to or arising under this Agreement or the 
facts giving rise to the Agreement shall be litigated in Colorado, and Executive expressly agrees to the 
personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Colorado.
10.
Entire Agreement.  Thompson Creek and Executive understand and agree that this
Agreement contains all the agreements between Thompson Creek and Executive relating to Executive’s 
employment and termination of employment with Thompson Creek, other than the continuing obligations 
set forth in the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement.
11.
Acknowledgements.  Executive specifically acknowledges and agrees that by entering
into this Agreement and in exchange for the consideration described in paragraph 3 above to which 
Executive otherwise would not be entitled, Executive is waiving and releasing any and all rights and 
claims that Executive may have arising from the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, 
which have arisen on or before the date of execution of this Agreement.

EXECUTIVE IS HEREBY ADVISED IN WRITING BY THIS AGREEMENT TO CONSULT 
WITH AN ATTORNEY BEFORE SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT.  EXECUTIVE

received it, to consider whether Executive wishes to sign this Agreement.  Executive
16

Mine Safety Disclosures
Exhibit(cid:160) 95
Employee and contractor safety is a fundamental priority for the Company at all of our mine sites.(cid:160) We have in place comprehensive safety programs that include 
extensive health and safety training for all employees and contractors, site inspections, emergency response preparedness, crisis communications training, 
incident investigation, regulatory compliance training and process auditing, as well as open dialogue among all levels of employees and contractors.(cid:160) Our goal is 
to achieve zero lost time and zero reportable injuries.(cid:160) We strive to eliminate exposure to hazards in the workplace, ensure that we comply with all mine safety 
regulations, and support regulatory and industry efforts to improve the health and safety of our employees and contractors along with the industry as a whole.
Our operations at the TC Mine are subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and 
Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”).(cid:160) Whenever the MSHA believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has 
occurred, it may issue a citation or order which describes the violation and fixes a time within which the operator must abate the violation. In some situations, 
such as when the MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to persons, MSHA may issue an order requiring cessation of operations, or removal of persons 
from the area of the mine, affected by the condition until the hazards are corrected. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it has authority to propose a civil 
penalty or fine, as a result of the violation, that the operator is ordered to pay.
Under rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, mine operators are required to include in their periodic reports 
filed with the SEC certain information relating to citations or orders issued under the Mine Act, and certain other mine safety information.(cid:160) The table that follows 
reflects citations, orders, violations and proposed assessments issued to the Company by MSHA during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 for the TC Mine 
and all legal actions pending before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission as of December 31, 2014. Due to timing and other factors, the data 
may not agree with the mine data retrieval system maintained by MSHA at www.MSHA.gov.
