Exhibit 99.1
Investor Presentation August 2016
Legal Disclaimers Forward-Looking Statements This presentation contains, and the officers and
representatives of the Partnership and its general partner may from time to time make, “forward–
looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.
These statement may include discussions about our: business strategy; acquisition strategy;
financing strategy; ability to make, maintain and grow distributions; the ability of our customers to
meet their drilling and development plans on a timely basis or at all and perform under gathering
and processing agreements; future operating results, including our forecast of Adjusted EBITDA
and Distributable Cash Flow; future capital expenditures; and plans, objectives, expectations,
forecasts, outlook and intentions. All of these types of statements, other than statements of
historical fact included in this presentation, are forward-looking statements. In some cases,
forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may,” “could,” “should,”
“expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,”
“pursue,” “target,” “continue,” the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. The
forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are largely based on our expectations,
which reflect estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and
assumptions reflect our best judgment based on currently known market conditions and other
factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are
inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control.
In addition, management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate.
Management cautions all readers that the forward-looking statements contained in this
presentation are not guarantees of future performance, and we cannot assure any reader that
such statements will be realized or the forward-looking events and circumstances will occur.
Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking
statements due to important factors listed in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) and elsewhere in those filings. The forward-looking statements speak only
as of the date made, and other than as required by law, we do not intend to publicly update or
revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons
acting on our behalf. Oil and Gas Reserves The SEC requires oil and gas companies, in filings
with the SEC, to disclose “proved oil and gas reserves” (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible) and permits oil and gas
companies to disclose “probable reserves” (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are as likely as not
to be recovered) and “possible reserves” (i.e., additional quantities of oil and gas that might be
recovered, but with a lower probability than probable reserves). Investors are urged to consider
closely the disclosure in Sanchez Production Partners’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most
recent fiscal year. 2 © 2016 Sanchez Production Partners LP

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures – Historic Financials:
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their
most comparable GAAP financial measure under Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures in this presentation. The reconciliations are only intended to be reviewed in
conjunction with the presentation to which they relate. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss)
adjusted by interest (income) expense, net, which includes interest expense, interest expense
net (gain) loss on interest rate derivative contacts and interest (income); income tax expense
(benefit); depreciation, depletion and amortization; asset impairments; and accretion expense.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted by (gain) loss on sale of assets; (gain) loss
from equity investment; unit-based compensation programs; unit-based asset management fees;
(gain) loss from mark-to-market activities; and (gain) loss on embedded derivative. Distributable
Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense; distributions on preferred
units; and maintenance capital expenditures. These financial measures are used as quantitative
standards by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as
investors, research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets without
regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; the ability of our assets to
generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness; and our operating
performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry,
without regard to financing or capital structure. These financial measures are not intended to
represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as a substitute for net income,
operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial
performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures – Forecast Financials: In addition to Adjusted EBITDA, we provide a forecast of
Distributable Cash Flow in this presentation. We are unable to reconcile our forecast range of
Adjusted EBITDA or Distributable Cash Flow to GAAP net income (loss), operating income or
net cash flow provided by operating activities because we do not predict the future impact of
adjustments to (i) net income (loss) for unit based compensation and asset management fees,
(gains) losses from mark-to-market activities and equity investments or asset impairments due to
the difficulty of doing so, or (ii) net cash flow provided by operating activities because this metric
includes the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities related to the timing of cash
receipts and disbursements that may not relate to the period in which the operating activities
occurred. Additionally, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable
reconciliation, in significant part due to ranges in our forecast impacted by changes in oil and
natural gas prices and reserves which affect certain reconciliation items. Summary of Non-GAAP

Appendix III Escalating Working Interest
From the Seller’s perspective, monetization of a portion of the well’s stable cash flow in an EWI
structure enhances realized rates of return and provides capital for redeployment in the asset
base In this example, the sale of the EWI results in: NPV $4.1 MM (unchanged) IRR 89% Eagle
Ford wells are characterized by fast payback during a period of steep decline followed by a
longer period of stable cash flow and low decline for the remaining life of the well Years 0 - 2 = ~
40% of production and 60% of present value Years 2+ = ~ 60% of production and 40% of present
value In this example, over the full life of the well the developer expects: NPV $4.1 MM IRR 67%
EWI Case Study: Repeatable “Win/Win” Structure(1) Typical Eagle Ford Well EWI – Seller’s
Perspective EWI – MLP Buyer’s Perspective (1) Assumes initial well cost of $4.5 MM; Three year
EWI sold in Year 2 at PV10; Flat price deck of $55/BBL and $3.50/MCFE; 25% NGL realization;
Catarina type curve EWI Seller Achieves Payback, Monetizes FCF For Redeployment, and
Enhances IRR EWI Buyer Achieves Stable Cash Flow, Which Supports Distributions PV10 CF
t=0 Mo. $4.1 MM From the MLP Buyer’s perspective, the purchase of an EWI, together with
hedging (at closing) of the resulting “levelized” production from the asset, provides stable cash
flow to support distributions over time while mitigating the need for maintenance capital 18 Cash

SPP Eagle Ford Acquisition Illustrated below, the SPP Eagle Ford Acquisition was structured to
offset natural production declines, minimize maintenance capital requirements, and maintain
more stable cash flows over the life of the asset for SPP The escalating working interests
acquired from SN are expected to “levelize” production to SPP in years one through five Hedges
covering a high percentage of production in years one through five, executed by SN, were
novated to SPP at closing Escalating Working Interest Purchased From SN By SPP SN Retains
