Corporate Strategy
Lake Resources’ mission has always been to develop a protitable minerals discovery
business, concentrating on the etlective use ol the geosciences and leveraging these skills
to make strategic investments To this end, our locus is on:
- Exploration in the most prospective areas tor worldeclass deposits that will attract
major mining companies as joint venture partners at an appropriate stage.
- Use at the most costeetlective practices and technologies including multispectral
satellite images, reprocessing and reinterpretation of existing databases and M~:-—-—- . .. -._ —
application of appropriate deposit models, - i - ‘ 4.9—“
- Formation of alliances with major mining companies lor exploration and development ‘ \ r
at the Company’s discoveries. r . 1 .v
. «It; ‘
- Development oia revenue stream comprising net smelter royalties and net prolits
interests when mining companies develop deposits discovered by us.
- Seed capital investments in other emerging resources sector companies.
The board considers that the corporate culture required for successtul mineral exploration is
signilicantly dilierent from the culture of the downstream businesses ol mining and ,
smelting,
Accordingly, Lake Resources does not place a high priority on becoming a miner.
preferring. instead, to retain royalty and net profits interests in its discoveries and to remain
locussed on its core business of mineral exploration.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Exploration Projects
Mineral exploration is an inherently risky undertaking. Typically, for every 
one thousand mineral occurrences investigated, only one hundred warrant 
drilling  and  of  these,  only  one  ultimately  proves  to  be  economically 
mineable.
Factors  that  influence  investment  decisions  for  scarce 
exploration  funds  include  geological  prospectivity, 
availability of geological, geophysical and exploration data, 
access  to  land,  sovereign  risk,  government  policies, 
infrastructure and competitive advantages.
From its incorporation in 1997, Lake concentrated its early efforts in                               
Pakistan and Sweden.  In 2004, the Company wound down exploration in                         
Sweden and shifted its focus to a promising new exploration play in Argentina, whilst   
continuing exploration in Pakistan.  In late 2005, work in Argentina was terminated to 
concentrate on the company’s more advanced copper and gold targets in Pakistan.

CHAGAI PROJECT
Lake  Resources  is  exploring  for  epithermal 
gold and porphyry copper-gold deposits in the 
Chagai region in western Balochistan through a 
joint venture with Colt Resources Middle East.
The  project  area  is  situated  in  the  Tethyan 
Magmatic  Arc  which  extends  from  Turkey 
through Iran into Pakistan.   Important mineral 
deposits  in  the  Arc  include  the  Reko  Diq 
porphyry copper-gold deposit and the Saindak 
copper-gold mine.

Exploration Licences
P A K I S T A N
Lake Resources began regional exploration in 
the Chagai region following the granting of a   
10 000 sq km Reconnaissance Licence (RL) in 
early  1998.    In  March  2000,  the  RL  was 
relinquished  and  four  Exploration  Licences 
(Els),  covering  920  sq  km,  were  granted  to 
Lake.   These ELs expired in March 2009 and 
were  replaced  with  three  new  ELs  that  were 
granted  for  a  period  of  three  years  and 
subsequently  renewed,  over  reduced  areas 
(approx. 50%) for a further period of three years 
to September 2015.
During 2014-15, the company entered into an Exclusivity Agreement and associated Shareholders 
Agreement and Share Subscription Agreement with Colt Resources Middle East (CRME) and Aamir 
Resources Consultants whereby CRME can earn a majority interest in the Chagai Project through 
exploration expenditure of US$1.9 million within 3 years and a further US$3.1 million within a 
further period of 3 years. Lake’s initial interest in the project is 27.5%, reducing to 15% equity or a 
10% carried interest if minimum exploration expenditure is met by the incoming parties under 
certain conditions.
Pursuant to these agreements, Lake Resources surrendered its three exploration licences and new 
exploration licences covering the same areas as the surrendered licences were granted to the 
Pakistan-incorporated operating entity, Chagai Resources (Pvt.) Limited for a period of 3 years, 
effective 12th June 2015.  Lake Resources’ interest in Chagai Resources is held though a wholly 
owned Pakistan-incorporated subsidiary, Lake Mining Pakistan (Pvt.) Limited.

A condition of the new licences is that the Balochistan Government should have up to a 25% interest in the licences – the government previously advised that preparation 
of a draft agreement was under way.
The Amalaf area adjoins the northern boundary 
of  the  Saindak  copper-gold  mine. 
  The 
exploration target is large tonnage - low grade 
copper amenable to low-cost open-pit mining 
and  trucking  to  the  adjacent  Saindak  mine 
operated  by  Chinese  company  Metallurgical 
Construction Corporation (MCC).  In 2005, one 
of  two  RC  percussion  holes  drilled  by  Lake 
intersected 
low-grade  copper-molybdenum 
(see previous annual reports for details).
The  Dasht-i-Gauran  area  is  situated  to  the 
west of copper mineralisation reported by TCC 
from drilling at its Sor Baroot Prospect at the 
Reko  Diq  Project,  and  covers  a  number  of 
possible  alteration  zones  identified  from 
interpretation of satellite images.
At Koh-i-Sultan, exploration targets are world-class copper and gold deposits associated with an 
extensive system of intensely altered breccia and volcanics on the margin of an extinct volcanic 
caldera.   Lake Resources undertook drilling programs in 2005, 2007-8 and 2012.   Geologically 
significant copper, gold and trace elements were intersected in a number of holes — these results, 
reported in detail in previous annual reports, support the potential for economic porphyry copper-
gold deposits.
During the year under review, site visits to the project area were undertaken by CRME personnel to 
assess infrastructure and access requirements and a detailed program and budget for resumption of 
exploration on the licence areas was prepared.
Commencement of field work was delayed pending approval of government security clearances for 
key project personnel – the security clearances were granted in June 2016.
