<p><i>Summary 
</i>The present report presents an overview of the Working Group&#8217;s activities during 
</p>
<p>the period under review, including regular sessions of the Working Group, communications 
and country visits.  
</p>
<p>The thematic part of the report presents the findings of the Working Group&#8217;s 
ongoing global study of national laws and regulations relating to private military and/or 
security companies (PMSCs). In the present report, the Working Group focuses on laws 
and regulations of eight francophone countries in Africa, namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia as 
well as those of eight countries in the Asia region, namely China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, 
the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates. The Working Group&#8217;s 
global study aims to assess existing national laws regarding PMSCs and their effectiveness 
in protecting human rights and promoting accountability for violations. Furthermore, it 
aims at identifying common points, good practices and regulatory gaps that may exist.  
</p>
<p>The Working Group observes that, while there are common elements in the laws of 
these countries, diverse contexts at the national level affect the way in which PMSCs are 
regulated and the regulatory approach of each country significantly varies. The Working 
Group reiterates the need for effective regulation of the activities of PMSCs and invites all 
Member States to facilitate its study of national legislation, which aims to identify trends 
and good practices and to develop guidance for Member States in exercising effective 
oversight of the activities of PMSCs.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of 
violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination describes its activities since its previous report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/24/45). The thematic section of the report presents the results of the Working 
Group&#8217;s global study on national legislation concerning private military and security 
companies, which focuses on selected countries in Africa and Asia.  
</p>
<p>2. The report is submitted pursuant to resolution 2005/2 of the former Commission on 
Human Rights, which established the mandate of the Working Group, and Human Rights 
Council resolutions 7/21, 15/12 and 24/13, in which the Council further extended the 
mandate. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group is composed of five independent experts: Patricia Arias (Chile), 
Elzbieta Karska (Poland), Anton Katz (South Africa), Faiza Patel (Pakistan) and Gabor 
Rona (United States of America). Ms. Patel&#8217;s term officially ended on 2 June 2014. 
Mr. Saeed Mokbil (Yemen) was appointed on the same day as member of the Working 
Group. During its 20th regular session in December 2013, the Working Group elected 
Ms. Arias as Chairperson-Rapporteur for the period from January to December 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group 
</b>4. In accordance with its usual practice, the Working Group held three regular sessions 
during the reporting period: two in Geneva and one in New York. It held regular meetings 
with representatives of Member States, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 
experts. It reviewed allegations regarding the activities of mercenaries and private military 
and/or security companies (PMSCs) and their impact on human rights, and decided on the 
appropriate action to be taken. 
</p>
<p>5. For the purposes of the present report, PMSC is defined as &#8220;a corporate entity which 
provides on a compensatory basis military and/or security services by physical persons 
and/or legal entities&#8221;. Military services refer to &#8220;specialized services related to military 
actions, including strategic planning, intelligence, investigation, land, sea or air 
reconnaissance, flight operations of any type, manned or unmanned, satellite surveillance, 
any kind of knowledge transfer with military applications, material and technical support to 
armed forces and other related activities&#8221;, whereas security services refer to &#8220;armed 
guarding or protection of buildings, installations, property and people, any kind of 
knowledge transfer with security and policing applications, development and 
implementation of informational security measures and other related activities&#8221;.1 
</p>
<p><b> A. Nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first sessions of the Working Group  
</b></p>
<p>6. The Working Group held its nineteenth session in New York from 29 July to 2 
August 2013. As part of that session, it convened a panel discussion with experts to discuss 
the use of PMSCs by the United Nations, in the context of its study launched in March 
2013, the outcome of which will form the basis of the Working Group&#8217;s report to the sixty-
ninth session of the General Assembly. The first panel focused on the use of PMSCs by the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Draft of a possible Convention on Private Military and Security Companies for consideration and 
</p>
<p>action by the Human Rights Council, A/HRC/15/25, annex I. </p>


<p>United Nations as armed guards, while the second panel addressed the use of PMSCs by the 
United Nations in peace operations.  
</p>
<p>7. The twentieth session of the Working Group was held in Geneva from 16 to 20 
December 2013. During this session, the Working Group held consultations with 
representatives of Member States with a view to pursuing outstanding country visit 
requests. From 3 to 7 March 2014, the Working Group held its twenty-first session in 
Geneva. During this session, the Working Group held discussions with representatives from 
civil society on the importance of an international binding instrument to regulate the 
activities of PMSCs, including minimum standards of regulation, and on strategies to 
mobilize stakeholders in support of a legally binding instrument to enhance constructive 
engagement with States, international organizations and NGOs. The Working Group will 
further elaborate on the draft of a possible international convention on private military and 
security companies. 
</p>
<p>8. On 5 March 2014, the Working Group held a public event on the topic of use by the 
United Nations of PMSCs, which was opened by the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights. The participants discussed the recently adopted United Nations Policy and 
Guidelines on the use of armed guards and the challenges faced by the United Nations 
when outsourcing a number of security tasks to private contractors. Discussions highlighted 
the risks posed to United Nations operations, its staff and local populations. The need for 
the United Nations to ensure that PMSCs and the actions of their employees are in 
conformity with international standards was also emphasized. Participants made concrete 
proposals to address some of the challenges, such as putting in place a robust selection and 
vetting process when employing private security companies and ensuring that mechanisms 
are established to provide remedies for possible human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>9. Since its last report to the Human Rights Council, the Working Group has sent six 
communications to the Governments of Australia, Honduras, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania 
and the United States of America, respectively.2 The Working Group expresses its 
appreciation to the Government of Honduras, which replied to one of the communications 
addressed to it, and invites the other Governments to do so as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Country visits  
</b></p>
<p>10. The Working Group conducted one country visit during the period under review. It 
visited the Comoros from 7 to 16 May 2014. The report on the visit to the Comoros is 
presented as an addendum to the present report. The Working Group thanks the 
Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for its positive response to its request for a visit, which it 
plans to undertake from 6 to10 October 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Collecting information on individuals convicted of mercenary activities 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 21/8, requested the Working Group to 
establish a database of individuals convicted of mercenary activities (para. 18). Pursuant to 
that request, the Working Group sent a note verbale to all Member States on 22 January 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 Summaries of the communications will be included in the Communications report of Special 
</p>
<p>Procedures to be submitted to the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council. </p>


<p>2013, requesting information on cases of mercenaries convicted by national courts. 
Reminders were sent on 6 March 2013. Information on replies received was provided in the 
Working Group&#8217;s previous report to the Human Rights Council. No further responses have 
been received since. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Other activities of the Working Group members 
</b></p>
<p>12. Working Group member Gabor Rona participated in the Montreux +5 Conference 
convened by the Government of Switzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) and the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF), held 
from 11 to 13 December 2013. He also participated in the 55th Ordinary Session of the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, held in Luanda, Angola, from 28 
April to 12 May 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Research on national regulation of PMSCs 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Working Group continued its global study of national laws regarding PMSCs to 
assess their effectiveness in protecting human rights and promoting accountability for 
violations. The study aims to identify common points, good practices and regulatory gaps 
that may exist. The present report focuses on eight francophone African States and eight 
Asian States. The Working Group&#8217;s previous report to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/24/45) focused on 13 anglophone African States3. In its next report to the Human 
Rights Council, in 2015, the Working Group intends to report on the national legislation of 
countries in the Western European and Others Group (WEOG), the Eastern European 
Group (EEG), as well as the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC).  
</p><p>14. In conducting this study of national legislation on PMSCs on a region-by-region 
basis, the Working Group hopes to develop guidance to help Member States regulate the 
growing phenomenon of PMSC use. Some of the laws reviewed for this report were made 
available by States and others were obtained through research. The various national laws 
were analysed through the lens of the following elements: (a) scope of the legislation; (b) 
licensing, authorization and registration of PMSCs; (c) selection and training of PMSC 
personnel; (d) permitted and prohibited activities of PMSCs; (e) rules on acquisition of 
weapons by PMSC personnel; (f) use of force and firearms by PMSC personnel; (g) 
accountability for violations of the law committed by PMSC personnel and remedies 
provided for victims and (h) ratification of the international convention on mercenaries. 
These elements were considered to be crucial in understanding the general regulatory 
framework in each State.

</p>
<p>Africa, Swaziland, Uganda and Zimbabwe. </p>


<p><b> B. Francophone Africa 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Analysis 
</b></p>
<p>15. The following francophone States in Africa were analysed for this report: Burkina 
Faso, Cameroon, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Morocco, 
Senegal and Tunisia.  
</p>
<p>16. All of these States have laws to regulate private security companies (PSCs) and their 
activities, which mainly focus on providing guard and protection services for persons and 
goods. None of the States have laws or regulations covering the activities and services of 
private military companies. The relevant laws focus on the domestic sphere, without 
prohibiting the provision of military or security services abroad or ruling on extraterritorial 
applicability. However, none of the laws analysed contain any specific provisions on direct 
participation by PMSC personnel in hostilities. Where legislation prohibits PSC personnel 
from carrying out certain activities of the police and the armed forces, it is not clear 
whether the related provisions apply only in times of peace or during armed conflicts as 
well.  
</p>
<p>17. All the States had detailed regulations on licensing and authorization of PSCs, 
including relevant details regarding the responsibilities of the various inter-ministerial, 
ministerial and other governmental bodies. As a precondition for obtaining a licence, most 
of the States analysed require a review of the &#8220;moral standards&#8221; or &#8220;good behaviour&#8221; of the 
company&#8217;s managers and/or its personnel. However, none of the laws reviewed contain any 
reference to human rights law or standards as prerequisites for the operation of the PSC. 
Regarding national registration, only Cameroon4 requires the authorizing entity to maintain 
a national record of security companies.  
</p>
<p>18. In general, States have detailed selection criteria and place emphasis on the necessity 
of providing training to PSC staff. However, the laws focus on form and procedural 
conditions rather than on content, and none of the laws contain reference to international 
human rights or humanitarian law as part of the selection criteria or the training materials. 
All the laws reviewed address the question of the applicant&#8217;s criminal record, but vary in 
relation to the gravity of the crimes involved. Half of the laws reviewed provide 
information on mandatory and regular training of PSC personnel, while the other half refers 
only to optional training and principles based on the PSC&#8217;s code of ethics.  
</p>
<p>19. Regarding permitted activities, the relevant laws all emphasize that the only 
activities that security providers are authorized to carry out are guard and protection 
services to persons and property or goods. Furthermore, PSC personnel are required to 
indicate that their activities are private in nature and, in several countries, the permitted 
activities may only be carried out inside private properties and not beyond those 
boundaries. Prohibited activities include all services that are not linked to the security of 
persons and property and some countries prohibited activities such as the involvement of 
PSC personnel in labour conflicts and political or religious events. Some laws specifically 
prohibit PCS personnel from carrying out certain activities that may overlap the functions 
of the police and the military. The majority of the laws reviewed discourage PSCs from 
hiring former members of the military forces or of the police as managers or employees.  
</p>
<p>20. The States observed had different approaches to the acquisition and possession of 
weapons and firearms, for example, some allowed all PSC personnel to be armed and to 
possess weapons/firearms; others only allowed certain PSC personnel who carry out 
specific activities, such as surveillance, guarding and transport of funds, to carry weapons, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 Cameroon, Decree No. 2005/031, art. 2. </p>


<p>and prohibited others, such as personnel protecting people; and some required special 
permits for the acquisition and possession of weapons and firearms. Some States prohibit 
PSC personnel from acquiring and possessing specific types of weapons and firearms, or 
prohibited the acquisition and possession of weapons and firearms for specific purposes. 
Only the legislation of Tunisia5 refers specially to illegal acquisition of firearms and the 
consequences relating thereto. Moreover, the regulatory approaches regarding the use of 
force and firearms are rather divergent; some States entirely prohibit the use of force and 
firearms in all situations, except for self-defence, while others permit the use of force  in 
accordance with conditions prescribed in the relevant laws and regulations.  
</p>
<p>21. Most States appear to have a monitoring system carried out by the office that 
authorizes/licenses PSCs, which makes announced or unannounced, regular or ad-hoc 
inspections and reviews regular or ad-hoc reports on infractions or violations of the law 
committed by the PSC personnel. However, in general, the relevant laws do not provide 
rules on the content of the monitoring procedure, but focus mostly on administrative 
sanctions, such as warnings, fines, temporary suspension of the activities of the PSC, 
withdrawal of authorization or seizure of weapons and firearms. The laws rarely refer to 
penal and civil sanctions. None of the laws reviewed contain provisions regarding 
personnel compliance with the standards of international human rights and humanitarian 
law or guarantees for effective remedy to victims.  
</p>
<p>22. While all the States reviewed have ratified the Protocol Additional to the Geneva 
Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International 
Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), which defines the term  &#8220;mercenary&#8221;, and the majority are 
party to the Organization of African Unity Convention for the Elimination of Mercenaries 
in Africa, only Cameroon and Senegal have ratified the International Convention against 
the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries.6 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Scope of the legislation 
</b></p>
<p>23. The legislation of seven of the States analysed address the issue of private security 
companies.7 These laws provide for &#8220;private security companies&#8221;8 or &#8220;private security and 
guard companies&#8221;,9 with the general meaning of guard and protection services provided to 
persons and property or goods.10 However, none of the legislation covers private military 
companies (PMCs) or addresses direct participation of PMSC personnel in hostilities.  
</p><p>24. While the legislation of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Mali prohibits PSC personnel from carrying out certain acts related to activities of the 
police and the armed forces,11 it is not clear whether the related provisions apply in times of 
peace as well as during armed conflicts. None of the laws regulate the export of security or

<p>military services abroad nor contain relevant jurisdiction provisions or clauses regarding 
extraterritorial application.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Licensing, authorization and registration of PSCs 
</b></p>
<p>25. The laws of Burkina Faso, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Mali, the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and Tunisia12 provide for authorizations and licences to be granted by or registered 
with the ministry responsible for internal security. In other countries, it is an 
intergovernmental body under the ministry in charge of internal security or the local 
government that is responsible for licensing and monitoring PSC activities.13 Morocco&#8217;s law 
provides for a &#8220;competent administrative authority&#8221; in charge of reviewing the requests for 
authorization, but does not specify further responsibilities or the relationship with a 
supervising or monitoring ministry or other government body. 
</p>
<p>26. As a precondition for granting a licence, Burkina Faso requires a &#8220;review of the 
moral standards of the company&#8217;s managers&#8221;, while in Senegal, the authority in charge of 
authorizing private security activities conducts an &#8220;investigation of the moral standards&#8221; of 
the applicant, and in Tunisia, potential employees of PSCs must &#8220;be known to be of good 
behaviour.&#8221;14 Nowhere is reference to human rights standards or training stated as being a 
prerequisite for managers or personnel in order for a PSC to obtain authorization for a 
licence.  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to national registration of PSCs, only Cameroonian law requires the 
relevant authority to &#8220;maintain a national record of security companies&#8221;.15 Morocco  has a 
self-registration system that obliges PSCs to establish and maintain an internal registry of 
the identity of employees and other data necessary for monitoring their activities16 and 
Tunisian law contains a similar provision, obliging the holder of the authorization to keep a 
register within the Ministry of the Interior.17 Legislation of the remaining countries do not 
make any reference to national or self-registration systems. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Selection and training of PSC personnel 
</b></p>
<p>28. The criteria for selecting PSC personnel indicate that a clean criminal record is a 
high priority in the States analysed.18 However, the related provisions vary with regard to 
the gravity of the offence. For example, in Burkina Faso, no one shall be a director or 
manager of a security company, if he or she was &#8220;sentenced to mandatory imprisonment of 
three (3) months or a suspended sentence of more than six (6) months for a crime or

<p>misdemeanour, except for torts of negligence or involuntary crimes.&#8221;19 This requirement is 
also found, to varying degrees, in the legislation of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Mali, Senegal and 
Tunisia.20  
</p>
<p>29. The criterion of &#8220;good moral standards&#8221; is also important in several States.21 In 
Morocco, the relevant law states that no one shall be hired if he or she was &#8220;sentenced or 
imprisoned for a crime deemed incompatible with the exercise of the activities described in 
this Act&#8230;22 Morocco&#8217;s legislation is in fact quite progressive; it states that &#8220;the hiring of an 
employee must be in line with the professional qualifications established by regulations 
regarding the nature of the job&#8221;.23 However, this law does not provide further details on 
what such requirement would entail in concrete terms. None of the laws analysed contain 
any reference to international human rights or humanitarian law or standards to be taken 
into account during the selection process.24 
</p>
<p>30. The laws of only four countries provide information on mandatory and regular 
training of PMSC personnel, namely Burkina Faso, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Morocco and Tunisia. 
However, none of the relevant laws contains details about the content of the required 
training, nor any specific details on international human rights or humanitarian law or 
standards. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Permitted and prohibited activities  
</b></p>
<p>31. In the laws reviewed, the activities that PSCs are permitted to carry out range from 
guarding and providing  protection for persons and property/goods, and protection for the 
transport of funds, money, documents, jewellery, precious metals and other important 
objects.25 In Burkina Faso, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, and Morocco, PSCs are required to indicate the 
private nature of their work in order to avoid confusion between the activities of private 
persons and those of public security services.26 Some countries27 permit PSC personnel to 
carry out activities within the buildings and boundaries of the properties being guarded.28 
Exceptions exist, as in Burkina Faso, where the law states that such personnel shall only 
carry out their duties in the public sphere in exceptional cases (without specifying further), 
and in Mali, Morocco and Tunisia, where PSC personnel may, exceptionally carry out their 
duties in the public sphere in order to prevent theft, burglary or other attack against 
property.29

<p>32. Regarding prohibited activities, the laws of Burkina Faso, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and 
Morocco specifically emphasize that services not related to the security or protection of 
persons and property are excluded from the ambit of the concerned laws and are therefore 
prohibited.30 The involvement of PSC personnel in a labour conflict or related event31 is 
prohibited in Burkina Faso, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Morocco and Senegal. Other prohibited activities 
include gathering information on political, religious or trade union opinions.32  
</p>
<p>33. Some laws specifically prohibit PSCs from carrying out certain activities that may 
overlap the functions of the police and the military, and PSCs are required to respect 
existing legislation concerning arrest and detention of criminals. In the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, PSCs are permitted to provide protection to persons and property, 
&#8220;insofar as they do not replace the police&#8221;, but they are prohibited from &#8220;patrolling, 
arresting, carrying and using firearms, special devices and any other material normally 
reserved for the military and the police.&#8221;33 Similar provisions are contained in the laws of 
Tunisia and Morocco.34 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Rules on acquisition of weapons by PSC personnel 
</b></p>
<p>34. The States reviewed35 appear to have different approaches regarding the acquisition 
of weapons by the personnel of PSCs. PSC personnel in Burkina Faso, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
Morocco and Tunisia are allowed to be armed and to possess weapons, including firearms 
as determined by the &#8220;relevant laws and regulations in force&#8221;36. In Mali, PSC personnel in 
charge of surveillance, guarding and transport of funds are allowed to possess weapons, 
however, personnel protecting people cannot be armed.37 In some cases, special permits are 
required for the acquisition and possession of weapons and firearms, as in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and Tunisia.38 However, some States prohibit PSC personnel from 
acquiring and possessing specific types of weapons and firearms, or prohibit them from 
possessing weapons for specific purposes. In Cameroon, for example, &#8220;protection and 
alarm equipment may not include firearms&#8221;, and &#8220;security companies may not have or use 
conventional armament&#8221;.39 C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire authorizes PSC personnel &#8220;to use stun bombs, 
clubs, rubber-bullet firearms, pepper spray and tear gas&#8221;;40 Mali prohibits carrying self-
defence gas, knives and blunt weapons,41 while the Democratic Republic of the Congo

<p>prohibits carrying and using firearms, special devices and other material normally reserved 
for the military and the police&#8221;.42 
</p>
<p>35. The legislation analysed also contain specific provisions on the obligation of PSC 
personnel with regard to the weapons in their possession in the case of temporary 
suspension or cessation of activities. In Cameroon, for example, in the event that 
authorization is withdrawn, &#8220;edged weapons held by the security company shall be 
automatically seized by the appropriate administrative body&#8221;; in the event of temporary 
cessation of activities, &#8220;the protection equipment of the security company shall be deposited 
for safe keeping with the appropriate authorities&#8221;. After a temporary cessation of activity of 
more than six (6) months, said equipment may be sold or disposed of without 
consideration.43 Tunisian legislation contains similar provisions whereby upon definitive 
cessation of activities, the security company and its personnel must hand over all weapons 
to the appropriate authorities.44  
</p>
<p>36. Of the eight States reviewed, only Tunisia has laws that sanction to the illegal 
holding of weapons. If an agent authorized to carry a weapon for the purpose of carrying 
out a mission as part of his or her duties does not return the weapon immediately after 
completing his or her mission, he or she &#8220;shall be punished with imprisonment of one year 
and a fine of 1,000 dinars&#8221;.45 
</p>
<p>37. The legislation reviewed depict patchy regulation, among the States, of the 
acquisition and possession of weapons by PSCs. In order to ensure that PSC personnel 
respect international standards relating to arms-control licensing procedures, arms transfer, 
acquisition of arms and trafficking in arms, and are accountable for any related offences, it 
is critical that States establish standard methods by which both PSCs and their personnel 
acquire, export, import and possess weapons.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Use of force and firearms by PSC personnel 
</b></p>
<p>38. Only Burkina Faso, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Morocco have specific laws on the use of force and firearms by PSC personnel. Those laws 
explicitly state that the use of firearms during the exercise of any security activity is 
authorized only in cases of legitimate defence.46 Morocco has a different approach, in that 
the relevant law allows for PSC personnel to be armed and to use, inter alia, all means of 
defence and control, in accordance with the applicable provisions contained in the relevant 
laws and regulations.47 In C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the use of firearms and grenades in guarding and 
transport of funds is authorized under the conditions defined by the Minister of Internal 
Security and the regulations concerning the carrying of firearms. However, the permit to 
carry firearms must indicate the intended use of the arm. Furthermore, under no 
circumstances shall a firearm permit issued for activities other than guarding or transport of 
funds be used, under penalty of sanctions for carrying illicit firearms.48 Mali&#8217;s legislation 
provides for the personnel of PSCs in charge of surveillance, guarding and transport of 
funds to posses and use arms and ammunition only for the time necessary to carry out their

<p>mission in private sphere.49 Furthermore, the use of such arms shall be under the 
responsibility of the PSC and is covered by the provisions of the Criminal Code.50 
</p>
<p>39. The legislation of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire prohibits PSCs from being involved in 
administrative or investigative police activities and from participating in operations aimed 
at maintaining public order during political, sports, social, traditional, cultural or religious 
events.51 In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, PSCs are permitted to provide 
protection to persons and property, &#8220;insofar as they do not replace the police&#8221;, but they are 
prohibited from patrolling, arresting, carrying and using firearms, special devices and any 
other material normally reserved for the military and the police&#8221;.52 In Mali, PSCs in charge 
of surveillance, guarding, transport of funds and protection of persons are prohibited from 
participating in operations aimed at maintaining public order or limiting the free circulation 
of people or vehicles.53 None of the legislation analysed address the use of force and 
firearms that may overlap the functions of the police and the military or that may involve 
the direct participation of PSC personnel in hostilities during armed conflicts. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Accountability for violations of the law committed by PSC personnel and remedy for 
victims 
</b></p>
<p>40. Six of the States analysed have monitoring systems provided for in their respective 
laws,54 which are generally administered by the agency that authorizes or grants licences to 
PSCs. Monitoring the activities of PSCs include carrying out announced or unannounced, 
regular or ad-hoc inspections.  
</p>
<p>41. Only Cameroon&#8217;s legislation provides details on the scope of the monitoring and 
inspection activities of the monitoring body. It specifies that the inspection shall cover the 
staff, general recruitment conditions, cases of dismissal, respect for requirements 
concerning uniforms and badges, the validity of insurance coverage; the appropriateness of 
the types and quantity of communication, protection and alarm equipment used.55 Further to 
the laws regulating their activities, PSCs in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire are required to submit quarterly 
and annual activity reports to their licensing agencies or monitoring bodies;56 however, are 
not obliged to report on their compliance with other laws. Compliance with the standards of 
international human rights and humanitarian law is not a requirement of the responsibilities 
of the monitoring bodies. 
</p>
<p>42. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Senegal are the only 
States in which PSCs are obliged to immediately report infractions or violations of the law 
committed by their personnel. In C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, PSC personnel must immediately inform 
the national defence and security forces of &#8220;any infraction or fact concerning the security of 
persons and property or State security&#8221; that they know about and must provide any 
information enabling the apprehension of the criminals. However, a serious restriction is 
attached to this provision; &#8220;under no circumstances shall such information be provided to a 
foreign power or a physical person or legal entity foreign to the Ivorian defence and 
security forces.&#8221;57 The legislation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo requires that

the relevant law shall be notified to the committee established by the Minister of the 
Interior.59 None of the above-mentioned laws provide further details regarding the nature of 
the &#8220;infractions&#8221; or &#8220;facts concerning the security of persons and property or State security&#8221; 
or the &#8220;serious incidents&#8221; that need to be reported, which may make their implementation 
difficult. 
</p>
<p>43. With regard to the accountability of PSC personnel, most of the laws reviewed focus 
on acts violating the provisions regarding permissible activities, licensing, authorization, 
recruitment and other administrative processes.60 
</p>
<p>44. With regard to sanctions, the various laws focus on administrative sanctions applied 
by the authorizing or licensing agencies in the forms of a warning, a fine, temporary 
suspension of the company&#8217;s activities, withdrawal of authorization, and seizure of 
weapons and firearms.61 In Mali, Morocco and Tunisia, the sanctions include 
imprisonment.62 In some instances, laws contain references to penal and civil sanctions for 
infractions linked to the exercise of the PSC activities;63 however, none of the legislation 
analysed contains provisions on remedies for victims.

<p><b> C. Asia 
</b></p>
<p>45. The legislation of the following States in the Asia region were reviewed: China, 
India, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka and the United Arab 
Emirates. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Analysis 
</b></p>
<p>46. All eight States reviewed have regulations on private security companies (PSCs), 
albeit without uniformity. None of the laws covers private military companies or services. 
Despite the transnational nature of private security services, almost all the laws address 
PSC activities within the national sphere, with the exception of India which briefly 
addresses the import and export of PSC activities.64 In most of the States, the regulation of 
PSCs is administered by a central or local government authority. The powers of the 
regulating authorities differ in each State. The requirement to obtain a licence is mandatory 
in all the States.

</p>
<p>Extraterritorial activities are forbidden without prior permission, and foreign companies are not 
allowed to engage in security services unless they fulfil certain requirements. </p>


<p>47. The criteria for granting licences to PSCs and/or their employees vary among the 
States. In all of the States reviewed, PSC employees must not have any criminal 
convictions and must possess certain training qualifications. Most of the laws do not 
specify the training requirements and none refers to training that includes human rights law 
or standards. Furthermore, the relevant laws do not specify whether the disclosure of past 
criminal convictions also includes acts involving human rights violations. In terms of a 
central register for PSCs, only three States have laws pertaining to that. Although all the 
laws analysed require PSCs to obtain a licence, only four States require that individual 
security personnel or employees hold a licence. The requirement for PSC personnel to 
obtain licences can be an important vetting mechanism to ensure that qualified persons are 
employed, but also that persons with past convictions relating to human rights abuses are 
excluded.  
</p>
<p>48. Notwithstanding the gaps and lack of uniformity among the laws reviewed, some 
good practices were observed as follows: foreign companies are not allowed to engage in 
the PSC domain without meeting legal requirements;65 PSCs are required to cooperate with 
the civil defence authority in times of emergency, such as natural disaster;66 PSCs are 
required to have a sound organizational structure with post accountability and a security 
guard management system;67 liability of legal persons and the PSC;68 revocation of licence 
due to engagement in criminal activity;69 PSCs are prohibited from conducting criminal 
investigations;70 PSCs are prohibited from exercising any of the powers conferred on public 
security officers;71 and PSCs are required to keep an internal data register.72 These practices 
provide the necessary framework that can contribute to the monitoring of human rights 
violations.  
</p>
<p>49. None of the eight States reviewed is a party to the International Convention against 
the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries.  
</p>

companies (PSCs) refer to either private security services or private security companies;73 
none refers to military services. Divergent approaches to regulating PSCs exist not only 
among the States reviewed, but also within a given State. For instance, Pakistan has no

ordinances of two provinces were selected: the Sindh Private Security Agencies 
(Regulation and Control) Ordinance, 2000 (2000 Sindh Ordinance), Sindh Province 
(Karachi),76 and the Punjab Private Security Companies (Regulation and Control) 
Ordinance, 200277 (2002 Punjab Ordinance), Punjab Province. 
</p><p>51. While most of the laws regulate actual security and guarding services, China&#8217;s laws 
also cover security guard training entities;78 India&#8217;s law provides information on PSC 
services and provides for training of private security guards and supervisors;79 Malaysia&#8217;s 
law provides information on PSC services;80 Pakistan&#8217;s Punjab Ordinance covers services 
such as security guards for persons, property and cash-in transit. The law in the Philippines 
covers private detectives and security guards, while Singapore&#8217;s law defines private 
investigators, security officers and the provision of security service, including the provision 
of alarm surveillance services and Sri Lanka&#8217;s law covers the provision of services to 
protect public-sector officers and State-owned property. China&#8217;s law also provides for the 
public sector to engage the services of PSCs directly. Other than China and Sri Lanka, none 
of the other States make direct reference to the engagement of PSCs by the public sector, 
nor do they expressly prohibit the use of PSCs by public sector organizations.  
</p>
<p>52. All the laws focus on the provision of private security services in the domestic 
sphere; however India&#8217;s law further provides for the export of private security activities, but 
states that the provision of private security services abroad is prohibited without the 
permission of the Controlling Authority, which, in turn, requires the permission of the 
Central Government. Furthermore, India&#8217;s law does not permit foreign companies to 
engage in or provide private security services under its jurisdiction, unless they are 
registered in India, or have a proprietor, majority shareholder, partner or director who is a 
citizen of India.81 China&#8217;s law also permits and limits the import of activities of foreign 
PSCs by prohibiting certain organizations that have public functions from contracting 
wholly foreign-owned or mixed-capital (Chinese and foreign) security companies.82  
</p><p>53. All the laws reviewed regulate PSC personnel. In some cases, the regulation is quite  
broad in scope. For example,  China&#8217;s law does not only regulated security companies, but 
also the organizations that employ them, including government bodies, social organizations 
and public institutions, although the security guards must meet the requirements prescribed 
by law and may not provide services outside of the premises that they have been hired to 
guard or beyond the limits of the property managed by the hiring entity.  
</p>
<p>54. Article 1 of the United Arab Emirates Private Security Companies decree includes in 
the definition of PSCs, &#8220;any government body&#8221; as well as any &#8220;security company or 
institution &#8230; offering a security service, whether independently or in conjunction with

government body providing a security service that is considered as being &#8220;private&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Licensing, authorization and registration of PSCs 
</b></p>
<p>55. All of the laws reviewed provide for a central authority, normally a government 
department or ministry, vested with the powers to authorize, supervise and control PSCs.83 
The authority may be decentralized, as in the case of federal States such as Pakistan, India 
and China and generally, the relevant laws give the central authority the power to inter alia, 
implement the executing regulations, and grant, renew, cancel and suspend licences. In 
some cases, the authority has the explicit power of maximum supervision over PSCs.84  
</p>
<p>56. In all of the States examined, a PSC must have a licence in order to start or continue 
its security business. The person establishing the PSC must also obtain a licence. Only four 
countries85 require that PSC personnel have a separate licence also.  
</p>
<p>57. Some of the eligibility criteria for the company or owner licence are common to 
most of the laws analysed, including the need for the applicant to meet certain qualification 
and training requirements;86 the requirement not to have been convicted of any crime or 
other offence;87 and the requirement of good conduct.88 Other criteria specific to two or 
more States include the nationality of a manager or company;89 the requirement for 
companies to have a minimum equity;90 requirement concerning the age of the manager;91 
requirements concerning premises, equipment, facilities, etc.92 The eligibility criteria for the 
security personnel licence are the same in the four States that require it and include 
requisite training and experience;93not to have been convicted of any crime or other 
offence;94 and fulfilment of the criteria relating to good moral conduct.95 Of the States 
reviewed, China regulates the security guard criteria most thoroughly by requiring, inter 
alia, that personnel pass relevant examinations; employee contracts must include coverage

<p>under the national social insurance programme; employees must have regular training on 
law, professional knowledge and skills; and regular assessment of work performance. 
</p>
<p>58. Only some of the laws examined contain reference to the establishment of a security 
agency register: Pakistan, 2000 Sindh Ordinance;96 Philippines, Republic Act No. 5487, 
1969;97 and Sri Lanka, Act No. 45, 1998.98 The other laws do not expressly provide for such 
register.  
</p>
<p>59. None of the laws state the need for PSC personnel, including managers and owners, 
to have specific training in, or knowledge of, human rights law or standards. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Selection and training of PSC personnel 
</b>60. There is a lack of uniformity in the laws reviewed with regard to the selection and 
training of PSC personnel. There is no reference to training in human rights law and 
standards in any of the laws, which focus rather on various types of training, including by 
public institutions such as the police,99 or the issuance of letters of approval by government 
authorities such as the Chief Police Officer.100 The selection criteria are covered in detail in 
the laws of Pakistan (Sindh and Punjab Provinces), the Philippines and Singapore. With 
regard to employee conduct, in some of the States reviewed,101 the conduct of PSC 
personnel is also indirectly governed through the eligibility criteria established for granting 
individual employee licences. Where employee licences are not required, the selection 
criteria apply to the companies themselves. China&#8217;s State Council Order No. 564 is the 
most detailed in this respect: it contains a long list of measures that security guards must 
take when providing security and guard services. Some of the relevant laws establish a clear 
limitations on security employees&#8217; conduct, for example, the prohibition from carrying out 
any activity or exercising powers normally conferred to police officers, customs officers, 
immigration officers, prison officers or any other type of public officer.102  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Permitted and prohibited activities  
</b></p>
<p>61. Each of the States reviewed regulates PSC conduct, in terms of permitted or 
prohibited activities, differently. However, four aspects are regulated by the laws of two or 
more States, namely the requirement for PSCs to exhibit their licence publicly and in a 
conspicuous place;103 the requirement to keep an internal register of data;104 prohibition 
from conducting criminal investigations;105 and prohibition from exercising any powers that 
are normally conferred to public security officers.106 In that respect, the laws of Malaysia 
and Pakistan, for instance, state that PSCs may not exercise the powers conferred on police,

<p>customs, immigration, prison officers or any other kind of public official. Aside from the 
four aspects mentioned above, the permitted and prohibited activities of PSCs vary from 
country to country and there are no provisions for the application of human rights standards 
or principles.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Regulations on the use of force and acquisition of weapons by PSC personnel 
</b>62. Most of the States reviewed allow PSC personnel to carry firearms. Singapore&#8217;s law 
prohibits private guards from carrying certain firearms unless the employee has a special 
permit; Sri Lanka has a similar requirement. Malaysia&#8217;s law makes no mention of the use of 
firearms by PSC personnel, but its indicates that an arms licence may be issued to a 
responsible person designated by the security company. A common detail that is usually 
missing from the regulations is the type of firearms and other non-lethal weapons that 
security guards can use. China&#8217;s regulations107 on the use of guns by guards and escorts are 
a good example of legislation that limits the use of firearms and defines the rules of 
engagement. The laws reviewed also differ in their regulation of training that PSC 
personnel must have in order to obtain a licence to handle firearms. There are no clear or 
uniform standards on this issue. Training requirements in some States108 provided for fail to 
specify minimum standards; the Philippines allow PSC personnel to carry weapons subject 
to the provision of training to security guards and limitations on the types of weapons 
carried. Sri Lanka&#8217;s law vaguely states that the Minister may establish regulations with 
regard to the level of competence in the use of firearms for PSC personnel and the 
certificates for the use of firearms are issued by the local police departments.  
</p>
<p>63. Illegal acquisition of arms is rarely addressed in the relevant laws. The law of the 
United Arab Emirates mentions the prohibition from acquiring or carrying firearms, but 
most of the laws reviewed make no mention of arms or weapons. However, this may be due 
to the fact that specific laws regulate the sale and possession of firearms, and does not infer 
that PSCs have impunity with regard to this issue.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Accountability for violations of the law committed by PSC personnel and remedy for 
victims  
</b></p>
<p>64. Only two States, namely China109 and Malaysia,110 clearly recognize the obligation 
to report information concerning any offence or violation of their respective laws. The Sri 
Lanka law provides for the obligation to furnish reports to the competent authority, which 
could be construed as including reports on offences or violations.111 However, specific 
provisions for reporting human rights offences or violations is generally absent from among 
the laws reviewed, which raises important questions about the impact of PSC operations on 
human rights and the issue of accountability.  
</p>
<p>65. A good practice observed in China provision is the duty of the employer or the 
security company to provide compensation in cases where a security guard causes injuries 
or casualties.112 The law of the Philippines also provides for what is considered to be good

must promptly report to the police any violation or crime that he could not stop, while simultaneously

<p>practice: security companies are required to purchase a bond issued by a reputable 
insurance company to cover any valid legal claim filed against the company.113 The 2002 
Punjab Ordinance also provides for the security company to make arrangements for 
insurance for its guards.114 The absence of similar provisions in the laws of other States may 
have implications on the rights of victims of human rights abuses to a remedy. 
</p>
<p>66. On the other hand, two of the laws examined contain provisions for immunity to the 
central authorities,115 or any person116 so long as they have acted in good faith. The 2005 
India Act exempts the controlling authority of liability for indemnities for anything done in 
good faith while the 2000 Sindh Ordinance (Pakistan) exempts any person of liability for 
indemnities for anything done in good faith. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>67. <b>The study of legislation on private military and/or security companies of States 
in francophone Africa and in Asia highlights the different approaches to the 
privatization of security. Analysis of the legislation in both regions show a regulatory 
emphasis on the provision of guard and protection services to persons and property in 
the domestic sphere. None of the legislation deals with private military companies or 
adequately addresses the issue of military and security services provided abroad and 
the extraterritorial applicability of relevant legislation.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The transnational nature of private military and security services (PMSC), the 
high likelihood of the use of force and involvement in hostilities on the part of PMSC 
personnel and the gaps in regulations and inconsistency of approaches found in the 
present study underscore the risk that the status quo can seriously undermine the rule 
of law and the effective functioning of democratic State institutions responsible for 
ensuring public safety. Furthermore, the regulatory and accountability gaps noted 
create potential risks to fundamental human rights, such as the right to security and 
the right to life, as well as the right of victims to effective remedies. The Working 
Group stresses that the right to security is an inherent human right, which underpins 
the enjoyment of other rights.  
</b>69. <b>The study of the laws and regulations reveals a lack of specific rules on the 
content of monitoring activities and inspections of PMSCs, as well as a lack of 
references to compliance by the PSC and/or its personnel with international human 
rights and humanitarian law and standards, and provisions on penal accountability, 
civil liability of individuals and corporate actors, as well as effective remedies to 
victims.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Considering the diverse activities and the broad geographical scope covered by 
PMSC services, lack of regulation in those critical areas may result in States&#8217; 
ineffective control over the private security industry and the activities of its personnel. 
Lack of familiarity with human rights standards among PMSC personnel also raises 
concerns. In order to ensure that the relevant international human rights and 
humanitarian law and standards are respected and effectively used in the course of 
private security operations with a view to minimizing the risk of violations thereto and

<p><b>guaranteeing the effective accountability of PSCs and their personnel, it is essential 
that human rights-based vetting mechanisms as well as mandatory legal training with 
reference to the relevant international human rights and humanitarian law and 
standards be introduced. Such training in human rights standards is imperative and 
should form part of the overall mandatory criteria for obtaining a licence to operate 
and for subsequent licence renewals.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The study indicates that, although several national laws provide for the 
establishment of a government authority responsible for granting licences to PSCs, 
very few of the States reviewed require or grant power to the said authority to keep a 
centralized register of licences that have been awarded. States&#8217; obligation to keep such 
a register may assist in maintaining oversight of PSC operations and the conduct of 
PSC personnel.  
</b>72. <b>The Working Group hopes that the study of national legislation on PMSCs will 
enable it to identify good practices that would contribute to its development of 
guidance for Member States on how to regulate PSCs effectively and ensure the 
enjoyment of the right to security by all. For instance, the regulation of the export of 
security (and military) services is an example of good practice, which States must 
consider addressing within their regulatory frameworks. Other good practices include 
the mandatory requirement for PMSCs to have a sound organizational structure 
coupled with an effective post accountability system that addresses not only their 
activities, but also  the conduct of their personnel, and the requirement for all alleged 
offences or violations committed by PMSCs and/or their personnel to be reported to 
the police or other law enforcement agents.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Notwithstanding the good practices that may be identified by the Working 
Group in the course of its study of national legislation on PSCs and despite the 
detailed provisions on permitted and prohibited activities, there are still regulatory 
gaps relating to issues such as the acquisition of weapons and trafficking in arms by 
PMSC personnel and their consequences and divergent approaches to the use of force 
and firearms in the course of duty. Taking into account the nature of PMSC activities 
and the potential participation of PSC personnel in combat and mercenary-related 
activities, as well as the likelihood that PMSC personnel carry and use weapons, the 
lack of regulation creates potential risks to human rights. An international convention 
could provide standard rules and methods on acquiring, exporting, importing, 
possessing and using weapons and would ensure that PMSC personnel worldwide are 
also held accountable for illegal acquisition of weapons, illicit trafficking in arms and 
prohibited use of force. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The study highlights the lack of clear regulations on oversight by the 
authorities and accountability of actors in the PMSC industry. Legislation is 
particularly silent on how the conduct of PSCs or PMCs is arbitrated during potential 
events of unrest or armed conflict. An international convention covering issues such as 
licensing, authorization, selection and training of PMSC personnel would promote 
implementation at the national level of common and consistent regulations that would 
ensure effective accountability and the availability of remedies for violations.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Working Group reiterates its view that a comprehensive, legally binding 
international regulatory instrument would be the best way to ensure adequate 
protection of human rights. In that regard, the Working Group welcomes the work of 
the intergovernmental working group established by the Human Rights Council with 
a view to considering the possibility of an international instrument for the regulation 
of PMSCs; it encourages all States to participate actively in that process.
