<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Thirtieth session 
</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 10<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 2 October 2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>30/24. National policies and human rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard 
</p>
<p>of achievement for all peoples and all nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all relevant international human rights treaties, including the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> its resolutions 23/19 of 23 June 2013 and 27/26 of 26 September 
</p>
<p>2014 on national policies and human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> that States emphasized in the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
</p>
<p>of Action and the 2005 World Summit Outcome1 that they bear the responsibility, in 
</p>
<p>conformity with the Charter, to develop and encourage respect for human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, 
</p>
<p>language, disability, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
</p>
<p>birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that States should integrate their obligations and commitments 
</p>
<p>under international human rights law into their national legislation in order to ensure that 
</p>
<p>State action at the national level is effectively directed towards the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that State action aimed at the promotion, protection and full realization of 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national level is most effective when fully 
</p>
<p>integrated into national policies based on a human rights perspective, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are inalienable, universal, indivisible, 
</p>
<p>interdependent and interrelated and that, therefore, national policies aimed at their 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection will also have a mutually reinforcing effect on their realization, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 General Assembly resolution 60/1.

<p>process of integrating their obligations and commitments under international human rights 
</p>
<p>law into national legislation, and drawing up and carrying out national policies aimed at the 
</p>
<p>full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the important and constructive role that national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and civil society can play in the process of drawing up and assessing the impact 
</p>
<p>of national policies aimed at the promotion, protection and full realization of human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that the technical cooperation offered by the Office of the United

</p>
<p>programmes can be a useful vehicle to support States&#8217; compliance with their human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations and their follow-up to recommendations made by United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that the inclusive participation of all sectors of society in debating and 
</p>
<p>developing policies and programmes affecting the population is critical for the success of 
</p>
<p>such processes, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that public policies planned and formulated through participatory and 
</p>
<p>accessible approaches are a key factor in promoting respect for and safeguarding the 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights,
