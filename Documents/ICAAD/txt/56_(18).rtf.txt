The Law on Careless Driving and Analysis of the Evidence

Careless Driving is defined by s. 99 (1) of the Land Transport Act as driving "on a public street without due care and attention".

The test for careless driving is stated in the case of Khan v State, High Court of Fiji Criminal Appeal No. 1 of 1994 (21 October, 1994) as follows:

"In order to determine whether the offence of careless driving is committed, the test, as LORD GODDARD C.J. said in SIMPSON v PEAT (1952 1 AER. 447 at p.449) is: "was D exercising that degree of care and attention that a reasonable and prudent driver would exercise in the circumstances? "The standard of proof is an objective one . . . "

The Court has noted the evidence of all the witnesses. The Court has also scrutinized the rough sketch plan and the fair sketch plan and the keys tendered by the Prosecution. 

The Rough Sketch Plan and the Fair Sketch Plan show the point of impact of the accident on the right side. The bus was traveling on the left side. The evidence given by the witnesses is that the accident took place on the left lane or closer to the center of the road. The Rough Sketch and the Fair Sketch Plan are not properly drawn out to assist the Court in this case. The Police Officers at the scene drawing sketch need to be mindful of the width of the road, the center of the road and other crucial details when drawing sketches. They come in handy when Courts decide traffic cases. The more detail they provide the easier it becomes for the Court to analyze the sketches and plans. In this case the sketch shows the point of impact on the right lane, which would mean the bus, went onto the other side if it was traveling along the left lane. The Police Officer drawing the sketch should have shown the sketch to the accused and the other driver and if they agreed with it he should have asked them to sign or initial the plans. This was not done.

The evidence of the bus driver is that he was driving at a speed of 40 km/hr and could not stop the bus once he saw the accused's car from about 10m. The Court does not believe the bus driver that he could not stop his bus at a speed of 40 km/hr once he saw the car from about 10m. If the bus driver was in fact driving at 40 km/hr he would have been able to stop the bus once he saw the car from about 10m. The Court does not believe the driver was driving at 40Km/hr. 

The accused told the Court that she checked the left side, the side from which the bus approached her. She did not see the bus and she proceeded to move her vehicle along when she was bumped by the bus. The accused told the Court that the bus was fast. The 2nd witness for the defence who was following the accused told the court that "Accused was not fast. She got off from loop road. Pacific Bus was bit fast. Saw the bus bang the car. Accused was slow. Accused braked at the junction. I braked. Accused then took off." From the evidence of the accused and the 2nd defence witness who was right behind the accused the Court finds that the accused took all reasonable care and was attentive. The accused was not careless in her driving. 

The Court also noted the demeanor of all the witnesses. The Court believes the accused and the other defence witness. They were truthful. The Court from the evidence finds that the accused as a driver exercised that degree of care and attention that a reasonable and prudent driver would exercise in the circumstances. 

The prosecution in this case has not proved that the accused drove without due care and attention. 

The accused is acquitted of the charge. 

28 Days to appeal.
