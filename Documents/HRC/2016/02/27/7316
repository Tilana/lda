<p><b>  Mission to the Gambia: comments of the 
Government of the Gambia on the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions  
</b></p>
<p><b>  The following document represents the views and comments of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of the Gambia in respect of the Report of the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, drafted 
</b></p>
<p><b>following a country visit to the Gambia from 3 to 7 November 2014. 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Gambia is dismayed at the bias manner in which the Special Rapporteur has 
</p>
<p>presented its Report. The allegations contained therein are unsubstantiated and lack merit, 
</p>
<p>with a heavy reliance on tabloids as a source of information. The Report fails to highlight 
</p>
<p>the positive effort and achievements of The Gambia in the field of Human rights.   
</p>
<p>2. Given the bias and speculative nature of the Report, the Report is an inaccurate 
</p>
<p>representation of the situation on the ground. We note that the Report of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is based substantially on information generated by other bodies such as 
</p>
<p>Amnesty International and tabloid Reports whose publications about The Gambia remain 
</p>
<p>unverified. 
</p>
<p>3. The fact that the Special Rapporteur based most of his allegations on inferences, 
</p>
<p>speculations and unverified information are particularly worrying especially when the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur did not confirm the veracity of these allegations with The Gambian 
</p>
<p>Government Officials. 
</p>
<p>4. In Paragraph 2 of the Report, the Special Rapporteur states that during the visit, they 
</p>
<p>met with certain Government officials including the Deputy Minister of Health. This is 
</p>
<p>incorrect as no such designation exists in The Gambia. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p>5. Paragraph 10 of the Report states &#8220;&#8230; despite legal provisions for Court Marshall 
</p>
<p>Proceedings to be public, they have reportedly started in closed chambers and it is unclear 
</p>
<p>whether the accused have adequate legal representation&#8230;&#8221; This statement is factually 
</p>
<p>incorrect and has no basis in reality. The proceedings did not take place in closed chambers. 
</p>
<p>The provisions of section 24 of the Constitution of The Gambia and section 109 of the 
</p>
<p>Armed forces Act were observed at all times during the trial of the accused. On the issue of 
</p>
<p>legal representation, all accused were legally represented by private practitioners paid for 
</p>
<p>by the National Agency for Legal Aid (NALA). The rights of the accused to legal 
</p>
<p>representation has not been breached in anyway.  Their family members were present 
</p>
<p>during the trial and they were allowed access to their families.  Given the nature of the 
</p>
<p>proceedings which borders on national security, the press were excluded for obvious 
</p>
<p>reasons. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>6. In Paragraph 20, we agree with the Special Rapporteur that Article 18(2) of the 
</p>
<p>constitution of The Gambia is in line with international standards, we disagree however that 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;reality however, is different&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>7. Paragraph 21 is not an accurate representation of The Gambian law. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur fails to highlight that even though the death penalty exists with regards to 
</p>
<p>offences under the Armed forces Act, particularly sections 26 to 39, 41 and 45, the sentence 
</p>
<p>of death is however not mandatory. The Court Martial has discretion to impose the death 
</p>
<p>sentence or life imprisonment or any less punishment provided by the Act. Save for the 
</p>
<p>offences under section 188 and 35(f) of the Criminal Code which carries a mandatory death 
</p>
<p>sentence, Gambian law clearly  empowers the court, in appropriate circumstances, to 
</p>
<p>impose the  death penalty as it is in force, having being restored in 1995.  It therefore 
</p>
<p>follows that the law is in line with international standards and its interpretation has also 
</p>
<p>conformed to international standards.   
</p>
<p>8. In view of the above and fact that the Supreme Court of the Gambia has interpreted 
</p>
<p>Section 18(2) of the Constitution in line with international standards, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has no basis for concluding that the &#8220; reality on the ground is however 
</p>
<p>different&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>9. In paragraph 11 the Special Rapporteur notes &#8220;&#8230;interference with the independence 
</p>
<p>of the judiciary&#8230; Human rights protection is largely an illusion&#8221;. However in Paragraph 
</p>
<p>22, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the decision of the Supreme Court of The Gambia 
</p>
<p>in Badjie v. The State, &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is pleased to learn&#8230;the supreme court 
</p>
<p>unanimously agreed and commuted the death sentences to life imprisonment&#8221;. Contrary to 
</p>
<p>the allegation made in paragraph 11, Paragraph 22 is a clear manifestation of the 
</p>
<p>independence of The Gambia&#8217;s judiciary, free from executive control or influence. 
</p>
<p>10. Paragraph 24, &#8220;the Special Rapporteur received Reports about the inadequate 
</p>
<p>conditions of detention of death row prisoners&#8230;The fact that the permission that he was 
</p>
<p>granted to visit this establishment and to investigate these allegations was cancelled at the 
</p>
<p>last minute, seem to support the contention that the State believes it has to hide the 
</p>
<p>conditions from international scrutiny.&#8221; Again, this is speculative and not supported by any 
</p>
<p>evidence. The condition of detention and treatment of persons on death row in The Gambia 
</p>
<p>are fair and meets international standards. Lawyers and family members have unhindered 
</p>
<p>access to death row inmates. The fact that the Special Rapporteur did not have access to the 
</p>
<p>security wing cannot in itself justify the conclusion that &#8220;The Gambia has something to 
</p>
<p>hide&#8221;, besides which country will open its maximum security wing to the public? 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Resumption of execution and conditional moratorium  
</b></p>
<p>11. Paragraphs 25- 34 are merely speculative and their veracity has not been verified.  
</p>
<p>All trials resulting in the imposition of the death penalty were carried out according to due 
</p>
<p>process and fair trial standards.  
</p>
<p>12. Contrary to the allegation contained in paragraph 27, all nine death row inmates who 
</p>
<p>were executed in August 2012 had already exhausted their appeals. The executions were 
</p>
<p>conducted in accordance with Gambian law and were not arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>13. Paragraph 30 is inaccurate, no inmate with a mental condition was executed in 
</p>
<p>August 2012 and there are no inmates at the Mile II Central Prisons with mental disorders. 
</p>
<p>14. Paragraph 33 is incorrect and does not represent the information given to the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur. The Gambian Officials informed the Special Rapporteur that according to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 </b> 
</p>
<p>Prisons Act, the Committee conducts a visit on the Prisons Quarterly. However, Members 
</p>
<p>of the said committee can visit the prisons at any given time.  On the composition of the 
</p>
<p>Committee, it comprises Government Officials, Retired Civil Servants and Private 
</p>
<p>Individuals. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Use of force by law enforcement and activities of 
paramilitary groups 
</b></p>
<p>15. Paragraph 36 is factually incorrect. The Gambia has not recorded any &#8220;deaths in 
</p>
<p>custody&#8221; by the agents of the NDEA. In the case of Cherno Alieu Suwareh, we state 
</p>
<p>categorically that Mr. Suwareh&#8217;s death did not occur whilst he was in the custody of the 
</p>
<p>NDEA.  Those accused of his death were all investigated and prosecuted in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the law. A court of competent jurisdiction acquitted and discharged them in view of 
</p>
<p>the evidence before it and nothing else. 
</p>
<p>16. Contrary to the allegations under paragraph 46, the NDEA is mandated to 
</p>
<p>investigate drug related matters under the Drug Control Act of 2003 and its subsequent 
</p>
<p>Amendments. The Act makes provision for and provides guidance on the activities on the 
</p>
<p>NDEA, having due regard to the fundamental rights and liberties of persons. 
</p>
<p>17. It is with disappointment that the Special Rapporteur chooses to make such 
</p>
<p>allegations as contained in paragraph 46 given that, during the period of visit, The Gambian 
</p>
<p>officials provided a copy of the Drug Control Act to the Special Rapporteur which clearly 
</p>
<p>outlines the mandate and powers of the NDEA. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Impunity for extrajudicial executions and enforced 
disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>18. Law Enforcement Officers are continuously engaged in training and sensitization on 
</p>
<p>human rights especially Officers of the Police Human Rights Unit. 
</p>
<p>19. Paragraph 41 of the Reports states &#8220;&#8230;reports of the police regularly extending the 
</p>
<p>72 hour limit for detention without charge and seldom conducting an arrest pursuant to a 
</p>
<p>warrant&#8221;. This is unsubstantiated and unverified. We task the Special Rapporteur to provide 
</p>
<p>instances of the allegations made in the said paragraph. 
</p>
<p>20. Paragraph 44 of the Report states &#8220;&#8230;serious concern about the broad and unchecked 
</p>
<p>power as afforded to such special units under the umbrella of the Gambia Police Force&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>This is an inaccurate representation of facts. The special unit under the Gambia Police force 
</p>
<p>comprises of all Security Units which are meant to compliment the efforts of Police and 
</p>
<p>Immigration. 
</p>
<p>21. We also take issue with the allegations made in Paragraph 48. There is an on-site 
</p>
<p>medical facility at the Prisons. Autopsy investigations are performed on all deaths that 
</p>
<p>occur within the vicinity of Mille II Central Prisons. There has not been any report of 
</p>
<p>deaths due to the use of excessive force or mistreatment. All death cases are accompanied 
</p>
<p>with comprehensive medical certificates on the causes of death. 
</p>
<p>22. Paragraph 55 does not fully reflect the situation on the ground. The Gambia does not 
</p>
<p>treat cases involving law enforcement officers any different.  Law enforcement officers 
</p>
<p>have faced the full force of the law when charges are levied against them. For example in 
</p>
<p>the case of the State v. Edrissa Jarju and Edrissa Jaiteh, both NDEA officers accused of 
</p>
<p>murder, were tried on a murder charge before the High Court of The Gambia. Even though 
</p>
<p>they were acquitted, the State filed a motion for appeal against their conviction at the Court </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>of Appeal.  It is therefore unfair and inaccurate to conclude that there is impunity for crimes 
</p>
<p>committed by law enforcement officers. In the case of Cherno Alieu Suwareh, the accused 
</p>
<p>were arrested, charged and prosecuted. Justice took its course when they were acquitted and 
</p>
<p>discharged following a full blown trial.  
</p>
<p>23. In Paragraph 56, the Special Rapporteur has not checked the authenticity or source 
</p>
<p>of the photos to enable him to arrive at the conclusion that they were indeed photos of the 
</p>
<p>dead coup plotters. 
</p>
<p>24. In Paragraph 58, the decision to deny the Special Rapporteur access to the security 
</p>
<p>wing of the Mile II Prisons has no relevance or bearing on the willingness of the 
</p>
<p>Government of The Gambia to receive international assistance to investigate the cases of 
</p>
<p>Mr. Manneh and Mr. Hydara. 
</p>
<p>25. Paragraph 59 to 63 are based on mere speculations. There is no proof to support the 
</p>
<p>allegations made therein.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Accountability for human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>26. In Paragraph 71, we note that all cases involving law enforcement officers where 
</p>
<p>they were alleged to have perpetrated a killing have been investigated and prosecuted. We 
</p>
<p>cannot therefore urge our Courts to convict based on insufficient evidence in an attempt to 
</p>
<p>appease the international community. Where the state has not been satisfied with the 
</p>
<p>decision of the court, it has resorted to appealing the decision.(See paragraph 15 above) 
</p>
<p>27. We reiterate the independence of The Gambian Judiciary, contrary to the allegation 
</p>
<p>of lack of independence made in paragraphs 72.  (See paragraph 6 above) 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>In light of the above responses, we are confident that the Report will be 
</b></p>
<p><b>reviewed and amended accordingly. 
</b></p>
