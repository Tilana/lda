<p>1. In its resolution 9/8 entitled &#8220;Effective implementation of international human rights 
instruments&#8221;, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to report annually 
on measures taken to implement that resolution and on obstacles to its implementation, 
including recommendations for further improving the effectiveness of, harmonizing, and 
reforming the treaty body system. This report briefly highlights the most recent 
developments in this regard. 
</p>
<p>2. Information regarding the twenty-second meeting of the chairs of the  human rights 
treaty bodies, held in Brussels on 1 and 2 July 2010, has been submitted to the sixty-fifth 
session of the General Assembly pursuant to its resolution 57/202. This report (A/65/190) 
also includes information on the outcomes of the tenth and eleventh inter-committee 
meetings of the human rights treaty bodies. The meeting of the chairs was for the first time 
not held in Geneva, the idea being to bring treaty bodies closer to the implementation level. 
</p>
<p>3. During 2010, human rights treaty bodies held 21 sessions amounting to 68 weeks in  
Geneva and New York (each session lasting between one and four weeks),  during which 
138 State party reports were reviewed in plenary sessions. The Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women held one additional session in October 2010, 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child held its three sessions in parallel chambers and 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination extended its sessions by one 
week to address the backlog of reports awaiting review. Treaty bodies received during 2010 
a total of 147 States party reports, including 13 common core documents. 
</p>
<p>4. The treaty bodies continued their work to finalize treaty-specific reporting 
guidelines to complement the guidelines for the common core document. In 2010, the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Human Rights Committee adopted their 
treaty-specific reporting guidelines. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities adopted its rules of procedures and the Committee against Torture adopted its 
amended rules of procedure. Treaty bodies continued to develop, improve and implement 
such new working methods as establishing the list of issues prior to reporting, notably the 
Committee against Torture and the Human Rights Committee, and refining the follow-up 
procedures to concluding observations and decisions on individual communications. The 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination decided that, instead of sending 
lists of questions before the session, the Country Rapporteur would send to the State party 
concerned a short list of themes with a view to guiding and focusing the dialogue between 
the State party&#8217;s delegation and the Committee during the consideration of the State party&#8217;s 
report. Such a list of themes does not require written replies. The Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women decided to improve the format of its 
concluding observations. Both the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women and the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families adopted new general recommendations/comments. Treaty 
bodies and the Secretariat continued efforts to harmonize and standardize their work, 
including through the three-day eleventh inter-committee meeting of the human rights 
treaty bodies and the two-day twenty-second meeting of the chairs.  
</p>
<p>5. Treaty bodies and the Secretariat examined some 11,600 items of correspondence 
and over 150 new individual complaints received by the treaty bodies were registered. The 
Human Rights Committee, the Committee against Torture, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women examined and adopted final decisions on some 110 
communications in total. They issued over 55 requests for interim measures of protection in 
cases where lack of such protection might lead to irreparable harm for the petitioners. They 
also followed up on over 60 decisions in which violations of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture or the Convention on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women had been found.  </p>


<p>6. Six meetings of States parties took place in Geneva or New York during 2010, 
essentially to hold elections to fill seats for which the previous members&#8217; mandates had 
ended (the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women, the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination and the Committee on the Rights of the Child). In the case of the 
Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture the membership expanded to 25 members 
following the entry into force of the Convention for the fiftieth State party and its meeting 
of States parties thus also elected experts to fill the new seats. The membership of the 
Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was enlarged from 12 to 18 following 
the entry into force of the Convention for the sixtieth State party. During 2010, human 
rights treaty bodies also had three informal meetings with States parties which were widely 
attended and provided an opportunity for States parties and treaty bodies to discuss the 
most recent developments in the work of treaty bodies, as well as other matters of common 
interest, in particular the efforts of treaty bodies to improve their working methods (the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, and the Committee against Torture). An open-ended 
working group of the Human Rights Council on an optional protocol to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure met from 6 to 10 December 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>7. OHCHR updated the training tool (DVD) on the work of the treaty bodies, entitled 
&#8220;Bringing human rights home&#8221;, which is available in all United Nations official languages. 
In addition to traditional treaty body support provided by country offices, the Human 
Rights Treaties Division of OHCHR has continued to support in 2010 a number of 
capacity-building activities and training sessions upon requests of State parties, United 
Nations partners and regional organizations, on the common core document and treaty-
specific guidelines, reporting, individual communications and follow-up to 
recommendations in Bahrain; Belarus; Cap Verde; Hong Kong, China; Japan; Kazakhstan; 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; Mexico; Peru; Qatar; Senegal; and 
Turkmenistan. Also, the Division&#8217;s staff trained or presented the work of the treaty bodies 
at specific events upon the request of regional organizations such as the Council of Europe, 
United Nations departments, programmes and specialized agencies, academia and civil 
society. 
</p>
<p>8. On 29 November 2010, OHCHR organized an event to celebrate the twentieth 
anniversary of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, in cooperation with the International Steering 
Committee for the campaign for ratification of the Convention. Participants discussed legal, 
social and practical improvements in the protection of migrants and migration policies 
following ratification; the relationship between international migration, development and 
the protection of human and labour rights of migrants; the application and applicability of 
the standards contained in the Convention, and the current and future prospects for further 
ratifications. 
</p>
<p>9. OHCHR organized a one-day celebration on 29 October 2010 to commemorate the 
100th session of the Human Rights Committee. On this occasion, States parties, United 
Nations bodies and other intergovernmental organizations, national human rights 
institutions, international and national non-governmental organizations and academics were 
invited to join the members of the Committee for discussions on the main following 
themes: identifying and stocktaking the main achievements, constraints and challenges 
faced by the Committee; assessing the implementation of the Covenant in the various 
regions of the world, with examples of achievements and best practices regarding civil and 
political rights; and identifying priorities for future activities of the Committee. </p>


<p>10. From 28 to 30 June 2010, the eleventh inter-committee meeting of the human rights 
treaty bodies was held in Geneva. Two representatives of each treaty body were invited. 
The inter-committee meeting had on its agenda the following issue: preparation and 
analysis as a basis for lists of issues, including lists of issues prior to reporting 
(targeted/focused reports), taking into account the application of the common core 
document and the treaty-specific reporting guidelines. The full report of the meeting and 
the report of the chairs of human rights treaty bodies on their twenty-second meeting are 
available in document A/65/190. 
</p>
<p>11. The significant growth of the treaty body system has prompted the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to request all stakeholders to re-think the future of treaty 
bodies with innovative and creative ideas. On 14 September 2009, the High Commissioner 
in her statement to the Human Rights Council, inter alia, underscored the importance of the 
treaty bodies, both through their reporting and individual complaints mechanisms, as well 
as through the universal periodic review process. She highlighted that the overall success of 
the human rights protection system, marked by the increase in the number of human rights 
instruments and corresponding monitoring bodies, together with greater compliance by 
States parties with reporting obligations, posed greater demands on the treaty bodies and 
her Office. She stated that, while that success was most welcome and encouraging, States 
parties should accede to human rights treaties and other stakeholders to initiate a process of 
reflection on how to streamline and strengthen the treaty body system to achieve better 
coordination among these mechanisms and in their interaction with special procedures and 
the universal periodic review. The High Commissioner made a similar appeal before the 
General Assembly on 21 October 2009. 
</p>
<p>12. A number of consultations organized by stakeholders as a direct response to the 
High Commissioner&#8217;s call have taken place and resulted in the adoption of statements 
which include various proposals to strengthen and streamline the treaty body system. These 
meetings were organized in Dublin in November 2009, for treaty body members, at the 
initiative of the University of Nottingham, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland; in Marrakesh in June 2010, for national human rights institutions, at the initiative 
of the Advisory Council on Human Rights of Morocco, and in Poznan, Poland, in 
September 2010, for treaty bodies chairs, hosted by the University of Poznan and attended 
by five chairs. Furthermore, one year after the Dublin Statement, 21 non-governmental 
organizations have made a written submission to the High Commissioner, in November 
2010, including several proposals to strengthen the treaty body system. States parties will 
be invited by the High Commissioner and the chairpersons of the treaty bodies to a 
technical expert consultation in the spring of 2011.   
</p>
<p>13. A number of other consultations organized by stakeholders, such as United Nations 
entities and civil society actors, are also planned. In addition, OHCHR is organizing a series 
of one-day consultations for treaty body members near Geneva during their respective 
sessions. These consultations aim at providing committee experts with space for creative 
thinking to strengthen and streamline their methods of work and reflect on the future of the 
treaty body system. They also allow committee members to discuss in advance the agenda 
items of the inter-committee meeting. When possible the consultations will bring together 
two committees which sessions overlap. Further to requests for additional meeting time in 
2010,1 the General Assembly requested in a number of resolutions that the Secretary-
General presents concrete and tailored proposals on the human rights treaty bodies, to 
improve their effectiveness and to identify efficiencies in their working methods and 
</p>

<p>meeting time by the human rights treaty bodies (A/65/317). </p>


<p>resource requirements in order better to manage their workloads, bearing in mind budgetary 
constraints and taking account of the varying burdens on each treaty body. 
</p>
<p>14. The High Commissioner looks forward to the culmination of this process of 
reflection. It is her intention to compile the outcomes of these reflections and present them 
to treaty body experts, States parties and all other stakeholders at an appropriate time in 
</p><p>2011.
