<p><b> B. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>6.  On 17 October 2011, the Director of the Human Rights Council and Special 
Procedures Division opened the first meeting of the ninth session on behalf of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. He noted the successful commemoration of 
the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
in New York and highlighted the ongoing celebration of the International Year of People of 
African Descent. He also stressed the need to keep attention focused on victims and to 
implement concrete and effective policies and programmes in order to accelerate equal 
enjoyment of human rights by all. He added that the objective of the High Commissioner 
was to ensure that the follow-up to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and 
the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference was an office-wide priority. In 
this regard, the Director mentioned the three workshops on national plans of action 
organized by OHCHR in Yaound&#233;, Addis Ababa and Saint Petersburg. He underlined the 
importance of the two topics to be discussed at the session, namely, the role of sport and the 
role of education in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. He noted that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference provided a comprehensive agenda 
for advancing the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. He concluded by expressing the hope that practical and action-oriented 
recommendations would result from the session.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Permanent Representative of Djibouti to the United Nations in Geneva, 
Mohamed Siad Douale, was elected Chairman-Rapporteur by acclamation. In his opening 
remarks, Mr. Douale reiterated his strong commitment to the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Statements 
</b></p>
<p>8. The European Union congratulated Mr. Douale on his re-election as Chairperson-
Rapporteur, thanked him for his achievement to date in bringing different delegations 
together on subjects where they sometimes had diverging views, and assured him of the 
support of the European Union and its constructive engagement during the session. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Adoption of the agenda and programme of work 
</b></p>
<p>9. After the election of its Chairperson, the Working Group adopted the agenda for its 
ninth session and its programme of work. The Working Group held its final meeting on the 
afternoon of 10 January 2012. </p>


<p><b> III. Sharing of experience, including on good practices, 
implementation of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference 
</b></p>
<p>10. The representative of South Africa informed the Working Group about a variety of 
measures taken by his country since the adoption of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action, including the enactment of laws, the creation of relevant ministries 
and the establishment of the national human rights commission.  
</p>
<p>11. An observer from a non-governmental organization commended the important role 
being played by those organizations in combating all forms of discrimination, citing as 
examples their role in the anti-apartheid movement and the role played during the recent 
commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>12. The representative of Brazil stated that his Government had launched a national 
campaign to address racism and racial discrimination in the country. He emphasized how  
the Government cooperates with the private sector, namely major Brazilian companies and 
banks, to create job opportunities for people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>13. The representative of France informed the Working Group on a national plan of 
action to combat racism that was being finalized with the participation of such ministries as 
the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Employment and Social 
Affairs and the Ministry of Education, and in cooperation with the National Institution for 
Human Rights and the Haute autorit&#233; de lutte contre les discriminations et pour l&#8217;&#233;galit&#233;. 
</p>
<p>14. The representative of Germany stated that his Government placed great importance 
on fighting all forms of discrimination. Germany had indeed provided financial support for 
the establishment of the database for best practices. 
</p>
<p>15. The representative of Mexico reported on the establishment of a national council for 
the prevention of discrimination in 2010 mandated to fighting all forms of discrimination 
and to promoting best practices. 
</p>
<p>16. The representative of South Africa stated that his country had adopted a national 
plan to implement positive discrimination in the country with a view to bringing adequate 
solutions to victims of discriminations, including white women. He also stressed the 
importance and positive role of the collection of disaggregated data.  
</p>
<p>17. The representative of Kuwait stressed the will of his Government to fight all forms 
of discrimination. In this regard, he underlined the fact that Kuwait had implemented laws 
forbidding religious or racial discrimination and conducted educational programmes 
dedicated to the promotion of human rights in this area.  
</p>
<p>18. The representative of Japan explained that, in 2011, the human rights organs of the 
Ministry of Justice had held nationwide awareness-raising activities throughout the year 
based on the slogan &#8220;Respect the human rights of foreigners&#8221;. He also pointed out that 
labour laws and regulations in Japan were applied to all workers employed by domestic 
entities. 
</p>
<p>19. The representative of the European Union provided examples of actions taken by the 
European Union to combat all forms of discrimination, in particular the mainstreaming of 
non-discrimination in all European Union policies and activities, the award to journalists </p>


<p>focused on discrimination and diversity issues, the diversity charters at the workplace, and 
the European Union framework for Roma integration. 
</p>
<p>20. The representative of Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) reaffirmed the 
commitment of his Government to fight all forms of discrimination by providing 
information about the enactment of the Organic Law against Racial Discrimination. 
</p>

the Development of Indigenous and Afro-Honduran Affairs, and reiterated the advocacy of 
Honduras for a decade for people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>22. The representative of Senegal expressed concern about the plight of migrants all 
over the world and invited States that had not yet adopted relevant instruments for fighting 
all forms of discrimination to do so.  
</p>
<p>23. An observer from a non-governmental organization underlined the need for a decade 
for people of African descent and the creation of a standing forum for them. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Review of progress in the implementation of 
recommendations adopted by the Working Group at its 
eighth session 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Chairperson informed the Working Group on the contributions made to 
OHCHR for the implementation of recommendations adopted by the Working Group at its 
eighth session. OHCHR had made a compilation of contributions received, which is 
available on the website of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>25. The Chief of the OHCHR Anti-Discrimination Section provided an overview of 
activities conducted by OHCHR since the eighth session, focusing on activities carried out 
in the context of the proclamation of the International Year for People of African Descent 
and the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action. He referred to the OHCHR Framework for Action to Combat Discrimination 
against People of African Descent and the thematic discussion devoted to people of African 
descent held by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on 7 March 
2011 and the general recommendation adopted by the Committee in this regard. He 
furthermore reported on the commemoration on 21 March 2011 of the International Day for 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, an event focusing on the situation of people of 
African descent; the electronic toolkit prepared by OHCHR to assist the work of staff in its 
field offices; and the &#8220;Let&#8217;s Fight Racism&#8221; campaign launched in cooperation with different 
departments of OHCHR and the Department of Public Information. Lastly, he informed the 
Working Group on the activities undertaken by OHCHR with regard to the development of 
national plans of action against racism and mentioned the subregional workshops organized 
by the Anti-Discrimination Section of OHCHR in Addis Ababa and Saint Petersburg for 10 
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.  
</p>
<p>26. The Chief of the Anti-Discrimination Section also highlighted that several countries 
in Latin America and Africa had started to elaborate national plans of action and legislation 
against racism and racial discrimination with the technical assistance of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>27. The representative of the European Union reported on initiatives taken at the 
regional level based on written contributions, including existing legislative and policy 
measures on child protection against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, and non-discrimination in the area of employment. 
</p>
<p>28. The representative of Greece stated that the economic impact of discrimination was 
an issue that should also be addressed by the Working Group. </p>


<p>29. The representative of the Russian Federation stated that the workshop held in Saint 
Petersburg had been a success and highlighted the participation of experts, which had 
allowed the broad discussion of issues relating to racism and racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>30. The representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
stated that the workshop organized in Addis Ababa had been an extremely interesting 
OHCHR initiative. She commended both OHCHR and Ethiopia for such an inclusive event 
and raised the issue of possible follow-up to the workshop. The representative also 
provided information about legislative and others measures taken at the national level to 
prevent and combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
including against migrants, such as the adoption of a comprehensive law on hate crimes and 
measures taken to promote racial equality. 
</p>
<p>31. The representative of the African Union provided an update about the organization&#8217;s 
initiatives and cooperation with other regional organizations, including in the fight against 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>32. The representative of the Russian Federation outlined the efforts made by his 
Government to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. The Russian 
Federation attributed an important role to mass media in the promotion of racial equality, 
especially in advertising cultural and social events in line with the approach of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action. Educational programmes taking into account ethnic 
languages, dialects and cultures and dedicated to marginalized people living in the Great 
North of the country were emphasized. 
</p>
<p>33. The representative of Japan referred to the measures taken by his Government to 
protect children and promote the right to education. He pointed out that children of foreign 
origin were entitled to enrol in public schools for their compulsory schooling free of charge 
in accordance with the country&#8217;s obligations under international human rights laws. In order 
to facilitate integration of these children, the education system employed educational staff 
members who speak the children&#8217;s language.  
</p>
<p>34. The representative of Mexico informed the Working Group about the actions taken 
by Mexico to protect children, in particular the measures adopted through the modification 
of the Constitution with a view to promote the right of the child against discrimination. The 
Government had implemented nutrition programmes dedicated to children of migrants and 
specific programmes for indigenous children. Underlining the relationship between 
discrimination and employment, Mexico had launched a labour reform initiative aiming to 
promote social justice and security at work.  
</p>
<p>35. The representative of Argentina outlined the measures taken by the Government to 
implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, in particular the adoption of 
a national plan of action against discrimination in 2005 and the establishment of a national 
institute against discrimination, xenophobia and racism in 1995. He listed the numerous 
laws enacted by Argentina to promote and protect all children, including the children of 
migrants. The representative recalled the commitment of his Government to the most 
important conventions of the International Labour Organization.  
</p>
<p> 36. The representative of Algeria expressed appreciation for the examples of domestic 
anti-discrimination measures provided by South Africa. In the special framework of the 
tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the representative 
asked OHCHR what obstacles had been met in implementing the recommendations adopted 
during the eighth session of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>37. An observer from a non-governmental organization expressed his satisfaction with 
the efforts made by OHCHR to disseminate the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action among Member States and stakeholders. He inquired, however, about the number of </p>


<p>papers published recently concerning the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
and the activities currently under way or planned by OHCHR to promote it.  
</p>
<p>38.  The representative of Senegal expressed satisfaction with the statement delivered by 
Algeria concerning the importance of commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Good and best practices 
</b></p>
<p>39. All delegations welcomed the note prepared by OHCHR. Discussions were held on 
the concept of good and best practices and the perceived risk of establishing standards for 
national practices. Another aspect highlighted was that practices might be deemed to be 
good by policymakers because it suited a certain context but might not be transferable to 
another context or country. Clear indications were also given that the database should be a 
compilation of documents submitted to OHCHR. One regional group clearly indicated that 
it would find useful to have a list of criteria to be used voluntarily by contributors, and 
encouraged the Anti-Discrimination Section to refine the suggestions included in its paper 
further. 
</p>
<p>40. The representative of South Africa stated that the notion of best practices had to be 
defined on the basis of a common understanding, which should be clarified during the 
discussion. He stated that instrumental tools to be used to define this concept were 
important, and added that some forms of universal criteria might be useful. 
</p>
<p>41. The representative of the European Union underlined the need to improve 
contributions. She recalled the request contained in the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action and the outcome document on the creation of a database, stating that the mandate 
of the Anti-Discrimination Section was to create a database that would be useful, and 
stressed the need to elaborate criteria that could be used by States and other stakeholders. 
The criteria would be used by contributors themselves to identify which practices could 
enrich the database; the criteria would not, however, be used by OHCHR to validate or 
reject a practice. The representative added that the definition of a good or a best practice 
would be up to States and other relevant stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>42. The delegate of Pakistan, speaking on behalf of the Organization of Islamic 
Cooperation (OIC) expressed concern about whether the Working group was the 
appropriate forum to discuss the definition of a good practice. He also raised concern about 
the consequences that such a discussion might have on other processes.  
</p>
<p>43.  The representative of Algeria requested that a discussion on the criteria that might 
have consequences on others processes be avoided. She also stressed that what was 
applicable in a context was not necessarily possible in others.  
</p>
<p>44. The representative of Egypt recommended that what constituted a good practice or 
not should not be defined, otherwise it will have implications for the work of other bodies.  
</p>
<p>45. The delegate of Brazil stated that it was an issue that went beyond the capacity of 
the Working group. States should decide if they wished to replicate a practice based on 
their own circumstances and their commitments in terms of fighting racism.  
</p>
<p>46.  The representative of Cuba stated that the aim was not to define what was a best or a 
good practice. This was a national prerogative of Governments, based on their own 
assessment.  
</p>
<p>47.  The representative of the Russian Federation stated that it was up to the State to 
provide the criteria of its own best practices on a voluntary basis.  </p>


<p>48.  The representative of Morocco shared the view expressed by the delegate of 
Pakistan on behalf of OIC. He warned about the establishment of criteria and standards that 
might go beyond the mandate of the Working group. The objective as defined in the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference should take precedence over the 
issue of criteria and standards. This objective was to have a database that would allow 
countries to have an idea of what had been done in other States. He specified that the aim 
was to help countries and Governments by providing them with examples of practices that 
could be used when they design their own national policies and strategies to fight racism 
and racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>49. The representative of Mexico, supported by the representative of Argentina, stated 
that criteria could be useful but that it was not appropriate to discuss their  in the Working 
Group.  
</p>
<p>50.  The representative of Senegal recommended that national experiences should be 
compiled and made available to all States and stakeholders, without any attempt to define 
elements constituting good or best practices. This could be done by the Special Rapporteur 
on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Role of sport in combating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Chairperson recalled Human Rights Council resolution 13/27, in which the 
Council acknowledged that sport could help to spread the values of diversity, tolerance and 
equality, and to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
The Chairperson also referred to paragraph 218 of the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action, and paragraph 128 of the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference.  
</p>
<p>52. Mr. Hansen, on behalf of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for 
Development and Peace, made a presentation on the role of sport in combating racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. He shared examples of good 
practices and possible ways to establish and enhance cooperation among relevant 
stakeholders. Mr. Hansen suggested collaborating also with corporate entities, clubs and 
athletes. 
</p>
<p>53. The representative of UEFA, Mr. Gasser, made a presentation on football and social 
responsibility, while focusing on racism and diversity. He presented the strategic themes, 
partnership and campaigns of UEFA, and the use of disciplinary measures and fines in the 
context of UEFA social responsibility projects and shared additional practices to promote 
respect and combat racism, such as using Champions&#8217; League games, Europe league 
games, posters, captains armbands, clips and match programme editorials. 
</p>
<p>54. Following the above-mentioned presentations, a discussion was held on the 
importance of sport in combating racism and promoting diversity, the need to enhance and 
establish cooperation among States, intergovernmental organizations, international, 
regional and national sporting bodies and civil society, and in particular the need to 
strengthen cooperation between the High Commissioner and the Special Adviser to the 
Secretary-General in combating racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
as articulated by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 13/27.  
</p>
<p>55. The importance of including the issue of racism as one of the strategic themes of the 
Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for Development and Peace was 
highlighted. Many delegates agreed that it would be useful to have, as suggested by one of </p>


<p>the panellists, a compilation of best practices in the field of sport and racism in order to be 
able to identify gaps in this area and suggest relevant actions.  
</p>
<p>56. The Executive Director of FARE, Mr. Powar, emphasized that football was a mirror 
of society, reflecting the social climate of a particular society. Football was practised by 
people of different cultural and national backgrounds. While underlining the existence of 
racism and racism-based events linked to football all over the world, he explained the key 
role of football in combating discrimination. The actions undertaken by FARE to address 
this issue related to information-sharing activities, actions weeks and event organization. 
He explained that the 2011 FARE Action Week campaign had permitted the organization of 
more than 2,500 anti-racism activities in 41 countries in and around football grounds all 
over Europe.  
</p>
<p>57. Ms. Safronova of the anti-racism programme of the Zenit Football Club (Saint 
Petersburg) made a presentation focused on the actions undertaken by her organization to 
fight racism. She underlined the commitment of the Club to address racism issues and 
explained that, in 2001, it had implemented an anti-racism programme allowing football 
players to express their rejection of racism through jerseys and movies. Ms. Safronova also 
provided other examples, such as anti-racism campaigns in the streets of Saint Petersburg, 
the &#8220;red card&#8221; initiative and the official website of the Club publicly denouncing racism-
based events, with the comments of players. She emphasized the institutional cooperation 
between Zenit Football Club and the City of St. Petersburg in the fight against racism and 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>58. Underlining the differences between minority ethnic groups present in Europe and 
those in the Russian Federation, the representative of the European Union asked Ms. 
Safronova which minority ethnic groups were targeted by the Zenit&#8217;s actions.  
</p>
<p>59. The representative of Senegal asked Ms. Sofronova whether the actions taken by 
Zenit Football Club were to be extended to other football clubs in the Russian Federation. 
He also asked Mr. Powar whether FARE led actions to cope with the hooligan issue and 
whether the 41 countries covered by FARE&#8217;s actions were only in Europe. 
</p>
<p>60. The representative of Brazil inquired about FARE&#8217;s partnerships outside Europe.  
</p>
<p>61. The representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
inquired about future actions that could be undertaken by football clubs and associations to 
address racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>62. In his reply, Mr Powar underlined the fact that the aim of FARE was to eradicate 
racism in European society. With regard to hooligans, he explained his organization&#8217;s 
commitment to tackle this issue while recognizing that there was not a necessary linkage 
between hooliganism and racism.  
</p>
<p>63. The representative of France provided some examples of actions taken by the 
Government to combat violence in sports. He stressed the elaboration in 2010 of a plan of 
action to address violence in stadiums, and in 2011 of a national charter for supporters&#8217; 
associations to combat discrimination in sports. 
</p>
<p>64. The representative of the United Kingdom referred to the &#8220;Kick It Out&#8221; programme 
that aimed at combating discrimination and encouraging inclusive practices and work for 
positive change throughout the football, educational and community sectors, 
</p>
<p>65. The Deputy Executive Secretary of the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport, 
Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Directorate of the Council of Europe, Ms. Parayre, 
highlighted the important role played by sport in the fight against racism and discrimination 
and the promotion of diversity, in both professional and amateur sport. She stressed the fact 
that the main challenge lay in the contradiction existing between the values promoted by </p>


<p>sport, including tolerance, and the persistence of racist and discriminatory behaviour on the 
ground. She also reported on the work done by the Council of Europe and its mechanisms, 
especially the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance), in collaboration with 
the European Union to combat racism and discrimination in sport. In this regard she 
stressed that standard-setting, monitoring and awareness-raising initiatives remained the 
main activities of the Council of Europe. She also referred to, inter alia, general policy 
recommendation no. 12 on combating racism and racial discrimination in the field of sport 
of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance. On the issue of the media, 
she underlined the important role they could play in fighting against racism in sport. In this 
regard, she referred to initiatives adopted by the media, including the &#8220;White paper on 
sport&#8221;, &#8220;Speak out against discrimination&#8221; and &#8220;Media against racism in sport&#8221; campaigns.  
</p>
<p>66. The representative of the European Union referred to a study by the Fundamental 
Rights Agency and provided some examples of action taken by the European Union with 
regard to the role of sport in combating all forms of discrimination, underlining article 165 
of the European Union treaties, which provided for measures for the promotion of fairness 
and openness in sport, in cooperation with third countries and relevant international 
organizations. 
</p>
<p>67. The representative of the Russian Federation stressed the importance for his 
Government of making sport a tool to promote peace, equality and mutual respect. He 
referred to Government educational programmes promoting tolerance for civil servants 
working in the field of sport and for young people.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Role of education in combating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Chairperson welcomed the panellists and pointed out the key role played by 
education in social cohesion and a multicultural society without racism and racial 
discrimination. He underlined the importance of education to prepare children to evolve in 
society and of fighting social exclusion by promoting solidarity and tolerance. Bearing in 
mind that education was a relevant tool to promote equality and social justice, the 
Chairperson stressed the need to encourage educational system and training integrating 
values to fight all forms of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>69. The Director of Programme of Community Tampa Bay, Ms. Estevez, stated that 
education had a key role in the fight against discrimination, because it influenced peoples&#8217; 
behaviour and vision. She described the Anytown programme, which was a means to 
promote intercultural dialogue between people of different cultural and national 
backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>70. The Chief of the History and Memory for Dialogue Section at UNESCO, Mr. Iye, 
described the actions undertaken by UNESCO against racism, for example, its commitment 
to mobilize expertise and establish international instruments to combat racist theories as 
well as discrimination in education. Its most relevant instruments included the Convention 
against Discrimination in Education and the Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice. He 
also pointed out that several recommendations made in the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action were addressed to UNESCO and reaffirmed his Organization&#8217;s 
commitment to respond to them. He underlined in this regard the adoption in 2003 of the 
Integrated Strategy to Combat Racism, Discrimination, Xenophobia and Intolerance. Mr. 
Iye informed the Working Group on the educational part of the Slave Route Project, which 
aimed to contribute to a better understanding of the causes, forms of operation, issues and 
consequences of slavery in the world. </p>


<p>71. Speaking on behalf of the African Group, the representative of Senegal, referred to 
his support for education in the fight against racism on condition that effective resources 
are allocated in order for it to have an impact on students, lecturers, teachers and all people 
in society. The representative therefore stressed the need to extend this kind of education 
also to people outside the formal educational system.   
</p>
<p>72. The representative of Brazil stated that education was a good means to fight racism. 
In this regard, Brazil had launched several initiatives with UNESCO, such as the 
publication of anti-racism educational tools for schools.  
</p>
<p>73. The representative of South Africa enquired about the support provided by 
UNESCO to States in promoting educational programmes against racism, and about the 
difficulties met by the Organization when attempting to convince States to use education as 
a tool to combat racism.  
</p>
<p>74. Mr. Iye replied to Senegal and expressed his agreement that education as a tool to 
fight racism should be extended beyond the school. He referred to the efforts made by 
UNESCO to develop means such as multimedia tools to target people outside the formal 
educational system. With regard to the enquiry made by South Africa, the difficulties in 
implementing educational instruments were encountered in cultural environments, because 
educational programmes had to be adapted to cultural contexts; UNESCO therefore 
intended to promote intercultural dialogue and to share good practices among countries and 
regions.  
</p>
<p>75. The Chairperson of the Board Active Citizenship Foundation, Ms. Szelenyi, 
presented different ways to achieve a comprehensive approach to designing education as a 
tool for combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, stating 
that the harmonization of policy, governance and programme elements in education were 
necessary. In order to change and achieve democratic attitudes in children and young 
adults, it was important to adopt an anti-segregation education policy, establish inclusive 
schools, and develop participative school governance. She also highlighted the importance 
of political will and cooperation with civil society to achieve these goals. Ms. Szelenyi 
stressed the fact that history teaching was an instrument of knowledge and dialogue 
contributing to inter-ethnic reconciliation and understanding; collaborative revision of 
history textbooks in order to dispel the erroneous clich&#233;s and prejudices was therefore 
necessary. She added that web-based technology and social media were crucial tools in 
sharing information and knowledge in all settings of education and could play an important 
role in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>76. The Director of the International Institute for the Studies in Race, Reconciliation and 
Social Justice of the South African University of the Free State, Professor Andre Keet, 
made a presentation on the importance of the role of national human rights institutions and 
higher education in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance through education. He presented examples of good practices in the field of 
education from South Africa, and stressed the need to develop a new pedagogy that would 
give educational expression to the objectives of the Durban Declaration and Plan of Action.  
</p>
<p>77. Both Ms. Szelenyi and Prof. Keet stressed the importance of formal and non-formal 
education, and highlighted the need to include democratic citizenship and human rights 
education in the core curricula at schools and universities. They also pointed out the role 
played by teachers and their responsibility as key players in combatting stereotypes and 
discriminatory attitudes.  
</p>
<p>78. Following the presentations, a discussion was held on the importance of education 
as a tool for combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. A 
delegate confirmed the important role that national human rights institutions and civil 
society can play in the field of education and training, and stressed the need to continue </p>


<p>developing international standards in the light of contemporary manifestations of racial 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>79. Several delegates shared examples of good practices from their own countries, such 
as the use of formal and non-formal education in combating racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance; introducing the history of people of African descent, 
immigrants and other vulnerable groups as a compulsory course in curricula; human rights 
courses at universities, and human rights training and seminars for teachers; quota systems 
at universities; and scholarships and incentives for specific vulnerable groups. Other 
delegates mentioned the inclusion of linguistic and cultural objectives in educational 
programmes for immigrants and indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>80. Ms. Osler, Professor of Citizenship and Human Rights Education at the University 
of Leeds, underlined the role played by citizenship education in combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. She explained that citizenship 
education was a tool to combat all forms of discrimination. Bearing in mind the example of 
mass education in Europe in the late nineteenth century which favoured intolerance through 
a strong nationalistic focus, she pointed out that citizenship education should be open to 
national political institutions as well as international entities promoting human rights, such 
as the United Nations or the Council of Europe. Citizenship education therefore needed to 
recreate new, more inclusive national stories and histories, which could contribute to 
challenging exclusive, ethno-nationalistic or xenophobic conceptions of the nation-State. 
She underlined the fact that education for cosmopolitan citizenship was also a way to 
prepare citizens to challenge forms of discrimination and that this kind of education 
encouraged learners to respect diversity at all levels, from the local to the global. Human 
rights education needed to be provided in the earliest years of schooling. Ms. Osler also 
pointed out the relevance of including historical events, such as the Holocaust and other 
examples of genocide, in curricula.  
</p>
<p>81.  Ms. Saura of the Secretariat of Policies for Racial Equality, Division of African 
Descent and National Human Rights at the Ministry of Education and Culture of Uruguay 
recalled the commitment of Uruguay to the fight against discrimination, in particular 
through the enactment of several laws, such as the Law No. 13670 on compliance with the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. She 
pointed out the actions taken by Uruguay to compile official statistics about minority 
groups, create an institution dedicated to the promotion of equality for people of African 
descent and recognize their cultural and historical contributions to Uruguay. She gave 
examples, based on statistical data, on existing inequalities between people of African 
descent, indigenous people and white people in the country. Uruguay had launched a 
national plan of action against racism and discrimination based on the provisions of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. Ms. Saura emphasized the example of study 
grants allocated to students of African descent that allowed them to start and complete their 
studies, and encouraged adults of African descent to finish study programmes even if they 
no longer attended school. Ms. Saura also referred to initiatives taken with the private 
sector to modify educational programmes encompassing racist stereotypes. She also 
stressed that Uruguay had cooperated with UNESCO on the Slave Route Project. 
</p>
<p>82. Both the Head of the Genocide Education Project at the Documentation Centre of 
Cambodia Mr. Dy and OHCHR consultant Dr. Damascene Gasanabo  made presentations 
on the role of genocide education in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, using Cambodia and Rwanda as case studies. They explored ways 
to reconstruct peace and build a collective memory through education and textbooks, and 
highlighted the importance of integrating genocide education into curricula in post-conflict 
and post-genocidal countries to enhance genocide prevention, national reconciliation and 
peacebuilding.  </p>


<p>83. Mr. Dy stated that Governments should allocate an adequate budget to the above-
mentioned, and highlighted the role of non-governmental organizations in the field of 
genocide education. Dr. Gasanabo encouraged the revision of history textbooks on the basis 
of objective research. In the discussion that followed the presentations, delegates stressed 
the importance of history teaching, including genocide education, in combating racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and in the prevention of conflict.  
</p>
<p>84. The Head of the Department of the Committee for External Relations of the City of 
Saint Petersburg, Ms. Sakharova, recalled that the Russian Federation was a country where 
most nations had largely preserved their traditions, languages and religion in a context of 
political and cultural unity within the State. To prevent dissemination of xenophobia and 
racism ideas in the multi-ethnic community of Saint Petersburg, the city had implemented a 
policy of harmonization of inter-ethnic, intercultural and inter-confessional relations. In this 
framework, she pointed out the tolerance programme, which aimed at sensitizing people to 
the importance of mutual ethno-cultural respect based on the values of the multinational 
Russian society. In addition, the government of Saint Petersburg had launched a 
programme to train specialists in the area of intercultural interactions, such as teachers. She 
also referred to, inter alia, specialized educational programmes for high-school pupils, the 
use of the Internet to promote tolerance and the teaching of Russian to migrants. 
</p>
<p>85.  The representative of the European Union enquired about the possibility of 
implementing the tolerance programme at the national level and about cultural projects 
launched for very young children, and also asked whether such programmes promoting 
tolerance had been implemented in other cities of the Russian Federation.  
</p>
<p>86.  The representative of the European Union reported on the activities promoted by the 
European Union to combat racism throughout education, recalling that it had adopted the 
principle of &#8220;non-discrimination mainstreaming&#8221; in all its policies and activities, including 
the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training known as &#8220;ET 
2020&#8221;, adopted in 2009 to support Member States in the promotion of equity, social 
cohesion and active citizenship. The framework had been launched because the European 
Union had recognized that education helped to bring key competences to support 
integration. The representative then referred to several European programmes to reach these 
goals, including the More Inclusion Less Exclusion (MILE) project to ensure that migrant 
children receive an appropriate education to be integrated in their host country; the Europe 
for Citizens Programme, adopted in 2006 to enhance tolerance and mutual understanding 
between European citizens; and the European Social Fund, created in 1951 to promote 
economic and social cohesion.  
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  Presentation and adoption of the report on the ninth session 
</b></p>
<p>87. On 10 January 2012, the draft report was adopted ad referendum, and the Working 
Group decided to entrust the Chairperson-Rapporteur with its finalization. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Final statements 
</b></p>
<p>88. The delegate of the European Union congratulated the Chairperson, other Working 
Group representatives, especially South Africa, and OHCHR for the good outcome of the 
session, and stated that it was her understanding that the conclusions and recommendations 
would be implemented within existing resources. 
</p>
<p>89. The delegate of Italy recalled the commitment of his Government to the fight against 
racism and all other forms of intolerance and discrimination. Italy regarded international 
cooperation in this field as one of the main tools to enhance protection and promotion of </p>


<p>human rights. The Working Group was a venue for sharing good practices on the fight 
against racism among States Members of the United Nations, and also for deepening 
knowledge on such important topics as sport and racism. He also pointed out that, in the 
conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group, there were references to the 
Durban Review Conference, its outcome document, the anniversary of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action and the relevant political declaration. He recalled 
that Italy had taken part in the Durban Conference in 2001 and that the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action contained several paragraphs on the Middle East and that, 
because of these paragraphs, the &#8220;Durban process&#8221; had become a tool to accuse one 
particular country. This was the main reason why Italy had decided not to attend the 
Durban Review Conference in 2009 and part of its preparatory process, nor the latest high-
level meeting in New York. Lastly, he stated that Italy could not accept any document 
adopted in the framework of the Durban process being used in a similar way, and that it 
was his understanding that these conclusions and recommendations did not imply any 
reference to any particular country. 
</p>
<p>90. The representative of Egypt stated that the Working Group did not target any 
specific countries. 
</p>
<p>91. Delegations from South Africa, Pakistan, Cuba and Zimbabwe joined the previous 
speakers to congratulate the Chairperson and regional groups on their efforts and spirit of 
cooperation.

<p><b>this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Working Group stresses the need for a renewed and consistent global

to the Secretary-General on Sport for Development and Peace and other relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>parts of the United Nations to engage with relevant international sporting bodies to 
</b></p>
<p><b>discuss practical measures aimed at combating racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance in sport, such as the development and promotion 
</b></p>
<p><b>of codes of conduct against racism in sport and of international certificates for clubs </b></p>


<p><b>and sports associations cooperating with programmes aimed at eradicating racism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in sports.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C.  Role of education in combating racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>The Working Group reiterates the necessity of taking concrete actions for the 
effective implementation of provisions of the DDPA relevant to the role of education in 
</b></p>
<p><b>combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular paragraphs 121-124, 129 and 132 of the Durban Programme of Action. 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The Working Group emphasizes the importance of the DDPA as an 
instrumental source for education and strongly encourages Member States and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant stakeholders to consider the DDPA and the Outcome Documents of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Durban Review Conference in the elaboration of educational programmes and plans. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>The Working Group recognizes the important role of education in combating 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular in 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoting the principles of tolerance and respect to ethnic, religious and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity and preventing the proliferation of extremist racist and xenophobic 
</b></p>
<p><b>movements and propaganda, especially among the youth.  
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>The Working Group commends the important role played by UNESCO in 
relation to education against racism, in particular the Slave Route Project and its 
</b></p>
<p>theme of &#8220;Breaking the silence&#8221;, which immensely contribute to education on the 
</p>
<p><b>history of slavery and trans-Atlantic, Mediterranean and Indian Ocean slave trades. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>The Working Group further encourages OHCHR to collaborate with UNESCO 
and other relevant stakeholders to design and issue age-appropriate educational 
</b></p>
<p><b>materials aimed at increasing awareness of the DDPA and the OD of the Durban 
</b></p>
<p><b>Review Conference for the use of children and young people and also to disseminate 
</b></p>
<p><b>the aforementioned materials widely, including online.  
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>The Working Group calls on States to ensure equality and non-discrimination 
with regard to access to education, training and career development in education. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group urges States to take all appropriate measures to eliminate obstacles 
</b></p>
<p><b>limiting access to good quality education and further urges States to commit resources 
</b></p>
<p><b>to eliminate, where they exist, inequalities in educational outcomes.  
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>The Working Group also encourages States and relevant stakeholders to ensure 
that women and girls can fully exercise their human rights in all spheres of public life 
</b></p>
<p><b>in line with relevant provisions of the DDPA and the Outcome Document of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Durban Review Conference and thereby promote their access to education and 
</b></p>
<p><b>training at all levels.  
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>The Working Group notes the positive contribution made by the new 
information and communications technologies, including Internet as educational tools, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in combating racism through rapid and wide-reaching communication and 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages all stakeholders, including Governments and OHCHR to use these 
</b></p>
<p><b>technologies to combat manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p><b>and related intolerance in cyber space.   
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>The Working Group invites stakeholders, in particular Governments, to ensure 
cross-cultural interactions and genuine dialogue within educational initiatives as 
</b></p>
<p><b>promoted by the Alliance of Civilizations launched by the SG of the UN in 2006. The </b></p>


<p><b>Working Group encourages Governments to develop creative educational tools to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote appreciation of diversity among youth.  
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>The Working Group emphasizes the important role of formal and non-formal 
education for deconstruction of prejudices, positive change of negative perceptions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhanced understanding and social cohesion. To this end, the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages States to implement educational activities and measures including human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights training at various levels and sectors to prevent and combat effectively racism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</b></p>
<p>131. <b>The Working Group encourages States to promote accurate reflection of 
history in education so as to avoid stereotypes and distortion or falsification of historic 
</b></p>
<p><b>facts, which may lead to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance.</b> 
</p>
<p>132. <b>The Working Group notes the complex linkages between education, identity-
building and outbreak of conflicts. In this regard, the Working Group encourages 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments to ensure that textbooks and other educational materials reflect 
</b></p>
<p><b>accurately historical facts, as they relate to past tragedies and atrocities, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>those falling under the categories listed in paragraph 99 and other relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>paragraphs of the DDPA.  
</b></p>
<p>133. <b>The Working Group encourages the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to assist stakeholders to provide human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>education or training with a strong anti-discrimination component for students in 
</b></p>
<p><b>schools and universities, journalists, state officials, civil servants, judges, law 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement officials and military personnel, humanitarian workers, staff involved in 
</b></p>
<p><b>peacekeeping and peace-building operations, as well as for teachers, trainers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other educators and private personnel acting on behalf of the States. The Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group notes the importance of focusing on effective prevention of racism, racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance during such trainings, in 
</b></p>
