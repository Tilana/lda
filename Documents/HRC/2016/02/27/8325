<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 65/219, the General Assembly reaffirmed its request to the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in mainstreaming the right to development, 
to undertake effectively activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership for 
development between Member States, development agencies and the international 
development, financial and trade institutions, and to reflect those activities in detail in her 
next report to the Human Rights Council. In resolution 65/219, the Assembly also 
requested the Secretary-General to submit a report to the Assembly at its sixty-sixth 
session, and an interim report to the Council on the implementation of resolution 65/219, 
including efforts made at the national, regional and international levels in the promotion 
and realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>2. A note by the Secretariat was submitted to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/18/22) to explain that, in accordance with the practice established on the basis of 
the timing of the reporting cycle, the consolidated report of the Secretary-General and High 
Commissioner on the right to development would be submitted to the Council at the same 
time as the report of the Working Group on the Right to Development in order to allow 
consolidated action by the Council on the same thematic issue.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group on the Right to Development convened its twelfth session from 
14 to 18 November 2011. The Working Group will therefore submit its report on that 
session to the Human Rights Council at its nineteenth session.  
</p>
<p>4. The present report is submitted in accordance with the above-mentioned requests 
and the note of the Secretariat, and also supplements the report of the Secretary-General on 
the right to development (A/66/216) submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth 
session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights relating to the promotion 
and realization of the right to development, including in 
commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United 
Nations Declaration on the Right to Development 
</b></p>
<p>5. As requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 65/219 and by the Human 
Rights Council in its resolution 15/25, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR), in consultation with Member States and other relevant 
stakeholders, launched in early 2011 a far-reaching programme of commemoration for the 
twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development (see annex I). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Communications, outreach and publicity activities 
</b></p>
<p>6. A communication strategy for the anniversary was aimed at increasing global 
awareness, creating wider outreach and building a broader constituency in support of the 
right to development. OHCHR emphasized four messages for the anniversary: first, the 
right to development is a human right; second, this right belongs to everyone, without 
discrimination; third, the right to development is as relevant today as it was on the day the 
Declaration was adopted and responds to contemporary challenges; and fourth, the 
international community must act together in a coherent manner in order to realize the right 
to development. </p>


<p>7. OHCHR prepared and launched a special webpage1 devoted to the anniversary, 
featuring the signature design, statements, feature stories, publicity materials, calendar of 
events and other documentation. The Office also prepared and published on its website and 
disseminated through the social network, including on Facebook and Twitter, 12 stories on 
the content and importance of the right to development. The Office produced and widely 
circulated, in all official languages of the United Nations, public information notes, 
booklets containing the text of the Declaration with relevant photos, and posters. 
</p>
<p>8. Jointly with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, OHCHR 
developed and launched an e-platform introducing the right to development. In addition, the 
Office commissioned the production of a video with anniversary messages on all aspects of 
the Declaration, which was widely circulated though social media, including YouTube, and 
shown at anniversary events around the globe. During the anniversary year, OHCHR 
prepared, contributed and/or delivered 17 oral and press statements and articles  for senior 
officials on the right to development. In addition, OHCHR will release, in 2012, a factsheet 
on frequently asked questions about the right to development and a book containing the 
research work of some 30 international experts. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Events and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>9. OHCHR organized and supported some 20 major international events and many 
pioneering initiatives. The programme of commemoration of the anniversary began with an 
inaugural event organized jointly by the Friedrich-Ebert Foundation on 24 and 25 February, 
in Berlin. The High Commissioner delivered a statementat the event, which was entitled 
&#8220;Twenty-five years of the right to development: achievements and challenges&#8221;<i>.</i> 2  An expert 
symposium, which was part of the event, affirmed the three challenges to the realization of 
the right to development identified by OHCHR: the impasse in the intergovernmental 
debate; the need to mainstream the right to development in the work of the United Nations 
system, thus ensuring policy coherence in the global partnership for development; and the 
need to build a broader right-to-development constituency in civil society.3 
</p>
<p>10. At the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held 
from 9 to 13 May 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey, OHCHR delivered a statement4 and observed 
that human rights, including the right to development, were central to the course of 
development envisaged for the least developed countries for the coming decade; 
highlighted the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development as 
an opportunity to reinvigorate partnerships to build an enabling environment for 
development, inclusive of human rights principles; stressed the linkages between 
development, poverty reduction and gender equality and the contribution of women to 
development; and reaffirmed the commitment of OHCHR to support human rights-based 
development in the least developed countries. In addition to the article by the High 
Commissioner (annex II), OHCHR submitted a written contribution entitled &#8220;The right to 
development approach to a new global partnership for development for the least developed 
countries&#8221;5 to inform the outcome of the Conference. The Istanbul Declaration and 
Programme of Action, adopted at the Conference, embraced a significant number of 
explicit human rights considerations, including the right to development. OHCHR is 
working closely with relevant United Nations bodies, including the  Office of the High

<p>Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and 
Small Island Developing States to ensure follow-up in this regard. 
</p>
<p>11. On 20 May 2011, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted a 
statement on the importance and relevance of the right to development (annex III). 
Following a briefing organized by OHCHR in cooperation with the Friedrich-Ebert 
Foundation for the chairpersons of United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures 
mandate holders on 29 June 2011, the chairpersons of nine United Nations human rights 
treaty bodies issued a joint statement on 1 July 2011, in which they resolved to make a 
concerted effort to promote a development-informed and interdependence-based reading of 
all human rights treaties in order to highlight and emphasize the relevance and importance 
of the right to development in interpreting and applying human rights treaty provisions and 
in monitoring compliance with these provisions (annex IV).<b>  
</b></p>
<p>12. The Economic and Social Council, during the coordination segment of its annual 
substantive session, devoted a special event to the right to development and global 
partnership for development, which was held on 12 July 2011 in Geneva. The event, 
chaired by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, provided an 
opportunity to exchange views on how the promotion of the right to development and the 
achievement of Millennium Development Goal 8 could strengthen each other and how the 
United Nations system could use these synergies in the perspective of 2015 and beyond.6 
The High Commissioner delivered a statement at the event.7<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>13. In accordance with the request made by the Human Rights Council in its decision 
16/117, OHCHR organized, on 14 September 2011, in Geneva, a thematic panel discussion, 
during its eighteenth session, on the theme &#8220;The way forward in the realization of the right 
to development: between policy and practice&#8221;. The panel discussion focused on the 
contribution and potential of the Declaration on the Right to Development to thinking, 
policy and practice in relation to development; how the right to development can be 
implemented in the context of contemporary political, social, environmental and financial 
challenges; and shaping future work on the effective implementation of the right to 
development.8 The High Commissioner participated in and delivered a statement at the 
event.9 
</p>
<p>14. At the initiative of OHCHR, 17 United Nations bodies and system agencies as well 
as other international organizations endorsed, on 14 September 2011, a statement in support 
of human rights-based policy coherence in the implementation of the right to development 
and global partnership for development (annex V). The High Commissioner launched the 
joint statement at the above-mentioned panel discussion .  
</p>
<p>15. OHCHR also organized the fourth session of the Social Forum from 3 to 5 October 
2011, under the chairmanship of Minelik Alemu Getahun, the Permanent Representative of 
Ethiopia to the United Nations Office in Geneva. In the light of the anniversary and as 
decided by the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 16/26, the Social Forum discussed 
the role of civil society in the realization of the right to development.10 As requested in 
resolution 16/26, the High Commissioner submitted a background report to inform the

<p>deliberations of the Social Forum (A/HRC/SF/2011/2). A representative of OHCHR 
delivered opening remarks to the Social Forum.11 
</p>
<p>16. The Geneva office of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Non-Aligned 
Movement cooperated with OHCHR to organize, on 19 October 2011, in Geneva, a round 
table on the theme &#8220;The right to development: constraints and perspectives&#8221;, with a specific 
focus on policy coherence towards the implementation of the right to development in 
Member States of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The themes addressed included 
redeploying resources from disarmament to development, how to reconcile national 
development goals with the economic and financial restrictions imposed by financial 
institutions and recurring financial crises, and the role of States&#8223; leadership and 
independence for the promotion of international development commitments.12 A 
representative of OHCHR delivered a statement at the event.13 
</p>
<p>17. The Inter-Parliamentary Union  in cooperation with OHCHR organized, on 20 
October 2011, in Bern, a seminar on the theme &#8220;Promoting the right to development: the 
role of Parliament&#8221;. The seminar focused on how human rights could be promoted from a 
development perspective, the need to give full effect to civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights for enhancing the realization of the right to development, and the 
contribution of Parliaments to the promotion of the right to development. The role of 
parliamentarians in legislating, policymaking, monitoring and budgeting, as well as the 
current context of multiple crises and growing demands from civil society, dominated the 
discussion. The need for reform of the international economic architecture was also a focus 
of the discussion. The meeting was a useful opportunity to engage parliamentarians in 
addition to Governments, civil society and national institutions.14 A representative of 
OHCHR attended and made a presentation at the event.15 
</p>
<p>18. OHCHR organized a special anniversary event, during the sixty-sixth session of the 
General Assembly, at Headquarters on 8 November 2011. The event, entitled &#8220;The right to 
development at 25: policy coherence in the global partnership for development&#8221;, focused on 
policy coherence and synergies in the agendas of the First, Second and Third Committees in 
efforts to mainstream the right to development and strengthen global partnership for 
development. The event was chaired by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and attended by the Secretary-General, who delivered a keynote statement (annex 
VI). The President of the General Assembly and the Chairpersons of the First, Second and 
Third Committees of the General Assembly also attended and made remarks at the event.16 
The High Commissioner delivered a closing statement at the event.17 
</p>
<p>19. OHCHR also provided substantive and logistical support for the organization of the 
twelfth session of the Open-ended intergovernmental Working Group on the Right to 
Development, which was held from 14 to 18 November 2011. The Working Group was 
chaired by the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations Office in 
Geneva, Tamara Kunanayakam. The High Commissioner attended and delivered opening

<p>remarks at the meeting.18 The Working Group ended its session by consensus adoption of 
its conclusions and recommendations.19   
</p>
<p>20. OHCHR organized an expert panel discussion on &#8220;the right to development at 25&#8221;, 
which was scheduled for 5 December 2011 in New York. The discussion is designed to 
bring together leading thinkers on global issues to address the right to development and 
human-rights based development in the broader context of contemporary global issues, 
including multiple global economic and financial crises. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>21.<b> The twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Right to 
Development provided an opportunity for the international community to reflect on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the lessons learned, achievements made and the potential of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p><b>in addressing contemporary global challenges in an increasingly interdependent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>globalized world. The anniversary led to an unprecedented amount of initiatives and 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities by stakeholders, international organizations, academic institutions, non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations and civil society, as shown in the present report.  
</b></p>
<p>22.<b> Many of the discussions echoed the four key messages that OHCHR 
emphasized at the launch of the anniversary year: development is a human right for 
</b></p>
<p><b>all; the right to development belongs to everyone, without discrimination; the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>development is as relevant today as it was on the day the Declaration was adopted; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and finally, we must act together in a determined and coherent manner in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>realize the right to development. The conclusions of the anniversary events call for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolute transition from theory to action. They have also highlighted the many 
</b></p>
<p><b>stubborn challenges that remain in the path of the meaningful realization of the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to development. 
</b></p>
<p>23.<b> Firstly, twenty five years after the adoption of the Declaration, the 
politicization, polarization and stubborn impasse in the intergovernmental debate on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to development must end. It is imperative that principled common ground be 
</b></p>
<p><b>found, through greater political consensus and more political will. The starting point 
</b></p>
<p><b>for such consensus must be the Declaration itself. 
</b></p>
<p>24.<b> Secondly, we must work to enlarge the organized constituency in support of the 
right to development. Non-governmental organizations and civil society at large are 
</b></p>
<p><b>the engine of human rights. We must heed them, include them and support them in 
</b></p>
<p><b>their work.  
</b></p>
<p>25.<b> Thirdly, the resolution in which the General Assembly established the post of 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights explicitly included the mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>to promote and protect the realization of the right to development and to enhance 
</b></p>
<p><b>support from relevant bodies of the United Nations system for this purpose. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>underscores the seminal importance of human rights-based policy coherence in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>global partnership for development, and requires full mainstreaming of all human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, including the right to development, into the work of the United Nations system, 
</b></p>
<p><b>most importantly in the upcoming quadrennial comprehensive policy review and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the post-2015 development agenda.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Article by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights: </b>&#8220;No real development without human rights&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries 9-
</b></p>
<p><b>13 May 2011, Istanbul, Turkey 
</b></p>
<p>According to the latest UN Human Development Report, the number of 
malnourished people in the world increased from 850 million in 1980 to 1 billion 
worldwide today. There are few statistics that are more disappointing than this. Despite the 
technological revolutions of the past three decades, widening poverty gaps, food shortages, 
economic crises and armed conflicts continue to plague individuals in many parts of the 
world &#8211; and most painfully those living in the 48 least developed countries (LDCs). 
</p>
<p>When one speaks of development, the language used is most frequently that of 
economists, but let us pause for a minute and think about what the main goals of economic 
development ought to be. Development should be about access to opportunities towards the 
constant improvement of human wellbeing, about guaranteeing the right to a life of dignity 
and freedom &#8211; freedom from want, freedom from fear and the freedom to flourish. Indeed, 
development is a right, and it is high-time the language of human rights and a focus on 
human beings forms the core of discussions on development in LDCs. 
</p>
<p>Once every ten years, the international community gathers for a conference to 
address the key issues facing LDCs. This week, the Fourth UN Conference on LDCs in 
Istanbul takes place against the backdrop of much unrest in the Middle East and North 
Africa region. There is no doubt that the denial of people&#8223;s right to development is one of 
</p>
<p>the root causes that sparked off this unrest. People have been taking to the streets because 
of rampant poverty and inequalities, rising unemployment, a lack of opportunities, and the 
chronic denial of their economic, social and cultural, civil and political rights. They have no 
regular channels to express their discontent; they are deprived of the benefits arising from 
the natural resources of their countries, and they cannot meaningfully participate in the 
decision-making process to change the situation. These are exactly the kind of issues 
addressed by the UN Declaration on the Right to Development, which turns 25 years old 
this year. 
</p>
<p>The right to development embodies the human rights principles of equality, non-
discrimination, participation, transparency and accountability as well as international 
cooperation. Some of the basic requirements of the UN Declaration are plainly: to put 
people at the centre of development; to ensure free, active and meaningful participation; to 
fairly distribute the benefits of development; and to respect self-determination and 
sovereignty over natural resources.  
</p>
<p>My message to the LDCs Conference is clear: human rights and the right to 
development must be at the core of development policy. The right to development should 
be at the heart of a strengthened global partnership for development and guide global 
strategy to meet new challenges. It empowers everyone to realize their potential, 
irrespective of personal differences, irrelevant to geographic demarcations and indifferent 
to economic classifications. 
</p>
<p>Realizing the right to development advances more than just human rights. It 
mandates the rule of law and good governance, especially eradication of corruption, at the </p>


<p>domestic level. It applies globally including to the Millennium Development Goals, aid, 
trade, investment, debt, finance, agriculture, technology transfer, intellectual property and 
access to medicines, climate change, and institutional reform.  
</p>
<p>Development strategies that focus on economic growth alone have permitted 
increased poverty and inequality, malnourishment and unemployment, and threats like 
environmental degradation. Poor people, women, children, minorities, indigenous peoples, 
migrants, refugees and persons with disabilities are often left behind. We must realize the 
aspirations of those living at the margins of their own societies - and of the global 
community.  
</p>
<p>Economic growth aligned with the right to development will help realize the UN 
Charter&#8223;s vision for a world in larger freedom, founded on peace, development and human 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p>LDCs straddle the jaggered terrain between a history of hardship and an abundance 
of hope as the &#8222;next wave&#8223; economies for globalization, often blessed with rich reserves of 
</p>
<p>natural resources and untapped human capital, including the energy of a youthful 
workforce. A rights-based approach to development will draw on and nurture this hope. An 
approach of neglect and disdain for human rights can only result in the frustration and 
instability we are seeing in so many countries in recent months.

<p><b>Annex III 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Statement on the importance and relevance of the right to 
development, adopted on the occasion of the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>The 4th of December 2011 marks the 25th anniversary of the adoption by the United 
Nations General Assembly of the Declaration on the Right to Development.a On this 
occasion, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (the Committee) wishes 
to emphasize the close relationship and the complementarity existing between the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (the Covenant) and the 
Declaration on the Right to Development (the Declaration). 
</p>
<p>The Committee recalls that the UN Charter obliges States to take action, individually 
and jointly, for the promotion and respect of human rights and economic and social 
progress. Article 55 specifies that the promotion of full employment and development is 
integral to such efforts.b In 1948, the General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. Its articles 22 to 27 proclaim various economic, social and cultural 
rights, particularly the rights to work, to social security, to an adequate standard of living 
including the rights to food and to housing, to health, to education, and to enjoy and freely 
participate in cultural life. Subsequently, these rights were enshrined and elaborated in the 
Covenant of 1966. The substantive articles 1 to 15 of the Covenant inspired and shaped 
numerous fundamental elements of the right to development.  
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this incorporation of fundamental components of the right to 
development in the Covenant, the implementation of the right to development faced many 
structural obstacles. Article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes:  
&#8220;Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms 
set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized.&#8221; Responding primarily to the special 
</p>
<p>needs and concerns of developing countries, the General Assembly adopted the Declaration 
on the Right to Development in 1986 and expressed its concern about the &#8220;serious 
obstacles to development, as well as to the complete fulfillment of human beings and of 
peoples, constituted, inter alia, by the denial of civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights, and considering that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are 
indivisible and interdependent&#8221;. The Declaration emphasizes that in order to promote 
development, &#8220;equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the 
</p>
<p>implementation, promotion and protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights and that, accordingly, the promotion of, respect for, and enjoyment of certain human 
rights and fundamental freedoms cannot justify the denial of other human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>The Declaration also highlights that development is a multifaceted and participatory 
process. Specifically, the Declaration provides that development is &#8220;&#8230;a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>economic, social, cultural and political process, which aims at the constant improvement of 
the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active, 
free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits 
resulting therefrom&#8221;. Furthermore, the Declaration proclaims that the right to development 
</p>
<p>  
 a General Assembly resolution 41/128, annex. 
 b See the Preamble and Articles 1, 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations. </p>


<p>is &#8220;an inalienable human right&#8221; by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are 
</p>
<p>entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political 
development, through which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully 
realized. 
</p>
<p>The complementarity between the rights contained in the Covenant and the right to 
development in the Declaration is manifest, <i>inter alia</i>, in the correspondence between 
articles 3 and 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development relating to national and 
international responsibilities and article 2 of the Covenant on obligations of States parties, 
including the duty to provide international assistance and cooperation; and in the provisions 
of article 8(1) of the Declaration on the Right to Development and those of the Covenant 
relating for example to ensuring the empowerment and active participation of women, 
disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups, employment, basic resources and 
fair distribution of income, eradication of poverty and the provision of an adequate 
standard of living, including food and housing, health services, education, and enjoyment 
of culture. 
</p>
<p>The Committee, in pursuance of its mandate,c has adopted several General 
Comments and statements which not only complement the substance of the right to 
development but also indicate the ways and means of implementing the fundamental 
elements of the right to development. These include general comment No. 3 on the nature 
of States parties&#8223; obligations (14 December 1990)d and the statements on globalization (15 
May 1998),e poverty (4 May 2001),f and the Millennium Development Goals (September 
2010).g Moreover, in its dialogue with States parties, the Committee also consistently 
recalls the commitment of developed countries to provide at least 0.7 per cent of gross 
national product (GNP) as official development assistance (ODA),h as well as the duty 
incumbent on all States to co-operate in the promotion of development and respect for all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with the UN Charter. The 
Committee considers that the right to development, through the systematic application of 
the core principles of equality, non-discrimination, participation, transparency and 
accountability at both the national and international levels, establishes a specific framework 
within which the duty to provide international cooperation and assistance has to be 
implemented. 
</p>
<p>The Committee, recognizing and reaffirming the linkage and the synergy between 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Declaration on 
the Right to Development, is resolved to continue monitoring the implementation of all the 
rights protected by the Covenant contributing simultaneously to the full realization of the 
relevant elements of the right to development. In doing so, the Committee will, in its

<p><b>Annex IV 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Right 
to Development 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Joint statement of the Chairpersons of the United Nations treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Geneva , 1 July 2011) 
</b></p>
<p>The 4th of December 2011 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption by the 
General Assembly of the Declaration on the Right to Development (the Declaration).a 
</p>
<p>In our capacity as Chairpersons of the United Nations human rights treaty bodies set 
up to monitor the implementation of the core human rights treaty obligations at the national 
level, we welcome the commemoration of this special anniversary of the Declaration. We 
believe that this anniversary provides a unique and timely opportunity to reiterate the 
principles and elements set out in the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>It is significant that the Declaration, in its definition of the right to development,b 
does not reduce development to purely economic aspirations or goals but articulates a 
broad, comprehensive understanding of development at national and international levels. 
The right to development finds clear resonance in various human rights treaty provisions, 
which emphasize the multi-faceted, multi-dimensional and complex nature of development 
processes and the need for development to be inclusive, equitable and sustainable. 
</p>
<p>The Declaration indeed proclaims that all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
are indivisible and interdependent and equal attention must be paid to civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rightsc. In fact, there are many similarities and striking 
complementarities between the Declaration and the human rights treaties. Many elements 
of the right to development are reflected in human rights treaty provisions and 
jurisprudence of treaty bodies, including on self-determination; fair distribution of 
resources; equality and non-discrimination, particularly on grounds of sex, gender, age, race 
and disability; active, free and meaningful participation; accountability and transparency; 
substantive rights relating to adequate standard of living, including food, water and 
sanitation, housing,  health services, education, employment, enjoyment of culture; freedom 
of expression, assembly and association; and international assistance and cooperation.  
</p>
<p>For all the reasons given, we are resolved to make a concerted effort to promote a 
development-informed and interdependence-based reading of all human rights treaties, so 
as to highlight and emphasize the relevance and importance of the right to development in 
interpreting and applying human rights treaty provisions and in monitoring compliance with 
these provisions. In this way, we shall contribute to further the realization of the right to 
development by ensuring that the necessary conditions are in place for achieving economic 
and social progress and development for all, including vulnerable individuals and groups.

<p><b>  Statement made by agencies of the United Nations system 
and other international organizations in support of policy 
coherence in the implementation of the right to development  
</b></p>
<p><b>  (14 September 2011)  
</b></p>
<p>As the United Nations family commemorates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development, we reaffirm the vision of the 
Charter of the United Nations for a world in larger freedom, based on peace and security, 
development and human rights.  
</p>
<p>Since 1986, the Declaration has provided normative underpinnings for a human-
centred approach to development. Human development and human rights are embedded 
and reinforce each other conceptually and in practice, helping to secure the well-being and 
dignity of all people.  
</p>
<p>An effective global partnership for development, underpinned through human rights-
based policy coherence and coordination at all levels, is the very foundation for achieving 
the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals in 
an equitable and sustainable manner.  
</p>
<p>Looking at development as a comprehensive process aiming to improve the lives of 
all peoples around the world our work is guided by key human rights principles of non-
discrimination, equality, participation, transparency and accountability, as well as 
international cooperation.  
</p>
<p>Recognizing the political commitments made in the 2010 MDG outcome documenta, 
which reaffirms the importance of respect for all human rights, including the right to 
development, States also resolved to work together for the promotion of the economic and 
social advancement of all peoples.  
</p>
<p>The United Nations development system and its partners continue to embrace and 
promote this vision around the world by supporting the development of national capacities 
under the principles of national ownership and social, economic and environmental 
sustainability. We resolve to contribute to building resilient and responsive institutions and 
promoting policy coherence in the spirit of a meaningful global partnership for 
development.  
</p>
<p>Together, we are committed to carrying this vision forward and to making the right 
to development a reality for all.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Remarks by the Secretary-General at the General Assembly 
event to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
Declaration on the Right to Development  
</b></p>
<p><b>  (New York, 8 November 2011)</b>  
</p>
<p>Your Excellency, Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the General Assembly,  
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay,  
</p>
<p>Distinguished Chairpersons of the General Assembly&#8223;s First, Second and Third 
</p>
<p>Committees,  
</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,  
</p>
<p>A quarter of a century ago, the Declaration of the Right to Development gave hope 
to millions of people around the world.  
</p>
<p>It brought all human rights together. And it centred development around people.  
</p>
<p>After the Declaration was adopted, it was reaffirmed over and over.  
</p>
<p>At the Rio Conference on the Environment and Development. At the World 
Conference on Human Rights. And in the Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>On paper, the Declaration lived. In practice, it languished.  
</p>
<p>Economic growth and material wealth were mistaken for true development.  
</p>
<p>Visible, accountable hands in government ceded too much to the invisible, 
unreliable hands of the market.  
</p>
<p>Human rights were too often subverted for financial gain.  
</p>
<p>Our environment was sacrificed for the economy.  
</p>
<p>Lavish luxury fed off of deplorable want.  
</p>
<p>In 1986, this visionary Declaration committed the world to true development.  
</p>
<p>By 2011 there has been significant progress. The MDGs galvanized the world into 
action.  
</p>
<p>But for too many people, basic needs are a distant dream.  
</p>
<p>As we meet, calls for change echo across the world.  
</p>
<p>We cannot take refuge in silence.  
</p>
<p>That is why my advice to world leaders is consistent.  
</p>
<p>I tell them to listen.  
</p>
<p>Listen to your people. Hear their concerns. Pay close attention.  
</p>
<p>That is what I do in my travels around the world.  
</p>
<p>In refugee camps. In the ashes of war. In cooperatives and communities. The 
languages are different, but the message is the same:  </p>


<p>Help us to help ourselves.  
</p>
<p>People do not want handouts.  
</p>
<p>They are not interested in charity.  
</p>
<p>All they ask is the right to build their own future.  
</p>
<p>The Declaration demands this empowerment. It states that, &#8220;All human beings have 
</p>
<p>a responsibility for development, individually and collectively.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>Now is the time to realize the Declaration&#8223;s ideals. So that people can live with 
</p>
<p>dignity &#8230; free of want or fear.  
</p>
<p>When we grant people the right to unlock their own potential, we trigger a 
transformation of our world.  
</p>
<p>That is why I am calling for a new social contract.  
</p>
<p>I have just returned from Cannes, where I urged G20 leaders to write this new social 
contract for the 21st Century.  
</p>
<p>Not only for people living in the world&#8223;s wealthiest nations, but for all.  
</p>
<p>I proposed a Global Jobs Pact.  
</p>
<p>We need a recovery that generates jobs, so that growth is sustainable and inclusive.  
</p>
<p>The Social Protection Floor is an important initiative. The specifics change from 
country to country &#8211; but the objectives are consistent:  
</p>
<p>To reduce poverty.  
</p>
<p>To shield people from shocks.  
</p>
<p>And to create equality so that societies can flourish.  
</p>
<p>When the floor is protected, no one will fall through the cracks.  
</p>
<p>Now is the time to invest in development.  
</p>
<p>We must invest in people, especially women and youth. They make up more than 
two-thirds of the global population. But they have more than numbers. Women and youth 
have the ability and energy to drive progress.  
</p>
<p>In the process, they can stabilize whole societies.  
</p>
<p>When we give women equal opportunities, we right a social injustice. When we give 
youth jobs, we transform frustration into production.  
</p>
<p>In this world marred by violence and war, we must remember that development is 
the path to peace.  
</p>
<p>At the same time, as the Declaration shows, peace is a path to development.  
</p>
<p>Our world is drowning in arms. Illegal weapons are flooding markets and wreaking 
havoc on communities.  
</p>
<p>We have to beg for funds for peace operations while military spending tops a trillion 
dollars.  
</p>
<p>Disarmament, economic issues and human rights are all crucial for development. 
That is why I am pleased to be joined today by the Chairs of the General Assembly&#8223;s First, 
Second and Third Committees.  
</p>
<p>When we take on global problems as a whole, the solutions cut across categories.  </p>


<p>The food, fuel and financial crises are undermining the right to development.  
</p>
<p>We are responding by making comprehensive, sustainable development the UN&#8223;s 
top priority. Next year&#8223;s Rio+20 Conference is our chance to define a path to the future we 
</p>
<p>want.  
</p>
<p>Excellencies,  
</p>
<p>Senegalese justice Keba M&#8223;Baye was a champion of the Right to Development.  
</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;To develop is to improve human life.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>And to that end, he called for more than economic development &#8230; more than 
technological progress &#8230; more than material wealth.  
</p>
<p>He called for &#8220;development of the mind.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;Development of thought must go hand-in-hand with technological 
development&#8230; because the two activities sustain each other.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>Today we need more than a meeting &#8211; we need a meeting of the minds.  
</p>
<p>To realize the inalienable right to development &#8211; for all.  
</p>
<p>Thank you. 
</p>
<p>    </p>
