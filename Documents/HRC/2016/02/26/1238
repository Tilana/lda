<p><b>  26/&#8230;  Situation of human rights in Belarus 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the 
provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on 
Human Rights and other applicable human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the General 
Assembly and the Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in Belarus, 
including Council resolutions 20/13 of 5 July 2012 and 23/15 of 13 June 2013, and 
deploring the inadequate response and lack of cooperation by the Government of Belarus to 
the requests of the Council made in those resolutions, including the denial of access to the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus and other special procedures 
mandate holders to the country, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Belarus;1 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at continuing violations of human rights in Belarus, 
which are of a systemic and systematic nature, as well as at the use of torture and ill-
treatment in custody, the lack of response by the Government of Belarus to cases of 
enforced disappearance of political opponents, the impunity of perpetrators of human rights 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>violations, the violations of labour rights amounting to forced labour, the significant gaps in 
anti-discrimination legislation, the pressure on defence lawyers, and the lack of 
participation of opposition political parties in Parliament, urges the Government to 
undertake an electoral reform in line with the recommendations made by the Special 
Rapporteur so as to ensure that elections in Belarus at all levels are in accordance with the 
norms and standards of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and calls 
upon the Belarusian authorities to cooperate fully to that end with relevant United Nations 
mechanisms and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the said 
Organization; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> the Government of Belarus to carry out a comprehensive review 
of relevant legislation, policies, strategies and practices to ensure that the provisions are 
clearly defined, consistent with international human rights law and with their human rights 
obligations and commitments, and not used to impede or unduly restrict the exercise of any 
human right, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the right of peaceful 
assembly and the right to freedom of association, including to form and join a trade union, 
as well as the freedom of the media; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Notes</i> the continued attention paid by the Special Rapporteur to the issue of 
the death penalty in Belarus, and encourages the parliamentary working group on the death 
penalty to expedite its work; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> the Government of Belarus to carry out a comprehensive reform of the 
justice sector and bar associations in order to guarantee the full independence and 
impartiality of the judiciary, the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial and the 
right to an effective review of sentences and convictions by a higher tribunal established by 
law and to freely chosen legal representation throughout all proceedings, as well as the 
availability of information on the implementation of all sentences, while noting recent 
attempts to reform the judiciary; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Strongly urges</i> the Government of Belarus to immediately and 
unconditionally release and rehabilitate all political prisoners, while welcoming the recent 
release of a prominent human rights defender, also strongly urges the Government to ensure 
that those who have been released are immediately and fully reinstated in their civil and 
political rights, to address, through comprehensive, transparent and credible investigations, 
reports of torture and ill-treatment by law-enforcement officials and to prosecute alleged 
perpetrators and punish those found guilty, and to put an immediate end to the arbitrary 
arrest, detention and harassment of human rights defenders, political opponents and 
journalists, to arbitrary travel bans and to other policies aimed at intimidating 
representatives of the political opposition and the media, as well as human rights defenders 
and civil society organizations; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Strongly encourages</i> the Government of Belarus to establish a national 
human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles, and to enhance the 
progress made towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Belarus for a period of one year, and requests the Special Rapporteur to 
submit a report on the situation of human rights in Belarus to the Human Rights Council at 
its twenty-ninth session and to the General Assembly at its seventieth session; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges</i> the Government of Belarus to cooperate fully with the Special 
Rapporteur, including by providing him access to visit the country and the information 
necessary to facilitate the fulfilment of the mandate; </p>


<p>10. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to provide the Special Rapporteur with the assistance and resources necessary to 
allow the fulfilment of the mandate.
