[3]     
The burden of proving that the statements (caution-interview statements and the charge statements) were obtained voluntarily and without oppression is on the prosecution. The burden is also on the prosecution to prove that the statements were obtained without any breaches of their rights, and if there were any breaches, there was no resulting prejudice to the accused. The standard of proof is that of beyond reasonable doubt.

[4]     
In case of Ganga Ram & Shiu Charan v Reginam Criminal, Appeal No. 46 of 1983 on 13/7/1984 Fiji Court of Appeal said:

"It will be remembered that there are two matters each of which requires consideration in this area. First, it must be established affirmatively by the crown beyond reasonable doubt that the statements were voluntary in the sense that they were not procured by improper practices such as the use of force, threats of prejudice or inducement by offer of some advantage  what has been picturesquely described as "the flattery of hope or the tyranny of fear". Ibrahim v R (1914) AC 599. DPP v Ping Lin (1976) AC 574. Secondly, even if such voluntariness is established there is also need to consider whether the more general ground of unfairness exists in the way in which the police behaved, perhaps by breach of the Judges Rules falling short of overbearing the will, by trickery or by unfair treatment. Regina v Sang (1980) AC 402, 436 @ C  E.
This is a matter of overriding discretion and one cannot specifically categorize the matters which might be taken into account".

[5]     
The Pricy Council, in the case of Wong Kam-Ming v The Queen (1980) A.C. 247, P.C., observed that:

[t]he basic control over admissibility of statements are found in the evidential rule that an admission must be voluntary i.e. not obtained through violence, fear or prejudice, oppression, threats and promises or other improper inducements. See decision of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v R (1914-15) AER 874 at 877. It is to the evidence that the court must turn for an answer to the voluntariness of the confessions.

[6]

[78]    
However, all the police officers who gave evidence denied any kind of assault, threat or inducement on 2nd accused. No witness for the prosecution has seen any injury to his face or the eye.

[79]    
The witness Mohammed Munif, the uncle of the 2nd accused also testified that he could observe the 2nd accused and that he had no visible injuries and that he was walking normally.

[80]    
Corporal Irshad Ali, the brother-in-law of the 2nd accused also testified that Nadim, the 2nd accused had no injuries.

[81]    
However, the fact remains that 2nd accused had an injury to his eye when he was taken to the prison on 20th January, 2010 by the police officers. Evidence of the gate keeper and the Nurse Practitioner who saw that 2nd accused had a black eye, was not challenged. Therefore, there is no doubt that the injury to 2nd accused's eye was caused whilst he was in police custody. There was no evidence placed by the prosecution to show how and when this injury was caused to 2nd accused.

[82]    
The only evidence placed before this court as to how and when this injury was caused is the evidence of the two accused persons.

[83]    
It is the duty of the police officers to give proper medical treatment when a suspect is in their custody. That was never done until the accused persons were refused entry by the gate keeper in prison. The injury to the eye of the 2nd accused is consistent with the alleged assaults on the 2nd accused when I consider the evidence of the accused persons.

[84]    
There was no legal representation for 2nd accused in the Magistrates Court. However, Counsel for 1st accused has informed the Magistrate that the confessions were made under duress.

[85]    
According to the evidence of the Nurse Practitioner, although she advised the police to bring the X-rays to see the internal injuries, police have never brought X-rays to her. Although the Nurse Practitioner's opinion on the injuries cannot be taken into consideration as she is not an expert witness, the evidence as to what she saw, heard and perceived can be relied upon and accepted.

[86]    
I am convinced that the 2nd accused has been subject to assault before the confessions and the charge statement were recorded.

[87]    
I disbelieve the evidence of the police witnesses that the 2nd accused was not subject to assaults whilst in police custody.

[88]    
Therefore, I find that the prosecution has failed to prove that the 2nd accused made the alleged confessions, voluntarily. 

[89]    
Hence I find the said confession made in the caution interview statements and the charge statement by 2nd accused is inadmissible in evidence.

[90]    
The 1st accused says that he was assaulted at Border Police Station, Nadi, where he was made to strip naked, physically assaulted, chillie mixed with water was sprayed into his eyes and private parts. He was threatened to confess to the murders. He said that entire interview on 17/1/2010 is a fabrication and he signed due to assaults. He says that he was further assaulted and threatened on his return to CID Headquarters.

[91]    
As I said before when discussing the evidence, the police officers have never taken any of the accused persons to a medical officer. I bear in mind that 1st accused has not requested to be medically examined when he was produced before the Magistrate. However, he had complained that confessions were recorded under duress and it was a fabrication.

[92]    
He has complained to the Prison gate keeper that he was assaulted by the police and that he wanted to be medically examined. He has complained to the Nurse Practitioner that he was assaulted by police officers in Nadi. Nurse Practitioner has recorded that and advised the police officers to bring the X-rays back to her. Although the X-rays were done, it was not taken back to the Nurse Practitioner or a medical officer by the police. 2nd accused has complained to the Nurse Practitioner that he has tenderness and palpation of the back and chest. After making preliminary investigation and observations only, the Nurse Practitioner has ordered the X-ray to be taken and brought back to her.

[93]    
According to the evidence of the 1st accused as well as the 2nd accused, no weapon was used by the police officers to assault the accused persons, except using of capsicum spray and chillies. Therefore the complaint of the 1st accused to the gate keeper and the Nurse Practitioner are consistent with the evidence of assault given by the accused persons.

[94]    
I have carefully considered the evidence of the police witnesses that the 1st accused was never assaulted.

[95]    
Both accused persons testified that they were taken to the building near the Nadi Airport. Also police witnesses, except one, denied that they were taken to a building near Nadi Airport and said that the accused persons were taken to Ba Police Station straight from Nadi Police Station.

[96]    
The police witness, Inspector Iqbal Khan clearly stated that they went to the Border Police Station at Nadi Airport and that the 1st accused was picked up from there. 

[97]    
However both accused persons testified that the 1st accused was picked up at Nadi Police Station and that only thereafter they were taken to Border Police Station in separate vehicles.

[98]    
The prosecution witness D/Cpl Mahesh Chand who drove the TCU vehicle said that he is 'pretty sure' that he never stopped at Nadi Police Station. However, all other police witnesses who travelled in the vehicle including ASP Abdul Khan testified that they stopped at Nadi Police Station to pick 1st accused. Even the accused persons have testified that 1st accused was picked up at Nadi Police Station.

[99]    
It was alleged by the 2nd accused that at Lami Police Station, ASP Abdul Khan and other police officers took him to a room upstairs where he was assaulted. Also ASP Abdul Khan said in evidence that at Lami Police Station he did not have any contact with 2nd accused. Further he said that he did not go inside the Lami Police Station and that he was inside the vehicle parked in front of Lami Police Station facing the charge room.

[100]   
However, the witness D/C 3581 Nancy Komaitai said in evidence that ASP Abdul Khan went inside the Lami Police Station and further said that ASP Abdul Khan was one of the officers who took the accused into the Lami Police Station.

[101]   
Police officers are expected to make their notes when they conduct or assist investigations. However, the evidence of the police witnesses for the prosecution especially the evidence of the officers of the TCU who assisted the investigation was unsatisfactory, tainted with contradictions which affects their credibility. 

[102]   
I have observed the demeanor and deportment of the 1st accused and the way he faced the cross-examination by the prosecution. I am convinced that the 1st accused was subject to assault and oppression prior to the alleged confessions in the caution interview statements and the charge statement were recorded and signed and that he signed the confessions due to those assaults and oppression.

[103]   
I am inclined to accept the evidence of 1st accused that he was assaulted and oppressed and I find that the physical pain which he has complained of is consistent with the manner of assault said to have been received by him. Prosecution has not displaced this evidence.

[104]   
Therefore I find that the prosecution has failed to prove that the above confessions in the caution interview statements and the charge statement of the 1st accused were made voluntarily.

[105]   
Hence I hold that the said confessionary statements are inadmissible in evidence.
