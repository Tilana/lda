Acquisition of Hamilton Investment Group, Inc.
On August 12, 2014, we consummated the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of all of the outstanding
stock of Hamilton Investment Group, Inc.  (“Hamilton”) pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase
Agreement dated August 11, 2014 by and among the registrant, Hamilton and the stockholders of
Hamilton (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). The purchase price consisted of: (a) Cash in the
amount of $9,000,000; and (b) 3,523,554 shares (the “Shares”) of the registrant’s common stock
($2,300,000 value based on the trailing 20-day average of the registrant’s common stock).  In
addition, there exists a working capital adjustment provision whereby we would be required to
pay the former Hamilton stockholders additional cash equal to the amount of any working capital
of Hamilton in excess of $2,200,000 (“Working Capital Target”) at closing; provided, however,
that  in  the  event  that  Hamilton’s  working  capital  is  less  than  the  Working  Capital  Target  at
closing, then the amount of such deficit will be offset against the Shares issued to the former
Hamilton stockholders at closing
A summary of the pro forma purchase price allocation as of June 30, 2014 is as follows:

Heartland Bank Credit Facility
On August 12, 2014, HII Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
(collectively, the “Borrower”) entered a senior secured credit facility (the “Facility”) with Heartland
Bank as Agent consisting of (i) a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Heartland Bank
for a 3-year $12 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) and (ii) an account purchase agreement (the
“Purchase Agreement”) with Heartland Bank, as agent for the purchase and sale of approved
receivables of Borrower in amounts not to exceed $6 million. The proceeds of borrowings under
the Facility may be used for the payment of a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of
Hamilton Investment Group; the refinance of outstanding debt under Borrower’s prior accounts
receivable facility; working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries; funding of the debt
service reserve account and payment of all costs and expenses arising in connection with the
negotiation of the Credit Agreement and related documents. On the closing date, the Borrower
received proceeds of $12 million under the Credit Agreement and approximately $4.65 million
under  the  Purchase  Agreement.    The  Company  utilized  $9  million  to  pay  a  portion  of  the
purchase price for the Hamilton acquisition, approximately $4.75 million to payoff the Borrower’s
prior  accounts  receivable  facility,  $450,000  in  commitment  fees,  $675,000  to  fund  Borrower’s
debt  service  reserve  account  and  approximately  $190,000  in  other  expenses  related  to  the
Facility.  Borrower retained approximately $1.625 million for working capital.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to WSJ prime
plus a spread that ranges from 5.50% to 8.25% per annum depending on the Borrower’s first lien
leverage ratio (provided that at no time shall the WSJ prime be less than 4%). The Term Loan
requires  monthly  interest  payments,  quarterly  principal  payments  of  $300,000  and  a  balloon
payment on the August 12, 2017 maturity date.  The Term Loan may be increased by up to an
additional  $10  million  upon  request  and  agreement  by  the  Lenders,  but  is  not  a  committed
amount under the facility.
Under  the  Purchase  Agreement,  all  approved  receivables  will  be  purchased  by  the  lenders
thereunder for the face amount of such receivable less the lender’s 1.50% service charge.   In
addition, the Purchase Agreement requires a 10% reserve against receivables purchased, which
amount  will  increase  to  25  and  50%  for  receivables  outstanding  past  60  and  90  days,
respectively.    The  account  purchase  facility  replaces  the  Company’s  previous  senior  secured
revolving facility.
The Facility is secured by all of the Borrower’s assets as well as a pledge of the Company’s
equity in each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  The Company paid a cash structuring fee of
$450,000 to the Lenders and also issued a 4-year warrant to purchase 2.5 million shares of the
Company’s common stock with an exercise price $1.00 per share in connection with the Facility,
resulting in a debt discount equal to the relative fair value of the warrants of $1,293,679.
