EXPLANATORY NOTE
Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) is filing this Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K/A (this “Amended Form
10-K”) to amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) on March 3, 2016 (the “Original Form 10-K”), solely in response to comments received from the staff of the SEC. In response to
the comments, the Company amended and restated the disclosures in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations, of the Original Form 10-K to expand and revise its disclosures primarily with respect to its presentation of non-GAAP financial
measures.
In accordance with Rule 12b-15 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Item 7 of Part II and Item 15 of Part III of the Original
Form 10-K are hereby amended and restated in their entirety. As the Amended Form 10-K relates only to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 15, Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, the previously issued consolidated
financial statements and footnotes to the Original Form 10-K are unchanged. This Amended Form 10-K does not amend or otherwise update any other
information in the Original Form 10-K. Accordingly, this Amended Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the Original Form 10-K and with our
subsequent filings with the SEC. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Original Form 10-K.
PART II 
Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
We are a growth-oriented company based in Houston, Texas that manages and maintains interests in energy and infrastructure businesses. We were
created through the successful reorganization of Delta Petroleum Corporation ("Delta") in August 2012. The reorganization converted approximately
$265 million of unsecured debt to equity and allowed us to preserve significant tax attributes. We changed our name from Par Petroleum Corporation to
Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. effective October 20, 2015.
Our business is organized into three primary operating segments:
1) Refining - Our refinery in Kapolei, Hawaii produces ultra-low sulfur diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, marine fuel and other associated refined products
primarily for consumption in Hawaii.
2) Retail - Our retail outlets sell gasoline, diesel and retail merchandise throughout the island of Oahu as well as the neighboring islands of Maui, Hawaii
and Kauai. Our retail network includes Tesoro and "76" branded retail sites, company-operated convenience stores, sites operated in cooperation with
7-Eleven and other sites operated by third parties.
3) Logistics - We own and operate refined products terminals, pipelines, a single-point mooring and trucking operations to distribute refined products
throughout the island of Oahu as well as the neighboring islands of Maui, Hawaii, Molokai and Kauai.
1
We also own an equity investment in Laramie Energy, a joint venture entity focused on producing natural gas in Garfield, Mesa and Rio Blanco
Counties, Colorado. On December 17, 2015, we entered into an equity commitment letter with Laramie Energy, pursuant to which we agreed to
purchase certain membership interests of Laramie Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of $55 million, subject to certain financing commitments
by various lenders and additional equity investors, in connection with the closing of a purchase and sale agreement whereby Laramie Energy agreed to
acquire certain properties in the Piceance Basin for $157.5 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The transaction closed on
March 1, 2016 and, upon the closing of the transaction, Laramie Energy assumed ownership and operatorship of the purchased properties and our
ownership interest in Laramie Energy increased from 32.4% to 42.3%.
The refining, retail and logistics segments were established through the acquisition of PHR from Tesoro on September 25, 2013. As a result, our results
of operations for any period after September 30, 2013 will not be comparable to any period before September 30, 2013. 
During 2015, we changed our reportable segments to separate our retail and logistics operations from our refining operations due to a change in senior
leadership, organizational structure, the acquisition of Mid Pac and to reflect how we currently make financial decisions and allocate resources. We
have five reportable segments: (i) Refining, (ii) Retail, (iii) Logistics, (iv) Texadian and (v) Corporate and Other. We previously reported results for the
following three business segments: (i) Refining, Distribution and Marketing, (ii) Natural Gas and Oil Production and (iii) Commodity Marketing and
Logistics. We have recast the segment information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 to conform to the current period presentation.
Please read Note 19—Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed
information on our operating results by segment.
Recent Events
KeyBank Credit Agreement
On December 17, 2015, HIE Retail and Mid Pac entered into a credit agreement with KeyBank in the form of a revolving credit facility with a maximum
principal amount of $5 million and term loans in the amount of $110 million. The proceeds of the term loans were used to repay and terminate the
existing indebtedness under the HIE Retail and Mid Pac Credit Agreements and to pay transaction fees and expenses and to facilitate a cash
distribution to their parent.
Registered Direct Offering
On November 25, 2015, we issued an aggregate of 3.4 million shares of our common stock to certain pre-existing investors and other investors in a
registered direct offering (the “Offering”) at a purchase price of $22.00 per share. The total gross proceeds from the Offering were approximately $74.8
million, before deducting expenses of approximately $1.0 million, for net proceeds of approximately $73.8 million.
Inventory Financing Agreements
On June 1, 2015, we entered into several agreements with J. Aron & Company ("J. Aron") to support the operations of our refinery (the "Supply and
Offtake Agreements"). The Supply and Offtake Agreements have a term of three years with two one-year extension options upon mutual agreement of
the parties. The Supply and Offtake Agreements also include a deferred payment arrangement, whereby we can defer payments owed under the
agreements up to the lesser of $125 million or 85% of the eligible accounts receivable and inventory.
Upon execution of the Supply and Offtake Agreements, we terminated our Supply and Exchange Agreements with Barclays on June 1, 2015, subject to
certain obligations to reimburse Barclays for third-party claims, and the ABL Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a loss
of $19.2 million related to the termination of these financing agreements, which is included in Loss on termination of financing agreements on our
consolidated statements of operations. Please read Note 10—Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements for more
information.
Mid Pac Acquisition
On April 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Mid Pac for cash consideration of $74.4 million. In connection with the acquisition, Mid Pac's pre-
existing debt was fully repaid on the closing date for $45.3 million. The acquisition and debt repayment were funded with cash on hand and $55 million
of borrowings under the Mid Pac Credit Agreement. The results of operations of Mid Pac are included in our refining, retail and logistics segments
effective April 1, 2015. Mid Pac distributes gasoline and diesel through over 80 locations across the State of Hawaii, and owns four terminals. In
conjunction with the acquisition, we also obtained the exclusive rights to the "76" brand in Hawaii through 2024. Please read Note 4—Acquisitions to
our consolidated financial statements for more information.

Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014
Net Loss. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our net loss was $39.9 million compared to a $47.0 million net loss for the year ended December 31,
2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we benefited from favorable market conditions with crack spreads above the five year average which
improved our margins and declining crude prices which reduced our operating expenses. We continued the trend of commercial improvements with
increased on-island sales mainly resulting from a contract with the military for jet fuel and additional fuel volumes as a result of our acquisition of Par
Hawaii. The favorable market conditions were partially offset by losses related to the change in value of our common stock warrants and contingent
consideration, equity losses from our investment in Laramie and losses on the termination of financing agreements as further discussed below.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA was $110.4 million compared to a $9.2
million loss for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change was primarily related to improved crack spreads and lower energy costs resulting from
lower crude oil prices.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was $14.3 million compared to a $38.8 million loss for the year ended
December 31, 2014. The change is primarily related to improved crack spreads and lower energy costs resulting from lower crude oil prices, offset by a
decrease of $58.8 million in our equity earnings from Laramie Energy, largely due to an impairment of $41.1 million, higher depreciation, depletion and
amortization expenses and higher interest expense and financing costs in 2015.
Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013
Net Loss. Our net loss decreased to $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $79.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our
acquisition of PHR in September 2013 had a significant impact on our margins, particularly in our refining segment. During 2014, the Company focused
on building its customer base in Hawaii and its back-office support functions. Also reducing our loss year over year were gains recognized in 2014
related to the change in the value of our common stock warrants and equity earnings from Laramie compared to losses in 2013 as further discussed
below.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For the year ended December 31, 2014, Adjusted EBITDA was a $9.2 million loss compared to a
$30.9 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Adjusted Net Income (Loss ) was a $38.8 million loss
compared to a $53.1 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) was
primarily due to the acquisition of PHR in September 2013.

The profitability of our Hawaii business is heavily influenced by crack spreads in both the Singapore and U.S. West Coast markets. These markets
reflect the closest, liquid market alternatives to source refined products for Hawaii. We believe the Singapore 4-1-2-1 and Mid Pacific crack spreads
(or four barrels of Brent crude converted into one barrel of gasoline, two barrels of distillate (diesel and jet fuel) and one barrel of fuel oil) best reflect a
market indicator for our operations. The Mid Pacific crack spread is calculated using a ratio of 80% Singapore and 20% San Francisco indexes.

Weighted average differentials, excluding shipping costs, of a blend of crudes with an API of 31.98 and sulfur weight percentage of 0.65% that is
indicative of our typical crude oil mix quality compared to Brent crude.
Please see discussion of Adjusted Gross Margin below. We calculate Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel by dividing Adjusted Gross Margin by total
refining throughput. 
Management uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety
of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs
per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refinery including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs,
insurance, utilities and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in Operating expense on our
consolidated statement of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations.
Non-GAAP Performance Measures
Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These
measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and our
calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.
Adjusted Gross Margin
Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as (i) operating income (loss) plus operating expense (excluding depreciation), depreciation, depletion and
amortization, impairment expense, inventory valuation adjustments (which adjusts for timing differences to reflect the economics of our inventory
financing agreements, including lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments and the impact of the embedded derivative repurchase obligation) and
unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives or (ii) revenues less cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) less inventory valuation adjustments, impairment
expense and unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives. We define cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) as the hydrocarbon-related costs of
inventory sold, transportation costs of delivering product to customers, crude oil consumed in the refining process, costs to satisfy our RINS obligations
and certain hydrocarbon fees and taxes. Cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) also includes the unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives and
inventory valuation adjustments just that we exclude from Adjusted Gross Margin.
Management believes Adjusted Gross Margin is an important measure of operating performance and uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate
operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. Management believes Adjusted Gross
Margin provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash
items and timing differences created by our inventory financing agreement and lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the
earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation)
and Depreciation, depletion and amortization.
Adjusted Gross Margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income (loss), net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure
of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross Margin presented by other companies may not be comparable
to our presentation since each company may define this term differently as they may include other manufacturing costs and depreciation expense in cost
of revenues.

Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding changes in the value of contingent consideration and common stock warrants,
acquisition and integration expense, unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, inventory valuation adjustment, impairment expense, loss on termination
of financing agreements, release of valuation allowance due to Mid Pac acquisition and gains (losses) on sales of assets. Adjusted EBITDA is Adjusted
Net Income excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and equity (earnings) losses from Laramie Energy. We believe Adjusted
Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess:
•The financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;
•The ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness; and
•Our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss),
cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation as other companies may
define these terms differently.

Factors Impacting Segment Results
Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014
Refining. Operating income for our refining segment was $71.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $105.2 million compared
to an operating loss of $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in profitability was primarily driven by an 11% increase in
refined product sales volumes, which was compounded by an 18% increase in the percentage of sales of higher margin products, particularly distillate
and gasoline. Additionally, there was an improvement in crack spreads year over year. The 4-1-2-1 Mid Pacific Crack Spread was $8.31 per barrel in
2015 compared to $7.16 per barrel in 2014. A global decline in crude oil prices resulted in a reduction in production costs and operating costs. Brent
crude oil prices averaged $99.45 per barrel during 2014 compared to $53.60 per barrel in 2015, with similar decreases experienced for WTI crude oil

prices. The year ended December 31, 2015 also benefited from $9.8 million in gains on commodity derivatives and there was no such activity for the
year ended December 31, 2014.
Logistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $1.3 million compared to
operating income of $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Profitability of the logistics business is primarily driven by throughput which
increased from 129.7 Mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 146.6 Mpbd for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Retail. Operating income for our retail segment was $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $10.5 million compared to
operating income of $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the acquisition of Mid
Pac which closed on April 1, 2015 and contributed $10.2 million of operating income in 2015 to our retail segment.
Texadian. Operating loss for our Texadian segment was $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $16.4 million compared to
operating income of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the profitability of this segment was primarily due to lower
margins available for moving crude oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast due to market conditions which led to lower cash flows and resulted in
impairment charges. As a result of these market conditions, we canceled the charter on barges used to move crude oil from Canada to the U.S Gulf
Coast resulting in a $2.6 million impairment of intangible assets. These factors, along with the negative cash flows in 2015 and forecasted cash flows for
2016, also resulted in the recognition of a $7.0 million impairment of goodwill associated with the Texadian segment.

Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013
Refining. Operating loss for our refining segment was $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a slight decrease of $1.9 million compared to
an operating loss of $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We purchased our refinery on September 25, 2013 and the results of
operations were only included in our financial statements from that date forward. It took management a period of time build its on-island customer base
and establish a normal crude supply chain as evidenced by the $4.02/bbl improvement in the Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel from 2013 to 2014.
Additionally, operating expenses increased due to a full year of operations; however, there was a $3.5 million increase in insurance costs, $6.0 million
increase in property and local taxes and $3.2 million increase in salaries and wages compared to 2013 annualized expenses. In addition, approximately
$6.0 million of operating expenses were capitalized as inventory costs for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Logistics. Operating income for our logistics segment was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $16.9 million compared to
operating income of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The logistics operations were acquired in the PHR acquisition on September
25, 2013; therefore, the primary driver of the increase in operating income was the inclusion of a full year of operations of PHR in 2014 compared to only
three months in 2013; however some of the increase in 2014 was offset by lower bunkering volume due to fewer cruise ships in Hawaii in 2014.
Retail. Operating income for our retail segment was $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $14.0 million compared to
operating income of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The retail operations were acquired in the PHR acquisition on September 25,
2013; therefore, the primary driver of the increase in operating income was the inclusion of a full year of operations of PHR in 2014 compared to only
three months in 2013. Additionally, management focused on increasing market share and merchandising efforts which resulted in improved results on a
same store basis.
Texadian. Operating income for our Texadian segment was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $11.0 million compared to
operating income of $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower trading differentials on heavy
Canadian crude oil and lower volumes.
Adjusted Gross Margin
Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014
Refining. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $192.4 million an increase of $108.5 million
compared to $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in refined product sales volumes of
approximately 11%, lower production costs due to lower crude oil prices and improved crack spreads. In addition, our product mix for 2015 had a higher
percentage of sales of higher margin products, particularly distillate and gasoline, compared to 2014.
Retail. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $68.3 million, an increase of $23.8 million
compared to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due a 31 million gallon, or 63% increase, in sales volumes,
of which 30 million gallons related to the acquisition of Mid Pac.
Logistics. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $34.0 million, an increase of $3.5 million
when compared to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in crude oil throughput and on-
island sales volumes of approximately 14% and 16% in 2015 as compared to 2014, respectively.
Texadian. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our Texadian Adjusted Gross Margin was a loss of $0.2 million, a decrease of $9.3 million when
compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower rail car revenues and lower margins available
for moving crude oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast due to market conditions.
Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013
Refining. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our refining Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $83.9 million, an increase of $97.5 million
compared to a loss of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of PHR in September
2013.
10
Retail. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our retail Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $44.5 million, an increase of $35.0 million
compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due a 39 million gallon, or a 382% increase, in sales
volumes primarily due to the acquisition of PHR in September 2013 and a renewed focus of retail management on increasing market share and
merchandising efforts post-acquisition.
Logistics. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our logistics Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $30.5 million, an increase of $21.8 million
when compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of PHR in September 2013.
Texadian. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our Texadian Adjusted Gross Margin was approximately $7.1 million, a decrease of $9.6 million
when compared to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower trading differentials on heavy
Canadian crude oil and lower volumes as the Cushing/Hardisty trading differential decreased from $13.31/bbl in 2013 to $10.42/bbl in 2014.
Discussion of Consolidated Results
Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014
Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenues were $2.1 billion, a $1.0 billion decrease compared to $3.1 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to reductions of $921.0 million and $56.7 million in our refining and Texadian segments,
respectively, and were primarily the result of global declines in crude oil prices. Brent crude oil prices averaged $99.43 per barrel during 2014 compared
to $53.58 per barrel in 2015, with similar decreases experienced for WTI crude oil prices. The market decreases were partially offset by increases of
$51.8 million and $12.2 million in our retail and logistics segments, respectively. The increase in the retail segment was driven by the Mid Pac
acquisition, which helped to offset lower prices per gallon. The increase in the logistics segment was driven by higher total throughput which increased
from 129.7 Mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 146.6 Mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2015, which is consistent with an increase in
our refined product sales volume from 69.1 Mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 76.8 Mbpd for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Mid
Pac acquisition closed on April 1, 2015 and contributed a total of $147.6 million in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 of which $54.3
million and $93.3 million was attributed to the refining and retail segments, respectively. Mid Pac also contributed $4.0 million in logistics revenues
which eliminate on a consolidated basis.
Cost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2015, cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) was $1.8 billion, a $1.2
billion decrease compared to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to reductions of $1.0 billion and $48.7
million in our refining and Texadian segments, respectively, and were primarily the result of global declines in crude oil prices as discussed above.
These decreases were partially offset by increases of $28.0 million and $8.8 million in our retail and logistics segments, respectively. The increase in
the retail segment was driven by the Mid Pac acquisition, which helped to offset lower prices per gallon on a cost basis. The increase in the logistics
segment was driven by higher throughput as discussed above. The Mid Pac acquisition contributed a total of $115.4 million in cost of revenues
(excluding depreciation) during the year ended December 31, 2015 of which $45.7 million and $69.7 million was attributed to the refining and retail
segments, respectively. Mid Pac also contributed $3.7 million in logistics cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) which eliminate on a consolidated
basis.
Operating Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately
$141.6 million, a decrease of $5.0 million compared to $146.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower
energy costs resulting from lower crude oil prices due to market prices as discussed above. This decrease was partially offset by incremental operating
expenses of $16.0 million as a result of the Mid Pac acquisition. Additionally, in 2015, we terminated our post-retirement medical plan and recognized a
gain of $5.1 million which was included as a reduction of operating expense (excluding depreciation) on our consolidated statement of operations.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2015, DD&A expense was approximately $19.9 million, an increase of $5.0
million compared to $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to $4.3 million of depreciation, depletion and
amortization on assets acquired as part of the Mid Pac acquisition on April 1, 2015 and various capital projects put in service in 2014 as we built our
back office support and information technology systems, partially offset by $2.1 million lower depletion expense for Point Arguello due to the asset being
fully impaired as of December 31, 2014 and $1.1 million lower amortization of intangible assets due to certain assets being fully amortized as of
December 31, 2014.
11
Impairment expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $7.0 million and $2.6 million related to goodwill and
intangible assets in our Texadian segment, respectively. There was no impairment expense during the year ended December 31, 2014.
(Gain) Loss on Sale of Assets, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2014, loss on sale of assets, net was approximately $0.6 million. The prior period
loss was the result of selling oilfield equipment.
General and Administrative Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015, general and administrative expense was approximately $44.3 million, an
increase of $10.0 million when compared to $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to an increase in
compensation and consulting costs. The increase in compensation costs were due to building our back office support as we exited the transition
services agreement with Tesoro. Previously, the costs incurred under the transition services agreement were included in Acquisition and integration
expense. In 2014, our consulting costs primarily related to acquisition and integration activities; however, in 2015, our consulting costs were included in
general and administrative expense as they primarily related to system modifications and process improvements related to the Supply and Offtake
Agreements.
Acquisition and Integration Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015, acquisition and integration expense was approximately $2.0 million, a
decrease of $9.7 million when compared to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to no expenses
related to the integration of PHR in the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by expenses incurred for the Mid Pac acquisition and integration.
Interest Expense and Financing Costs, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our interest expense and financing costs were approximately $20.2
million, compared to $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance during
the period as a result of the Mid Pac acquisition on April 1, 2015.
Loss on Termination of Financing Agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our loss on the termination of financing agreements was
approximately $19.7 million, which primarily consists of a loss of $17.4 million on the termination of the Barclays Supply and Exchange Agreement and
a loss of $1.8 million on the termination of the ABL Facility. The loss of $17.4 million on the termination of the Supply and Exchange Agreement consists
of a loss of $13.3 million for the cash settlement value of the liability and recognition of $5.6 million of deferred financing costs, partially offset by a $1.5
million exit fee received from Barclays. The loss on the termination of the ABL Facility consisted of the recognition of deferred financing costs. For the
year ended December 31, 2014, our loss on the termination of financing agreements was approximately $1.8 million as a result of our termination of our
bridge loan agreement entered into in 2014. Please read Note 11—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.
Change in Value of Common Stock Warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a loss
of approximately $3.7 million, a change of $8.1 million when compared to a gain of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year
ended December 31, 2015, our stock price increased from $16.25 per share as of December 31, 2014 to $23.54 per share as of December 31, 2015
which resulted in an increase in the fair value of the common stock warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our stock price decreased from
$22.30 per share on December 31, 2013 to $16.25 per share on December 31, 2014 which resulted in a decrease in the value of the common stock
warrants. Additionally, the number of warrants outstanding has decreased over the two year period due to certain warrant holders exercising their
warrants.
Change in Value of Contingent Consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the change in value of our contingent consideration liability
resulted in a loss of approximately $18.5 million, a change of $21.3 million when compared to a gain of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2014. The contingent consideration relates to the acquisition of PHR which occurred on September 25, 2013 and the change in value during the year
ended December 31, 2015 was due to an increase in our actual and expected cash flows related to PHR during the contingency period based on our
actual results.
Equity Earnings (Losses) From Laramie Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2015, losses from Laramie Energy were approximately $56.0 million,
a change of $58.8 million compared to earnings of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is due to losses recognized by
Laramie Energy for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to lower sales prices for natural gas and condensate and an impairment of $41.1 million on
our equity investment in Laramie Energy in 2015. Please read Note 3—Investment in Laramie Energy, LLC to the consolidated financial statements for
further discussion.
Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a benefit for the release of $16.8 million of our valuation allowance as we expect to
be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards to offset future taxable income of Mid Pac. Excluding the impact of releasing
the valuation allowance related to the Mid Pac deferred tax liability, state tax expense was approximately $29 thousand, compared to $455 thousand of
state tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014.
12
Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013
Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues were $3.1 billion, a $2.2 billion increase compared to $886.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of the PHR acquisition which closed on September 25, 2013, therefore, 2013 only
included approximately three months of revenues. Brent crude oil prices averaged $99.45 per barrel during 2014 compared to $108.70 per barrel in
2013 and the 4-1-2-1 Mid Pacific Crack Spread was $7.16 per barrel in 2014 compared to $7.33 per barrel in 2013. The Texadian segment also
contributed $89.0 million to the increase despite an overall decrease in margins as discussed below. The increase was primarily driven by an increase
in sales reported on a gross versus net basis based on the nature of the transactions executed with counterparties.
Cost of Revenues (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2014, cost of revenues (excluding depreciation) were $2.9 billion, a $2.1
billion increase compared to $857.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of the PHR
acquisition which closed on September 25, 2013, therefore 2013 only included approximately three months of activity as discussed above. The
Texadian segment also contributed $100.0 million to the increase in cost of revenues (excluding depreciation). The increase was primarily due to an
increase in purchases reported on a gross basis as discussed above.
Operating Expense (Excluding Depreciation). For the year ended December 31, 2014, operating expense (excluding depreciation) was approximately
$146.6 million, an increase of $113.7 million compared to $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase is primarily due to the
acquisition of PHR in September 2013. Additionally, during 2014, expenses were higher when comparing annualized 2013 PHR expenses to 2014 due
to a $3.5 million increase in insurance costs, $6.0 million increase in property and local taxes and $3.2 million increase in salaries and wages. In
addition, $6.0 million of operating expenses were capitalized as inventory costs for the year ended December 31, 2013.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2014, DD&A expense was approximately $14.9 million, an increase of $8.9
million compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Approximately $8.0 million of the increase related to PHR and primarily related
to the closing of the acquisition of PHR in September 2013.
Loss (Gain) on Sale of Assets, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the loss on sale of assets, net, was approximately $624 thousand as a
result of selling oilfield equipment within our natural gas and oil production segment. There was no significant activity during the year ended
December 31, 2013.
Trust Litigation and Settlements. For the year ended December 31, 2014, there was no trust litigation and settlement expense, compared to $6.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2013. There was no significant activity during the year ended December 31, 2014, as we moved further away from the
date of our emergence from bankruptcy.
General and Administrative Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expense was approximately $34.3 million, an
increase of $12.8 million when compared to $21.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher consulting
expenses related to process improvements and the strengthening of internal controls and $2.8 million in higher stock-based compensation expense.
Acquisition and Integration Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2014, acquisition and integration expense was approximately $11.7 million, an
increase of $1.9 million when compared to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to expenses incurred to
exit the transition service agreement with Tesoro, further integration efforts related to the acquisition of PHR and approximately $7 million of Mid Pac
related expenses.
Interest Expense and Financing Costs, Net. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our interest expense and financing costs were approximately $18.0
million, compared to $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt balance
during 2014 due to additional borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement. Please read Note 11—Debt to the consolidated
financial statements.
Loss on Termination of Financing Agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our loss on termination of financing agreements was
approximately $1.8 million, compared to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. During 2014, we recognized a loss of $1.8 million due to
the termination of the Bridge Loan. During 2013, we recognized a loss of $6.1 million due to the termination of our obligations under the Delayed Draw
Term Loan Credit Agreement.
Other Income (Expense), Net. For the year ended December 31, 2014, other expense was approximately $312 thousand, a decrease of $1.1 million
when compared to other income of $758 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2013. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2013
included a $0.5 million franchise tax refund and $0.2 million in income from a legal settlement that were both nonrecurring. There were no individually
significant items during the year ended December 31, 2014.
13
Change in Value of Common Stock Warrants. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the change in value of common stock warrants resulted in a gain
of approximately $4.4 million, a change of $14.6 million when compared to a loss of $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. During the
year ended December 31, 2014, our stock price decreased, which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the common stock warrants. Conversely, our
stock price increased during the year ended December 31, 2013, which resulted in a loss as the value of the common stock warrants also increased.
Change in Value of Contingent Consideration. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the change in value of our contingent consideration liability was
approximately $2.8 million. The contingent consideration relates to the acquisition of PHR which occurred on September 25, 2013 and the change in
value was due to a decrease in our expected cash flows related to PHR during the contingency period.
Equity Earnings (Losses) From Laramie Energy. For the year ended December 31, 2014, earnings from Laramie Energy were approximately $2.8
million, a change of $5.7 million compared to a loss of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The favorable change was primarily due to
higher realized natural gas prices and derivative gains.
Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded approximately $455 thousand of state tax benefit. The 2014 effective tax rate of
1.0% differs from the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a full valuation allowance against the tax benefit generated by our current operating loss and
various state deferred tax activity. The 2013 effective tax rate was 0.0% and differed from the statutory rate primarily due to a full valuation allowance
against the tax benefit generated by the operating loss.
14
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our debt maturities and debt service requirements, fixed capacity payments and
contractual obligations, capital expenditures and working capital needs. Examples of working capital needs include purchases and sales of
commodities and associated margin and collateral requirements, facility maintenance costs and other costs such as payroll. Our primary sources of
liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, amounts available under our credit agreements and access to capital markets.

The change in our liquidity position from December 31, 2015 to February 26, 2016 was primarily attributable to the expiration of our Texadian credit
agreement in February, our investment in Laramie Energy of $55 million in February, increased availability under our J. Aron deferred payment
arrangement and operating results and normal working capital changes for the period.
As of December 31, 2015, we had access to the J. Aron Deferred Payment Arrangement, the KeyBank Credit Agreement, the Texadian Uncommitted
Credit Agreement and cash on hand of $167.8 million. In addition, we have Supply and Offtake Agreements with J. Aron, which are used to finance the
majority of the inventory of our refinery. Generally, the primary uses of our capital resources have been in the operations of our refining segment, our
retail segment, our Texadian segment, payments related to the acquisition of Mid Pac, cash capital contributions to Laramie Energy and payments of
operating expenses related to our natural gas and crude oil assets.
We believe our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to meet our current capital expenditures, working capital and
debt service requirements for the next 12 months. The funds for the $55 million Laramie Energy capital contribution were raised through our November
25, 2015 registered direct offering. The refinery turnaround costs will be funded through operating cash flows. Additionally, we may seek to raise
additional debt or equity capital to fund any other significant changes to our business or to refinance existing debt. We cannot offer any assurances that
such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost.
Rights Offering
In July 2014, we issued, at no charge, one transferable subscription right with respect to each share of our common stock then outstanding. Holders of
subscription rights were entitled to purchase 0.21 shares of our common stock for each subscription right held at an exercise price of $16.00 per whole
share. The rights offering was fully subscribed and we issued approximately 6.4 million shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of
approximately $101.5 million in August 2014.
15
Registered Direct Offering
On November 25, 2015, we issued an aggregate of 3.4 million shares of our common stock to certain pre-existing investors and other investors in an
offering at a purchase price of $22.00 per share. The total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $74.8 million, before deducting expenses
of approximately $1.0 million, for net proceeds of approximately $73.8 million.
KeyBank Credit Agreement
On December 17, 2015, HIE Retail and Mid Pac entered into the KeyBank Credit Agreement in the form of a revolving credit facility up to $5 million
("KeyBank Revolving Credit Facility"), which provides for revolving loans and for the issuance of letters of credit and a term loan agreement (“KeyBank
Term Loans”), which provided term loans totaling $110 million. The proceeds of the KeyBank Term Loans were used to repay existing indebtedness
under the HIE Retail, Mid Pac Credit and Term Loan and Bridge Loan Credit Agreements and to pay transaction fees and expenses and to facilitate a
cash distribution to their parent. As of December 31, 2015, we have not executed any borrowings under the KeyBank Revolving Credit Facility.    
The KeyBank Term Loans mature in seven years and are fully payable on December 17, 2022. Principal on the KeyBank Term Loans will be repaid
quarterly over the term of the loans. The KeyBank Revolving Credit Facility matures on December 17, 2020 and no more than seven borrowings of
Eurodollar loans may be outstanding at any time. Letters of credit issued under the KeyBank Revolving Credit Facility are not to expire later than 30
days prior to the maturity date of the KeyBank Revolving Credit Facility.
The KeyBank Term Loans and advances under the KeyBank Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate equal to (i) during the periods
such revolving loan or term loan, as applicable, is a Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) during the periods such
revolving loan or term loan, as applicable, is a Eurodollar Loan, the relevant Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Loan for the applicable
interest period plus the Applicable Margin.
Pursuant to the KeyBank Credit Agreement, we are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants affecting our business and
operations, including compliance with an interest coverage ratio of less than 2.50 to 1.00, a debt service coverage ratio of less than 1.25 to 1.00, and a
maximum leverage ratio.
The loans and letters of credit issued under the KeyBank Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in and lien on substantially all of the
assets of HIE Retail and Mid Pac, a pledge by Par Petroleum, LLC of 100% of its ownership interest in HIE Retail and a pledge by Par Hawaii Inc. of
100% of its ownership interest in Mid Pac.
Please read Note 11—Debt in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
Term Loan
On July 11, 2014, we and certain subsidiaries entered into a Delayed Draw Term Loan and Bridge Loan Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement"),
amending and restating a previous borrowing arrangement with the lenders, to provide us with a term loan of up to $50 million ("Term Loan") and a
bridge loan of up to $75 million ("Bridge Loan"). The lenders under the Credit Agreement include ZCOF Par Petroleum Holdings, LLC and Highbridge
International, LLC, who are also our stockholders. Proceeds from the Term Loan were used to fund the additional deposit required by the Mid Pac
merger agreement, to pay transaction costs, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.
In July 28, 2014, the Credit Agreement was amended and we borrowed an additional $35 million ("Advance") under the Term Loan and on
September 10, 2014, we extended the repayment date of the Advance to March 31, 2015.
We had no borrowings under the Bridge Loan and on September 3, 2014, we terminated the Bridge Loan and expensed approximately $1.8 million of
financing costs associated with this loan that is included in Loss on termination of financing agreements in our consolidated statement of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2014.
On March 11, 2015, we entered into a Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement whereby we extended the repayment date of the Advance to March 31,
2016. Upon the execution of the KeyBank Credit Agreement on December 17, 2015, we repaid the full amount outstanding under the Advance on
December 22, 2015.
The Term Loan matures on July 11, 2018 and bears interest at either 10% per annum if paid in cash or 12% per annum if paid in kind, at our election and
has an original issue discount of 5%. The Term Loan is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries, excluding Texadian,
Texadian Energy Canada Limited (“Texadian Canada”), certain of our
16
immaterial subsidiaries and Par Petroleum, LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively “the Guarantors”). All our obligations under the Term Loan are
unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors.
HIE Retail Credit Agreement
On November 14, 2013, HIE Retail, LLC ("HIE Retail") entered into a Credit Agreement (“Retail Credit Agreement”) in the form of a senior secured loan
of up to $30 million and a senior secured revolving line of credit of up to $5 million. On May 15, 2015, HIE Retail entered into an amendment to the Retail
Credit Agreement that terminated the retail revolver, extended the maturity date of $22 million of the existing term loan until March 31, 2022, and
provided additional term loan borrowings of up to $7.9 million, on the same terms as the previous term loan. We repaid in full and terminated the Retail
Credit Agreement in December 2015 upon entering into the KeyBank Credit Agreement and expensed $58 thousand of financing costs associated with
the agreement, which is included within Loss on termination of financing agreements on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
Texadian Uncommitted Credit Agreement
On February 20, 2015, Texadian Energy, Inc. ("TEI") and its wholly-owned subsidiary Texadian Energy Canada Limited, amended and restated their
uncommitted credit agreement. The amended agreement increased the uncommitted loans and letters of credit capacity to $200 million and extended
the maturity date. The agreement expired in February 2016.
Mid Pac Credit Agreement
On April 1, 2015, PHI and Mid Pac entered into the Mid Pac Credit Agreement in the form of a senior secured term loan in the amount of $50 million and
a senior secured revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of up to $5 million scheduled to mature on April 1, 2018. We borrowed the full
amount of the loans at the closing. The proceeds of the loans were used to repay certain existing debt of PHI and Mid Pac totaling $45.3 million, pay a
portion of the acquisition consideration and for general corporate purposes. We repaid in full and terminated the Mid Pac Credit Agreement upon
entering into the KeyBank Credit Agreement and expensed $381 thousand of financing costs associated with the agreement, which is included within
Loss on termination of financing agreements on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Guarantors
In connection with our shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was filed with the SEC on June 1, 2015 and declared effective on June 23, 2015
(“Registration Statement”), we may sell non-convertible debt securities and other securities in one or more offerings with an aggregate initial offering
price of up to $750 million. Any non-convertible debt securities issued under the Registration Statement may be fully and unconditionally guaranteed
(except for customary release provisions), on a joint and several basis, by some or all of our subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries that are “minor” within
the meaning of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The Company has no “independent assets or operations” within the meaning
of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and certain of the Guarantor Subsidiaries may be subject to restrictions on their ability to distribute funds to the Company,
whether by cash dividends, loans or advances. On November 25, 2015, we issued 3.4 million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering
which reduced the amount of securities available for issuance under the Registration Statement to approximately $675 million.

approximately $37.1 million and net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $6.4 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $114.2 million and primarily related to $64.3 million for
the acquisition of Mid Pac, an investment in Laramie Energy of $27.5 million and additions to property and equipment totaling approximately $22.3
million. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and was primarily related to the Mid
Pac acquisition deposit of $10.0 million and additions to property and equipment of approximately $14.3 million. Net cash used in investing activities
was approximately $564.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and was primarily related to the acquisition of PHR for approximately $559.3
million and additions to property and equipment totaling approximately $7.8 million, offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of $2.9 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $60.4 million and consisted primarily of proceeds
from the sale of common stock totaling $76.1 million and net proceeds from inventory financing agreements of $13.2 million, offset by net repayments of
borrowings and deferred payment arrangement of $20.5 million and deferred loan costs of $7.3 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the
year ended December 31, 2014 of approximately $130.1 million consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of common stock totaling $103.9 million
and $26.0 million of borrowings under the Term Loan which were used to fund the Mid Pac acquisition deposit and general corporate and working
capital purposes. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 of approximately $632.1 million resulted from
advances from our supply and exchange agreements totaling approximately $378.2 million, the sale of common stock totaling approximately $199.2
million, additional net borrowings of approximately $35.6 million and the release of approximately $19.0 million from restricted cash held to secure
letters of credit.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital expenditures excluding acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $22.3 million and were primarily related to
our refinery and information technology systems. Our capital expenditure budget for 2016, including major maintenance costs, ranges from $45 to $50
million and primarily relates to scheduled turnaround expenditures, as well as projects to improve our refinery reliability and efficiency and upgrades to
our information technology systems. We also committed to fund approximately $55 million for investments in Laramie Energy.
Additional capital may be required to maintain our interests at our Point Arguello Unit offshore California, but production is not economic in the current
low-price environment and we are not able to estimate the amount of any potential capital requirement. We also continue to seek strategic investments
in business opportunities, but the amount and timing of those investments are not predictable.
Contractual Obligations
         We have various contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual
obligations include future cash payments required under existing contractual arrangements, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may
result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly related to our operating activities. The following table
summarizes the contractual obligations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015. Cash obligations reflected in the

Long-Term Debt (including Current Portion). Long-term debt includes the scheduled principal payments related to our outstanding debt obligations and
letters of credit. Please read Note 11—Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Interest Payments on Debt. Interest payments on debt represent estimated periodic interest payment obligations associated with our outstanding debt
obligations using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015. Please read Note 11—Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further
discussion.
Operating Leases. Operating leases include minimum lease payment obligations associated with certain retail sites, office space and office equipment
leases. Also included in operating leases are two charter agreements associated with our logistics operations.
Capital Leases. Capital leases include minimum lease payment obligations associated with certain retail sites.
Purchase Commitments. Primarily consists of contracts executed as of December 31, 2015 for the purchase of crude oil for use at our refinery that are
scheduled for delivery in 2016.
Laramie Energy Equity Commitment. On December 17, 2015, we entered into an equity commitment letter with Laramie Energy, pursuant to which we
agreed to purchase certain membership interests of Laramie Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of $55 million in support of an acquisition
Laramie Energy completed on March 1, 2016.
Commitments and Contingencies
Inventory Financing Agreements. On June 1, 2015, we entered into several agreements with J. Aron & Company ("J. Aron") to support the operations of
our refinery, (the "Supply and Offtake Agreements"). The Supply and Offtake Agreements have a term of three years and two one-year extension options
at the mutual agreement of the parties. Please read Note 10—Inventory Financing Agreements to our consolidated financial statements for more
information.
Pursuant to the Supply and Offtake Agreements, J. Aron holds title to quantities of crude oil and refined products in exchange for the Company's
obligation to legally repurchase the crude oil and refined products at a later date. Substantially all of the crude oil and refined products inventory in the
refinery storage tanks are titled to J. Aron. Primarily all of the crude and refined products inventory outside the refinery, except for one location, are
owned and titled by the Company. In addition, the Company holds title to inventory contained in the process units during the refining process. The
Company purchases the crude oil from J. Aron as it is discharged from the storage tanks into the process units. After processing, J. Aron takes title to the
refined products stored in our storage tanks until the products are transferred to our retail locations or to third parties.  We currently market and sell the
refined product independently to third parties.
While title to the crude oil and certain refined product inventories will reside with J. Aron, the Supply and Offtake Agreements will be accounted for
similar to a product financing arrangement; therefore, the crude oil and refined products inventories will continue to be included on our consolidated
balance sheet until processed and sold to a third party. Each reporting period, we record a liability in an amount equal to the amount we expect to pay to
repurchase the inventory held by J. Aron based on current market prices.
Environmental Matters. Our petroleum refining operations and third-party oil and gas exploration and production operations in which we have a working
interest are subject to extensive and periodically changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions,
wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent
and the cost of compliance can be expected to increase over time. Our policy is to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital
nature when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates may be subject to revision in
the future as regulations and other conditions change.
Periodically, we receive communications from various federal, state and local governmental authorities asserting violations of environmental laws and/or
regulations. These governmental entities may also propose or assess fines or require corrective actions for these asserted violations. We intend to
respond in a timely manner to all such communications and to take appropriate corrective action. We do not anticipate that any such matters currently
asserted will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
19
Regulation of Greenhouse Gases
The EPA has begun regulating GHG under the CAA. New construction or material expansions that meet certain GHG emissions thresholds will likely
require that, among other things, a GHG permit be issued in accordance with the Clean Air Act regulations and we will be required in connection with
such permitting to undertake a technology review to determine appropriate controls to be implemented with the project in order to reduce GHG
emissions.
Furthermore, the EPA is currently developing refinery-specific GHG regulations and performance standards that are expected to impose GHG emission
limits and/or technology requirements. These control requirements may affect a wide range of refinery operations. Any such controls could result in
material increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions for our business and an increase in cost of the products we produce, which could
have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
On September 29, 2015, the EPA announced a final rule updating standards that control toxic air emissions from petroleum refineries, addressing,
among other things, flaring operations, fenceline air quality monitoring and additional emission reductions from storage tanks and delayed coking units.
Affected existing sources will be required to comply with the new requirements no later than 2018, with certain refiners required to comply earlier
depending on the relevant provision and refinery construction date. We do not anticipate that compliance with this rule will have a material impact on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
In 2007, the State of Hawaii passed Act 234, which required that GHG emissions be rolled back on a statewide basis to 1990 levels by the year 2020.
Although delayed, the Hawaii Department of Health has issued regulations that would require each major facility to reduce CO2 emissions by 16% by
2020 relative to a calendar year 2010 baseline (the first year in which GHG emissions were reported to the EPA under 40 CFR Part 98). Those rules are
pending final approval by the Government of Hawaii. The refinery’s capacity to reduce fuel use and GHG emissions is limited. However, the state’s
pending regulation allows and we anticipate the refinery will be able to demonstrate, that additional reductions are not cost-effective or necessary in light
of the state’s current GHG inventory and future year projections. The pending regulation allows for “partnering” with other facilities (principally power
plants) which have already dramatically reduced greenhouse emissions or are on schedule to reduce CO2 emissions in order to comply with the state’s
Renewable Portfolio Standards.
Fuel Standards
In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (“EISA”) which, among other things, set a target fuel economy standard
of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the U.S. by model year 2020 and contained a second Renewable Fuel Standard
(the “RFS2”). In August 2012, the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly adopted regulations that establish an average industry
fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon by model year 2025. The RFS2 requires an increasing amount of renewable fuel usage, up to 36.0 billion gallons
by 2022. In the near term, the RFS2 will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. The RFS2 may present production and logistics
challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining and marketing industries in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other
parties or purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel, with
potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels.
In October 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the Clean Air Act to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be
blended into gasoline from 10% (“E10”) to 15% (“E15”) for 2007 and newer light duty motor vehicles. In January 2011, the EPA issued a second waiver
for the use of E15 in vehicles model years 2001-2006. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be
addressed before E15 can be marketed on a large scale for use in traditional gasoline engines. Consequently, qualified Renewable Identification
Numbers (“RINS”) will be required to fulfill the federal mandate for renewable fuels.
In March 2014, the EPA published a final Tier 3 gasoline standard that lowers the allowable sulfur level in gasoline to 10 parts per million ("ppm") and
also lowers the allowable benzene, aromatics and olefins content of gasoline. The effective date for the new standard, January 1, 2017, gives refiners
nationwide little time to engineer, permit and implement substantial modifications; however, approved small volume refineries have until January 1, 2020
to meet the standard. The American Petroleum Institute and American Fuel and Petrochemical Association may challenge the final regulation. In
September 2015, our refinery was granted small volume refinery status by the EPA. Along with credit and trading options, potential capital upgrades for
the refinery are being evaluated.
Beginning on June 30, 2014, new sulfur standards for fuel oil used by marine vessels operating within 200 miles of the US coastline (which includes the
entire Hawaiian Island chain) was lowered from 10,000 ppm (1%) to 1,000 ppm (0.1%). The sulfur standards began at the refinery and were phased in
so that by January 1, 2015, they were to be fully aligned with the International Marine Organization ("IMO") standards and deadline. The more stringent
standards apply universally to both US
20
and foreign flagged ships. Although the marine fuel regulations provided vessel operators with a few compliance options such as installation of on-board
pollution controls and demonstration unavailability, many vessel operators will be forced to switch to a distillate fuel while operating within the Emission
Control Area ("ECA"). Beyond the 200 mile ECA, large ocean vessels are still allowed to burn marine fuel with up to 3.5% sulfur. Our refinery is capable
of producing the 1% sulfur residual fuel oil that was previously required within the ECA. Although our refinery remains in a position to supply vessels
traveling to and through Hawaii, the market for 0.1% sulfur distillate fuel and 3.5% sulfur residual fuel is much more competitive.
There will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in the EISA and other fuel-
related regulations. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to
refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels.
Environmental Agreement. On September 25, 2013 (“Closing Date”), Hawaii Pacific Energy (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Par created for purposes of
the acquisition of PHR), Tesoro and PHR entered into an Environmental Agreement (“Environmental Agreement”), which allocated responsibility for
known and contingent environmental liabilities related to the acquisition of PHR, including the Consent Decree as described below.
Consent Decree
Tesoro is currently negotiating a Consent Decree with the EPA and the DOJ concerning alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act related to the
ownership and operation of multiple facilities owned or formerly owned by Tesoro and its affiliates ("Consent Decree"), including the Hawaii refinery. It is
anticipated that the Consent Decree will be finalized sometime during 2016 and will require certain capital improvements to our refinery to reduce
emissions of air pollutants.
We estimate the cost of compliance with the final Consent Decree could be $20 million to $30 million. However, Tesoro is responsible under the
Environmental Agreement for reimbursing us for all reasonable third-party capital expenditures incurred for the construction, installation and
commissioning of such capital projects and for the payment of any fines or penalties imposed on us arising from the Consent Decree to the extent
related to acts or omission of Tesoro or us prior to the Closing Date. Tesoro’s obligation to reimburse us for such fines and penalties is not subject to a
monetary limitation; however, the obligation relating to fines and penalties terminates on the third anniversary of the Closing Date.
Indemnification
In addition to its obligation to reimburse us for capital expenditures incurred pursuant to the Consent Decree, Tesoro agreed to indemnify us for claims
and losses arising out of related breached of Tesoro’s representations, warranties and covenants in the Environment Agreement, certain defined
“corrective actions” relating to pre-existing environmental conditions, third-party claims arising under environmental laws for personal injury or property
damage arising out of or relating to releases of hazardous materials that occurred prior to the Closing Date, any fine, penalty or other cost assessed by a
governmental authority in connection with violations of environmental laws by us prior to the Closing Date, certain groundwater remediation work, the
replacement of underground storage tanks located at certain retail assets and fines or penalties imposed on us by the Consent Decree related to acts or
omissions of Tesoro prior to the Closing Date and to the Pearl City Superfund Site.
Tesoro’s indemnification obligations are subject to certain limitations as set forth in the Environmental Agreement. These limitations include a deductible
of $1 million and a cap of $15 million for certain of Tesoro’s indemnification obligations related to certain pre-existing conditions as well as certain
restrictions regarding the time limits for submitting notice and supporting documentation for remediation actions.
Bankruptcy Matters. We emerged from the reorganization of Delta Petroleum on August 31, 2012 ("Emergence Date") when the plan of reorganization
("Plan") was consummated. On the Emergence Date, we formed the Delta Petroleum General Recovery Trust (“General Trust”). The General Trust was
formed to pursue certain litigation against third parties, including preference actions, fraudulent transfer and conveyance actions, rights of setoff and
other claims or causes of action under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other claims and potential claims that the Debtors hold against third parties. The
General Trust was funded with $1 million each pursuant to the Plan.
The General Trust is pursuing all bankruptcy causes of action, claim objections and resolutions and all other responsibilities for winding up the
bankruptcy. The General Trust is overseen by a three-person General Trust Oversight Board and our General Counsel is currently the trustee
(“Recovery Trustee”). Costs, expenses and obligations incurred by the General Trust are charged against assets in the General Trust. To conduct its
operations and fulfill its responsibilities under the Plan and the trust agreements, the Recovery Trustee may request additional funding from us. Any
litigation pending at the time we emerged from Chapter 11 was transferred to the General Trust for resolution and settlement in accordance with the Plan
and the order confirming the Plan. We are the beneficiary of the General Trust, subject to the terms of the trust agreement and the Plan. Since the
Emergence Date, the General Trust has filed various claims and causes of action against third parties before the Bankruptcy Court, which actions
21
are ongoing. Upon liquidation of the various claims and causes of action held by the General Trust, the proceeds, less certain administrative reserves
and expenses, will be transferred to us. It is unknown at this time what proceeds, if any, we will realize from the General Trust’s litigation efforts.
As of December 31, 2015, a total of twelve claims totaling approximately $23.1 million remain to be resolved by the Recovery Trustee. We have agreed
to settle six of these claims for aggregate consideration of approximately $666 thousand, subject to final documentation and payment, and have filed or
will file notices of objection with respect to liability for the other claims.   
The largest remaining proof of claim was filed by the U.S. Government for approximately $22.4 million relating to ongoing litigation concerning a
plugging and abandonment obligation in Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Lease OCS-P 0320, comprising part of the Sword Unit in the Santa Barbara
Channel, California. We believe the probability of issuing stock to satisfy the full claim amount is remote, as the obligations upon which such proof of
claim is asserted are joint and several among all working interest owners and Delta, our predecessor, owned a working interest in the unit of
approximately 2.4% .
              The settlement of claims is subject to ongoing litigation and we are unable to predict with certainty how many shares will be required to satisfy
all claims. Pursuant to the Plan, allowed claims are settled at a ratio of 54.4 shares per $1,000 of claim. At December 31, 2015, we have reserved
approximately $1.1 million representing the estimated value of claims remaining to be settled which are deemed probable and estimable at period end.
Operating Leases. We have various cancelable and noncancelable operating leases related to land, vehicles, office and retail facilities and other
facilities used in the storage, transportation and sale of crude oil and refined products. The majority of the future lease payments relate to retail stations
and facilities used in the storage, transportation and sale of crude oil and refined products. We have operating leases for most of our retail stations with
primary terms of up to 32 years and generally containing renewal options and escalation clauses. Leases for facilities used in the storage, transportation
and sale of crude oil and refined products have various expiration dates extending to 2044.
In addition, with our Texadian segment and our logistics segment, we have various agreements to lease storage facilities, primarily along the Mississippi
River, railcars, and towboats and other equipment. These leasing agreements have been classified as operating leases for financial reporting purposes
and the related rental fees are charged to expense over the lease term as they become payable. The leases generally range in duration of five years or
less and contain lease renewal options at fair value. Our railcar leases contain an empty mileage indemnification provision whereby if the empty
mileage exceeds the loaded mileage, we are charged for the empty mileage at the rate established by the tariff of the railroad on which the empty miles
accrued.

lease terms in excess of one year are as follows (in thousands):

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations were based on the consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2—Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies of our audited consolidated financial statements included herein. We have identified certain of these policies as being of
particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by
management. We analyze our estimates on a periodic basis, including those related to fair value, impairments, natural gas and crude oil reserves, bad
debts, natural gas and oil properties, income taxes, derivatives, contingencies and litigation and base our estimates on historical experience and various
other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out accounting method. We value merchandise along with spare
parts, materials and supplies at average cost. Estimating the net realizable value of our inventory requires management to make assumptions about the
timing of sales and the expected proceeds that will be realized for the sales.
Our refining segment acquires substantially all of its crude oil from J. Aron under procurement contracts. The crude oil remains in the legal title of J. Aron
and is stored in our storage tanks governed by a storage agreement. Legal title to the crude oil passes to us at the tank outlet. After processing, J. Aron
takes title to the refined products stored in our storage tanks until sold to our retail locations or to third parties. We record the inventory owned by J. Aron
on our behalf as inventory with a corresponding accrued liability on our balance sheet because we maintain the risk of loss until the refined products are
sold to third parties and we have an obligation to repurchase it. The valuation of our repurchase obligation requires that we make estimates of the prices
and differentials assuming settlement at the end of the reporting period. Please read Note 10—Inventory Financing Agreements for additional
information.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. In estimating fair value, we use discounted cash-flow projections, recent comparable market transactions, if available or quoted prices. We
consider assumptions that third parties would make in estimating fair value, including the highest and best use of the asset. The assumptions used by
another party could differ significantly from our assumptions.
We classify fair value balances based on the classification of the inputs used to calculate the fair value of a transaction. The inputs used to measure fair
value have been placed in a hierarchy based on priority. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted, readily observable quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis. We use a variety of methods to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities
acquired in business combinations and evaluating goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. These methods include the cost approach, the
sales approach and the income approach. These methods require management to make judgments regarding characteristics of the acquired property,
future revenues and expenses. There is a significant amount of judgment involved in cash-flow estimates. Changes in these estimates would result in
different amounts allocated to the related assets and liabilities.
At December 31, 2015, we conducted an impairment test related to our equity investment in Laramie Energy. As a result of the decline in commodity
prices during 2015, we concluded that our equity investment in Laramie Energy was impaired and recognized an other-than-temporary impairment
charge of $41.1 million on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. We primarily used a market approach to
determine the fair value of our equity investment in Laramie Energy as of December 31, 2015.
At September 30, 2015, we conducted an interim goodwill impairment test of our Texadian reporting unit due to (i) a reduction in the forecasted results of
operations during our annual budgeting process; (ii) the decision to cancel the charter on the barges used to move crude oil from Canada to the U.S.
Gulf Coast due to lower forecasted commodity prices and (iii) negative cash flows from the business during 2015. Upon completion of the goodwill
impairment test, we determined the goodwill associated
23
with the Texadian reporting unit was fully impaired resulting in a charge of $7.0 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2015. In assessing the value of the reporting unit, we primarily used an income approach with a weighted-average discount rate of 15%.
Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis. In the valuation of the liability for the contingent consideration to be paid for the
acquisition of PHR and of our outstanding warrants, we use simulation models which require management to make estimates of future gross margin,
gross margin volatility and expected volatility of our stock price and a present value factor. Different estimates would result in a change in the fair value
of the amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements.
Derivatives and Other Financial instruments. We are exposed to commodity price risk related to crude oil and refined products. We manage this
exposure through the use of various derivative commodity instruments. These instruments include exchange traded futures and over-the-counter swaps,
forwards and options.
For our forward contracts that are derivatives, we have elected the normal purchase normal sale exclusion, as it is our policy to fulfill or accept the
physical delivery of the product and we will not net settle. Therefore, we did not recognize the unrealized gains or losses related to these contracts in our
consolidated financial statements. We apply the accrual method of accounting to contracts qualifying for the normal purchase and sales exemption.
All derivative instruments not designated as normal purchases or sales, are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their
fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. We have not designated any derivative
instruments as cash flow or fair value hedges and therefore, do not apply hedge accounting treatment.
In addition, we may have other financial instruments, such as warrants or embedded debt features, that may be classified as liabilities when either
(a) the holders possess rights to net cash settlement, (b) physical or net equity settlement is not in our control or (c) the instruments contain other
provisions that cause us to conclude that they are not indexed to our equity. Our former delayed draw term loan facility contained certain puts that were
accounted for as embedded derivatives. We have also accounted for our obligation to repurchase crude oil and refined products from J.Aron at the
termination of the Supply and Offtake Agreements as an embedded derivative. These liabilities were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently
adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period through earnings. 
Asset Retirement Obligations. We record asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) at fair value in the period in which we have a legal obligation, whether by
government action or contractual arrangement, to incur these costs and can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability. Our AROs arise
from our refining, retail and logistics operations, as well as plugging and abandonment of wells within our natural gas and crude oil operations. AROs
are calculated based on the present value of the estimated removal and other closure costs using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate. When the liability is
initially recorded, we capitalize the cost by increasing the book value of the related long-lived tangible asset. The liability is accreted to its estimated
settlement value and the related capitalized cost is depreciated over the asset’s useful life and both expenses are recorded in Depreciation, depletion
and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. The difference between the settlement amount and the recorded liability is recorded as a
gain or loss on asset disposals in our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate settlement dates by considering our past practice, industry
practice, management’s intent and estimated economic lives.
We cannot currently estimate the fair value for certain AROs primarily because we cannot estimate settlement dates (or ranges of dates) associated with
these assets. These AROs include hazardous materials disposal (such as petroleum manufacturing by-products, chemical catalysts and sealed
insulation material containing asbestos) and removal or dismantlement requirements associated with the closure of our refining facility, terminal
facilities, or pipelines, including the demolition or removal of certain major processing units, buildings, tanks, pipelines or other equipment.
