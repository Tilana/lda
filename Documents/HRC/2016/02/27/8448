</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>The modern development enterprise and human rights movement have largely 
</p>
<p>existed in parallel since the Second World War, although they share common goals. 
However, a growing rapprochement between the two fields is gradually occurring. This is 
both as a result of recent discontent with the outcomes of solely economically focused 
development efforts, and the increasing recognition of the important role human rights play 
in securing the basic conditions necessary for living with dignity. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur examines the ways in which human rights, and the right to 
health framework more specifically, can add value to development policies and 
programmes. Using the example of HIV/AIDS, the Special Rapporteur considers projects 
in which a human rights-based approach has been utilized, and explores the value added of 
that approach. 
</p>
<p>The report points to a number of challenges that remain in incorporating human 
rights into development work. In particular, the Special Rapporteur warns against adoption 
of a &quot;culture of evaluation&quot; to the detriment of human rights-based approaches. The report 
concludes with recommendations to the United Nations, and other actors in the 
development and human rights fields, concerning ways to further strengthen the integration 
of development and human rights.   </p>

<p><b> I.</b>&#160; <b>Introduction</b>&#160;
</p>
<p>1. This report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolutions 15/22 
and 6/29. Over the last decade, particularly since the Millennium Declaration and 
formulation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), development and the right to 
health have increasingly converged. Prior to this, the right to health (and human rights more 
broadly) had only occasionally been linked with development despite their largely common 
goals and only recently have significant efforts been made toward fully integrating the two 
disciplines. However, throughout the evolution of the modern development enterprise, it 
has been frequently recognized that health plays a critical role in achieving particular 
development outcomes; conversely, it has been increasingly noted of late that development 
strategies can also have significant positive and negative impacts on the health of 
populations.  
</p>
<p>2. Nearly half of the MDGs address health-related issues, which comprise fundamental 
aspects of the right to health, and the other MDGs address its underlying determinants.  
Moreover, many development programmes and institutions have begun to make use of a 
right to health approach in their practices and programmes. However, much work remains 
to be done, and in this report, the Special Rapporteur seeks to examine and analyze the 
convergences between development and the right to health, to more fully understand what it 
means to take a right to health approach to development.<b> </b> 
3. Broadly speaking, development refers to processes of social change and to projects 
meant to transform national economies, particularly in former colonies or third world 
States.1 A narrower conception of international development evolved after the Second 
World War with the establishment of institutions, policies, disciplinary formations and &#8211; 
most importantly &#8211; practices of intervention aimed toward the alleviation of poverty in the 
third world.2 Although the modern development enterprise found its roots in the same 
conflict as that which gave birth to the international human rights movement, the two 
disciplines have largely existed in parallel and, despite their shared goals, have largely 
remained separate pursuits until recent times. 
</p>
<p>4. The links between health and development have long been acknowledged. It is 
generally recognized that securing a certain level of health-related development is a 
prerequisite for the overall economic development of a country.3 For instance, in Africa, it 
is estimated that the HIV/AIDS pandemic has reduced the economic growth rate by 
between two to four per cent continent-wide.4 Similarly, it has been estimated that the long-
term negative effects of malaria result in a decrease in gross national product of up to 1.3 
per cent in certain affected regions.5 
</p>
<p>5. The importance of particular aspects of health as they relate to poverty, and in turn, 
development, has also been well documented. For example, securing the sexual and

<p>reproductive health of populations has an integral role in eliminating poverty and 
promoting economic growth, alongside its direct effects on individuals&#8217; health. Ensuring 
access to reproductive services, including family planning, is a vital step in disrupting the 
&#8220;repetitive cycle&#8221; of poverty, inequality and slow economic growth that is perpetuated by 
limited reproductive choices.6 It has also been observed that development policies designed 
to improve economic conditions and living standards of communities can often have 
unintended effects on health; in particular, they can create additional health risks for 
vulnerable groups, which is known to compromise the welfare objectives of development 
policies.7  
</p>
<p>6. As this role of development policies in creating or exacerbating &#8220;diseases of 
poverty&#8221;, alongside health problems associated with industrialization, has become 
increasingly acknowledged, more holistic approaches to development have been sought out, 
and the potential for the right to health to inform and guide development practice has 
increased. Indeed, the ability of people to enjoy an adequate level of health is today broadly 
recognized as a key development goal in itself. Over the last few decades, development 
theory has begun to shift its primary focus from economics to human conditions. This shift 
finds expression in the concepts of human development and the right to development,8 and 
has created space for the right to health and other human rights to move closer to the centre 
of the process of development. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The growing convergence of development, human rights and 
the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>7. The relationship between development and human rights has undergone numerous 
changes over the past five to six decades.  While each began as, and largely remains, an 
independent approach to addressing problems of human welfare, there has been an 
inexorable shift within the development sphere of late towards a more humanistic model of 
advancement and the recognition that health has an impact on economic development. This 
has necessarily come to include human rights, although the form in which human rights-
based concepts and approaches are incorporated has varied, and there have been differing 
levels of acceptance of such concepts within the development sphere.  
</p>
<p>8. Earlier, narrower conceptions of development largely focused on indicators such as 
growth in GNP, rise in personal incomes, industrialization, technological advance, or social 
modernization.9 This left little room for the inclusion of human rights, despite the fact that 
the overall aim of development was the improvement of the human condition, and in that 
respect development and human rights have always intersected. Significant evolution 
occurred in the 1980s to 1990s, alongside acknowledgement of the right to development as 
a stand-alone right, as will be discussed in Section III. Over this time, growing acceptance 
of human rights discourse within the development community took place. In particular, the 
human development, or &#8220;capabilities&#8221; approach to development pioneered by Amartya Sen 
and Martha Nussbaum appeared against the backdrop of the relative backlash against 
purely economic models of development that previously dominated this arena.

<p>9. In 1987, the landmark study by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) 
&#8220;Adjustment with a Human Face&#8221; spurred global debate on the negative social impacts, 
including on health, of structural adjustment programmes prescribed by the international 
financial institutions as a means to achieve economic development. Three years later, in 
1990, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) published the first <i>Human 
Development Report</i>. Alongside the report, UNDP created the Human Development Index, 
a summary measure of various human development indicators, such as maternal mortality, 
childhood education, gender disparities, poverty, etc. The index and report represented a 
major progression in development theory, which aimed to &#8220;[put] people back at the center 
of the development process&#8221; by going beyond income to assess people&#8217;s long-term well-
being.10 This broader and holistic reconceptualization of development has been increasingly 
favoured and has facilitated efforts to recognize and incorporate human rights in 
development work.11  
</p>
<p>10. The evolved concept of development, which underwrites the MDGs and the 
contemporary development paradigm, represents a significant departure from these earlier 
views, making more evident the close overlap between development and human rights.12  
This close interrelationship between development and human rights is clearly spelled out in 
the 2000 Millennium Declaration and was underlined at the 2010 High-level Plenary 
Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the MDGs. As the outcome document 
states, &#8220;respect for and promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of 
effective work towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals&#8221;.13 
</p>
<p>11. The &#8220;capabilities&#8221; approach first articulated by Sen and developed by Nussbaum, 
which underlies the concept of human development, at its core requires removal of major 
sources of &#8220;unfreedom&#8221; in order for development to occur, including poverty, poor 
economic opportunities, tyranny, neglect of public facilities, and social deprivations.14 This 
very acknowledgement allows a clear space in which human rights-based discourse can 
guide development. The capabilities approach recognizes rights as both &#8220;constitutive&#8221; of 
and &#8220;instrumental&#8221; to the overall process of development;15 that is, rights and freedoms are 
not only necessary tools in achieving the goals of development, but that realization of rights 
should constitute an end-goal of development itself. More particularly, this approach holds 
that human rights are entitlements which make up a part of a set of central capabilities: a 
core set of freedoms, or rights, which form the basis of the very opportunities necessary to 
achieving a requisite level of human development.  
</p>
<p>12. When development is perceived in terms of human development and capabilities, it 
is evident that the right to health has both constitutive and instrumental relevance in respect 
of development and poverty reduction.16  The right is constitutive insofar as ill health and

<p>inadequate protection of the right to health are symptoms and constituent parts of 
inadequate human development and poverty, and instrumental in that the enjoyment of the 
right to health is instrumental in securing other human rights, such as the right to education 
and work, which are essential to the achievement of human development. 
</p>
<p>13. In other words, the new conception of development recognizes that the realization of 
human rights, including the right to health, is a central aspect of development itself. This 
connection has been elaborated in many forums, including the United Nations: the 
centrality of human rights in poverty reduction has been well recognized, and elaborated 
through a conceptual framework and guidelines on human rights and poverty reduction.17 
However, as previously discussed, health is also implicated in many other conceptions of 
development besides that involving poverty reduction, and it is this centrality of health to 
all aspects of development which makes it essential that a right to health approach be used 
in all development programmes and policies which seek to address health.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The right to health and development  
</b></p>
<p>14. The right to health is of particular importance to development. It is an inclusive right 
that encompasses the underlying determinants of health such as access to food and water 
and sanitation and poverty and discrimination. As such, the right to health is implicated in 
nearly all development activities, and should be a central component of development 
programming.  
</p>
<p>15. Of the eight Millennium Development Goals subsequently developed to reflect the 
objectives agreed upon in the Millennium Declaration in 2000, Goals 4, 5 and 6 deal with 
health directly and others deals with underlying determinants of health. At least 8 of the 16 
MDG targets, and 17 of the 48 related indicators, are health-related. As the MDGs have 
become a major focus of health-related development work, it was an important step for 
these goals to place health at the very centre of the development enterprise. Moreover, at 
the 2010 high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly, States committed to 
promoting global public health for all to achieve the MDGs and to ensure &#8220;respect for 
human rights, promote gender equality and the empowerment of women as essential means 
of addressing the health of women and girls, and to address the stigmatization of people 
living with and affected by HIV and AIDS&#8221;.18 The normative framework that is now well 
developed and understood for the right to health is well placed to inform the efforts towards 
achieving the MDGs.19  
</p>
<p>16. The following sections address in turn how human rights, and the right to health 
framework in particular, can inform development policies and programmes; the right to 
development and how it relates to the right to health; practical examples of use of the right 
to health framework in development efforts; and, finally, the benefits and challenges of 
integrating human rights into development programming.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The right to health framework 
</b></p>
<p>17. Comprehensive incorporation of human rights into development work necessitates 
changes in the practical approach taken to development work itself. The advancement of 
human rights through development work &#8211; as opposed to simply avoiding rights violations 
</p>
<p>  
 17  Idem. 
 18  A/RES/65/1, para. 73 (i) 
 19  A/59/422. </p>


<p>&#8211; is an important step, and one which largely remains a work in progress. The adoption of a 
right to health framework, in respect of health, and of human rights-based approaches more 
generally is one method by which genuine synchronicity can be achieved in respect of 
health-related development work and human rights.  
</p>
<p>18. The right to health framework complements current development approaches by 
underlining the importance of aspects such as participation, community empowerment and 
the need to focus on vulnerable populations. The right to health analytical framework 
&#8220;unpacks&#8221; the right to health, making it easier to understand and apply in practical settings. 
Its key elements are as follows:20  
</p>
<p> (a) Identification of relevant national and international human rights laws, norms 
and standards; 
</p>
<p> (b) Recognition that the right to health is subject to resource constraints and 
progressive realization, requiring the identification of indicators and benchmarks to 
measure progress over time; 
</p>
<p> (c) Recognition that the right to health imposes some obligations that are of 
immediate effect, and are not subject to progressive realization; 
</p>
<p> (d) Recognition that the right to health includes freedoms and entitlements; 
</p>
<p> (e) The objective of ensuring that all health services, goods and facilities shall be 
available, accessible, acceptable and of good quality; 
</p>
<p> (f) States have duties to respect, protect and fulfil the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health; 
</p>
<p> (g) Special attention should be given to issues of non-discrimination, equality 
and vulnerability; 
</p>
<p> (h) Opportunities are required for the active and informed participation of 
individuals and communities in decision-making that has a bearing on their health; 
</p>
<p> (i) Developing countries have a responsibility to seek international assistance 
and cooperation, while developed States have some responsibilities towards the realization 
of the right to health in developing countries; and 
</p>
<p> (j) Effective, transparent and accessible monitoring and accountability 
mechanisms must be available at the national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>19. Development and the full realization of the right to health both require long-term 
strategies and planning. At the same time, the right to health framework demands that 
immediate steps be taken to ensure the core obligations of the right to health, and that 
special attention be given to the situation of vulnerable and marginalized groups. Whereas 
some elements of the right to health allow for progressive realization in accordance with 
available resources, others must be realized immediately.  The realization of these aspects 
of the right to health cannot be conditioned through prioritization in development planning, 
policies and programmes. As the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
clarified, States have a core minimum obligation to ensure the satisfaction of minimum 
essential levels of the right to health under the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), including:  
</p>
<p> (a) The right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a non-
discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups; 
</p>
<p>  
 20  A/62/214, para. 71. </p>


<p> (b) Opportunities are required for the active and informed participation of 
individuals and communities in decision-making that has a bearing on their health; 
</p>
<p> (c) Access to the minimum essential food which is nutritionally adequate and 
safe; 
</p>
<p> (d) Access to shelter, housing and sanitation and an adequate supply of safe 
drinking water; 
</p>
<p> (e) The provision of essential drugs; 
</p>
<p> (f) Equitable distribution of all health facilities, goods and services.21 
</p>
<p>20. In respect of human rights more broadly, it has been noted that there was historically 
a lack of clarity concerning the content of human rights-based approaches. This was 
mitigated by the Common Understanding agreed upon by United Nations agencies in 2003. 
This document represents the achievement of conceptual consensus; however, it lacks detail 
and has been difficult to operationalize. United Nations agencies have employed the 
Common Understanding in inconsistent ways,22 and, outside the United Nations system, the 
definitions and uptake of human rights-based approaches vary even more widely. However, 
common elements can still be distilled from most approaches taken, and can be used to 
inform implementation of a right to health approach to development. 
</p>
<p>21. According to the Common Understanding, a human rights-based approach requires 
that each stage of development programming &#8211; that is, the goals, processes and outcomes of 
development &#8211; be informed by, and further, human rights:23  
</p>
<p> (a) Goals: All programmes, policies and technical assistance should further the 
realization of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) Processes: Human rights standards and principles guide programming in all 
sectors and phases of the programming process; and 
</p>
<p> (c) Outcomes: Development cooperation contributes to the development of duty-
bearers to meet their obligations and of rights-holders to claim their rights. 
</p>
<p>22. The following further elements have been identified by the United Nations as 
necessary, specific, and unique to a human rights-based approach to development: 
</p>
<p> (a) Assessment and analysis in order to identify the human rights claims of 
rights-holders and the corresponding human rights obligations of duty-bearers as well as the 
immediate, underlying, and structural causes of the non-realization of rights; 
</p>
<p> (b) Programmes which assess the capacity of rights-holders to claim their rights, 
and of duty bearers to fulfill their obligations, and the development of strategies to build 
these capacities; 
</p>
<p> (c) Programmes which monitor and evaluate both outcomes and processes 
guided by human rights standards and principles; and

<p> (d) Programming informed by the recommendations of international human 
rights bodies and mechanisms.24  
</p>
<p>23. In practical terms, this approach does not simply require that the goals and outcomes 
of development are loosely aligned with those of human rights. More is necessary; in 
particular, it is vital that the processes around development and implementation of 
programming adopt a human rights-based approach, as will be discussed further. Similarly, 
use of human rights in development requires the use of good programming practices, but 
adoption of such practices in and of itself does not constitute adoption of a right to health, 
or human rights-based approach. For instance, use of monitoring and evaluation is not 
uncommon in development practice, and yet its inclusion does not constitute use of a 
human rights-based approach without an attendant careful analysis of both the rights and 
duties of the parties involved in the programme, and an examination of their capacity to 
claim their rights and fulfill their obligations, respectively.  
</p>
<p>24. The actual content of a right to health approach as applied to development 
programming may vary in individual circumstances, and the Special Rapporteur believes 
that adaptation and flexibility are necessary depending on the nature of the development 
initiatives undertaken, the context, and so forth. However, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
opinion, adoption of a right to health approach should at least require: (1) the clear and 
explicit placement of human rights at the centre of health-related programming strategies, 
and (2) inclusion of some or all of the core elements of a right to health approach in a 
methodical manner. The framework should be considered in its entirety, and if elements of 
the framework are not adopted, it should be clear that their inclusion has at least been 
considered, rather than individual elements being cherry-picked in an ad-hoc manner. 
Operationalization of a rights-based approach to health should also reflect the Common 
Understanding. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Complementarities of the right to health and the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>25. In considering the relationship between the right to health and development, the 
Special Rapporteur considers it necessary to reflect on the complementarities of the right to 
health and the right to development. The present section does not exhaustively examine the 
relationship between the right to health and the right to development, but seeks to 
contribute to a discussion of how these rights feed into, and realize the core goals of, 
development.  
</p>
<p>26. The concept of a &#8220;right to development&#8221; was articulated in a series of international 
conferences, culminating in 1986, when the right was recognized in a declaration adopted 
by the General Assembly,25 and in 1993 the right to development was reaffirmed, as part of 
the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.26 Before that, in 1981, the right to 
development was also enshrined in Article 22 of the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples' Rights. 
</p>
<p>27. Within the United Nations system, a Working Group on the Right to Development 
was established in 1989 with a mandate to monitor and review progress made in the 
promotion and implementation of the right to development. The Working Group has been 
supported in its work by an independent expert on the right to development (1998-2003) 
</p>
<p>  
 24  Ibid., p. 2. 
 25  A/RES/41/128 
 26  A/CONF.157/23 </p>


<p>and a High-Level Task Force on the implementation of the right to development (2004-
2010).  
</p>
<p>28. The right to development is a self-standing right,27 which includes all other human 
rights. As the Declaration on the Rights to Development states in its article 1, it is a right 
&#8220;by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, 
contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized.&quot;28 Accordingly, the right to 
development includes the right to health guaranteed in ICESCR and other international 
human rights treaties.29 
</p>
<p>29. The right to development is a right of individuals and of peoples. It is 
distinguishable from the right to health in this respect, which is more related to the 
individual citizen&#8217;s relationship with the State. Nevertheless, overlap exists. General 
comment No. 14 of CESCR confirms that the right to health, as outlined in Article 12 of the 
ICESCR, has both collective and individual dimensions, and that collective rights are 
critical in the field of health, as modern public health policy relies heavily on prevention 
and promotion, approaches directed primarily towards groups.30 Similarly, both the right to 
health and the right to development underline the imperative of ensuring transparency, 
equality, participation, accountability and non-discrimination.31  
</p>
<p>30. The right to health extends to the underlying determinants of health, embracing a 
wide range of socio-economic factors that promote conditions in which people can lead a 
healthy life,32 which necessarily incorporates other rights. Yet a distinct feature of the right 
to development is its focus on a process of simultaneously advancing the full range of 
human rights. In this regard the words of former independent expert on the right to 
development and former chairperson of the Working Group on the Right to Development, 
Arjun Sengupta, are illustrative. As he notes: &#8220;the right to health could be implemented on 
its own, but when treated as a component of the right to development, its realization must 
include policies to expand resources as well as institutions over time, taking into account 
competing claims of other rights which must be coordinated with the right to health. Such 
exercise might imply a much larger claim on resources and much greater inputs from 
international cooperation than would be the case for the fulfilment of the right to health by 
itself.&#8221;33 
</p>
<p>31. The comprehensive nature of the right to development has the potential to encourage 
cross-sectoral collaboration and decrease &#8220;siloing&#8221; in pursuing realization of rights, and the 
right could be also used to address the underlying determinants of health through provision 
of public goods and distributive justice.34

<p>32. Moreover, the right to development focuses specifically on the duty of States to act 
jointly towards the realization of human rights. While the obligation of international 
cooperation is also recognized under ICESCR and other human rights treaties, 35 this aspect 
of both rights can be more comprehensively addressed through use of the right to 
development. In this regard, the high-level task force on the implementation of the right to 
development (HTF) developed a set of criteria for the evaluation of global partnerships 
(Millennium Development Goal 8). The criteria were developed around three attributes of 
the right to development: comprehensive and human-centred development policy; 
participatory human rights processes; and social justice in development. They include a 
number of sub-criteria and indicators, several of which relate to the right to health. In 
developing and testing these criteria, the Task Force inter alia examined partnerships 
relating to access to medicines and the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.36  
</p>
<p>33. The right to health can help operationalize the right to development. The right to 
development is not contained in a legally binding instrument at the international level, and 
thus, although it draws its foundations from binding human rights treaties, it is not directly 
enforceable in most countries.37 However, the Special Rapporteur notes that, in a recent 
landmark ruling, the African Commission determined that a State had violated the right to 
development enshrined in article 22 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights.38 In this respect, the right to health may provide support in achieving development 
goals through judicial enforcement where the right to development currently lacks the legal 
tools to do so. Along with addressing longer-term, underlying determinants relating to 
development outcomes, narrower interventions should simultaneously be pursued to 
address immediate rights infringements that impact on development.39  
</p>
<p>34. For example, individuals are increasingly bringing cases before national courts 
concerning breaches of their right to health.40 This approach has been particularly 
successful in securing access to essential medicines, a core aspect of development progress. 
Such cases may be brought by a particular litigant, but may result in provision of medicines 
to affected communities, thereby demonstrating the fact that enforcement of the right to 
health need not occur only for the benefit of one individual.41 Such litigation represents a 
powerful tool, not only to achieve a particular legal outcome, but to significantly strengthen 
and empower a social movement around the cause forming the subject matter of the 
litigation in question,42 further ensuring realization of the right. 
</p>
<p>35. The operationalization of the right to development can also be informed by the 
significant amount of work undertaken in respect of the collective aspect of the right to 
health. For instance, the World Health Organization (WHO) has long recognized the 
importance of social justice for health; the Commission on Social Determinants of Health

<p>has highlighted the importance of domestic legislation enshrining the right to health, and 
recognition of the rights of citizens to participate in public policy and budgeting,43 which 
has the potential to strengthen health systems. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Use of the right to health framework in HIV/AIDS programmes 
</b></p>
<p>36. Successful examples of the use of the right to health in programming and the 
evidence of its value-added to health-related development can be found in the context of 
HIV. The public health response to HIV was possibly the first instance in which the 
relationships between health and human rights became overwhelmingly apparent, and 
observations can be drawn from this that may be useful to further strengthen the integration 
of human rights and development.  
</p>
<p>37. Around 33.3 million people worldwide44 are currently living with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a retrovirus which causes acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS), a universally fatal syndrome causing failure of the human immune 
system. One of the most pressing health and human rights conundrums of modern life, it 
has been described as a &#8220;health threat of massive proportions&#8221;45 and an &#8220;extraordinary 
challenge&#8221;46, and represents the first illness that has essentially required the introduction of 
a public health response that gave heed to human rights. The relationship between HIV and 
development has also been clearly recognized over time. The pernicious effect of HIV on 
human development is being tackled through its prioritization as one of the eight 
Millennium Development Goals, and UNDP has noted that &#8220;mainstreaming&#8221; HIV into 
development processes is effective.47 The connections between HIV/AIDS and human 
rights were articulated by the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights 
(&#8220;Guidelines&#8221;), which recognize the central role played by human rights in addressing, 
limiting and attempting to eradicate HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>38. The historical evolution of the response to HIV/AIDS is a good example of a health 
problem with strong implications for human development contained most effectively by 
protecting and promoting human rights. Jonathan Mann described three clearly defined 
phases in the response to the epidemic: the first period concerned discovery of the illness 
and corresponding uncertainty surrounding its containment, while the second period largely 
focused on individual risk reduction and behavioural change, accompanied by the use of 
discriminatory prevention measures justified under a &#8220;public health rationale&#8221;. It was not 
until the third period, in the late 1980s, that a societal dimension was included in the 
approach to the disease, and the concept of &#8220;vulnerability&#8221; arose in identifying barriers to 
individual control over health. The &#8220;traditional&#8221; public health approaches initially applied 
to HIV/AIDS, consisting of information, education and services targeted at changing 
individuals&#8217; behaviour and reducing risk, were effective but ultimately insufficient to

<p>contain the spread of HIV/AIDS, not least because they assumed a static social 
environment.48 
</p>
<p>39. The second phase of the response, in which the international community promoted 
the prevention of discrimination under the &#8220;public health rationale&#8221;, is a clear example of 
recognition of the impact of human rights on health, and vice versa. It became increasingly 
clear that violations of the right to health, such as the State&#8217;s failure to prevent 
discrimination towards people living with HIV and AIDS (or, indeed, discrimination 
perpetrated by the State itself) actually reduced the effectiveness of HIV prevention 
programmes. Conversely, where rights were protected by the State, through clear 
preservation of anonymity in the context of HIV testing, participation in testing and 
counseling increased. The elimination of discrimination and protection of basic freedoms 
not only upheld rights but furthered public health aims concurrently.49  
</p>
<p>40. The relationship between the law, public health and human rights has thus been seen 
as of particular importance in relation to HIV. In an attempt to control the virus and the 
social practices that result in its spread, laws may be hastily enacted that are only partially 
successful in achieving behavioural change. The &#8220;AIDS paradox&#8221; is that: &#8220;&#8230;one of the 
most effective laws we can offer to combat the spread of HIV which causes AIDS is the 
protection of persons living with AIDS, and those about them, from discrimination.&#8221;50 
Indeed, this paradox does not exist only in respect of laws. Any development intervention 
designed to combat the spread of HIV which respects the human rights of those directly 
affected by and those most at risk of HIV, will ultimately be more effective in achieving its 
stated goals. 
</p>
<p>41. HIV thus represents a good example of the multi-faceted relationship between health 
and human rights.51 It shows how health policies and legislation can impact detrimentally 
on human rights, while violations of human rights can detrimentally affect health. Thus, 
policies and legislation which allow for the quarantining of a person who has contracted 
HIV would infringe on the right to liberty and security of person, while &#8220;naming and 
shaming&#8221; people who test positive to HIV, in violation of their right to privacy and 
confidentiality, creates stigma and deters others from seeking out testing and counselling. 
This close interrelationship also means that human rights and health-related policies and 
programmes have a great potential to be mutually reinforcing in the realization of health-
related development and the right to health. 
</p>
<p>42. However, there is still insufficient attention to these interactions, particularly in 
respect of development work. For instance, performing a human rights impact assessment 
of development policies and programmes, and documenting human rights abuses, are 
strategies that largely deal with the first two relationships mentioned. Incorporating human 
rights into each aspect of health-related development programming from its initiation is 
much more difficult to achieve.  
</p>
<p>43. As noted, in the initial, panicked response to HIV, there were calls for quarantine, 
compulsory notification, and even branding of those people living with HIV.52 As

<p>knowledge grew, and the hysteria surrounding its modes of transmission gradually abated, 
the extremity of the responses decreased, but identification of the symbiotic relationship 
between achieving public health and development outcomes, and protecting and promoting 
human rights, took longer to gain widespread acceptance. It remains overlooked in certain 
spheres of development, and the lessons learned regarding the effectiveness of responding 
to HIV using human rights are being increasingly forgotten. Nevertheless, where 
approaches utilizing human rights have been employed to address HIV, outcomes have 
been extremely encouraging.  
</p>
<p>44. The experience of the Sonagachi Project, started by the All India Institute of 
Hygiene and Public Health in Kolkata, India in 1992, is indicative of the potential of right 
to health-based interventions. While the project began as a traditional STD/HIV 
intervention amongst sex workers in the red-light areas within the district, it soon evolved 
into one that had at its core central facets of the right to health framework &#8211; most 
importantly, community participation &#8211; in an effort to empower the sex worker community 
to realize their own rights, and ultimately prevent the spread of HIV. The programme noted 
successful outcomes in respect of health and development; its most quantifiable effects 
included significantly improved condom usage,53 and reduced HIV rates amongst the 
Sonagachi sex worker population.54 However, its processes and their effects have also been 
thoroughly researched, reflecting its successes in advocacy and community leadership.  
</p>
<p>45. These processes &#8211; participation-based empowerment intervention strategies &#8211; are 
grounded in the right to health framework, and had a broad impact on factors reducing 
vulnerability of sex workers to infection with HIV and other STDs. Outcomes of these 
processes also included improved knowledge of STDs and condom protection and the 
establishment of social support amongst sex workers.55   
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur notes that this set of interventions, which has ultimately 
resulted in significant development of affected communities, successfully applied core 
elements of the right to health framework, including participation and non-discrimination. 
The interventions also acknowledged and promoted the fundamental freedoms and 
entitlements of the sex workers involved in the project; particularly, the right to control 
one&#8217;s health and body, including sexual and reproductive health. The programme moreover 
secured health services for sex workers, most notably through improving their acceptability 
and accessibility.56 
</p>
<p>47. Similarly, the experience of the UNIFEM South Asia Partnership with the Positive 
Women Network (PWN+) and Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) is a good 
example of how a rights-based, gender-sensitive response to HIV added significant value to 
pre-existing programming strategies in this area. The PWN+ has over 5,000 members 
throughout India, and works to support women living with HIV/AIDS by destigmatizing 
the illness; educating affected women; and establishing support, referral and empowerment 
systems.57 The partnerships&#8217; activities included initiation of national consultations of HIV-

<p>positive women; establishment of partnerships to support research, advocacy and lobbying; 
documentation of the experiences of HIV-positive women; engagement with the media 
around gender-sensitive reporting concerning HIV; creation of mechanisms of 
accountability through public hearings; and formulation of targeted strategies to address the 
vulnerability of women to HIV/AIDS at national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>48. The major improvements in the outcomes of the project attributable to the adoption 
of a human rights-based approach were largely due to the efforts around facilitating and 
securing the agency of women living with HIV/AIDS, which led to significant 
improvements in monitoring and accountability, a core element of the right to health 
framework. This is particularly evident in the continuing high-level participation of positive 
women in national and international initiatives relating to HIV, and the strong networks 
formed within India to allow for provision of technical assistance to these women. 
Ultimately, the advantage of this programmatic design is not only evident in terms of 
improved development outcomes; the changes in process demonstrate the inherent benefits 
in recognizing the dignity and equality of these women in the context of pursuing a broader 
development aim. Nevertheless, in not only ensuring their empowerment through 
participation, but in further utilizing it to achieve meaningful policy change, the practical 
benefits of adoption of various elements of a right to health framework in the development 
context are also seen. The approach taken also facilitated the identification of relevant 
national human rights laws, norms and standards that should be utilized in order for the 
State to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health of women living with HIV/AIDS, and 
the role of those women in holding the State accountable in this regard. This example 
demonstrates that United Nations agencies are in a unique position to facilitate capacity-
building and education around human rights in pursuance of particular development aims. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Benefits of human rights-based approaches to development 
</b></p>
<p>49. One key benefit of integrating human rights into development is the way it re-frames 
development, presenting its constituent components as entitlements and embracing the 
indivisibility and equal importance of all human rights.58 This has also been described as a 
creation of &#8220;claims and not charity&#8221;.59 In redefining the nature of the problem through 
incorporation of human rights, and the right to health framework in particular, a shift occurs 
to a more self-sustaining approach that imbues the former targets of development with 
genuine agency, and allows for realization of rights previously considered secondary, or 
less realizable. Member States of the United Nations have directly observed the value 
added by human rights in respect of development, noting, for instance, that development 
efforts &#8220;had become more systematic and meaningful, contributing to the enhancement of 
human dignity by encouraging people to become active participants in the development 
process&#8221;.60  
</p>
<p>50. Another benefit which human rights bring to development is guidance concerning 
the design and practical implementation of development programmes. For instance, one of 
the core requirements of a human rights-based approach is the requirement that processes 
are guided by human rights principles, as stated in the Common Understanding. For

<p>example, an increase in the number of people undergoing HIV testing may be a good 
outcome, but if achieved through coercive testing rather than a voluntary campaign, it is 
clear that human rights have failed to be integrated into the strategy.61 Moreover, simply 
achieving a positive result in a given field, such as health, will not automatically promote 
respect for the corresponding right, and thus imbue rights-holders and duty-bearers with a 
long-term &#8220;guarantee [or] set of structural claims&#8221;.62 Put simply, more needs to be done to 
ensure that long-term realization of rights occurs as a result of any development 
interventions. In respect of health, this is best achieved through undertaking the process of 
identifying the relevant human rights laws, norms and standards that apply, as part of the 
right to health framework, and continuing on to identify rights-holders and duty-bearers in 
that context. It has been noted that the &#8220;quality, legitimacy and sustainability&#8221; of outcomes 
depend on the process used to achieve them, and human rights may help secure those 
desirable elements,63 as well as addressing structural problems that ultimately perpetuate 
the very conditions that development programming seeks to address. 
</p>
<p>51. Moreover, participation of those that development programming seeks to assist 
should be increased through adoption of human rights within existing approaches to 
development. Although it is certainly true that participation has been frequently utilized in 
development without adoption of a human rights-based approach &#8211; its benefits even being 
acknowledged by the World Bank during the 1970s64 &#8211; and thus &#8220;participation&#8221; as a 
concept is not exclusive to human rights or new to development, there is no doubt that 
sustainable, quality outcomes are clearly linked to ownership and empowerment by affected 
communities, and that those who have the greatest stake in development are those who 
form the subject of that development itself. Nevertheless, the substantial difference lies in 
the fact that the right to health views participation as an entitlement, rather than a privilege 
occasionally granted. Drawing further attention to the importance of participation 
throughout all stages of development can only be beneficial. Human rights-based 
frameworks and approaches address participation alongside other essential elements of 
accountability, capacity-building, and so forth; as such, mainstreaming of human rights in 
programming may not pioneer the use of participation, but has the potential to improve 
upon the ad-hoc use of such concepts. 
</p>
<p>52. Evidence of the positive effects of human rights at the practice level of development 
ultimately provides an additional impetus for reframing both human rights and development 
as described above. Ultimately, shifting the process through which development actions are 
implemented, even if goals and outcomes are only subtly altered, may prove the defining 
means through which the potential of human rights-based approaches become most 
apparent, even in the absence of rigorous empirical evidence. In fact, a relentless pursuit of 
evidence for human rights-based approaches has its own shortcomings, as will be discussed 
presently. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Remaining challenges 
</b></p>
<p>53. Harmonizing the practical and operational aspects of human rights and development 
without compromising the essential values and philosophies of both domains is a challenge.

<p>Divergence stems from a number of factors, including practical disciplinary differences; 
development is largely the domain of economists and human rights that of lawyers and 
advocates. Additionally, there exists the long-standing contention that human rights are 
more prescriptive than operational, while development projects have focused on 
implementation and are more programmatic in nature. 
</p>
<p>54. These issues are partly addressed by the work of actors such as the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which developed, at the request of the 
human rights treaty bodies, a framework for indicators to monitor compliance with 
international human rights instruments, which takes into account the various ways in which 
human rights relate to development. The framework establishes three sets of indicators: 
structural, process, and outcome, and a list of illustrative indicators on the right to health 
have been developed.65 However, monitoring and evaluation of human rights-related issues 
in the development field has thus far been largely limited to outcome indicators. This raises 
some key concerns with respect to the way indicators are used in development and their 
impact on human rights. 
</p>
<p>55. Effective monitoring and evaluation is a core component of any human rights-based 
approach, and like other phases of the programming process it should be guided by human 
rights principles.66 Moreover, rights-based approaches, including those concerning the right 
to health, require transparency and accountability in decision-making processes, actions or 
omissions, for which effective monitoring and evaluation are necessary requirements. 
However, monitoring and evaluation must be undertaken carefully, to avoid the potential 
pitfalls associated with a &#8220;culture of evaluation&#8221;,67 wherein an overreliance on the use of 
easily quantifiable data and evidence-based evaluation practices can lead to neglect or 
disregard of development strategies whose effects are more difficult to quantify: for 
instance, those relating to capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>56. In many cases, it is very difficult to conduct evidence-based evaluations of human 
rights-based health interventions with the same level of methodological rigour applied to, 
for instance, clinical drug trials. As evaluation unavoidably feeds back into, and threatens to 
dictate, strategy, this can lead to distortion of prioritization in relation to interventions that 
can be more easily based on available evidence. Human rights-based interventions may be 
especially susceptible to this distortion precisely because they are less amenable to 
evidence-based evaluations. Given the difficulty of plainly illustrating the cause and effect 
relationship between the realization of human rights and intended health outcomes (for 
instance, the empowerment of sex workers, their increased use of condoms, and the 
resultant lower levels of HIV infection) it is imperative that a broad range of evidence-
informed practices are used when evaluating human rights-based interventions.68 
</p>
<p>57. Thus, overreliance on easily quantifiable data threatens to erode the core concept of 
the realization of human rights as ends in and of themselves. The instrumental value of the 
incorporation of human rights into development practice must not overshadow the proper 
understanding of human rights as constitutive components of human development. The 
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has noted that the MDGs &#8220;embody basic

<p>human rights,&#8221; including the right to health.69 An understanding of the intrinsic value of 
human rights and the promotion of human dignity as a necessary end of development must 
not be sacrificed in order to facilitate data-intensive evaluation.  
</p>
<p>58. Nevertheless, these concerns and challenges do not detract from the potential for 
human rights, and specifically the right to health, to provide a set of norms for development 
to reorient itself further in a more &#8220;human-centric&#8221; manner, drawing on legal and 
institutional frameworks that are crucial to human rights. They have potential not just to 
&#8220;add value&#8221;, but to achieve the core goals of development itself, as it has been most 
recently conceived in terms of the right to development and of human development as 
reflected in the MDGs. In this way development and human rights function symbiotically, 
as achieving gains in development through methods which utilize human rights will also 
achieve realization of rights.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The need to incorporate human rights into development is important for the 
long-term sustainability and legitimacy of development as an enterprise.  Many 
models of development failed to address basic human needs, and further, neglected 
the rights of people whilst pursuing development outcomes supposedly designed to 
benefit them. Human rights-based approaches to development are particularly useful 
in this regard, and their use should be promoted. The right to health can be a 
particularly powerful reference in that regard because of its close links to a full range 
of other rights and the crucial role that health plays in development, both human and 
economic.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) States take steps to ensure that the right to health framework is 
integrated into health-related development programming, particularly in respect of 
the health-related MDGs and social determinants of health; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) States take measures to ensure that information on the right to health 
framework, including the need for transparency, accountability and participation of 
individuals and communities in decision-making that has a bearing on their health, is 
disseminated and its use promoted in development-related areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The United Nations continues its efforts to provide more guidance in 
respect of human rights-based approaches and to provide best-practice examples of 
operationalization of human rights-based approaches; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The United Nations continue to design and implement human rights-
based approaches to development issues, and build its own capacity and that of States 
and other actors to incorporate human rights, and the right to health framework, into 
their development operations;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e) Organizations adopting a human rights-based approach in respect of 
development make use of independent, well-designed qualitative evaluation to assess 
the outcomes of their interventions, and publicize these evaluations to encourage 
dialogue and cooperation amongst agencies working at the intersection of 
development and rights;

<p><b> (f) Efforts be made to improve tools to measure the impact of human rights-
based approaches to development interventions with the support of relevant 
international bodies such as UNDP and OHCHR, taking into account that to achieve 
realization of rights is an end in itself; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Measures be taken to ensure that human rights priorities and goals are 
not neglected as a consequence of an overreliance on easily quantifiable data in the 
evaluation of development interventions.
