The Manora Oil Field is located in the G1/48 concession.  Mubadala Petroleum operates the concession and 
the field.  FID was reached on the Manora oil development on 23 July 2012 and production commenced on 
11 November 2014 with the first lifting on 25 December 2014.
Manora produced from nine wells during the period: MNA-01, MNA-02, MNA-03, MNA-05, MNA-07, MNA-08, 
MNA-11,  MNA-15  and  MNA-16.    The  average  gross  production  rate  year  to  date  to  30  June  was  12,116 
bopd (gross). Gross production for the half year was 2.2 MMSTB (Tap share 0.66 MMSTB) and cumulative 
field production to 30 June 2016 was 7.66 MMSTB (gross).
At  the  end  of  March  2016  the  Atwood  Orca  rig  returned  to  the  Manora  Oil  Field  to  drill  an  additional  two 
development  wells,  MNA-15  and  MNA-16  in  the  east  fault  block.      The  MNA-15  and  MNA-16  wells  were 
drilled to final total depths of 2,566m and 2,998m (measured depth) respectively and completed with electric 
submersible pumps (ESPs).  Drilling and completion of the two wells was completed in 38 days.
Both  infill  development  wells  were  targeting  the  east  fault  block  of  the  Manora  Oil  Field.  The  MNA-15  well 
found  44m  of  oil  pay  in  three  separate  reservoirs.        The  MNA-16  well  found  37m  oil  pay  in  four  separate 
reservoirs.

TAP OIL LIMITED
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
During the period Tap entered into a revised crude oil sales agreement at a price of Dubai plus US$0.70/bbl, 
with sales permitted to be sold either domestically in Thailand, or internationally.  Tap will continue to receive 
THB for domestic sales and USD for international sales.
There were 13 oil liftings during the first six months of 2016.
Third Party Gas 
In  2005  Tap  secured  an  option  over  approximately  33  PJ  of  gas  from  the  John  Brookes  field  offshore 
Western Australia at then current market prices.  The option was exercised in 2007 and Tap on-sells the gas 
to a number of Western Australian gas customers.  The gas is purchased at a fixed 2005 price and sold at 
fixed prices approximately three times higher.  Both buy and sell prices are denominated in Australian dollars 
and subject to CPI escalation.  Around 1.7 PJ currently remains to be delivered over the period 1 July 2016 
to December 2016.
Third party  gas  volumes  were slightly  lower  for  the  half  year  compared  to 2015,  gas  revenues  were in line 
with expectations with minimal volumes being deferred during the period.  Forecast third party gas revenues 
are expected to be around A$2.5 million per month until the end of 2016.
Exploration and Appraisal
Offshore Thailand
Tap holds a 30% direct interest in the G1/48 concession in the northern Gulf of Thailand.  This concession is 
operated  by  Mubadala  Petroleum.   The  Manora  discovery  in  late  2009  opened  up  a  new  oil  play  in  the 
northern Gulf of Thailand.
During the period the Operator assessed the prospect portfolio and identified the Sri Trang-1 exploration well 
for drilling.
The Sri Trang-1 well lies approximately 18 kilometres North North-East of the Manora production facility, the 
primary drilling target was the Miocene age  lacustrine delta sands similar to those producing at the Manora 
Oil Field.  The primary aim of the Sri Trang-1 well was to de-risk prospectively in the Northern Kra Basin.
The  well  was  spudded  on  17  May  2016  in  40  metres  of  water  by  the  Atwood Orca jackup  drilling unit  and 
was drilled to an extended final total depth of 2,814 meters measured depth
The  test  results  confirmed  the  presence  of  oil  in  poor  quality  reservoir  sand.  The  samples  collected  from 
three other zones confirmed the presence of water.  Although the oil  is not in commercial quantities, the Sri 
Trang-1 discovery has validated the hydrocarbon prospectivity of the Northern Kra Basin.
Myanmar
Block M-7 Moattama Basin, Offshore Myanmar
Tap holds a 95% participating interest in the M-7 Block and has assumed operatorship. 
The 12,875 km2 block is located in the gas and condensate prone Moattama Basin, offshore Myanmar.  The 
Block  is  160  kilometres  east  of  the  6.5  Tcf  Yadana  gas  field,  and  110  kilometres  northeast  of  the  1.5  Tcf 
Zawtika  gas  field.    The  Moattama  Basin  is  Myanmar’s  most  prolific  offshore  hydrocarbon  province,  with 
existing production from two offshore fields and a third field close to production commencement.  Production 
is typically from stacked Miocene clastic reservoirs.
Under  the  executed  Production  Sharing  Contract  (PSC),  the  Joint  Venture  partners  have  agreed  to 
undertake an 18 month Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and Study Period, followed by 
an option to proceed to a three-year commitment exploration work programme.
Tap has completed the 6 month preparation period for Block M-7, with the Initial Environmental Examination 
(IEE) Report presented and submitted to Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE).  Prior to entering the 12 
month  study  period  the  IEE  report  must  be  approved  by  MOGE,  then  the  Petroleum  Committee  of  the 
Myanmar Government before being signed off by the MIC.     
 
The seismic data was signed over from the MOGE Data centre to Tap in January 2016.  The data was the 
largest  shipment  out  of  the  MOGE  data  centre  to  date,  what  data  could  be  was  transcribed  and  loaded  to 
Tap’s Perth Office system for analysis.
Tap  issued  a  letter  to  MOGE  in  March  2016,  nominating  a  “Commencement  of  Operations”  date  of  30 
November 2016. This was accepted and confirmed by MOGE in a letter dated 10 May 2016.
The Company is seeking to farmout, defer or materially reduce the Company’s expenditure in Myanmar.

TAP OIL LIMITED
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Carnarvon Basin – Offshore Western Australia
WA-72-R and WA-351-P (Tap share 20%, Operator BHP Billiton)
WA-351-P  is  an  exploration  permit  in  the  offshore  Carnarvon  Basin,  Western  Australia.    The  permit 
contains  the  Tallaganda  gas  discovery  drilled  during  the  second  quarter  of  2012.    The  Tallaganda-1  well 
was  a  new  field  gas  discovery  in  the  Triassic  Mungaroo  Formation.    The  Tallaganda  structure  straddles 
both WA-351-P and WA-335-P to the south. The structure is well defined by modern 3D seismic data.  
 
The  Joint  Venture  has  accepted  a  Retention  Lease  over  the  Tallaganda  discovery  (WA-72-R)  and  has 
agreed not to renew WA-351-P, which expired on 27 June 2016. 
 
Tap  has  booked  49  PJ  as  a  2C  contingent  resource  for  the WA-351-P  portion  of  the  Tallaganda  structure 
(ASX release 29 January 2013).
WA-290-P and WA-49-R (Tap share 10%, Operator Quadrant Energy)
WA-290-P  is  an  exploration  permit  in  the  offshore  Carnarvon  Basin, Western  Australia.    In  early  2011,  the 
Joint Venture drilled the Zola discovery and in August 2012, a retention lease, WA-49-R, was granted over 
the Zola and Antiope discoveries for a period of five years.  The lease area covers two graticular blocks.
The Greater Zola Structure comprises several fault blocks along the Alpha Arch, south of the giant Gorgon 
gas field.  A single fault block was tested by Zola-1 (the Zola fault block).  Within the Greater Zola Structure, 
Bianchi-1 was drilled on an independent Triassic prospect some 6.4 kilometres north-northeast of the Zola-1 
gas discovery and 20.8 kilometres south-southwest of the Gorgon-1 gas discovery.
The  Joint  Venture  commenced  drilling  the  Bianchi-1  well  in  WA-49-R  on  12  April  2013.    In  July  2013,  the 
Joint Venture confirmed a gas discovery at Bianchi-1 with 112 metres of natural gas net pay in the Mungaroo 
Formation reservoir sandstones.  The well was drilled to a total depth of 5,429 metres and was plugged and 
abandoned as planned.
The discovery is positive for Tap with three gas discoveries (Antiope-1, Zola-1 and Bianchi-1) now made on 
the block.  Furthermore, the success at Bianchi-1 helps support Tap’s assessment of the Greater Zola Area 
and provides additional resources for the future potential commercialisation of the lease.
Tap estimates gross 2C contingent resources of 638 PJ within the retention lease and a net resource to Tap 
of 64 PJ, which includes 16 PJ of net 2C contingent resources for Bianchi-1, of net 2C contingent resource 
for the gas discoveries made in WA-49-R to date (includes the Zola, Bianchi and Antiope discoveries) (ASX 
Release 26 February 2014).
A  12  month  suspension  and  extension  was  approved  by  NOPTA  on  21  August  2015.    The  Permit  Year  3 
ends  on  21  October  2016.   The  Operator,  Quadrant Energy,  has  proposed  acquisition  of  the  new  200 km2 
Bianchi 3D seismic survey in November 2016 aimed at high grading Triassic Mungaroo prospects in these 
permits  for  future  drilling.    The  delay  in  acquisition  is  due  to  operational  area  overlap  with  a  Chevron 
operated Ocean bottom node survey and the end of May Whale migration, when seismic operations are not 
permitted.  Delay in the seismic acquisition will not require a suspension or extension of the permit terms for 
WA-49-R.
WA-320-P  and  WA-155-P  (Part  II)  (Tap  share  9.78%  and  6.56%  respectively,  Operator  Quadrant 
Energy)
WA-320-P  and  WA-155-P  (Part  II)  are  exploration  permits  in  the  offshore  Carnarvon  Basin,  Western 
Australia.
In  2013,  Tap  farmed  out  a  portion  of  its  interest  in  both  permits  to  JX  Nippon  Oil  and  Gas  Exploration 
(Australia)  Pty  Ltd  in  exchange  for  a  5%  carry  on  the  Palmerston-1  well  (up  to  a  total  well  cost  of  US$70 
million).  Post farmout, Tap retains 9.778% equity in WA-320-P and 6.555% equity in WA-155-P (Part II).
Approximately  310  km²  of  multi-client  3D  seismic  data  from  the  TGS  “Huzzas  MC3D  seismic  survey”  was 
licensed  by  the WA-320-P  Joint  Venture  in  2014.  During  2015  the  Huzzas  3D  data  was  initially  processed 
and  then  reprocessed  to  enhance  the  data  quality.  This  new  seismic  data  was  used  to  assess  the 
prospectivity of the permits and for planning of an exploration commitment well which is required to be drilled 
by Q4 2016 under current license conditions.
After extensive technical evaluation and engagement with the regulator, Quadrant Energy (formerly Apache), 
Operator of the WA-320-P permit,  recommended the Driftwood-1 well as the year 3 commitment well in WA-
320-P, replacing the previously proposed Palmerston-1 well. 
 
The  Driftwood-1  commitment  well  has  an  expected  total  well  cost  of  A$15.47  million  (gross),  substantially 
lower than the estimated cost for Palmerston-1 of A$98.2 million.

TAP OIL LIMITED
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Noble Tom Prosser jackup drilling rig commenced drilling the Driftwood-1 commitment well on 1 August 
2016.  The  well  intersected  all  of  the  drilling  objectives,  however  all  were  water  wet.  There  were  no 
hydrocarbon shows intersected in the primary and secondary targets and the rig was subsequently released 
on 16 August 2016.
TL/2 and TP/7 (Tap share 10% and 12.47% respectively, Operator Quadrant Energy)
The  TL/2  production  licence  and  TP/7  exploration  permit  are  located  in  shallow  water  in  the  offshore 
Carnarvon Basin approximately 40 kilometres north-northeast of Onslow, Western Australia.
The  Taunton  oil  field  was  discovered  in  1991  and  straddles  the  TL/2  and  TP/7  permit  boundaries.  It  was 
subsequently appraised by three additional wells which encountered oil in the Birdrong Sandstone. Tap has 
previously recognised a net 2C Contingent Resource of 0.9 MMstb for the Taunton field which is primarily in 
the Birdrong Sandstone reservoir (2015 Tap Annual Report).
In 2014 approval was granted for the variation of the TP/7 Year 3-5 work program (July 2014 – July 2017) to 
substitute the 3D seismic acquisition and well commitment with geotechnical studies.
The 2016 Work Program and Budget approved by the Joint Venture includes the abandonment of the Airlie 
Island  Storage  Facility  and  Chervil  5  and  6  wells,  with  work  commencing  in  the  first  half  of  2016.    The 
removal of the Chervil platform is being considered for 2017. During June the operator mobilised equipment 
to  Airlie  island  to  commence  removal  of  the  old  oil  storage  tanks  and  other  production  equipment  on  the 
island. This work was completed at the end of July. The abandonment of the Chervil 5 and 6 wells was also 
completed at the end of July.
WA-515-P & WA-516-P (Tap share 100%)
Tap  was  awarded  100%  of  blocks  W14-7  (now  permit  WA-515-P)  and  W14-16  (now  permit  WA-516-P) 
offered  under  the  2014  Offshore  Petroleum  Exploration  Acreage  Release.    WA-515-P  and  WA-516-P  are 
located in the northern Carnarvon Basin in shallow water.  Tap has agreed to a three year work program for 
each block, with each program running from 6 March 2015 to 5 March 2018.  The primary term work program 
for  each  block  comprises  160  km2  reprocessing  of  open  file  3D  seismic  data,  quantative  interpretation 
studies and geotechnical studies.  Estimated expenditure for each block in the primary 3 year term is A$0.8 
million.  The majority of these funds are anticipated to be spent from 2016 onwards.
Tap has licensed reprocessed Multi-client 3D seismic data over the two permits in order to satisfy the  year 
one commitment for both permits.  Evaluation and interpretation of this data is ongoing.
WA-34-R (Tap share 12%, Operator ENI)
WA-34-R  is  a  retention  lease  in  the  offshore  Bonaparte  Basin,  Western  Australia.  The  retention  lease 
contains  the  Prometheus/Rubicon  Gas  fields  and  covers  418  km2.    Tap  estimates  gross  2C  contingent 
resources  of  377  PJ  and  a  net  resource  to  Tap  of  45  PJ.    A  Retention  Lease  Renewal  application  was 
submitted to NOPTA and was granted by the Authority on 23 December 2015.  The renewal is  for five years 
to 22 December 2020.
Other Exploration
Tap also has the following interests:
1.  a 20% interest in WA-8-L in the offshore Carnarvon Basin which contains the Amulet oil discovery; and
2.  a 22.474% interest in WA-33-R in the offshore Carnarvon Basin which contains the Maitland gas discovery.
Financial Summary
Tap’s  revenue  for  the  first  half  of  2016  was  US$28.1  million  (2015:    US$55.4  million).    Gross  profit  was 
US$4.1  million  (2015:  US$14.8  million).  After  impairment  losses  and  write-downs  of  US$5.0  million  (2015:  
US$24.4 million), the net loss before tax was US$7.7 million (2015:  net loss before tax of US$19.7 million); 
and  the  net  loss  after  tax  was  US$6.0  million  (2015:  net  loss  after  tax  of  US$17.4  million).  Net  cash  flows 
from operations were US$18.4 million (2015: US$29.0 million).
Revenues  from  the  gas  contracts  were  lower  in  the  first  half  of  2016  due  to  lower  volumes  sold.    Gas 
volumes  delivered  were  lower  due  to  an  increase  in  deferred  delivery  under  take-or-pay  arrangements 
(banking).
Manora  revenues  were  US$17.7  million  (2015:  US$44.0  million)  which  consisted  of  13  oil  liftings  totalling 
587,662 bbls (2015: 798,875 bbls) sold at an average of US$30/bbl (2015: US$55/bbl).
Forming part of the cost of sales is the depreciation charged on a unit of production basis.  The depreciation 
of US$13.3m (2015: US$19.6m) charged for the  half year ended 30 June 2016  relates to the Manora oil & 
gas asset.

TAP OIL LIMITED
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The impairment loss relate predominantly to the write off of Manora exploration asset of US$4.4  million while 
the  prior  period  impairment  loss  relates  to  property,  plant  and  equipment  of  US$19.1  million  of  which 
US$17.8 million relates to the Manora development asset and US$1.3 million the Airlie development asset.
Administration costs were higher for the period at US$4.2 million (2015: US$2.6 million) due to redundancy 
costs and legal fees related to NGP arbitration.
Financing
On 31 March 2016, Tap announced that it had executed an Amended Facility Agreement with BNP Paribas 
and Siam Commercial Bank (BNP Facility).   The Company had been in discussions  with BNP  Paribas and 
Siam Commercial Bank regarding amendments to the terms of the BNP Facility so as to deal with the impact 
of lower oil prices on the facility.  The amendments provide the Company with additional liquidity with which 
to service its ongoing working capital requirements.
The amendments, executed on 31 March 2016, include reducing the minimum liquidity amount that needs to 
be held from US$10 million to US$3 million, and reducing amounts required to be held by the Company by 
way of restricted funds
As part of the above amended facility agreement, the Company:
  hedged  approximately  700,000  barrels  of  forecast  Manora  production  from  April  2016  to  February 
2017  at  an  average  swap  price  of  US$42.15/bbl,  representing  approximately  47.5%  of  forecast 
volumes over the 11 month period; and

completed a capital raising to raise A$7.75 million (before costs) representing 155,052,129 shares.  
The capital raising was completed on 18 April 2016.
Tap has made loan repayments totaling $US14.9 million during the half year, reducing the outstanding debt 
balance under the BNP Facility from US$36.1 million to US$21.2 million at 30 June 2016.
The modifications to the  BNP Facility strengthen the Company’s financial position and improve its ability to 
withstand further prolonged periods of low oil prices until the market improves.
Equity Raising
On  18  April  2016,  Tap  announced  the  closing  of  the  Rights  Issue  to  raise  A$7.75  million  (before  costs) 
representing  155,052,129  shares.  The  Rights 
the 
oversubscriptions  were  scaled  back  based  on  shares  held  at  record  date.  As  a  result  there  was  no 
requirement for underwriting by any party.
Issue  was  oversubscribed  by  A$0.62m  and
Funds  raised  from  the  Rights  Issue  satisfied  one  of  the  conditions  to  the  restructure  of  the  Company’s 
borrowing  base  debt  facility  with  BNP  Paribas  and  Siam  Commercial  Bank,  that  the  Company  raise  a 
minimum  of  US$5  million  in  additional  capital  with  the  funds  ultimately  being  used  for  working  capital 
purposes.
The  Company’s  major  shareholders,  Risco  Energy  Investments  (SEA)  Limited  (Risco)  and  Northern  Gulf 
Petroleum Holdings Limited (NGP), both subscribed for the full amount of their pro rata entitlement under the 
Rights Issue, being approximately A$1.5 million each.
Hedging
In March 2016 Tap executed hedging for approximately 700,000 barrels of forecast Manora production from 
April 2016 to February 2017 at an average swap price of US$42.15/bbl, representing approximately 47.5% of 
forecast volumes over the 11 month period.
Cost Reduction Initiatives & Board Changes
During the period, Tap announced that to ensure that it is able to continue to comply with the covenants in 
the amended BNP Facility, it had implemented a range of strategies including internal cost cutting, deferment 
of  non-core  activities  and  supporting  the  Operator’s  focus  on  the  reduction  of  Manora  operating  costs.    As 
part  of  these  cost  cutting  initiatives  the  Company  had  decided  to  seek  to  divest  its  Australian  exploration 
portfolio  that  has  material  outstanding  commitments,  and  to  farmout,  defer  or  materially  reduce  the 
Company’s  expenditure  in  Myanmar.    To  date  the  Company  has  not  been  succesful  in  divesting  its 
Australian exploration portfolio, but continues to review opportunities to do so.
With the significantly reduced activities of the Company, the Company’s staffing requirements have changed, 
with staff being reduced from 18 full time equivalent staff to 8 full time equivalent staff with staff reductions 
taking place in April and June 2016. The staff reductions are expected to reduce overheads by A$1.7 million 
on an annualised basis.
Mr Troy  Hayden stepped down as  the Managing Director of the Company effective from  27 May  2016, but 
will  remain  in  a  part-time  role  as  CEO,  paid  at  a  pro  rata  rate  of  his  current  annual  salary,  until  a  suitable
5

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
replacement  is  found.    Termination  benefits  paid  to  Mr  Hayden  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  his  2010 
Employment  Agreement  as  approved  by  shareholders  in  May  2011,  and  as  amended  and  approved  by 
shareholders  in  May  2013.    This  may  represent  an  amount  of  up  to  A$525,000  in  total  depending  on  the 
termination date of his services.
Unmarketable Parcels
In June 2016 Tap established a Share Sale Facility for holders of unmarketable parcels, to enable them to 
sell  their  shares  without  incurring  any  brokerage  or  other  costs  that  could  otherwise  make  a  sale  of  their 
shares unecomnomic.  The Company is seeking to reduce costs associated with maintaining a large number 
of  small  holdings.    This  Facility  closed  on  the  3  August  2016  and  proceeds  have  been  remitted  to 
shareholders.
Risk Management and Corporate Governance
The Consolidated Entity’s risk management and corporate governance statements were included in the 2015 
annual report.  These statements remain current.
Changes to Equity
155,052,129 shares were issued pursuant to a pro-rata renounceable rights issue announced on 14  March 
2016 to raise up to approximately A$7.75 million (before costs) and which closed on 13 April 2016.
A  total  of  5,002,576  employee  share  rights  were  issued  during  the  half-year  ended  30  June  2016  (2015:  
5,253,158).  835,853  shares  were  issued  during  the  half  year  ended  30  June  2016  (2015:  101,695)  as  a 
result  of  the  vesting  of  employee  share  rights.    A  total  of  2,707,724  share  rights  expired,  lapsed  or  were 
cancelled  during the half-year ended 30 June 2016 (2015: 2,440,211). The total number of share rights  on 
issue at 30 June 2016 was 14,736,778 (2015: 14,839,309).
Since  30  June  2016,  9,456,659  performance  rights  lapsed,  522,485  retention  rights  vested,  and  459,176 
retention rights lapsed.
Auditor’s Independence Declaration
The auditor’s independence declaration is included on page 7 of the half-year report.
Rounding Off of Amounts
The Company is a company of the kind referred to in ASIC Class Order 98/0100, dated 10 July 1998, and in 
accordance  with  that  Class  Order  amounts  in  the  directors’  report  and  the  half-year  financial  report  are

Independent Auditor’s Review Report to the 
members of Tap Oil Limited 
 
We  have  reviewed  the  accompanying  half-year  financial  report  of  Tap  Oil  Limited,  which 
comprises  the  condensed  statement  of  financial  position  as  at  30  June  2016,  and  the 
condensed  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income,  the  condensed 
statement of cash flows and the condensed statement of changes in equity for the half-year 
ended on that date, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information,  and  the  directors’ declaration of the consolidated entity comprising 
the  company  and  the  entities it  controlled  at the  end  of the  half-year  or  from  time  to time 
during the half-year as set out on pages 10 to 29.  
 
Directors’ Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report 
 
The  directors  of  the  company  are  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  half-year  financial 
report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and 
the  Corporations  Act  2001  and  for  such  internal  control  as  the  directors  determine  is 
necessary to enable the preparation of the half-year financial report that gives a true and fair 
view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  a  conclusion  on  the  half-year  financial  report  based  on  our 
review.  We  conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  Auditing  Standard  on  Review 
Engagements ASRE 2410 Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor 
of  the  Entity, in  order  to  state  whether,  on  the basis  of  the  procedures  described,  we  have 
become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the half-year financial report is not in 
accordance  with  the  Corporations  Act  2001  including:  giving  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the 
consolidated  entity’s financial position as at  30 June 2016  and  its performance for the half-
year  ended  on  that  date;  and  complying  with  Accounting  Standard  AASB  134  Interim 
Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Tap Oil Limited, 
ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the 
annual financial report. 
 
A  review  of  a  half-year  financial  report  consists  of  making  enquiries,  primarily  of  persons 
responsible  for  financial  and  accounting  matters,  and  applying  analytical  and  other  review 
procedures.    A  review  is  substantially  less  in  scope  than  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance 
with Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance 
that we  would  become  aware  of  all  significant  matters  that  might  be identified  in  an  audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation. 
 
Member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited
Auditor’s Independence Declaration 
 
In  conducting  our  review,  we  have  complied  with  the  independence  requirements  of  the 
Corporations  Act  2001.  We  confirm  that  the  independence  declaration  required  by  the 
Corporations Act 2001, which has been given to the directors of Tap Oil Limited, would be in 
the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor’s review report.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Based  on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that 
makes  us  believe that  the  half-year  financial  report  of  Tap  Oil  Limited  is  not in  accordance 
with the Corporations Act 2001, including: 
 
(a) giving  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  consolidated  entity’s  financial  position  as  at  30  June
2016 and of its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
(b) complying  with  Accounting  Standard  AASB  134  Interim  Financial  Reporting  and  the
Corporations Regulations 2001.

‘Interim Financial Reporting’. The half-year financial report does not include notes of the type 
normally  included  in  an  annual  financial  report  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the 
most recent annual financial report.
Basis of preparation
The  condensed  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  the  basis  of  historical  cost, 
except  for  the  revaluation  of  certain  non-current  assets  and  financial  instruments.    Cost  is 
based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for assets.  All amounts are 
presented in US dollars, unless otherwise noted.
Tap  Oil  Limited  (the  Company  or  Tap)  is  a  company  of  the  kind  referred  to  in  ASIC  Class 
Order 98/0100, dated 10 July 1998, and in accordance with that Class Order amounts in the 
directors’  report  and  the  half-year  financial  report  are  rounded  off  to  the  nearest  thousand 
dollars, unless otherwise indicated.
Going concern
The  half  year  financial  report  for  Tap  Oil  Limited  has  been  prepared  on  the  going  concern 
basis  which  contemplates  the  continuity  of  normal  business  activity  and  the  realisation  of 
assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The  Consolidated  Entity  has  incurred  a  net  loss  before  tax  of  $7.69  million  (30  June  2015: 
loss before tax of $19.68 million ) and had net working capital deficiency of $16.57 million for 
the half year ended 30 June 2016 (30 Dec 15: working capital deficiency of $13.26 million).
The Directors have reviewed the Consolidated Entity’s overall position and outlook in respect 
of the matters identified above and are of the opinion that the use of the going concern basis 
remains  appropriate.    The  consolidated  entity  is  expected  to  generate  sufficient  cash  flows 
from  its  operations  to  meet  its  commitments  over  the  next  12  months  as  well  as  satisfy  its 
financing covenants.
Accounting policies
The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of the half-
year financial report are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Company’s 2015 
annual financial report for the financial year ended 31 December 2015, except for the impact 
of  the  Standards  and  Interpretations  described  below.  These  accounting  policies  are 
consistent  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  with  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards.  Certain  comparative  information  has  been  reclassified  to  conform  with  current 
period presentation.

Impairment of development expenditures 
 
 
At  30  June  2016,  the  Consolidated  Entity  has  assessed  each  cash  generating  unit  to 
determine  whether  an  impairment  indicator  existed.    Airlie  development  asset  was  fully 
impaired  at  31  December  2015  as  not  recoverable  through  development  or  sale  with  all 
costs incurred during the current half year expensed.   
 
An impairment assessment was performed on the Manora development asset of US$65.5 
million  (2015:  US$74.5  million).    The  recoverable  amount  of  the  asset  was  determined 
based on a five year value in use model, which supported the existing carrying value. 
 
The following assumptions were used in the assessment of the recoverable amount: 
•
Discount rate – post-tax discount rate of 13.3% (2015: 11%) has been applied to the 
cash flow projections; 
Inflation  rate  –inflation  rate  of  2%  (2015:  2%)  has  been  applied  to  the  cash  flow 
projections; 
Oil price – the oil price applied to the cash flow projections is based on the average 
of  analysts’  forecast  price  at  the  date  of  assessment  for  4  years  then  thereafter 
increased  by  2%  inflation.    The  oil  price  assumptions  for  the  remainder  of  2016, 
2017 and 2018 are US$50.35/bbl, US$54.28/bbl and U$59.95/bbl respectively.
•
•
Sensitivity analysis
It is estimated that changes in the key assumptions would  impact the net recoverable amount as 
follows:
Discount rate: 1% increase
Discount rate: 1% decrease
Long term oil price decrease of US$5/bbl
Long term oil price increase of US$5/bbl

Ultimate recoupment of this expenditure is dependent upon the continuance of Tap’s right to 
tenure of the areas of interest and the discovery of commercially viable oil and gas reserves, 
their successful development and exploration, or, alternatively sale of the respective areas of 
interest at an amount at least equal to book value. Impairment losses are provided when the 
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. Exploration expenditure is written off and 
any related impairment losses released when permits are relinquished or disposed.

On 31 March 2016 Tap announced the execution of an Amended Facility Agreement with 
BNP Paribas and The Siam Commercial Bank (BNP Facility). The amendments provide the 
Company  with  additional  liquidity  with  which  to  service  its  ongoing  working  capital 
requirements.
The amendments include reducing the minimum liquidity amount that needs to be held from 
US$10 million to US$3 million, and reducing amounts required to be held by the Company 
by way of restricted funds.
In  consideration  for  these  modifications,  Tap  agreed  to  pay  its  debt  financiers  an 
arrangement fee and to increase the margin payable (over Libor) on amounts  outstanding 
under the BNP Facility.
As at 30 June 2016 the directors had reasonable grounds to believe the minimum liquidity 
threshold would be met and accordingly the classification of the borrowings was determined 
in accordance with the scheduled repayments under the facility.

11   Subsequent events
Since  the  end  of  the  financial  period  the  Directors  are  not  aware  of  any  other  matter  or 
circumstance not otherwise dealt with within the financial report that has significantly or may 
significantly affect the operations of the Consolidated Entity, the results of those operations 
or the state of affairs of the Consolidated Entity in subsequent financial years other than:
Unmarketable parcels
In June 2016 Tap established a Share Sale Facility for holders of unmarketable parcels, to 
enable  them  to  sell  their  shares  without  incurring  any  brokerage  or  other  costs  that  could 
otherwise  make  a  sale  of  their  shares  unecomnomic.    The  Company  is  seeking  to  reduce 
costs  associated  with  maintaining  a  large  number  of  small  holdings.    The  closing  date  for 
receipt of share retention forms was 3 August 2016.
As  at  market  close  on  the  3  August  2016  there  were  5,342,936  ordinary  shares,  held  by 
2,532 shareholders that were subsequently sold.
12  Contingencies and commitments
Success payments in respect of Manora Oil Field development
As  part  of  the  consideration  for  acquiring  the  G1/48  permit  in  2010,  Tap Energy  (Thailand) 
Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of Tap Oil Limited), is liable to make a 2P Reserves Deferred Payment 
to NGPH.  The payment is calculated pro-rata based on 2P reserves between 10mmbbls and 
35mmbbls.
Tap paid an initial 2P Reserves Deferred Payment of US$7.65 million in August 2012, based 
on  the  Operator’s  Manora  2P  gross  reserves  estimate  of  20.2  mmbbls  at  the  time  of  the 
Manora Final Investment Decision (FID).  A second payment of US$1.31 million became due 
on 31 December 2014 and a third payment of US$4.59 million became due based on the 31 
December 2015 2P Reserves as estimated by NSAI.
Further  payments  (up  to  a  maximum  of  US$23.94  million)  may  become  payable  based  on 
the Operator’s 2P reserves estimate at year end, and are payable up to four years after first 
production  (conditional  on  the  Manora  2P  Reserves  (plus  recovered  oil)  remaining  greater 
than 10mmbbls).
Default on repayment of Tap Carry
Under the terms relating to Tap’s acquisition of its 30% interest in the G1/48 Concession and 
the Manora Oil Development from Northern Gulf Petroleum Holdings Limited (NGPH) and its 
subsidiary Northern Gulf Petroleum Pte. Ltd (NGP), NGP agreed to repay US$10 million to 
Tap  out  of  NGP’s  share  of  production  from  that  project.    This  is  an  ongoing  repayment 
obligation as and when proceeds are received from each oil lifting.
After  repaying  approximately  US$1.03  million  from  proceeds  of  oil  liftings  to  date,  NGP 
ceased making any further repayments to Tap.  Tap has served notice on each of NGP and 
NGPH regarding NGP’s failure to pay amounts owing to Tap in connection with NGP’s share 
of  production  from  the  G1/48  concession.    As  at  31  December  2015,  the  full  remaining 
balance  of  US$8,967,629  was  due  and  payable  and  Tap  has  issued  default  notices  in 
respect  of  an  amount  totaling  US$8,967,629.    The  defaulted  amounts  remain  outstanding 
and are accruing interest.
Tap  Energy  (Thailand)  Pty  Ltd  initiated  arbitration  proceedings  against  NGP  on  19  August 
2015 (see below).
Northern Gulf Notice of Default on payment of Earn Out
On 15 October 2015, NGPH issued Tap Energy (Thailand) Pty Ltd with four default notices 
for  their  failure  to  pay  the  earn  out  fee  of  2%  on  revenue  generated  by  the  concessions 
(payable  provided  the  oil  price  remained  above  US$50/bbl)  as  agreed  to  under  the  terms 
relating to Tap’s acquisition of its 30% interest in the G1/48 Concession and the Manora Oil

Development from NGPH.  The amounts payable under these default notices can be set-off 
under  the  arbitration  (see  below)  against  amounts  owing  in  respect  of  repayment  of  the 
carried costs.
Notice of Arbitration
Tap Energy (Thailand) Pty Ltd, filed on 19 August 2015, a Notice of Arbitration in Singapore 
against  Northern  Gulf  Petroleum  Pte  Ltd,  Northern  Gulf  Petroleum  Holdings  Limited  and 
Northern Gulf Oil (Thailand) Co. Ltd (collectively NGP) in regards to payments due under the 
sale  and  purchase  agreement  for  Tap’s  acquisition  of  its  30%  interest  in  the  G1/48 
concession.    Tap  is  seeking  settlement  and  set  off  of  the  following  disputed  acquisition 
payments under that sale and purchase agreement:
1.
2.
3.
4.
The  US$1.31  million  which  Tap  has  calculated  is  due  and  payable  by  Tap  to  NGP  in 
respect of the 2P reserves payment for the period to 31 December 2014;
The  US$4.59  million  which  Tap  has  calculated  is  due  and  payable  by  Tap  to  NGP  in 
respect of the 2P reserves payment for the period to 31 December 2015;
Carried costs up to US$10 million payable by NGP to Tap of which US$1.03 million has 
been paid with US$8.97 million due and payable; and
To the extent NGP is entitled to any additional payments for 2P reserves, these can be 
set off.
After  repeated  attempts  to  resolve  the  payment  dispute  with  NGP,  Tap  is  pursuing  this 
arbitration against NGP in Singapore, as permitted under the sale and purchase agreement, 
to recover the carry repay and to set-off the 2P reserves payments.
NGPH’s earn-out claim has not been referred to in the Notice of Arbitration, but can still be 
set-off against amounts owing in respect of repayment of the carried costs, if, or when, raised 
by NGPH.
NGP’s defence and counterclaim includes its earlier claim that the 2P reserves payment for 
the period to 31 December 2014 should be US$14.6 million, not US$1.31 million

14  Fair value measurement of financial instruments
The  directors  consider  that  the  carrying  amount  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities 
recorded in the financial statements approximates their fair value.
The fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:


the  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  with  standard  terms  and 
conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted 
market prices; and
the  fair  values  of  other  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  determined  in 
accordance  with  generally  accepted  pricing  models  based  on  discounted  cash  flow 
analysis.
The  following  table  details  the  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities,  which 
represents  a  reasonable  approximation  of  the  carrying  value  of  the  financial  assets  and 
liabilities:
