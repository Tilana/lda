<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/12. 
</p>
<p>It outlines the activities of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants from 
</p>
<p>1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014. The thematic section is dedicated to European Union 
</p>
<p>border management and the human rights of migrants.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Participation in consultations and conferences  
</b></p>
<p>2. In November 2014, the Special Rapporteur organized an international consultation 
</p>
<p>on recruitment practices and migrant workers at which a thorough and dynamic dialogue 
</p>
<p>was held about key issues, barriers and policy options. The findings will be included in the 
</p>
<p>2015 report of the Special Rapporteur to the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>3. In addition, the Special Rapporteur contributed to a number of international and 
</p>
<p>regional dialogues and conferences, including the annual conference on migrants&#8217; rights of 
</p>
<p>the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, and the seventh dialogue on 
</p>
<p>protection of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
</p>
<p>on the theme &#8220;Protection at sea&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits  
</b></p>
<p>4. Having found that the 1.8 million Sri Lankans working abroad face many human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses, the Special Rapporteur visited Sri Lanka from 19 to 26 May 2014. He 
</p>
<p>recommended that the Government take a range of measures, including bilateral 
</p>
<p>agreements with countries of destination, the abolishment of recruitment fees for migrants 
</p>
<p>and the full implementation of the code of ethical conduct for private agencies. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur visited Italy from 2 to 6 December 2014. He found that, 
</p>
<p>despite a challenging economic and political climate, Italy has taken bold initiatives to 
</p>
<p>address the unprecedented number of migrants and asylum seekers arriving by boat. He 
</p>
<p>stressed that European Union member States must collectively support front-line States to 
</p>
<p>provide a sustainable response that fully respects the human rights of migrants.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur visited Malta from 6 to 10 December 2014. Following that 
</p>
<p>visit, he said that Malta must expect continued growth in the unprecedented number of 
</p>
<p>migrants and asylum seekers arriving by boat and develop programmes to cope.  
</p>
<p><b> C. European Union follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>7. The visits to Italy and Malta were complemented by a visit to the European Union in 
</p>
<p>Brussels, as part of a follow-up to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2012 year-long study on the 
</p>
<p>management of the external borders of the Union. In 2013, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>remained convinced of the importance of addressing irregular border crossings, which is 
</p>
<p>where the most egregious human rights abuses appeared to take place. The increased 
</p>
<p>numbers of migrant crossings and deaths in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as weaknesses 
</p>
<p>in the response by European Union member States, prompted the Special Rapporteur to 
</p>
<p>revisit the issues. In addition, the President of the Human Rights Council requested him, at 
</p>
<p>the Council&#8217;s twenty-seventh session, to monitor the situation of migrants at sea.  </p>


<p>8. The present report should be read alongside the reports on the visits to Italy and 
</p>
<p>Malta and the report to the Human Rights Council on European Union border management 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/23/46).  
</p>
<p><b> III. Follow-up to the 2013 regional study on management of the 
external borders of the European Union and its impact on the 
human rights of migrants  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>9. Despite some positive developments, the human rights issues raised in the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s 2013 report persist. The continued ineffectiveness and paradoxes of European 
</p>
<p>Union border management policies and the lack of a coherent, human rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach to migration have been vividly and visibly demonstrated by the deaths of migrants 
</p>
<p>in the Mediterranean Sea. These tragic events have propelled the issue of the human rights 
</p>
<p>of migrants who use sea-based migratory routes into the spotlight. Suffering that is less 
</p>
<p>frequently discussed is also being seen at all stages of migration, including within the 
</p>
<p>European Union.  
</p>
<p>10. Given the European Union&#8217;s share of global resources and wealth of substantive 
</p>
<p>normative standards, recent deaths at sea and other human rights issues have to be seen as 
</p>
<p>the result of collective political will and policy choices. The suffering of so many and the 
</p>
<p>tendency of migration to take place clandestinely is a symptom of systemic failings within 
</p>
<p>the European Union border management system and a clear sign that the region is losing 
</p>
<p>control of migration despite sustained investment in securing borders. These failings also 
</p>
<p>cut deeper and speak to how the European Union responds to difference and diversity.  
</p>
<p>11. The costs associated with attempting to sustain the status quo are huge. The human 
</p>
<p>costs continue to rise as migrants die at sea and suffer on a large scale at borders, within the 
</p>
<p>European Union, as well as in neighbouring countries. Furthermore, the resources lost 
</p>
<p>through investing into an ineffective system and not maximizing the opportunities to 
</p>
<p>benefit from organized migration are significant.  
</p>
<p>12. To remedy this, the European Union needs to take a whole-system view of migration 
</p>
<p>and review how its related policies and underlying concepts can be shifted to develop a 
</p>
<p>human rights-based approach. Taking a long-term view and banking on mobility over the 
</p>
<p>next 25 years will better place the Union to respond to the significant economic, social and 
</p>
<p>demographic changes that lie ahead.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Overview of migration since 2013  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Sustained increases in non-European Union migrants have not been seen but irregular 
</b></p>
<p><b>migration and asylum applications are increasing  
</b></p>
<p>13. A sustained increase in overall migration from third countries has not been seen over 
</p>
<p>the past five years. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
</p>
<p>estimates that, in 2012, the European Union experienced a 12per cent decline in migration 
</p>
<p>involving non-European Union nationals.1 The overall decrease in flows to the European 
</p>
<p>Union is reflective of the fact that the region has broadly deemed migration from third-
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 OECD, &#8220; Is migration really increasing?&#8221;, Migration Policy Debates (May 2014). </p>


<p>country nationals to be undesirable and dramatically reduced regular migration 
</p>
<p>opportunities.  
</p>
<p>14. The direct secondary effects of this approach can be seen in irregular migration 
</p>
<p>trends. While regular migration to the European Union is decreasing, a clear trend since the 
</p>
<p>2013 report is an increase in irregular migration and asylum claims. The European Agency 
</p>
<p>for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member 
</p>
<p>States of the European Union (FRONTEX) reported that, in the fourth quarter of 2014, 
</p>
<p>irregular migration was at the highest level (100,000 irregular crossings) since 2007, when 
</p>
<p>data started to be shared within the context of the FRONTEX Risk Analysis Network 
</p>
<p>(FRAN).  
</p>
<p>15. Asylum claims have also significantly increased. Having peaked in 1992 (670,000) 
</p>
<p>and again in 2001 (424,200), the number of asylum applications within the European Union 
</p>
<p>fell to just below 200,000 in 2006. From that relative low point, there was a gradual 
</p>
<p>increase in the number of applications until 2012, after which the rate of change quickened 
</p>
<p>considerably as the number of asylum seekers rose to almost 450,000 in 2013.  
</p>
<p>16. Within the global context, the proportion of those displaced by humanitarian 
</p>
<p>emergencies seeking refuge in Europe is still small. As reported by UNHCR, the world is 
</p>
<p>currently experiencing the highest levels of displacement since the end of World War II 
</p>
<p>and, at the beginning of 2015, 1.3 million refugees were registered in Lebanon and 1.9 
</p>
<p>million in Turkey. In comparison, the European Union assessed around 620,000 asylum 
</p>
<p>applications in 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Migration trends are diverging  
</b></p>
<p>17. Trends in regular migration to the European Union are not affecting all European 
</p>
<p>Union member States evenly. Countries such as Germany, Finland and France have seen 
</p>
<p>increasing flows in 2012, while Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland have experienced a decrease in permanent inward migration.2 
</p>
<p>18. Trends in asylum claims too show divergence, with Eurostat figures for 2014 
</p>
<p>ranging from 126,705 in Germany to 55 in Liechtenstein. Also according to Eurostat, the 
</p>
<p>proportion of applications being processed by Germany, Sweden and Italy went from 37per 
</p>
<p>cent in 2010 to 60 per cent in 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Sea-based migration and deaths at sea  
</b></p>
<p>19. While a number of precarious, sea-based routes to the European Union exist, by far 
</p>
<p>the most commonly used since 2013 has been the central Mediterranean route. The 
</p>
<p>dramatic increase in the use of that route has tragically resulted in large-scale loss of life. 
</p>
<p>UNHCR estimates that 3,000 people died or went missing at sea in 2014. Events in the first 
</p>
<p>four months of 2015 suggest that the use of this route and the associated avoidable deaths 
</p>
<p>of migrants continue at an alarming pace.  
</p>
<p>20. While the majority of sea-based migration passes through the central Mediterranean 
</p>
<p>Sea, the European Union is aware that, as a result of efforts to secure the border with 
</p>
<p>Turkey, more refugees and migrants have begun taking the route across the Aegean Sea to 
</p>
<p>the Greek islands. FRONTEX reported that during the period from July to September 
</p>
<p>record numbers of migrants used those channels. In October 2014, the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Refugees warned that the situation was reaching crisis point. 
</p>

<p><b> 4. Increased xenophobia towards migrants  
</b></p>
<p>21. Against a backdrop of a poor economic climate, the rise in nationalist populist 
</p>
<p>parties within the European Union and the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris at the beginning 
</p>
<p>of 2015, xenophobia and hate speech have increased. This rise in xenophobia against 
</p>
<p>migrants since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2013 report is a significant trend relating to how 
</p>
<p>migrants are perceived in Europe, as well as a stumbling block in the development of more 
</p>
<p>progressive policies.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Positive developments  
</b></p>
<p>22. A number of positive developments have taken place in relation to the human rights 
of migrants within the European Union. These include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Judgements of the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of 
</p>
<p>Justice, which have challenged externalization practices, &#8220;the Dublin logic&#8221;, immigration 
</p>
<p>detention and access to social protection issues;  
</p>
<p> (b) The work of FRONTEX Fundamental Rights Officer Inmaculada Arnaez 
</p>
<p>Fernandez and her staff, which includes the establishment of a code of conduct for joint 
</p>
<p>return operations, the Vega Children Handbook and the establishment of a mechanism for 
</p>
<p>monitoring fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p> (c) The search and rescue operations provided by both the Government of Italy and 
</p>
<p>FRONTEX through the Mare Nostrum and Triton operations. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>notes, however, that Triton&#8217;s operations have been limited, as discussed below;  
</p>
<p> (d) Regular migration initiatives, including the Blue Card system, the seasonal 
</p>
<p>workers directive and the draft student and researchers directive; 
</p>
<p> (e) Efforts by the European Parliament and the European Commission to respond to 
</p>
<p>the current crisis in the Mediterranean Sea; 
</p>
<p> (f) The attention of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights on the 
</p>
<p>human rights of migrants, including at the Agency&#8217;s 2014 annual conference.  
</p>
<p>23. Despite these positive elements, a continued focus on security continues to structure 
</p>
<p>the way in which the European Union handles border management. A wholesale, coherent 
</p>
<p>integration of the human rights of migrants in policies is missing. The system continues to 
</p>
<p>be characterized by complexity, a lack of harmonization between relevant policies and 
</p>
<p>regional and international human rights standards, limited responsibility sharing and the 
</p>
<p>absence of the political will needed to initiate the required changes.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Analysis of the European Union</b>&#8217;s management of migration and 
<b>control of its external borders in relation to the human rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Status quo is not sustainable  
</b></p>
<p>24. The current European Union border management system is buckling under the 
</p>
<p>pressure of increased irregular migration, despite the relatively small proportion of those 
</p>
<p>displaced by crisis seeking refuge in the Union.  
</p>
<p>25. As migrants continue to die at sea, and large-scale suffering is experienced at each 
</p>
<p>stage of migration, it is clear that the European Union does not control migration. This lack 
</p>
<p>of control manifests itself in a number of different ways, raising a wide range of human 
</p>
<p>rights concerns, many of which have persisted since 2013 and have gained increasing 
</p>
<p>impetus and urgency over the past two years.  </p>


<p><i>  Precarious routes into the European Union and human rights  
</i></p>
<p>26. The use of precarious routes into the European Union, particularly through the 
</p>
<p>central Mediterranean Sea, has increased dramatically since 2013 and resulted in large-
</p>
<p>scale violations of the right to life, as well as significant human rights abuses at all stages of 
</p>
<p>the migratory process. This form of migration is driven largely by conflict and poverty 
</p>
<p>(push factors), as well as by unmet needs within European labour markets (pull factor). 
</p>
<p>Many of these migrants are being forced to use precarious routes because of their desperate 
</p>
<p>situation and a lack of regular migration opportunities.  
</p>
<p>27. Organized smuggling rings are profiting from this lack of regular migration 
</p>
<p>channels, staying ahead of border control initiatives and facilitating crossings through 
</p>
<p>precarious routes in exchange for large payments. Smugglers have displayed a remarkable 
</p>
<p>disregard for the dignity, life and rights of migrants and have systematically exploited those 
</p>
<p>desperate to reach safer soil.  
</p>
<p>28. Commonly, boats carrying migrants to the European Union leave from: Egypt and 
</p>
<p>Libya when using central and eastern Mediterranean channels; Morocco and Tunisia when 
</p>
<p>using the western Mediterranean; and Turkey when using the Aegean Sea route. Many 
</p>
<p>migrants have come an extremely long way, including from sub-Saharan countries and 
</p>
<p>countries in the Middle East, to make these journeys. Migrants travelling through the 
</p>
<p>Sahara are subjected to horrific treatment, including rape and other forms of violence.  
</p>
<p>29. When migrants reach their intended country of departure, they often suffer further 
</p>
<p>violations of their rights. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights has 
</p>
<p>published reports of makeshift camps with extremely poor conditions that are run by 
</p>
<p>migrants in Morocco, as well as of migrants locked in small huts by smugglers in Turkey. 
</p>
<p>Smugglers typically charge several thousand United States dollars per person for boat 
</p>
<p>journeys to the European Union. Families with multiple members can pay in excess of 
</p>
<p>US$ 10,000 to make the trip.  
</p>
<p>30. The boat trips themselves are perilous, involving very basic vessels that have limited 
</p>
<p>navigation systems, are not seaworthy and often have insufficient amounts of food, water, 
</p>
<p>fuel, first aid kits and life jackets. Boats are usually extremely overcrowded and sometimes 
</p>
<p>contain more than double the recommended capacity. Once migrants have paid for the 
</p>
<p>journeys, they are often forced to go ahead with their plans despite sometimes having 
</p>
<p>second thoughts when seeing the vessels. Migrants have reported incidents of boats not 
</p>
<p>having captains, with inexperienced migrants being required to navigate, as smugglers do 
</p>
<p>not want to risk being caught by the authorities.  
</p>
<p>31. When smugglers are on the boats, incidents of sexual violence and slavery against 
</p>
<p>women have been reported. The crossing from North Africa takes, on average, between one 
</p>
<p>and three days, but can increase significantly depending on the boat and the maritime 
</p>
<p>conditions. Many boats capsize or go into distress.  
</p>
<p>32. The search and rescue services provided unilaterally by Italy and FRONTEX are a 
</p>
<p>response to these alarming trends (see appendix). In a report to the Special Rapporteur, the 
</p>
<p>European Commission said that Operation Mare Nostrum had rescued over 160,000 
</p>
<p>persons at sea in 2014 and that Operation Triton was estimated to have rescued 
</p>
<p>approximately 22,300 people between November 2014 and early 2015. In addition, some 
</p>
<p>private and military vessels have saved migrants&#8217; lives. However, as underlined by the 
</p>
<p>International Maritime Organization, the support provided to search and rescue operations 
</p>
<p>by merchant vessels should remain exceptional, and States should shoulder the main 
</p>
<p>responsibility for such operations.  
</p>
<p>33. While positive efforts to protect migrants&#8217; right to life have been made, they remain 
</p>
<p>insufficient. Key challenges include Operation Triton&#8217;s limited mandate for effective search </p>


<p>and rescue operations compared with the mandate of Operation Mare Nostrum, incoherence 
</p>
<p>in search and rescue zone management, tensions between unilateral and regional 
</p>
<p>interventions, disincentives for private and military vessels to provide assistance to 
</p>
<p>migrants, limited resource commitments from member States and difficulties in establishing 
</p>
<p>disembarkation protocols.  
</p>
<p>34. While search and rescue services are a vital part of addressing the human rights 
</p>
<p>challenges faced by migrants trying to reach the European Union by precarious routes, the 
</p>
<p>root causes of the use of these channels must be examined. A key driver is the lack of 
</p>
<p>regular migration channels that reflect the European Union&#8217;s genuine labour needs and the 
</p>
<p>humanitarian and protection needs of those fleeing humanitarian situations. The European 
</p>
<p>Union&#8217;s collective response to the Syrian crisis exposes a remarkably intransigent refusal to 
</p>
<p>offer Syrians any significant migration opportunities. Most European Union member States 
</p>
<p>have preferred to look the other way, unsurprisingly pushing migrants to turn to smugglers.  
</p>
<p>35. The increased use of the central Mediterranean route demonstrates beyond any 
</p>
<p>reasonable doubt that, whatever measures the European Union implements, migrants will 
</p>
<p>continue to come to the region and that &#8220;sealing&#8221; European borders is impossible. The risks 
</p>
<p>that migrants are prepared to take to reach safer soil show that border control measures are 
</p>
<p>not an effective disincentive when desperate people face situations of war, insecurity, 
</p>
<p>violence and extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p><i>  Externalization  
</i></p>
<p>36. Concerning trends in the use of externalization techniques have continued since the 
</p>
<p>publication of the 2013 report. The European Union has adopted the Global Approach to 
</p>
<p>Migration and Mobility as a policy framework with significant scope for future migration 
</p>
<p>governance and border control. The Approach comprises a complex and vast array of 
</p>
<p>loosely associated policy and legal mechanisms, as well as a number of projects in 
</p>
<p>countries of transit and origin.  
</p>
<p>37. Mobility partnerships are a key tool of the Approach and have been prominent in the 
</p>
<p>recent dialogue held by the European Union on its migration and border management. The 
</p>
<p>partnerships address a broad range of issues ranging from development aid to visa 
</p>
<p>facilitation, circular migration programmes and the fight against unauthorized migration, 
</p>
<p>including cooperation on readmission. The European Union has signed mobility 
</p>
<p>partnerships with Azerbaijan, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia since 2013. It has also signed a 
</p>
<p>common agenda on migration and mobility with Nigeria.  
</p>
<p>38. Overall, the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility lacks transparency and 
</p>
<p>clarity on the substantive contents of its multiple and complex elements. Additionally, 
</p>
<p>many agreements reached in the framework of the Approach have weak standing within 
</p>
<p>international law and generally lack monitoring and accountability measures, which allow 
</p>
<p>for power imbalances between countries and for the politics of the day to determine 
</p>
<p>implementation. Nonetheless, the European Union has continued to use the Approach to 
</p>
<p>promote greater &#8220;security&#8221;. There are few signs that mobility partnerships have resulted in 
</p>
<p>additional human rights or development benefits, as projects have unclear specifications 
</p>
<p>and outcomes. The overall focus on security and the lack of policy coherence within the 
</p>
<p>Approach as a whole creates a risk that any benefits arising from human rights and 
</p>
<p>development projects will be overshadowed by the secondary effects of more security-
</p>
<p>focused policies.  
</p>
<p>39. Readmission agreements are an area of particular concern. Despite protections 
</p>
<p>against such practices in European Union legislation, pushbacks and refoulement to 
</p>
<p>countries of origin and third countries with weak rule of law and poor asylum systems have 
</p>
<p>been conducted under the broad auspices of bilateral agreements. The European Court of </p>


<p>Human Rights has challenged such practices. In 2012, the court ruled on <i>Hirsi Jamaa and 
</i></p>
<p><i>Others v. Italy</i>, and held that Italy had violated articles 3, 4 and 14 of the Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by returning Somali and Eritrean 
</p>
<p>migrants travelling by sea back to Libya. The argumentation of the Government of Italy 
</p>
<p>cited the bilateral readmission agreement in place between Italy and Libya. However, the 
</p>
<p>ruling, which was in favour of the applicants and awarded compensation, reflects that 
</p>
<p>bilateral agreements cannot be used to justify practices that are incompatible with human 
</p>
<p>rights. In 2014, in <i>Sharifi and Others v. Italy and Greece</i>, the European Court of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights ruled on the treatment of irregular migrants who had entered Italy from Greece and 
</p>
<p>then had been deported back to Greece, with the fear of subsequent deportation to their 
</p>
<p>respective countries of origin. The Court ruled that both countries had violated articles 3 
</p>
<p>and 13 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 
</p>
<p>and that Italy had violated article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention.  
</p>
<p>40. In 2014, the European Commission launched a pilot project introducing a 
</p>
<p>mechanism in Pakistan and Ukraine to monitor whether the human rights of returnees are 
</p>
<p>respected. The project is implemented by the International Organization for Migration with 
</p>
<p>UNHCR and local partners. The Special Rapporteur urges the European Union to ensure its 
</p>
<p>effective implementation and to analyse and publish the results of this implementation. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, starting now, no one should be returned to any country under the Global 
</p>
<p>Approach to Migration and Mobility without oversight by an effective post-return human 
</p>
<p>rights monitoring mechanism.  
</p>
<p><i>  Continuing use of detention as a tool of border control  
</i></p>
<p>41. After making often extremely long, dangerous and arduous journeys to the European 
</p>
<p>Union, many irregular migrants and asylum seekers are subjected to immigration detention. 
</p>
<p>Detention is also commonly used by many States when migrants are waiting to be returned, 
</p>
<p>either because of an unsuccessful protection claim or because they have been identified 
</p>
<p>through the Eurodac database as having entered the European Union in another country.  
</p>
<p>42. Some instances of immigration detention in European Union member States are in 
</p>
<p>contravention of international human rights law because such detention is defined in 
</p>
<p>domestic law as not reasonable, necessary or proportionate, and because it is not decided on 
</p>
<p>a case-by-case basis. Additionally, there are a number of human rights concerns relating to 
</p>
<p>the impact of detention. Many migrants perceive their treatment as harsh and punitive, 
</p>
<p>despite irregular migration not being in any way a criminal act. Prolonged detention 
</p>
<p>without a clear basis has been shown to have a devastating effect on migrants&#8217; and asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers&#8217; mental health, for example by contributing to post-traumatic stress disorder, 
</p>
<p>anxiety and depression. This is frequently compounded by unacceptable detention 
</p>
<p>conditions, such as unsanitary toilet and shower facilities and unhygienic kitchens. Plus, 
</p>
<p>there is a lack of access to health care, as well as to physical and recreational activities.  
</p>
<p>43. Long periods of immigration detention can also lead to sustained barriers to 
</p>
<p>migrants claiming their economic and social rights, even after having been released. 
</p>
<p>UNHCR research suggests that detention disempowers migrants who are often keen to 
</p>
<p>work. A sustained absence from the labour market and the emotional and mental toll of 
</p>
<p>detention can lead to migrants becoming unnecessarily dependent on State-provided 
</p>
<p>support.  
</p>
<p>44. Of particular concern is the inclusion of children among detainees. Children are 
</p>
<p>usually afforded additional protections by member States and, according to many national 
</p>
<p>policies, are not supposed to be detained. However, if the age of the child is unknown, 
</p>
<p>which is common among those without documents or coming from countries that do not 
</p>
<p>have robust birth registration systems, they can be detained or kept in reception centres 
</p>
<p>until their age can be verified. This can take weeks or months. In some instances, while in </p>


<p>detention, children live and sleep with adults, without any special accommodation made for 
</p>
<p>their young age and without access to education. In others, families are separated in 
</p>
<p>different sections of the detention facility according to age and gender. The detention of 
</p>
<p>children, even for short periods, can have severe negative psychological effects. It has been 
</p>
<p>made clear by the Committee on the Rights of the Child that immigration detention is never 
</p>
<p>ever in the best interest of the child and that families of migrants should not be separated. 
</p>
<p>Hence, unaccompanied minors and families with children should always benefit from 
</p>
<p>alternatives to detention.  
</p>
<p>45. Alternatives to detention are being explored. For example, legal reforms in Italy 
</p>
<p>have reduced immigration detention from 18 to 3 months and, in Greece, the Government 
</p>
<p>has announced a policy change to reduce detention times and release significant numbers of 
</p>
<p>detainees. A number of countries have moved towards more open reception facilities, 
</p>
<p>particularly for vulnerable migrants such as children and families. Despite these welcome 
</p>
<p>changes, prolonged immigration detention, and the associated negative consequences on the 
</p>
<p>human rights of migrants, continues in many member States.  
</p>
<p><i>  Access to justice  
</i></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur notes a promising trend in relation to access to justice, as 
</p>
<p>national and regional bodies appear willing to support migrants in fighting for their rights.  
</p>
<p>47. However, systematic barriers to the right to access justice are in place in many 
</p>
<p>European Union member States. Significant resource constraints are making member States 
</p>
<p>unwilling to invest in services that facilitate access to justice for migrants, such as legal aid 
</p>
<p>and translation and interpretation services. Migrants&#8217; fear of detection and/or deportation if 
</p>
<p>they assert their right to access justice is also a key barrier. Additionally, inconsistencies in 
</p>
<p>access to justice persist, depending upon the rights at stake, the type and nationality of the 
</p>
<p>migrants and the jurisdiction. Finally, a lack of specific rules on courts&#8217; duties to apply 
</p>
<p>sanctions and/or compensation for violations of migrants&#8217; human rights is another 
</p>
<p>important barrier.  
</p>
<p>48. Concerns about access to justice have been expressed in a number of rulings of the 
</p>
<p>European courts. Decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in <i>Louled Massoud v. 
</i></p>
<p><i>Malta</i> (2010) and <i>Suso Musa v. Malta</i> (2013) held that the way in which both applicants 
</p>
<p>were treated violated articles 5 (1) and (4) on the basis that not all the detention had been 
</p>
<p>legal and proceedings to determine its legality had not been adequately implemented. In 
</p>
<p>June 2014, The European Court of Justice made a significant ruling in the case of Bashir 
</p>
<p>Mohamed Ali Mahdi, emphasizing that, under European Union law, a lack of identity 
</p>
<p>papers should not be used to justify extending immigration detention and that migrants 
</p>
<p>should have access to justice to challenge such detention.  
</p>
<p><i>  Fingerprinting and freedom of movement under the Dublin system 
</i></p>
<p>49. Severe restrictions on the movement of asylum seekers under the Dublin system, 
</p>
<p>which are in sharp contrast to the mobility provided to European Union citizens through the 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement framework. Under the Dublin regime, asylum seekers are required to 
</p>
<p>have their claim assessed in the country deemed responsible for their entry into European 
</p>
<p>Union common territory, which is most often the first country of entry. Once fingerprints 
</p>
<p>have been collected, they are entered into the Eurodac database, which is shared among 
</p>
<p>member States. If migrants whose details are stored in this database apply for protection in 
</p>
<p>other member States, they will usually be returned to the country through which they 
</p>
<p>entered the European Union.  
</p>
<p>50. The Dublin regulations have not been accompanied with significant standardization 
</p>
<p>of asylum procedures and criteria, therefore creating incentives for migrants seeking to </p>


<p>remain in the European Union to travel to countries other than their first country of entry. In 
</p>
<p>addition, under the Dublin system, migrants are often retained in front-line countries where 
</p>
<p>there are very limited economic opportunities. For example, Italy has faced a huge influx of 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers as well as a sustained economic downturn. This has resulted in migrants 
</p>
<p>becoming stuck where there are no jobs available for them, with disastrous results for 
</p>
<p>migrants and the host society.  
</p>
<p>51. The system also creates the potential for tension at borders, as many migrants do not 
</p>
<p>want their fingerprints to be taken. Troubling reports have emerged recently about border 
</p>
<p>management officials using force to collect fingerprints. The system also increases the 
</p>
<p>market for smugglers and encourages the use of precarious routes across Europe, as 
</p>
<p>migrants seeking protection are forced to do so in an irregular way, to avoid detection and 
</p>
<p>forced fingerprinting. It is disconcerting to see that European Union rules and practices 
</p>
<p>have caused the reappearance of smuggling routes within the Union, when such routes had 
</p>
<p>practically disappeared with the establishment of freedom of movement.  
</p>
<p>52. The European Commission took note of the issue of forced fingerprinting in 2014. It 
</p>
<p>requested information from European Union member States on the legal frameworks in 
</p>
<p>place and common practices. Some States, such as Greece, Malta and Italy, have legally 
</p>
<p>allowed the use of force if migrants resist fingerprinting, while other States, such as Austria 
</p>
<p>and Ireland, have prohibited such a practice. Responses from all Governments tend to 
</p>
<p>suggest that migrants and asylum seekers are rarely unwilling to give their fingerprints, 
</p>
<p>while others have said that it is very difficult to force a person who fundamentally will not 
</p>
<p>cooperate. Even countries, such as Malta,  that reported migrants being uncooperative at the 
</p>
<p>point of disembarkation claimed the individuals could typically be recalled later for 
</p>
<p>fingerprinting. While these reports by member States are encouraging, troubling anecdotal 
</p>
<p>evidence by migrants and front-line workers suggests that force has been used in countries 
</p>
<p>of first entry to the European Union.  
</p>
<p>53. The European Court of Human Rights has recently ruled on two significant cases in 
</p>
<p>relation to the Dublin logic. As discussed above, in 2014, the European Court of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights ruled, in <i>Sharifi and Others v. Italy and Greece</i>, that both countries had violated 
</p>
<p>articles 3 and 13 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
</p>
<p>Freedoms. In <i>Tarakhel v. Switzerland</i>, in November 2014, the Court ruled on the refusal of 
</p>
<p>Switzerland to examine the asylum application of members of an Afghan family and the 
</p>
<p>decision to send them back to Italy without assurances that their rights would be protected. 
</p>
<p>The Court held that there had been a violation of article 3 of the Convention and discussed 
</p>
<p>&#8220;systemic deficiencies&#8221; in the Italian system. In 2011, in <i>M.S.S v. Belgium and Greece</i>, the 
</p>
<p>Court held that Belgium had violated article 3 of the Convention by deporting an Afghan 
</p>
<p>migrant to Greece despite systemic failures in asylum and social protection provisions.  
</p>
<p>54. Alongside this jurisprudence, there are other signs that the Dublin logic is failing 
</p>
<p>and that the restrictions to freedom of movement are not sustainable. For example, 
</p>
<p>FRONTEX has reported that European Union border States are making significant reforms 
</p>
<p>to detention policies, possibly enabling greater freedom of movement and a decrease in 
</p>
<p>successful returns.  
</p>
<p><i>  Migrant workers  
</i></p>
<p>55. The precarious routes to Europe discussed above are mixed migration channels, with 
</p>
<p>economic migrants also risking their lives to seek opportunities because regular channels 
</p>
<p>for migrant workers to the European Union do not exist. Some progress in opening up 
</p>
<p>economic migration channels has been made through the development of the Blue Card 
</p>
<p>system and the seasonal workers directive. However, use of the Blue Card among European 
</p>
<p>Union member States is low and sustained opportunities for low-skilled migrants are scant. 
</p>
<p>In sectors where regulation is inadequate, such as domestic work, care, construction, </p>


<p>agriculture and tourism, migrants in need of work but unable to get visas come irregularly 
</p>
<p>and can become vulnerable to abuse, violence, restrictions on their freedom of movement 
</p>
<p>and economic exploitation.  
</p>
<p>56. While the relationship between irregular migration status and labour market abuses 
</p>
<p>is complex, the former will tend to increase vulnerability to the latter. Undocumented 
</p>
<p>workers, constrained by circumstances, will perform tasks at great financial, physical and 
</p>
<p>psychological cost. Little attention has been given to the impact European Union labour 
</p>
<p>market dynamics has on pull factors for irregular migration and the suffering of 
</p>
<p>undocumented migrant workers in the European Union. While the human rights 
</p>
<p>implications of using precarious sea routes have been highly visible, the suffering 
</p>
<p>experienced by undocumented migrant workers inside the European Union is largely 
</p>
<p>invisible.  
</p>
<p>57. Migrant workers trying to survive in Europe often find themselves subject to racism 
</p>
<p>and xenophobia. Labour market-related abuses and xenophobia within the overall 
</p>
<p>population are mutually reinforcing. It has been reported that employers do not employ 
</p>
<p>even highly skilled foreign workers and that there is a failure to maximize the potential of 
</p>
<p>migrant workers within the European Union, with many migrants underperforming in the 
</p>
<p>labour market relative to their education, in part because of xenophobic attitudes.  
</p>
<p>58. The unwillingness of European Union member States to ratify the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
</p>
<p>Families reflects the intention to not be held accountable for human rights abuses against 
</p>
<p>undocumented migrant workers.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Developing a human rights-based framework that banks on mobility over 
</b></p>
<p><b>a generation  
</b></p>
<p>59. All the human rights concerns discussed above are signs of stress within the 
</p>
<p>European Union border management and migration systems. They are clear indications that 
</p>
<p>the status quo simply is not sustainable. Ignoring these warning signs and pouring further 
</p>
<p>resources into an ineffective and paradoxical closure system will lead to further avoidable 
</p>
<p>human suffering, as well as wasted resources and lost opportunity costs from not reaping 
</p>
<p>the rewards of organized mobility.  
</p>
<p>60. Developing a human rights-based framework by tackling the most pressing concerns 
</p>
<p>and sustaining the political will needed to stay the course of reform over a generation will 
</p>
<p>allow the European Union to bank on the economic and social benefits of mobility.  
</p>
<p><i>  Developing a human rights-based framework  
</i></p>
<p>61. States assume obligations and duties under international law to respect, protect and 
</p>
<p>fulfil human rights. These obligations and duties on States under international law are also 
</p>
<p>broadly echoed by the standards within the European human rights system, which apply to 
</p>
<p>all regardless of nationality and administrative status.  
</p>
<p>62. A human rights-based framework for migration would ensure the application of 
</p>
<p>these obligations and duties to people in vulnerable situations of migration. It is a 
</p>
<p>framework based on equality and non-discrimination, the duty to protect and access to 
</p>
<p>justice. By upholding the principles of equality and non-discrimination, States acknowledge 
</p>
<p>that human rights are for all and that migrants should be treated as equal rights holders, 
</p>
<p>regardless of their migratory status in relation to the sovereign territory they find 
</p>
<p>themselves in. When migrants are viewed as equal rights holders, a duty to protect them at 
</p>
<p>all stages of the migration process naturally follows. If violations of these rights occur at 
</p>
<p>any point, as equal rights holders, migrants must have access to justice to remedy any 
</p>
<p>injustice.  </p>


<p>63. The establishment of a human rights-based framework based on the core principles 
</p>
<p>and provisions of international and regional law requires immediate action to stop 
</p>
<p>widespread suffering at the borders of the European Union.  
</p>
<p>64. A vital first step is for the European Union to scale up search and rescue operations 
</p>
<p>at sea to at least the level of Operation Mare Nostrum. While some efforts have been made, 
</p>
<p>it is vital that the European Union expand the resources committed to providing assistance 
</p>
<p>to those in distress at sea. The Special Rapporteur urges the European Union to strengthen 
</p>
<p>its search and rescue capacity, while also doing the following: respecting the principle of 
</p>
<p>non-refoulement; allowing irregular migrants to disembark immediately at the nearest port; 
</p>
<p>providing information, care and support to migrants; processing asylum claims equitably; 
</p>
<p>and supporting commercial vessels in exceptional circumstances to carry out rescue 
</p>
<p>operations without risk of retaliation or harassment for being considered accessories to 
</p>
<p>smuggling operations. The priorities should be clear: fighting smuggling operations is less 
</p>
<p>important than saving lives. The argument according to which one should not increase 
</p>
<p>search and rescue capacity in order to avoid encouraging smuggling operations is morally, 
</p>
<p>politically and legally unacceptable when human lives are at stake.  
</p>
<p>65. The development of a human rights-based framework goes beyond protection at sea. 
</p>
<p>Stepping up the creation of alternatives to detention, particularly for children, is another 
</p>
<p>issue of concern that should also be a priority.  
</p>
<p>66. In the long term, the European Union needs to take stock of the durable failure of the 
</p>
<p>Dublin logic and develop options for solidarity among its member States and greater 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement for migrants in Europe. Reversing the present logic, asylum seekers 
</p>
<p>should be able to register their asylum claim in the country of their choice and the European 
</p>
<p>Union should build upon current initiatives and support the countries receiving asylum 
</p>
<p>claims with proportionate and adequate financial and technical support. Standardizing 
</p>
<p>reception conditions and refugee status determination procedures throughout the European 
</p>
<p>Union should be a top priority, in order to avoid &#8220;asylum dumping&#8221; and stress on the 
</p>
<p>countries that offer better conditions.  
</p>
<p>67. Developing a human rights-based framework will require continued commitment 
</p>
<p>and the development of many more regular migration channels, including resettlement 
</p>
<p>opportunities for refugees. The most effective way to do this is to begin a process of 
</p>
<p>opening up regular migration channels to the European Union, exploring a range of options.  
</p>
<p>68. Firstly, many people presently crossing the Mediterranean Sea are, thanks to 
</p>
<p>smugglers, manifestly in need of international protection, such as most Syrians and 
</p>
<p>Eritreans. One cannot expect Syrians to live in camps or cities in Jordan, Lebanon or 
</p>
<p>Turkey indefinitely, with no prospects for a better life. If no other option is available, 
</p>
<p>refugees will take their chances with smugglers in order to provide a future for themselves 
</p>
<p>and their children, as many Europeans have done in similar circumstances in the past. 
</p>
<p>Through resettlement programmes for refugees and other humanitarian visas and 
</p>
<p>opportunities, it is well within the European Union&#8217;s means to develop the mechanisms 
</p>
<p>necessary for providing refuge, over a number of years, for 1 million of refugees displaced 
</p>
<p>by the Syrian and other major conflicts. Together with partner States in the global North 
</p>
<p>and elsewhere, creating a reliable long-term programme will ensure that a large number of 
</p>
<p>refugees will line up for resettlement rather than spend tens of thousands of euros and risk 
</p>
<p>their lives and that of their children in smuggling operations. This would considerably 
</p>
<p>reduce the market for smugglers and the cost of refugee status determination procedures in 
</p>
<p>Europe.  
</p>
<p>69. Secondly, smugglers and exploitative employers are presently implementing the 
</p>
<p>labour mobility that many European labour markets need in order to thrive. Through 
</p>
<p>creative visa opportunities for work at all skills levels, including for low-wage migrants, the </p>


<p>European Union could streamline the number of migrants coming through irregular means. 
</p>
<p>Coupled with entry and exit controls and other supporting initiatives, multi-year and multi-
</p>
<p>entry visas could incentivize migrants to come to the European Union for work and return 
</p>
<p>to the country of origin while respecting visa conditions. For such a plan to be successful, 
</p>
<p>the European Union and its member States will need to considerably reduce underground 
</p>
<p>labour markets and exploitation in the workplace over the coming decade, as they act as a 
</p>
<p>magnet for irregular migration at the request of exploitative employers: tougher labour 
</p>
<p>inspection mechanisms and stronger labour unions will be needed to achieve such results.  
</p>
<p>70. Fully sustaining the implementation of a human rights-based framework for regular 
</p>
<p>migration across the European Union therefore involves: increasing search and rescue 
</p>
<p>capacity; facilitating access to justice for migrants; developing alternatives to detention; 
</p>
<p>reinforcing labour inspection mechanisms needed to ensure the rights of all workers in the 
</p>
<p>European Union, including migrant workers; creating massive resettlement programmes for 
</p>
<p>refugees; and creating multiple labour migration visa opportunities to incentivize migrants 
</p>
<p>to use regular migration channels.  
</p>
<p>71. The successful implementation of this policy mix requires challenging the many 
</p>
<p>intersecting and negative perceptions of migrants and migration that have pervaded 
</p>
<p>European Union debates, discourses, policies and politics. The strict conceptual delineation 
</p>
<p>between internal and external migrants, demonstrated by the freedom of movement within 
</p>
<p>the Schengen region and the securing of external borders, conflicts with a human rights-
</p>
<p>based framework for migration that is based on equality and non-discrimination. This 
</p>
<p>distinction also rests on the assumption that sealing international borders is possible, which 
</p>
<p>the unsustainable status quo strongly shows is not the case.  
</p>
<p>72. The view of migrants among many stakeholders as &#8220;illegal&#8221; is counterproductive 
</p>
<p>and is not based on facts or the provisions of international law. While migrants who come 
</p>
<p>to the European Union without documents are in an irregular situation (or &#8220;undocumented&#8221; 
</p>
<p>or &#8220;unauthorized&#8221;), they have not committed a criminal act. The conceptualization of 
</p>
<p>irregular migrants as &#8220;illegal&#8221; has undoubtedly played into the use of immigration 
</p>
<p>detention. It has also had an impact on the general public&#8217;s perception of migrants, 
</p>
<p>legitimizing policies that are not in line with human rights guarantees and contributing to 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>73. The common conception that migrants are &#8220;job stealers&#8221; is also a harmful fantasy. 
</p>
<p>Much economic literature (see Card and Peri3) has highlighted how migrants complement 
</p>
<p>rather than compete with citizens, therefore creating greater overall productivity within the 
</p>
<p>economy. A 14-year study (Peri and D&#8217;Amuri4) into the effects of non-European Union 
</p>
<p>migration on 15 Western European countries showed that by taking manual jobs, migrants 
</p>
<p>pushed natives towards more highly skilled and better-paid jobs. In that study, a significant 
</p>
<p>increase in more complex skills among natives following migration was noted. The labour 
</p>
<p>market adjusted with no significant impact on natives&#8217; employment rates. The impact of the 
</p>
<p>global recession was shown to decrease but not eradicate this positive phenomenon, 
</p>
<p>debunking the argument that an economic downturn justifies repressive policies.  
</p>
<p>74. Similarly, conceptions of migrants as &#8220;a burden&#8221; are not based in reality, nor are 
</p>
<p>they productive. Much European Union debate focuses on the need to share the &#8220;burden&#8221; of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>irregular migration across different member States. Against a backdrop of fiscal and 
</p>
<p>demographic challenges in many countries and political discourses of austerity, discussing 
</p>
<p>external migration as a &#8220;burden&#8221; again legitimizes the further securing of borders and 
</p>
<p>encourages negative public attitudes. While society undoubtedly has a responsibility 
</p>
<p>towards migrants and more solidarity in sharing this responsibility is encouraged, migration 
</p>
<p>in itself is not and should not be presented as a burden. Much economic literature suggests 
</p>
<p>that, as workers, consumers and taxpayers, migrants contribute to the economic growth of 
</p>
<p>societies with very limited downsides. In fact, the perceived burden of migration comes 
</p>
<p>predominantly from the financial, technological and human resources necessary to 
</p>
<p>implement the European Union&#8217;s counterproductive security-focused policies and deal with 
</p>
<p>their unintended (although foreseeable) secondary effects. Acknowledging that migrants are 
</p>
<p>human beings with rights, the European Union and its member States should be talking 
</p>
<p>about sharing a responsibility, not a burden.  
</p>
<p>75. The normative basis for more positive, realistic views of migrants sits within an 
</p>
<p>abundance of fact-based analysis, as well as the European Union&#8217;s founding values of 
</p>
<p>respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights 
</p>
<p>for all, as evidenced in the robust human rights regime and the international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments that member States have ratified. 
</p>
<p><i>  Banking on mobility over a generation  
</i></p>
<p>76. Applying the European Union&#8217;s core values to policies that are based on fact rather 
</p>
<p>than fiction leads to migration policies that facilitate mobility and celebrate diversity. The 
</p>
<p>long-term development of the human rights-based framework discussed above will become 
</p>
<p>increasingly vital to the Union&#8217;s internal and external interests. Over the next 25 years, 
</p>
<p>Europe will undergo large-scale demographic, societal and labour market changes.  
</p>
<p>77. By 2025, more than 20 per cent of European Union citizens will be over 65 years of 
</p>
<p>age, with a particular increase in those over 85. The population of elderly people will 
</p>
<p>almost double, from 87.5 million in 2010 to 152.6 million in 2060. It is also expected that 
</p>
<p>the share of those aged 80 and over will rise from 5 to 12 per cent.5 At the same time, many 
</p>
<p>member States have fertility rates below the rate of replacement. An average fertility rate of 
</p>
<p>2.1 children per woman is estimated to be necessary to keep the population at a stable size 
</p>
<p>between generations in developed countries. United Nations population data suggests that 
</p>
<p>between 2010 and 2015 all European Union countries will have had average fertility rates 
</p>
<p>below the 2.1 mark with the regional average being 1.6. 
</p>
<p>78. In line with these demographic changes, the European work force is declining. In 
</p>
<p>2010, for the first time, more workers were retiring from the European labour market than 
</p>
<p>were joining it. The European Union and OECD are predicting that, with a zero net increase 
</p>
<p>in migration, the working age population will drop by 3.5 per cent by 2020. Over the next 
</p>
<p>50 years, the working-age population is expected to decline by nearly 42 million.6  
</p>
<p>79. These changes have the potential to exacerbate and widen existing skills gaps within 
</p>
<p>the European Union. Of the companies that responded to the 2013 European Company 
</p>
<p>Survey, 40 per cent stated that, despite high unemployment levels, they found it difficult to 
</p>
<p>find applicants with the correct skills set. The demographic shifts discussed above are going 
</p>
<p>to add pressure and impetus to the need to ensure balance between labour supply and 
</p>
<p>demand. According to both the European Union and OECD, for the European Union to 
</p>

</p>

<p>meet its 2020 employment targets, it will need to employ a mix of policies and reconsider 
</p>
<p>how it utilizes the skills of non-European Union migrants.  
</p>
<p>80. In the context of such shifts, the European Centre for the Development of 
</p>
<p>Vocational Training has projected that there will mainly be an increase in demand for 
</p>
<p>workers with medium and high skill levels and that demand for workers with low skills will 
</p>
<p>decrease. However, demand for low-skilled workers in 2025 is still projected to be 
</p>
<p>significant, at around 43 million. This figure has to be viewed against the European Union 
</p>
<p>2020 target of increasing the proportion of citizens gaining a tertiary education, as well as 
</p>
<p>the already rapid increases in those doing so. According to the Centre, between 2002 and 
</p>
<p>2013, a 13 per cent increase in the proportion of 30-34 year olds who have attended tertiary 
</p>
<p>education and a 57 per cent increase in the absolute number of tertiary education graduates 
</p>
<p>were recorded. 
</p>
<p>81. Another reason for adopting a human rights-based approach is the European Union&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>need to remain globally competitive. The World Economic Forum has noted diverging 
</p>
<p>trends between European countries, with some, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden 
</p>
<p>and the United Kingdom, being among the top-10 most competitive economies in the 
</p>
<p>world, and others lagging behind. The highest-ranking European Union country was 
</p>
<p>Germany, in fifth place, and the lowest-ranking was Greece, in eighty-first place.7 There is 
</p>
<p>currently a low level of highly skilled labour migration from non-European Union countries 
</p>
<p>to most member States owing to barriers to legal access and an informal reluctance by 
</p>
<p>employers to hire from outside the region. This demonstrates how an approach defined by 
</p>
<p>an emphasis on security can permeate all dimensions of migration.  
</p>
<p>82. Well-organized migration would allow member States to properly understand the 
</p>
<p>skill level of non-European Union migrants and support realistic strategies for filling labour 
</p>
<p>gaps and shortages in order to maintain and build global competitiveness. Migrants in 
</p>
<p>irregular situations cannot be assumed to have low skill levels. Those that do can still 
</p>
<p>contribute in important ways, given the aim of building the capacity of Europeans and the 
</p>
<p>continued projected demand for low-skilled workers.  
</p>
<p>83. A well-organized migration policy based on mobility and human rights could also 
</p>
<p>help the European Union to enhance its humanitarian and development impact. In 2013, 
</p>
<p>migrants sent approximately $404 billion in remittances, as highlighted in the 2013 report 
</p>
<p>of the Special Rapporteur. Migrants who moved from countries with a low human 
</p>
<p>development index to countries with a higher index experienced, on average, a 15-fold 
</p>
<p>increase in income, a doubling in education enrolment rates and a 16-fold reduction in child 
</p>
<p>mortality. If the human rights of migrants are effectively promoted, respected and protected 
</p>
<p>within well-governed migration processes, such development outcomes can be greatly 
</p>
<p>enhanced.  
</p>
<p>84. Committing to a generational shift in migration policy that recognizes that external 
</p>
<p>mobility can mirror the benefits of internal mobility, will better equip the European Union 
</p>
<p>and its member States to deal with these economic, social and demographic changes in a 
</p>
<p>way that sustains recovery, encourages growth and further develops global competitiveness. 
</p>
<p>It will also allow the European Union to truly promote its founding values in its relations 
</p>
<p>with the rest of the world, as envisaged in its Constitutional Treaty.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The events in the Mediterranean Sea and the mirroring of this suffering across 
</b></p>
<p><b>each stage of the migratory process within the past two years have clearly shown that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the status quo in relation to the European Union</b>&#8217;s approach to border control, asylum 
</p>
<p><b>and migration is not sustainable. The ability of migrants to reach European soil 
</b></p>
<p><b>despite a huge investment in securing borders demonstrates beyond a doubt that 
</b></p>
<p><b>sealing international borders is impossible. Migration is a long-standing part of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human condition and, in the globalized and conflict-ridden world in which we live, it 
</b></p>
<p><b>is inevitable.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The costs of denying this reality are huge. Most significantly, the human costs 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue to grow. There are no signs that the push and pull factors influencing 
</b></p>
<p><b>migratory patterns will change and the many grave associated human rights abuses 
</b></p>
<p><b>will decrease. In addition to the human costs, the huge investment of resources by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>European Union and its member States into ineffective and paradoxical border 
</b></p>
<p><b>control mechanisms could be spent in many other ways.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>As huge as these costs are, they are in no way inevitable. It is not beyond the 
</b></p>
<p><b>moral agency of the European Union to considerably reduce the suffering of large 
</b></p>
<p>numbers of migrants. The Union&#8217;s regional system of human rights and other 
</p>
<p><b>normative standards, its founding values and its strong tradition of promoting peace, 
</b></p>
<p><b>security and human rights, clearly show that the Union has the potential to play a 
</b></p>
<p><b>global leadership role on the issue of migration.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Claiming this leadership role involves the development of coherent and holistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights-based approaches that require short-, medium- and long-term 
</b></p>
<p><b>interventions. It is vital that, in the short term, the European Union step up search 
</b></p>
<p><b>and rescue operations, further explore alternatives to detention, particularly for 
</b></p>
<p><b>children, start providing more resettlement opportunities for people from the Syrian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Arab Republic and other countries, in line with its share of global resources, and take 
</b></p>
<p><b>stock of the failing Dublin logic and the systemic pressures it is creating.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>While this would already have a significant impact on the human rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants, it is important that the European Union also take a strategic, long-term 
</b></p>
<p><b>view. In the medium term, the Union should continue to provide resettlement 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities and open regular migration channels at all skills levels, invest in labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>inspection and tackle xenophobia, racism and discrimination against migrants. These 
</b></p>
<p><b>changes need to be sustained over the long term and accompanied by a fundamental 
</b></p>
<p><b>rethinking of the conceptualization of migrants and the development of integration 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes within the context of general diversity policies.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>To achieve sustainable success, the European Union must consider how its 
</b></p>
<p><b>founding principles and normative standards apply to those who are not citizens of its 
</b></p>
<p><b>member States. It must use fact-based analysis and rational, long-term thinking to 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenge the many negative conceptualizations that underpin current social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policy debates relating to migration within the Union. These include the strict 
</b></p>
<p><b>delineation between internal and external migrants, the idea of irregular migrants as 
</b></p>
<p>being &#8220;illegal&#8221;, the preoccupation with irregular, non<b>-European Union migration as 
</b></p>
<p>being a &#8220;burden&#8221; within the context of continuing fiscal challenges and <b>the perception 
</b></p>
<p><b>of migrants as </b>being &#8220;job stealers&#8221; who <b>deprive native citizens of economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities.  </b></p>


<p>91. <b>The benefits of this rethinking and of the European Union taking a leadership 
</b></p>
<p><b>role go far beyond the fulfilment of normative commitments. Fact-based economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>analyses have tended to conclude that migrants contribute to economic growth and 
</b></p>
<p><b>productivity. As Europe changes over the next generation, extending mobility to those 
</b></p>
<p><b>outside its borders will allow European Union member States to reap opportunities 
</b></p>
<p><b>for peace, security and sustainable development both within and outside the Union.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General recommendations    
</b></p>
<p><b>  To the European Union and its member States 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Overall  
</i></p>
<p>92. Accept the impossibility of &#8220;sealing&#8221; borders and the perverse incentives and 
</p>
<p><b>paradoxes created by the current system, as well as the inevitability and benefits of 
</b></p>
<p><b>mobility. Conversely, highlight the necessity of incentivizing all migrants to default to 
</b></p>
<p><b>services provided by the European Union and its member States and use entry and 
</b></p>
<p><b>exit control mechanisms rather than resorting to smuggling rings. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Invest in the overall development of a coherent and robust migration policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>that fully reflects the human rights of migrants as enshrined in both international and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional law.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Convey a road map for the evolution of this policy by developing a full 25-year 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy that outlines clear short-, medium- and long-term interventions and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>articulates a shared vision for how the European Union can bank on mobility over a 
</b></p>
<p><b>generation.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Invest in filling data gaps </b>&#8212;<b> such as those around underground labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>markets, labour exploitation of migrants, deaths at sea and push and pull factors </b>&#8212;<b> to 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop evidence-based policies. In addition, increase harmonization and coordination 
</b></p>
<p><b>in respect of migration data sources to develop a systemic picture.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Through fact-based analyses and long-term thinking, reflect on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>conceptualizations of migrants and migration that underpin counterproductive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ineffective security policies and result in the criminalization and stigmatization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Integrate these analyses at a political level, as well as within public 
</b></p>
<p><b>communication and education curricula. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Fully recognize the push and pull factors of irregular migration, including that 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaken by sea, and the European Union</b>&#8217;s responsibility in managing and 
</p>
<p><b>mitigating them.  
</b></p>
<p>99. Use the region&#8217;s considerable global influence, including two permanent and 
</p>
<p><b>one non-permanent seat on the Security Council, to push for more effective solutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>to humanitarian crises in the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine and other countries.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Regular migration channels  
</i></p>
<p>100. <b>Take a global leadership role in relation to the Syrian civil war and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian crises and reduce the market for smugglers by developing, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation with other States in the global North, resettlement opportunities so that </b></p>


<p><b>the European Union can accommodate over 1 </b>million of the world&#8217;s refugees<b> (0.2 per 
</b></p>
<p><b>cent of the total population of the European Union) over a number of years.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Develop and incentivize other regular and safe migration channels, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>for workers with varying skills levels, including for low-wage workers. Look at a 
</b></p>
<p><b>variety of options for legal migration, such as humanitarian admission, humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>visas, temporary protection, family reunification, economic admissions at all skills 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels, as well as for job seeking, student mobility and medical evacuation, in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the suggestions of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>European Union member States should increase the number of migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b>admitted under existing regular migration schemes, including the Blue Card system, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the seasonal workers directive and the future student and researcher directive.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Search and rescue  
</i></p>
<p>103. <b>Prepare for more arrivals by sea and commit to fully implementing obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>under international law to provide search and rescue services to migrants in distress 
</b></p>
<p><b>at sea, with State provision being the cornerstone of search and rescue operations.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Carefully consider options for how incentives that negatively impact private 
</b></p>
<p><b>ves</b>sels&#8217; willingness to assist migrants in distress can be removed, including the 
</p>
<p><b>development of a means by which compensation is given for commercial losses. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Develop protocols for how military vessels deployed in the Mediterranean Sea 
</b></p>
<p><b>for purposes other than search and rescue should respond to incidents of migrants in 
</b></p>
<p><b>distress to complement State action.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Further develop solidarity and responsibility-sharing mechanisms between 
</b></p>
<p><b>border and non-border States in relation to search and rescue operations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>processing protection claims through the provision of technical, financial and human 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  External management of migration  
</i></p>
<p>107. <b>Improve the coherence of the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility, 
</b></p>
<p><b>integrate rigorous human rights, due diligence, monitoring and oversight mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>into all external agreements and prioritize projects in countries of origin and transit 
</b></p>
<p><b>that will improve the human rights of migrants. For example, as suggested by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, prioritize support that improves 
</b></p>
<p><b>search and rescue operations within efforts to build the border management capacity 
</b></p>
<p><b>of non-European Union States, as well as support for national human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Make promoting genuine mobility for non-European Union migrants the 
</b></p>
<p><b>cornerstone of the Global Approach to Migration and Mobility.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Dublin and detention  
</i></p>
<p>109. <b>Take stock of the systemic failure of the Dublin mechanism. Reverse the 
</b></p>
<p><b>present logic by allowing asylum seekers to register their asylum claims in the country 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their choice within the European Union, while supporting the countries receiving 
</b></p>
<p><b>asylum claims with proportionate and adequate financial and technical support. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Invest in the considerable expansion and harmonization of the European 
</b></p>
<p><b>Asylum Support Office through several mechanisms, including through mutual 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognition of refugee status determination decisions, exchange of refugee judges </b></p>


<p><b>between States, a common European Union refugee determination appeal board and 
</b></p>
<p><b>common or shared reception mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Develop coordinated efforts to move away from the detention of all migrants, 
</b></p>
<p><b>investing in alternatives that avoid punishing those arriving irregularly. Look towards 
</b></p>
<p><b>a model that quickly responds to and capitalizes on the strong desire of the vast 
</b></p>
<p><b>majority of migrants to work and contribute to society.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>In line with the best interests of the child principle, step up protections afforded 
</b></p>
<p><b>to migrant children, particularly unaccompanied minors, and families with children. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Aim to eradicate the detention of children completely and to respond adequately to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the vulnerability of children in reception and social protection provisions. Age 
</b></p>
<p><b>verification is not a justification for detention and member States should move 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards a model that assumes vulnerability and responds by providing adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection, given the particularly damaging impact of even short periods of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>on children.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Access to justice and social protection  
</i></p>
<p>113. <b>Remove barriers to access to justice ensuring migrants can effectively </b>&#8212;<b> and 
</b></p>
<p><b>not simply on paper </b>&#8212;<b> access legal remedy for violations of their rights. Facilitating 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to justice, without fear of detection, detention or deportation, in order to help 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants fight for their rights, would go a long way towards, on the one hand, 
</b></p>
<p><b>legitimizing new migration policies by showing that territorial sovereignty and human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights are not incompatible, and, on the other hand, changing mentalities regarding 
</b></p>
<p><b>migration through fighting fantasies and stereotypes.  
</b></p>
<p>114. Develop &#8220;firewalls&#8221; between immigration enforcem<b>ent and public services, so 
</b></p>
<p><b>that all migrants in the European Union can seek access to justice and to social 
</b></p>
<p><b>services without fear of being denounced to immigration enforcement authorities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>deported.  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>Ensure that those who offer services, such as assistance to search and rescue 
</b></p>
<p><b>operations, medical support, shelter and legal advice, are explicitly protected from 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution under the facilitation directive.  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Migrant workers  
</i></p>
<p>116. <b>European Union member States should be weaned off their reliance on cheap 
</b></p>
<p><b>labour provided by migrant workers in specific economic sectors and should ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>labour rights are upheld for all, including migrants, including irregular migrants, 
</b></p>
<p><b>through full implementation of the employers sanctions directive and rigorous labour 
</b></p>
<p><b>inspection. Long-term investment in enforcement of the labour and human rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>all workers, including migrant workers, whatever their status, will allow the Union to 
</b></p>
<p><b>fill the inevitable increase in gaps in its labour markets in an efficient and organized 
</b></p>
<p><b>way.  
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>Improve accountability of violations of the rights of migrants, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>through continued support and cooperation with the European Ombudsman and by 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening the coordination of national human rights institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>Reconsider the general refusal of EUMS to ratify the International Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>on Migrant Workers.  </b></p>


<p><b> 2. Recommendations to specific European Union institutions

<p><b> B. Key legal, institutional and policy developments since 2013  
</b></p>
<p>2. As discussed in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2013 report, there are a large number of 
</p>
<p>legal, institutional and policy mechanisms that contribute to migration, border control and </p>


<p>asylum. The focus of the below section will be on the most pertinent developments since 
</p>
<p>2013.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Legal  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Dublin III  
</i></p>
<p>3. The Dublin system was updated in 2013 by two EU directives, which form part of 
</p>
<p>the most recent asylum acquis. The Eurodac regulations (Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013), 
</p>
<p>established a database system whereby migrants are fingerprinted in their country of origin 
</p>
<p>to ensure they can be returned to the country in which their asylum claim should be 
</p>
<p>processed under Dublin. Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 also updated the overall regulations 
</p>
<p>governing the Dublin Regulations system. Following the passing of Dublin Regulation III 
</p>
<p>and No. 603/2013, the recasted Dublin Regime came into force in January 2014.  
</p>
<p>4. The overall purpose of the updated regime is: to ensure that one Member State is 
</p>
<p>responsible for the examination of an asylum application; to deter multiple asylum claims; 
</p>
<p>to determine as quickly as possible the responsible Member State to ensure effective access 
</p>
<p>to an asylum procedure; and to ensure procedural safeguards such as the right to 
</p>
<p>information, personal interview, and access to remedies as well as a mechanism for early 
</p>
<p>warning, preparedness and crisis management.8 
</p>
<p>5. Some new provisions are included which could potentially improve the protection of 
</p>
<p>the rights of migrants, including restrictions on the use of detention when transferring a 
</p>
<p>migrant between countries, respect for the unity of the family and a duty on states to inform 
</p>
<p>migrants of the implications of being transferred between countries. Under the regime one 
</p>
<p>member state is responsible for the examination of an asylum claim and the normal process 
</p>
<p>is that the country the migrant arrives in processes an asylum application. However under 
</p>
<p>the regulations migrants cannot be returned to the countries they originally entered to have 
</p>
<p>their claims processed if there are systemic failings within the asylum system.9  
</p>
<p>6. In addition, Dublin III introduces an early warning mechanism and aims to make it 
</p>
<p>easier to detect problems in a member state&#8217;s asylum system so that the EU Commission 
</p>
<p>and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) can provide early assistance before the 
</p>
<p>situation degenerates. 
</p>
<p><i>  EU Regulation 656/2014  
</i></p>
<p>7. As a response to protection at sea challenges, EU regulation on surveillance of the 
</p>
<p>external sea borders in the context of Frontex co-operation was adopted in May 2014 and 
</p>
<p>entered into force in July. It sets out rules for the interception of vessels during joint 
</p>
<p>operations at sea, including for SAR situations and the disembarkation of intercepted or 
</p>
<p>rescued people. The aim of the new Regulation is to resolve confusion over diverging 
</p>
<p>national interpretations of international provisions on maritime surveillance by setting out 
</p>
<p>clear rules to be laid out in Frontex operational plans and followed during Frontex joint 
</p>
<p>operations.10 
</p>
<p>8. According to the regulation, if during a joint operation there is reason to believe that 
</p>
<p>a vessel or persons on board are in an emergency situation, the maritime and aerial assets 
</p>
<p>must contact the responsible Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC); they must transmit all

<p>available information to the RCC, place themselves at its disposal and follow its 
</p>
<p>instructions to assist with the rescue operation and disembark the rescued persons in a place 
</p>
<p>of safety. This procedure is detailed in the operational plans of each Frontex-coordinated 
</p>
<p>operation.11  
</p>
<p><i>  Seasonal Workers Directive (2014/36/EU) 
</i></p>
<p>9. This Directive, passed in February 2014, was the first directive on legal migration to 
</p>
<p>focus on low-skilled economic migration. Member States have until 30 September 2016 to 
</p>
<p>transpose the provisions of the Directive into their national laws, regulations and 
</p>
<p>administrative provisions. Its declared aim is to set out &#8220;fair and transparent rules of entry 
</p>
<p>and stay of seasonal workers who are not EU citizens&#8221;. It is destined for seasonal workers 
</p>
<p>who retain their principal place of residence in a country outside of the EU and stay 
</p>
<p>temporarily in the EU to carry out a &#8220;seasonal&#8221; activity such as agriculture and tourism. Its 
</p>
<p>seeks to establish &#8220;a common set of rights to which seasonal workers are entitled during 
</p>
<p>their stay in the EU in order to avoid their economic and social exploitation&#8221;. It therefore 
</p>
<p>stipulates that workers are entitled to equal treatment with nationals of the host member 
</p>
<p>state with regard to terms of employment. This includes working conditions, leave and 
</p>
<p>holidays, health and safety requirements at the workplace and social security. 
</p>
<p>10. In contrast to these positive provisions in relation to the human rights of migrants, 
</p>
<p>the Seasonal Workers Directive also aims to provide for incentives and safeguards to 
</p>
<p>prevent temporary stays from becoming permanent. However those who are already in the 
</p>
<p>EU would be allowed to extend their contract or change their employer at least once. Re-
</p>
<p>entry of those who return every year is to be facilitated in order to promote circular 
</p>
<p>migration. While the Directive provides a framework, again it leaves the Member States to 
</p>
<p>determine how many workers they admit and allows them the latitude to reject applications 
</p>
<p>if EU workers are available.12 
</p>
<p><i>  New mobility partnerships and readmissions agreements under the GAMM  
</i></p>
<p>11. The GAMM framework has four priorities: better organising legal migration and 
</p>
<p>fostering well managed mobility; preventing and combating irregular migration and 
</p>
<p>eradicating trafficking in human beings; maximising the development impact of migration 
</p>
<p>and mobility; and promoting international protection and enhancing the external dimension 
</p>
<p>of asylum. 
</p>
<p>12. The GAMM is constituted by a complex and vast array of loosely associated policy 
</p>
<p>and legal mechanisms, as well as a number of different migration related projects within 
</p>
<p>origin, transit and destination countries, including those related to South-South migratory 
</p>
<p>flows. The GAMM includes 8 regional dialogues, which are designed to foster coordinated 
</p>
<p>action between the EU and other continents at the regional level. Also under the GAMM, 
</p>
<p>sit plurilateral and bilateral agreements between EU and EUMS and specific third countries. 
</p>
<p>In the period 2012-2013, the Commission supported more than 90 migration-related 
</p>
<p>projects with a collective budget of over &#8364; 200 million.13  
</p>
<p>13. Mobility Partnerships are a key tool and have been prominent in the EU&#8217;s recent 
</p>
<p>external dialogue about its migration and border management. They encompass a broad 
</p>
<p>range of issues ranging from development aid to temporary entry visa facilitation, circular 
</p>
<p>migration programmes and the fight against unauthorised migration, including cooperation

<p>on readmission. The EU holds these Mobility Partnerships with 8 countries. The EU has 
</p>
<p>signed Mobility Partnerships with Morocco, Tunisia, Azerbaijan and Jordan since the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report in 2013. Furthermore, a Common Agenda on Migration and 
</p>
<p>Mobility has been signed with Nigeria. Discussions are ongoing with Belarus on 
</p>
<p>developing a Mobility Partnership.
 
 
</p>
<p>14. Since 2012, the EU has also signed readmission agreements with four new countries 
</p>
<p>Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Cape Verde, which all entered into force in 2014.14  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Institutional  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Search and rescue  
</i></p>
<p>15. The further reinforcement of the SAR services provided to migrants in the 
</p>
<p>Mediterranean Sea are an important institutional development since 2013. The Italian 
</p>
<p>rescue operation, Mare Nostrum, was launched in response to the hundreds of migrants who 
</p>
<p>died in shipwrecks near the island of Lampedusa in October 2013. Mare Nostrum is 
</p>
<p>reported to have saved the lives of as many as 160,000 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea 
</p>
<p>in 2014. Despite pressure from civil society organisations, the Italian government ended 
</p>
<p>Mare Nostrum in December 2014 because of high costs, the lack of support from other 
</p>
<p>European countries for the operation and the initiation of Operation Triton.15 
</p>
<p>16. Mare Nostrum was a specific mission run by the Italian Navy. It was initiated 
</p>
<p>despite pre-existing regional discussions about a Frontex operation and was described by 
</p>
<p>Italian Coast Guard Admiral Pettorino as &#8220;a very important message of humanity and civil 
</p>
<p>responsibility sent out by the Italian Government&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t a totally new operation but was 
</p>
<p>a significantly scaled up version of the Italian naval operation &#8220;Constant Vigilance&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>17. Reported operating budgets for Mare Nostrum differ. Media reports suggested that it 
</p>
<p>cost EUR 9 Million per month to run, whereas funding granted by the European 
</p>
<p>Commission Borders Fund (EBF) suggested that EUR 1.8 Million would cover a month&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>worth of running costs. More than 900 personnel are estimated to be involved in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of Mare Nostrum, which stretched far beyond the territorial waters of 
</p>
<p>Italy&#8217;s territorial waters and continuous zone. The operation deployed a large number of 
</p>
<p>navel ships, as well as helicopters, airplanes and drones.16  
</p>
<p>18. Debates have been witnessed within Europe about whether Mare Nostrum was a pull 
</p>
<p>factor for irregular migrants. Pettorini asserted that the operation was not a migration pull 
</p>
<p>factor and that those on boats were motivated by the humanitarian situations they were 
</p>
<p>fleeing. However other reports have discussed how smugglers abused the presence of Mare 
</p>
<p>Nostrum by making shorter journeys to where they knew migrant would be rescued 
</p>
<p>allowing them to facilitate more sea-based trips.17 
</p>
<p>19. Operation Triton, a Frontex initiative, was launched as a response to the continued 
</p>
<p>loss of life at sea in the Mediterranean in 2014. The Triton joint operation, coordinated by

<p>Frontex, started its activities in the Central Mediterranean in support of the Italian efforts on 
</p>
<p>1 November 2014.18  
</p>
<p>20. Whilst Operation Triton has been dubbed as a replacement for Mare Nostrum, the 
</p>
<p>reality is more complex. When Mare Nostrum was launched there were two Frontex joint 
</p>
<p>operations in existence and dialogue was on going about further community support. In 
</p>
<p>2014, the Italian Government started to lobby other EUMS for financial and technological 
</p>
<p>support for an &#8220;exit strategy&#8221; from Mare Nostrum. Alongside this lobbying, other EUMS 
</p>
<p>were trying to build support for additional resources for Frontex to support rescue at sea. As 
</p>
<p>the concept of a Frontex joint operation developed there was significant confusion about the 
</p>
<p>relationship between such a mission and the existing efforts of the Italian Government. It 
</p>
<p>became clear that Frontex was not prepared to provide an operation as comprehensive as 
</p>
<p>Mare Nostrum because of the high costs and that Operation Triton whilst providing SAR 
</p>
<p>services would have much more of a focus on border management.19  
</p>
<p>21. With the support of 18 EUMS, as well as a number of EU agencies and international 
</p>
<p>organisations, and a monthly budget of around EUR 2.9 million, Operation Triton was 
</p>
<p>launched in November 2014. Despite reported disagreement about the continuation of Mare 
</p>
<p>Nostrum within Italy and pressure from human rights organisations, the Italian Government 
</p>
<p>ceased their SAR services but contributes to Operation Triton.20  
</p>
<p>22. Operation Triton covers a narrower geographic focus but coordinates the 
</p>
<p>deployment of 2 fixed wing surveillance aircrafts, 3 patrol vessels, 2 coastal patrol vessels, 
</p>
<p>2 coastal patrol boats and 1 helicopter in order to assist Italy in coping with the on-going 
</p>
<p>migratory flows. In addition, Italian assets form part of the operation. Five debriefing teams 
</p>
<p>are deployed to support the Italian authorities in collecting intelligence on the people-
</p>
<p>smuggling networks operating in origin and transit countries as well as two screening 
</p>
<p>teams. 
</p>
<p>23. The core objective of the Triton operation is to provide assistance to the Italian 
</p>
<p>authorities&#8217; efforts to ensure effective surveillance of the maritime borders and in addition 
</p>
<p>provides assistance to any person on board a vessel in distress.21 Figures published by the 
</p>
<p>European Commission on January 13 2015 indicated that since the launch of the Triton 
</p>
<p>joint operation on 1 November 2014, the participating authorities have dealt with 
</p>
<p>130 incidents of which 109 were SAR cases. 16,402 people were detected, including 15,325 
</p>
<p>persons found on boats in distress. In addition to that, 57 facilitators were arrested. The EU 
</p>
<p>has cited the operation as an example of solidarity and best practice sharing between 
</p>
<p>Member States.22  
</p>
<p><i>  European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR)  
</i></p>
<p>24. The EUROSUR legislation discussed in became formally operational on 
</p>
<p>1 December 2013. It is designed to improve the information exchange and cooperation 
</p>
<p>between border control authorities and will involve increased surveillance of the European 
</p>
<p>Union&#8217;s sea and land borders using a vast array of new technologies, offshore sensors and 
</p>
<p>satellite tracking systems. Its &#8220;smart borders package&#8221;, will create one of the world&#8217;s largest

<p> Frontex&#8217;s Fundamental Rights Officer  </p>
<p>26. Since the publication of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 2013 report, the office of Frontex&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) has been more fully developed. The work of Ms. 
</p>
<p>Inmaculada Arnaez Fernandez and those supporting her since the inception of the FRO 
</p>
<p>mandate is considered an example of good practice. The Fundamental Rights Officer is 
</p>
<p>involved in many activities of the Agency such as the establishment of a Code of Conduct 
</p>
<p>for Joint Return Operations, the Vega handbook on children (soon to be finalised) and the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a mechanism for monitoring fundamental rights. She is involved in 
</p>
<p>preparing the operational plans for joint operations and she also carries out field visits to 
</p>
<p>these operations. She reports to the Management Board at each of its meetings on joint 
</p>
<p>operations, in particular any incidents reported during these operations, capacity building, 
</p>
<p>as well as on relations with other agencies, such as the European Asylum and Support 
</p>
<p>Office.24 
</p>
<p><i>  The Fundamental Rights Agency  
</i></p>
<p>27. The EU&#8217;s FRA has been active on the issues related to the human rights of migrants 
</p>
<p>in relation to border management. Their 2014 annual conference focussed the human rights 
</p>
<p>of migrants. The outputs of the conference reflected the key human rights concerns and a 
</p>
<p>significant degree of commonality with the findings of the Special Rapporteur, as discussed 
</p>
<p>in the policies and dialogues section below. In addition the agency have published a number 
</p>
<p>of publications on key issues.25  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Policies and dialogues  
</b></p>
<p><i>  European Agenda on Migration 
</i></p>
<p>28. The European Commission launched the work on elaborating a European Agenda on 
</p>
<p>Migration on 4 March 2015, which is expected to be adopted on 13 May. It aims to set out 
</p>
<p>its ideas for a comprehensive, coherent and holistic approach to migration, covering both 
</p>
<p>legal and irregular migration. It four main areas of focus are a common asylum system; a 
</p>
<p>new policy on legal migration; fighting irregular migration and trafficking more robustly; 
</p>
<p>and securing Europe&#8217;s external borders.

<p> 25 FRA, 2014, &#8220;Conference Conclusions&#8221;. </p>


<p><i>  European Council Strategic Guidelines  
</i></p>
<p>29. In its Conclusions of 26-27 June 2014, the European Council has adopted the new 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strategic Guidelines for Legislative and Operational Planning for the coming years within 
</p>
<p>the EU&#8217;s Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ)&#8221;. These Strategic Guidelines 
</p>
<p>identified the need for an organised migration policy on both the basis of international 
</p>
<p>protection and the long-term economic interests of the EU, as shown from the extracts 
</p>
<p>below: 
</p>
<p>30. &#8220;Faced with challenges such as instability in many parts of the world as well as 
</p>
<p>global and European demographic trends, the Union needs an efficient and well-managed 
</p>
<p>migration, asylum and borders policy, guided by the Treaty principles of solidarity and fair 
</p>
<p>sharing of responsibility, in accordance with Article 80 TFEU and its effective 
</p>
<p>implementation. A comprehensive approach is required, optimising the benefits of legal 
</p>
<p>migration and offering protection to those in need while tackling irregular migration 
</p>
<p>resolutely and managing the EU&#8217;s external borders efficiently. 
</p>
<p>31. To remain an attractive destination for talents and skills, Europe must develop 
</p>
<p>strategies to maximise the opportunities of legal migration through coherent and efficient 
</p>
<p>rules, and informed by a dialogue with the business community and social partners. The 
</p>
<p>Union should also support Member States&#8217; efforts to pursue active integration policies 
</p>
<p>which foster social cohesion and economic dynamism.&#8221;26 
</p>
<p><i>  The proposal for a holistic approach to migration from the European Parliament 
</i></p>
<p>32. In December 2014, the Civil Liberties Committee of the European Parliament 
</p>
<p>adopted a resolution calling for a holistic EU approach on migration in the Mediterranean. 
</p>
<p>The resolution includes sanctions for smugglers and human traffickers, and migration 
</p>
<p>management agreements with third countries for cooperation and safe returns. It also calls 
</p>
<p>for the strengthening of the border policy and security as well as enhancing the role of 
</p>
<p>Frontex and European Asylum Support Office (EASO). Whilst the European Parliament 
</p>
<p>has not yet passed the resolution, it suggests potential for the development of further 
</p>
<p>political will in relation to the human rights of migrants. 
</p>
<p><i>  EU Action Plan to counter migrant smugglers 
</i></p>
<p>33. The Action Plan, to be adopted in 2015, will focus on identifying and dismantling 
</p>
<p>the network of criminals who make profit of people seeking protection and better life 
</p>
<p>prospects in Europe, often exposing them to gross human rights violations. In doing so, it 
</p>
<p>will fully take into account the need to respect fundamental rights of migrants and to avoid 
</p>
<p>criminalization of those who assist them for humanitarian reasons.27 
</p>
<p><i>  European Commission communication on EU Return Policy  
</i></p>
<p>34. In its 2014 Communication on EU Return Policy COM (2014) 199, the European 
</p>
<p>Commission the Commission evaluated the Return Directive finding that it had effected 
</p>
<p>legislative and practical changes in all Member States. It found that legislation in all 
</p>
<p>Member States complies with the relevant rules fixed in Articles 16 of the Return Directive, 
</p>
<p>whilst some practical shortcomings remain in a number of Member States. The 
</p>
<p>Commission will follow up on all identified shortcomings.

</p>
<p> 27 European Commission, 2015, &#8220;Reply by DG Migration and Home Affairs to the questions by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants&#8221;. </p>


<p>35. In its upcoming &#8220;Return Handbook&#8221;, due to be adopted in 2015, the Commission 
</p>
<p>will expressly refer to relevant guidance documents from the Fundamental Right agency 
</p>
<p>concerning the treatment of irregular migrants who are subject of return procedures. This 
</p>
<p>handbook will also discuss key access to justice concerns in relation to migrants in 
</p>
<p>situations of return.28  
</p>
<p><i>  The draft students and researchers Directive 
</i></p>
<p>36. This draft legislation, proposed by the European Commission on 25 March 2013, 
</p>
<p>aims to determine the conditions of entry and residence, and the rights, of students and 
</p>
<p>researchers from non-EU countries to benefit from training and academic opportunities in 
</p>
<p>the region. It recasts the existing Directives in this area with the main aim of facilitating 
</p>
<p>admission and stay of these categories of third-country nationals in the EU. It is framed as a 
</p>
<p>response to shifts in demographics and competition dynamics within the EU.29 Whilst it is 
</p>
<p>currently being negotiated by the European Parliament and the Council and is not adopted 
</p>
<p>yet, the draft Directive recognises the role that non-EU nationals can play in responding to 
</p>
<p>the demographic and societal shifts being seen in the EU.  
</p>
<p><i>  The FRA annual conference 
</i></p>
<p>37. On 10-11 November, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), 
</p>
<p>together with the Italian Presidency of the Council of the EU, held its annual Fundamental 
</p>
<p>Rights Conference, which was this year dedicated to the topic of fundamental rights and 
</p>
<p>migration to the EU. 
</p>
<p>38. The event brought together over 300 EU and national decision makers, members of 
</p>
<p>national parliaments, the judiciary, law enforcement agencies, and experts from 
</p>
<p>international organisations, as well as national human rights bodies, civil society bodies and 
</p>
<p>academics involved with migration issues on a daily basis. Speakers included EU 
</p>
<p>Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, Speaker 
</p>
<p>of the Italian Chamber of Deputies Laura Boldrini, Italian Undersecretaries of State Senator 
</p>
<p>Benedetto della Vedova and Domenico Manzione, MEP and Vice-Chair of the Committee 
</p>
<p>on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Iliana Iotova, German Minister of State, 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Immigration, Refugees and Integration, Aydan O&#776;zoguz, FRA Director 
</p>
<p>Morten Kjaerum, and Swedish Minister for Public Administration at the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Finance, Ardalan Shekarabi. 
</p>
<p>39. Participants agreed that the EU and its Member States should develop a more 
</p>
<p>holistic approach to their migration and asylum policy. It was emphasised that fundamental 
</p>
<p>rights are not just one element of such policies, but on the contrary form the normative 
</p>
<p>framework in which they must be situated. It was emphasised at many points throughout 
</p>
<p>the conference that the EU and its Member States need a comprehensive and sustainable 
</p>
<p>migration policy, and that a new and positive narrative is necessary to counter the current 
</p>
<p>negative image of migrants and migration that stresses the benefits of migration both to 
</p>
<p>migrants themselves and to the countries hosting them. This is particularly true at present, 
</p>
<p>as projected demographic trends in the EU mean that many areas of the economy may face 
</p>
<p>an increasing shortage of labour in the coming years. Specific and practical measures are

<p><i>  European Migration Forum  
</i></p>
<p>40. The first meeting of the European Migration Forum (EMF) took place on the 
</p>
<p>26/27 January 2015 in Brussels. The EMF addressed issues and challenges in the 
</p>
<p>management of mixed flows of migrants and asylum seekers across the Mediterranean. The 
</p>
<p>discussions were structured around four thematic Workshops: First, access to the asylum 
</p>
<p>procedure at the borders; Second, integration of beneficiaries of international protection; 
</p>
<p>Third, a comprehensive approach to countering migrant smuggling; and Fourth, providing 
</p>
<p>adequate information in countries of origin and transit.  
</p>
<p>41. Conclusions from the Forum included: to take stock of current migration laws and 
</p>
<p>policies; to further develop Member States accountability in the implementation of EU 
</p>
<p>laws, and independent monitoring mechanisms of border controls, surveillance, SAR, visa 
</p>
<p>and asylum policies; to develop legal and regular channels to Europe for protection and 
</p>
<p>employment; and to respect rights of undocumented migrants and de-criminalise migration 
</p>
<p>and humanitarian assistance, including a firewall between immigration control and access 
</p>
<p>to justice and services.31
