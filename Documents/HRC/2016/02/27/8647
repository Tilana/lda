</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In response to the Government&#8217;s invitation, the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, James Anaya, visited 
Guatemala from 14 to 18 June 2010 to assess the application of the principles of 
consultation with the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples regarding the extractive industries, 
particularly the situation of indigenous peoples affected by the Marlin mine in the 
municipalities of Sipacapa and San Miguel Ixtahuac&#225;n. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit the Special Rapporteur held meetings with the President of 
Guatemala, the President of the Constitutional Court, the Committee on Indigenous Peoples 
of the Congress of the Republic, the Human Rights Ombudsman (<i>Procurador de los 
derechos humanos</i>), the Presidential Commission on Racial Discrimination against 
Indigenous Peoples (CODISRA), the Minister of the Environment and Natural Resources, 
the Deputy Minister of Energy and Mines, representatives of the Office for the Defence of 
Indigenous Women, and a number of high-ranking officials from the executive branch. The 
Special Rapporteur also visited San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez, San Miguel Ixtahuac&#225;n and 
Huehuetenango, where he had meetings with a large number of delegations of indigenous 
peoples and organizations, ancestral indigenous authorities, and municipal and local 
authorities. The Special Rapporteur also had the opportunity to meet representatives of 
indigenous communities affected by investment and mining projects in Sipacapa, El Estor 
and Chixoy. In addition, he had contacts with representatives of various branches of the 
business community, including the Chamber of Industry and representatives of mining 
companies operating in the country, with the United Nations Country Team in Guatemala 
and with members of the international diplomatic corps in the country. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincerest gratitude to the Government of 
Guatemala for the extensive support it provided at every stage of his visit to the country and 
to all the stakeholders who played an active part in the visit. In particular, the Special 
Rapporteur commends the invaluable work carried out by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Guatemala. Lastly, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to express his appreciation for the warm welcome he received from the 
country&#8217;s indigenous peoples during his visit to their traditional lands and sacred places. 
The mass attendance at the meetings by the authorities and members of indigenous 
communities from different parts of the country afforded powerful evidence, in the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view, of their human rights awareness and their determination to preserve 
their identities, based on close bonds with their traditional lands, in a democratic, 
participatory and multicultural Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>4. This document reflects the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s preliminary observations on his 
visit, which were communicated to the Government and the general public at the end of his 
visit. These preliminary observations will be developed in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s final 
report to the Human Rights Council, which will include a series of recommendations to the 
State of Guatemala and other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The impact of natural resource investment and development 
projects on the indigenous peoples 
</b>5. During his visit the Special Rapporteur noticed that the business activities under way 
in the traditional territories of the indigenous peoples of Guatemala have generated a highly 
unstable atmosphere of social conflict, a situation recognized not only by the affected 
peoples but also by the public authorities, civil society and the companies themselves. It 
seems that this situation has not only had harmful repercussions on the indigenous peoples </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14988 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>and communities but has also made it difficult for the Government and for business people 
themselves to promote investment and economic development in Guatemala. The situation 
calls for decisive and urgent action by the public authorities to avert the risk of the country 
becoming ungovernable. 
</p>
<p>6. The conflicts currently surrounding the projects involving investment in or 
development of natural resources in indigenous territories, at least all those directly 
witnessed by the Special Rapporteur, seem to follow a similar pattern. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, the pattern stems from two fundamental issues. 
</p>
<p>7. The first issue is the manifest conflict concerning the consultations that ought to 
precede the approval of such projects. The lack of an applicable legislative and institutional 
framework has led to consultation processes which are, to say the least, inadequate in terms 
of the international standards applicable to the rights of indigenous peoples. The question of 
consultations has a number of implications above and beyond those relating to specific 
projects. For many indigenous communities, failure to consult is associated with an 
intergenerational impression of invasion, marginalization and dispossession and a 
continuous sense of exclusion from and lack of involvement in decisions affecting them. 
</p>
<p>8. A second basic issue, which seems to have been somewhat neglected in the present 
debate, is the current regime governing the recognition and protection of the rights of the 
indigenous peoples of Guatemala to their lands, territories and natural resources. The high 
degree of legal insecurity as regards land ownership, the lack of collective titles to property 
in many if not the vast majority of cases, as well as the ongoing consequences of land 
dispossession during the internal armed conflict, are factors that have a bearing on the 
present disputes concerning projects involving investment in or development of natural 
resources, and that are frequently implicit in the requests for consultations. 
</p>
<p>9. During his visit the Special Rapporteur heard allegations from different authorities 
and representatives of indigenous communities concerning the impact of extractive projects 
on their daily lives, including: the contamination of rivers; the drying-up of wells; illnesses 
affecting infants; deaths of livestock; harassment of, attacks on and even killings of 
community leaders; enforced removals; damage to and demolition of houses; and 
horrendous cases of rape and sexual abuse of women. These allegations suggest that 
responsibility lies with the security forces and also with private companies or other private 
groups allegedly associated with the companies. They are serious allegations on which it 
would be inappropriate for the Special Rapporteur to comment for the time being. They will 
be raised in due course before the competent authorities in the context of the Human Rights 
Council proceedings. The Special Rapporteur also received worrying allegations to the 
effect that the projects have led to social disturbances and serious conflicts between 
communities and even between families. 
</p>
<p>10. He is also concerned about information concerning judicial action taken against 
members of indigenous communities who engaged in acts of social protest against 
companies&#8217; activities. The Special Rapporteur notes in this connection the speed with 
which such proceedings were conducted, compared with the apparent lack of response to 
community demands for the prosecution of violations of their rights. This could be 
interpreted as a sign of discrimination in access to justice. 
</p><p>11. The existence of legitimate demands on the part of the indigenous peoples is 
undeniable. These demands are founded not only on Guatemala&#8217;s international human 
rights obligations but also on elementary considerations of humanity, given the impact of 
the projects on their ancestral lands. There is obviously a considerable degree of opposition 
among the indigenous peoples to mining and other extractive industry projects. Their 
opposition is understandable in the light of the repeatedly reiterated perception that such 
projects invariably have a negative impact, damaging the land on which the affected </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-14988 
</p>
<p>communities have always lived and fuelling conflict between communities. On this point, 
the Special Rapporteur would simply like to convey the content of some of the slogans that 
he managed to read during the mass meetings he attended in San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez and 
Huehuetenango. One read &#8220;No to mining; we want peace&#8221; and another read &#8220;I am a Mam 
and care for my village. All mining contaminates.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>12. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur has received comments from some 
authorities and members of indigenous communities concerning the benefits that have 
accrued to them in their daily lives from business ventures in the areas in which they live. 
These views may be based on legitimate positions which should, ideally, be shared by the 
other people living in the neighbourhood of such ventures. The projects should yield 
benefits and not just entail undesirable consequences for the persons concerned. 
</p><p>13. All of the foregoing are extremely complex issues and very serious problems that 
must of necessity be addressed by the Government of Guatemala before situations of 
escalating conflict such as those experienced in other countries can occur. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The duty to consult 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Guatemala was motivated by the receipt of 
numerous communications concerning an alleged failure to consult prior to the approval of 
some of the main extractive projects that have been authorized or are currently being 
implemented, such as the Marlin mine run by the Montana-Goldcorp company in the 
Department of San Marcos or the Progreso cement works project in the Department of San 
Juan Sacatep&#233;quez. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur has noted the existence of a high degree of ambiguity or 
even confusion regarding the content and scope of the State&#8217;s duty to consult indigenous 
peoples, in accordance with the international standards that are binding on Guatemala. The 
Special Rapporteur considers it necessary to make the following observations in this regard: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The State of Guatemala has a duty to consult the indigenous peoples concerning any 
legislative or administrative measure that may have a direct impact on them and, in 
particular, concerning any project involving investment in infrastructure or 
prospecting or exploitation of natural resources in indigenous territories. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The duty to consult is recognized in a number of international instruments, including 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted in 
2007 with Guatemala voting in favour, International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries (1989), ratified by Guatemala in 1996, and other international human 
rights treaties to which Guatemala is a party, such as the International Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the American Convention on Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In line with these standards and with the jurisprudence of the international human 
rights treaty bodies, consultation is a process of dialogue conducted in good faith 
between the State and the indigenous peoples, in which the State must make every 
effort to secure the consent of the peoples concerned to the proposed measures. 
International standards are not met when the consultation is merely informational or 
consists solely of a formal procedure involving the signing of a document by the 
local authorities, especially since the communities&#8217; traditional decision-making 
structures do not always correspond to those of the authorities concerned. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14988 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>consultation should not be treated either as a mere referendum to elicit a &#8220;yes&#8221; or 
&#8220;no&#8221; response from the affected communities. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Like any other procedure aimed at securing consent, a consultation calls for 
negotiations in which all parties are prepared to give ground and to defend their 
legitimate interests and in which, as affirmed by the Constitutional Court of 
Guatemala, the agreements reached are binding on both parties. The State has a 
special responsibility to balance the different rights and interests affected by the 
proposed measures, applying criteria of necessity, proportionality and the 
achievement of legitimate aims in a democratic society. The State must include 
among these legitimate aims that of protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, 
especially their rights to traditional territories, lands and natural resources, that of 
safeguarding the special relationship of indigenous peoples with these territories, 
lands and resources as part of their world view, and that of promoting a truly 
multicultural society. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur has received allegations to the effect that the State has 
repeatedly granted licences for the building of infrastructure or for natural resource 
prospecting or exploitation in indigenous territories without undertaking the necessary 
consultations. Moreover, all parties agree that there is currently no legislative framework 
regulating the conduct of the consultation procedure in the Guatemalan legal order. 
</p>
<p>17. The lack of an internal legal order governing the implementation of the consultation 
procedure has given rise to a response in some cases by the companies themselves. While 
the companies&#8217; efforts to compensate for the lack of formal procedures is commendable, 
such procedures have been manifestly inadequate. The Special Rapporteur wishes to point 
out that, given the obligation of due diligence incumbent on them with respect to 
indigenous rights, companies cannot and should not conduct consultation procedures as an 
alternative to the obligations in that regard incumbent on the competent authorities, without 
the latter&#8217;s active involvement and without their direct supervision. Moreover, it should be 
borne in mind that the consultation always involves an active dialogue that does not come 
to an end after the initial round of proceedings, but should constitute an ongoing dialogue 
based not just on goodwill but on full respect for indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in respect of 
projects that affect their traditional territories. 
</p><p>18. The Special Rapporteur noted that the current discussion in Guatemala concerning 
the consultations issue may be boiled down to two basic points. 
</p>
<p>19. On the one hand, the lack of internal regulations implies, in the view of some 
branches of government, that there is no binding obligation to consult. This position is 
unsustainable, however, under international human rights law. The provisions of ILO 
Convention No. 169 are directly applicable and must be complied with by all public 
officials. This conclusion is borne out by the jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court, 
which has explicitly stated that consultations are a fundamental right and form part of the 
corpus of constitutional law on an equal footing with other rights recognized in the 
Constitution. The argument that there is no duty to consult indigenous peoples has 
contributed in large measure to the situation of serious legal unreliability currently affecting 
extractive activities and investment in the country. 
</p>
<p>20. On the other hand, there is an ongoing debate concerning the validity of the so-
called good-faith community consultations conducted by the indigenous communities 
affected by mining or hydroelectric projects pursuant to the provisions of the Municipal 
Code. Most of the communities have come out against the projects. The Constitutional 
Court has reasoned that the consultations are not strictly binding inasmuch as the 
municipalities are not competent to deal with mining issues. At all events, the Special 
Rapporteur considers that the importance of community consultations does not depend </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-14988 
</p>
<p>solely on whether or not they are binding under domestic law. Such initiatives are valid and 
relevant inasmuch as they reflect the legitimate aspirations of the indigenous communities 
to make known their views concerning projects that have a potential impact on their 
traditional territories. The rejectionist position of most communities in which consultations 
have taken place reflects both the absence of consent and the lack of a proper consultation 
procedure. The Special Rapporteur considers, however, that the holding of community 
consultations should neither preclude the organization nor prejudge the content of fresh 
consultation procedures that comply with international standards and in which the State 
actively participates in accordance with its obligations. 
</p>
<p>21. The adoption of regulations governing consultations would endow them with greater 
legal certainty and reliability, attributes that are necessary for any action on the part of the 
public authorities. This is the position adopted by international bodies such as the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the ILO Committee of Experts 
on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and also by the Constitutional 
Court of Guatemala. Most stakeholders, including various government ministries, 
indigenous organizations and peoples, and the business sector now seem to agree on the 
urgent need to take action towards that end. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur recommends that steps be taken as a matter of urgency to 
discuss and adopt the Consultation Act Initiative, on which the Congress Committee on 
Indigenous Peoples has issued a favourable opinion. It should comply with the minimum 
standards laid down in international norms and the peoples concerned should participate 
fully in its development. There is an equally urgent need to review sectoral legislation, 
including the Mining Act, in order to cover all aspects of the duties incumbent on the State 
in the area of protection of indigenous rights. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s claim that it has not granted new 
mining licences in the municipalities that have conducted community consultations and 
stated their opposition to the mining projects. The Special Rapporteur considers that the 
State should accord this practice formal status by declaring a moratorium on the granting of 
new licences within the areas concerned, at least until such time as a law regulating 
consultations with indigenous peoples is enacted, and should establish a monitoring body to 
ensure that State entities comply with the moratorium. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The case of the Marlin mine 
</b></p>
<p>24. One specific motive for the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit was to analyse the case of the 
Marlin mine, a gold and silver mine that has been in operation since 2005 and is located in 
areas corresponding to the municipalities of Sipacapa and San Miguel Ixtahuac&#225;n. The case 
has been the subject of an exchange of correspondence between the Special Rapporteur and 
the Government of Guatemala concerning a series of allegations made by various affected 
communities. During his visit the Special Rapporteur had meetings with representatives of 
communities and organizations from Sipacapa and San Miguel Ixtahuac&#225;n and with 
representatives of the multinational company Goldcorp, and had the opportunity to pay a 
visit to the mine itself. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur has received a series of allegations and reports during the 
past few months from a number of organizations concerning the alleged adverse impact on 
the environment of the exploitation of the Marlin mine, which has prompted some parties to 
demand the suspension of the company&#8217;s operations. The Special Rapporteur supports the 
view that if the mine poses a significant risk to people&#8217;s health or physical well-being, the 
Ministry of Energy and Mines should suspend its activities, at least until any adverse 
impact can be remedied. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14988 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>26. On 20 May 2010 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) 
adopted a decision granting precautionary measures on behalf of the communities of Mayan 
people (Sipakepense and Mam) of the Sipacapa and San Miguel Ixtahuac&#225;n Municipalities 
(MC 260-07), requesting the State of Guatemala &#8220;to suspend mining of the Marlin I project 
and other activities related to the concession granted to the company Goldcorp/Montana 
Exploradora de Guatemala S.A.&#8221; and &#8220;to implement effective measures to prevent 
environmental contamination, until such time as the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights adopts a decision on the merits of the petition associated with this request 
for precautionary measures&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>27. As a matter of principle and in light of Guatemala&#8217;s duty to comply in good faith 
with its international human rights obligations, the State must abide by the decisions of the 
IACHR, which is one of the main organs of the Organization of American States 
responsible for promoting and protecting human rights in the region. The Special 
Rapporteur has been informed that the IACHR intends to visit the country in order to assess 
the situation on the ground. The Government must act on the guidelines drawn up by the 
IACHR on completion of its visit and conduct an objective and impartial review of the 
allegations concerning the adverse impact of the project on the daily lives of indigenous 
communities in the area. 
</p>
<p>28. Apart from the mine&#8217;s potential impact on the environment and on physical well-
being, the question of consultations regarding the Marlin mine and indigenous consent must 
be addressed. There is obviously no consensus within the affected communities in favour of 
the mining activities. On the contrary, there is significant opposition thereto in the 
municipalities of Sipacapa and San Miguel Ixtahuac&#225;n and a conflict-riven atmosphere has 
developed as a result of the establishment of the mine in the area. 
</p>
<p>29. Aside from the company&#8217;s intention to engage in a consultation process with the 
affected communities, it has plainly not been possible to achieve a proper or stable 
understanding among the communities regarding the project or to address the concerns of 
the communities that are directly affected. 
</p>
<p>30. It is also clear that the State has not been closely enough involved in the processes of 
dialogue that the company has so far conducted with the affected communities, and that it 
failed to consult the communities before granting the prospecting and exploitation licences 
to the company. The Special Rapporteur has taken note in this regard of the study 
commissioned by the Goldcorp company, which concludes that the State&#8217;s failure to 
participate in the consultation processes renders the consultation inadequate and constitutes 
lack of respect for the human rights of the affected communities. 
</p>
<p>31. As a general principle, and in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, projects that have a significant impact on the rights of indigenous 
peoples, such as the Marlin mine, should not be implemented without the consent of the 
affected indigenous communities. This principle is based on practical as well as on moral 
and legal foundations. As may be seen in the present case, the execution of projects of this 
kind without the consent of the affected peoples fuels conflict and thus has negative 
implications both for the social well-being of the communities concerned and for the 
implementation of the project. 
</p><p>32. The whole of the foregoing demonstrates the need for corrective measures, taking 
into account the fact that the mining operations have already reached an advanced stage of 
construction and exploitation. The Special Rapporteur considers that if the mining 
operations are to continue in the future, they must be based on a consensual agreement with 
the affected communities. This can only be achieved through a fresh process of 
consultations that complies with international norms. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-14988 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the fact that a new consultation process 
constitutes a challenge in the present circumstances, and that major efforts will be required 
to build the trust needed to launch an effective dialogue between the parties. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur recommends in this regard, as a provisional measure, the 
creation of forums for dialogue in which the indigenous peoples can receive objective and 
comprehensive information about all aspects of the project that affect them, and are given 
the opportunity to explain and communicate their concerns to the State and the company. 
Within these forums the State should adopt an attitude of respect and good faith in 
responding to the communities&#8217; concerns. It should implement all measures that are 
required to alleviate or offset the harmful effects of the project, and reach an agreement 
with the affected communities. It would be recommendable, in the context of the 
procedures needed to build an atmosphere of trust, to undertake an impact study of the 
Marlin mine, addressing not only environmental and health issues but also the question of 
human rights and the social impact of the project. 
</p><p>35. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the major difficulties inherent in the question of 
consultation of indigenous peoples, as demonstrated not only in Guatemala but in many 
other parts of the world. He also appreciates the efforts being undertaken by various 
stakeholders to create more propitious conditions for the dialogue required in conducting 
such consultations, conditions that may also call for the analysis of structural causes and 
involve lengthy processes that are difficult to resolve. 
</p>
<p>36. Guatemala has demonstrated its international commitment to the promotion and 
protection of indigenous rights, as reflected in its prominent role in the drafting and 
adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The 
Special Rapporteur hopes that the State will continue to take decisive steps towards the 
effective implementation of the human rights of indigenous peoples and that the principles 
enshrined in the Declaration will be put into practice in the daily lives of the peoples 
concerned.
