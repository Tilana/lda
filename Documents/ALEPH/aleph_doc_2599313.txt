•  Initiates Foothold in Emerging Northwest Shelf Plays of 150,000 Net Acres

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Tuesday, September 6, 2016
HOUSTON, TX and ARTESIA, NM – EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) and Yates Petroleum
Corporation today announced definitive agreements under which EOG has agreed to combine
with Yates Petroleum Corporation, Abo Petroleum Corporation, MYCO Industries, Inc. and
certain other entities (collectively, Yates). Under the terms of this private, negotiated transaction,
EOG will issue 26.06 million shares of common stock valued at $2.3 billion and pay $37 million
in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments and lock-up provisions. EOG will assume and
repay at closing $245 million of Yates debt offset by $131 million of anticipated cash from Yates,
subject also to certain closing adjustments.
“This transaction combines the companies’ existing large, premier, stacked-pay acreage
positions in the heart of the Delaware and Powder River basins, paving the way for years of high-
return drilling and production growth,” said William R. “Bill” Thomas, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of EOG. “We are excited by this unique opportunity to advance EOG’s strategy
of generating high-return growth by developing premium wells at low costs that enhance long-
term shareholder value.
“Additionally we are thrilled to welcome Yates’ 300 employees to the EOG family and look
forward to continuing the important presence Yates has established in the community of Artesia,
N.M.”
Yates is a privately held, independent crude oil and natural gas company with 1.6 million net
acres across the western United States. Since 1924, when it drilled the first commercial oil well
on New Mexico state trust lands, Yates has amassed a rich acreage position across the western
United States. Highlights of Yates’ assets are summarized below:
•  Production of 29,600 barrels of crude oil equivalent per day, net, with 48 percent crude oil
•  Proved developed reserves of 44 million barrels of oil equivalent, net
•  Delaware Basin position of 186,000 net acres
•  Northwest Shelf position of 138,000 net acres
•  Powder River Basin position of 200,000 net acres
•  Additional 1.1 million net acres in New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, North Dakota
and Utah.
EOG is the largest oil producer in the Lower 48, with average net daily production of
551 thousand barrels of crude oil equivalent and a reputation for technological leadership in the
development of unconventional resource plays.
“EOG is our partner of choice as we look to extend Yates’ 93-year legacy,” said John A. Yates
Sr., Chairman Emeritus of Yates Petroleum Corporation and son of founder Martin Yates Jr. “As
we enter a new era of unconventional resource development, we are excited to join forces with
another pioneering company like EOG.”
Douglas E. Brooks, Chief Executive Officer of Yates Petroleum Corporation added, “This is a
tremendous opportunity to combine EOG’s strong technical competencies with the enormous
resource potential of the Yates acreage to create significant value for Yates and EOG
shareholders alike.”
Yates immediately adds an estimated 1,740 net premium drilling locations in the Delaware Basin
and Powder River Basin to EOG’s growing inventory of premium drilling locations, a 40 percent
increase. A premium drilling location is defined by EOG as a direct after-tax rate of return of at
least 30 percent assuming a $40 flat crude oil price. EOG plans to commence drilling on the
Yates acreage in late 2016 with additional rigs added in 2017.
“Through this transaction, our premium drilling strategy is gaining added momentum. With
improving well productivity and this newly enhanced resource base, our organization can
generate further increases in returns and capital efficiency,” Thomas said. “The combination
enhances the size and quality of EOG’s existing portfolio of oil resource plays.”
Doubles Position in Delaware Basin and Adjacent Plays
Yates has 186,000 net acres of stacked pay in the Delaware Basin in New Mexico that is highly
prospective for the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Leonard Shale formations. This brings the
combined company’s total Delaware Basin acreage position to approximately 424,000 net acres,
a 78 percent increase to EOG’s existing holdings.
Additionally, Yates has 138,000 net acres on the Northwest Shelf in New Mexico that is
prospective for the Yeso, Abo, Wolfcamp and Cisco formations. These shallow plays have the
potential to contribute additional amounts of premium inventory with the application of EOG’s
advanced completion and precision targeting technologies and low cost structure. Along with
EOG’s existing acreage, the newly combined company will have 574,000 net acres in the
Delaware Basin and Northwest Shelf. A summary of the acreage is listed below.

The combination also adds 81,000 net acres from Yates in the core development area of the
Powder River Basin that is prospective for the Turner Oil play. In total, Yates contributes 200,000
net acres in the Powder River Basin. This doubles EOG’s total Powder River Basin acreage to
400,000 net acres. The enhanced acreage position has significant exploration potential for
multiple stacked-pay formations.
