<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action, the International Covenants on Human Rights, and all and other 
relevant instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups 
and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all Human Rights Council resolutions relevant to civil society space, 
inter alia, resolutions 12/2 of 1 October 2009, on cooperation with the United Nations, its 
representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, 12/16 of 2 October 2009 on 
freedom of opinion and expression, 21/16 of 27 September 2012, on the rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and of association, 22/6 of 21 March 2013, on protecting human 
rights defenders, and 22/10 of 21 March 2013 on the promotion and protection of human 
rights in the context of peaceful protests,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the important role of civil society at the local, national, regional and 
international levels, and that civil society facilitates the achievement of the purposes and 
principles of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that special emphasis should be given to measures to assist in the 
strengthening of a pluralistic civil society, including through the strengthening of the rule of 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>law, social and economic development, the promotion of freedom of expression, the right 
of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, and the administration of justice, and to 
the real and effective participation of the people in the decision-making processes, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the crucial importance of active involvement of civil society, at all 
levels, in processes of governance and in promoting good governance, including through 
transparency and accountability, at all levels, which is indispensable for building peaceful, 
prosperous and democratic societies, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> that domestic legal and administrative provisions and their application 
should facilitate, promote and protect an independent, diverse and pluralistic civil society 
and, in this regard, strongly rejecting any acts of intimidation or reprisals against civil 
society, 
</p>
<p><i>Underscoring</i> that the legal framework within which civil society operates is that of 
national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and international 
human rights law, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that, in some instances, domestic legal and administrative 
provisions, such as national security and counter-terrorism legislation, and other measures, 
such as provisions on funding to civil society, have sought to or have been misused to 
hinder the work and endanger the safety of civil society in a manner contrary to 
international law, and recognizing the urgent need to prevent and stop the use of such 
provisions, and to review and, where necessary, amend any relevant provisions in order to 
ensure compliance with international human rights law and, as appropriate, international 
humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reminds</i> States of their obligation to respect and fully protect the rights of all 
individuals to, inter alia, freedom of expression and opinion, and to assemble peacefully 
and associate freely, online as well as offline, including for persons espousing minority or 
dissenting views or beliefs, and that respect for all such rights, in relation to civil society, 
contributes to addressing and resolving challenges and issues that are important to society, 
such as in the promotion of the rule of law and accountability, the environment, 
development, empowering persons belonging to minorities and vulnerable groups, racism 
and racial discrimination, crime prevention, corporate social responsibility and 
accountability, human trafficking, empowering women and youth, social justice, consumer 
protection and the realization of all human rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recognizes</i> the important role of civil society, at all levels, in providing 
assistance during financial and economic crises and in humanitarian crises, including armed 
conflict, natural disasters and man-made disasters, as well as during the stages of recovery, 
relief and rehabilitation, and also in the realization of transitional justice goals and in the 
reconstruction of society, and that the active participation of civil society can reinforce 
ongoing governmental efforts to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges</i> States to create and maintain, in law and in practice, a safe and 
enabling environment in which civil society can operate free from hindrance and insecurity;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Also urges</i> States to acknowledge publicly the important and legitimate role 
of civil society in the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to 
engage with civil society to enable it to participate in the public debate on decisions that 
would contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law and of 
any other relevant decisions; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Urges</i> all non-State actors to respect all human rights and not to undermine 
the capacity of civil society to operate free from hindrance and insecurity; </p>


<p>6. <i>Emphasizes</i> the essential role of civil society in subregional, regional and 
international organizations, including in support of the organizations&#8217; work, and in sharing 
experience and expertise through participation in meetings, in accordance with relevant 
rules and modalities, and, in this regard, reaffirms the right of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, to unhindered access to and communication with subregional, 
regional and international bodies, in particular the United Nations, its representatives and 
mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> human rights mechanisms, including the special procedures, as 
appropriate, in the framework of their existing mandates, to continue to address relevant 
aspects of civil society space; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to promote and protect civil society space, and invites it to continue 
efforts in this regard; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Decides</i> to organize, at its twenty-fifth session, a panel discussion on the 
importance of the promotion and protection of civil society space, which will, inter alia, 
contribute to the identification of challenges facing States in their efforts to ensure space for 
civil society and lessons learned and good practices in this regard, and invites the Office of 
the High Commissioner to liaise with States, relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, 
relevant special procedures, civil society and other stakeholders with a view to ensuring 
their participation in the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a summary report 
on the panel discussion, to be presented to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh 
session.
