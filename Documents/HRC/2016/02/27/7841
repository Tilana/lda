<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 21/28, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to provide all necessary 
technical support and training to assist the Government of South Sudan in promoting and 
protecting human rights, and to present a report on the progress of technical assistance and 
capacity-building to the Council at its twenty-third session. The Council also requested the 
international community and relevant United Nations Agencies and stakeholders to support 
the efforts of the Government on technical assistance and capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 21/28, the Human Rights Council acknowledged the commitments 
made by the Government of South Sudan to strengthen national mechanisms for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, called upon it to strengthen its cooperation with 
the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) on issues pertaining to the 
promotion and protection of human rights. The Council encouraged the Government to 
ratify the main international and regional human rights instruments, and also the continuing 
commitment of the Government to resolve all outstanding issues in the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement of 2005 with the Government of the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>3. OHCHR wishes to thank the Government of South Sudan, UNMISS, the United 
Nations agencies operating in South Sudan and civil society organizations for their 
cooperation and their contribution to the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>4. A number of significant factors have had a serious impact on the situation of human 
rights in South Sudan, notable among them being the continuing political tensions between 
South Sudan and the Sudan and the internal conflicts and ethnic tensions, as well inter-
communal conflicts and violence, both of which severely undermined efforts at nation- and 
institution-building. In March 2013, following more than 12 months of strained relations, 
the Governments of South Sudan and the Sudan signed the Implementation Matrix on 
Security, Economic and Cross-border Cooperation. Oil shipments to the Sudan from South 
Sudan, suspended since January 2012, subsequently recommenced in April 2013, although 
it will take several more months for full production to resume and oil revenues to filter 
through.  
</p>
<p>5. The suspension of oil exports between January 2012 and April 2013, which 
accounted for 98 per cent of the country&#8217;s revenue, combined with the accompanying 
austerity measures significantly affected development, particularly with regard to the 
delivery of basic services such as health, education and infrastructure, as well as efforts to 
tackle widespread poverty and marginalization. It is hoped that, if the recent agreements are 
implemented, they will contribute to an environment conducive to improving the lives of 
the people in South Sudan and increase the fulfilment of their human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The many challenges still facing the country, including those relating to human 
rights, remain significant. It will take considerable effort not only to tackle problems 
relating to the legacy of the civil war and the ongoing communal violence, but also to 
counter the impact that the austerity measures have had on the population.  
</p>
<p>7. The above-mentioned challenges include developing governance and security 
institutions with the necessary resources, capacity and accountability structures, addressing 
corruption to ensure the equitable and transparent management of public resources, 
developing a new Constitution and tackling the thorny question of ethnicity. Inter-ethnic 
tensions underpin many facets of life in South Sudan and are manifested in multiple ways, </p>


<p>from violent inter-ethnic clashes over the distribution of resources, political posts and 
employment opportunities. Mediation or peace processes have sometimes succeeded in 
mitigating these conflicts, but fundamental schisms need to be overcome if a sense of 
national identity that also respects ethnic diversity is to be forged. 
</p>
<p>8. Inter-communal violence, including that related to cattle raiding, is claiming a large 
numbers of lives, and remains common during the dry season, particularly in Jonglei State 
and the tri-State area (borders of Lakes, Warrap and Unity). Such attacks often involve not 
only killings but also the abduction of women and children. The theft of large numbers of 
cattle deprives the affected communities of their principal or indeed sole livelihood. Efforts 
by the State to exercise its authority, in particular through the deployment of security 
forces, appear to have had some impact in containing the phenomenon, with inter-ethnic 
violence declining from the levels recorded in 2011-2012. Nevertheless, an UNMISS 
investigation documented more than 100 killings resulting from an ambush by cattle raiders 
on migrating pastoralists on 8 February 2013; furthermore, between January and April 
2013, more than 100 people were reportedly killed in the tri-State area as a result of cattle 
raids.  
</p>
<p>9. Humanitarian needs remain substantial, especially in areas such as Jonglei, where 
insecurity has continued to produce waves of displacement, and in Upper Nile and Unity, 
where the influx of refugees from fighting in neighbouring Sudanese States increased 
towards the end of 2012. South Sudanese returnees, primarily from the Sudan, have also 
increased the demand for support, with more than 150,000 registered by the International 
Organization for Migration, and a further 125,000 still expected. Throughout the country, 
the World Food Programme estimates that 4.1 million people are at risk of food insecurity. 
</p>
<p>10. More than 90 per cent of the population is estimated to live below the poverty level. 
At least 50 per cent of all children do not attend school, and only 39 per cent of those who 
do are girls. Child and early marriage continues to present an obstacle to girls&#8217; education, 
</p>
<p>and raises health concerns and serious protection issues relating to sexual exploitation. High 
levels of illiteracy have also had an impact on the capacity to improve respect for human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>11. Over the past 12 months, some headway has been made on key transitional 
processes that will lead to elections in 2015. Government approval was given for a national 
census to be conducted in 2014. The National Elections Commission was inaugurated in 
January 2013, with a request for technical, logistical and operational support presented to 
the United Nations on 12 February for the scheduled elections. Members of a political 
parties council have been named. 
</p>
<p>12. Progress on developing a new Constitution has been extremely slow; this is a major 
concern, given that it is a core element of the transition process. There are also serious 
constraints on the right to freedom of expression and assembly, with threats and attacks 
against journalists and civil society actors when perceived to be critical of or in opposition 
to the Government. Media laws have been under development for some time, but are still 
under parliamentary review, where amendments have been proposed to improve protection 
for the right to freedom of expression.   
</p>
<p>13. Numerous hurdles therefore remain, including the need to ensure that space for 
political pluralism is protected, allowing civil society to play an open and critical role and, 
equally important, expediting the transition from a principally military and militarized 
environment to a peaceful, multiparty and civilian-led process of democratization.  </p>


<p><b> III. Human rights challenges and priorities  
</b></p>
<p>14. Against the background described above, South Sudan has continued to face 
daunting challenges to improving respect for human rights two years after its declaration of 
independence. While the historical legacy of conflict and underdevelopment, combined 
with the current difficulties (austerity measures have stifled efforts to improve the climate 
for advancing economic, social and cultural rights), have constrained the Government&#8217;s 
ability to make significant progress in protecting and promoting human rights, some 
positive developments have been registered in the creation of policies and laws to protect 
human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>15. For instance, human rights norms and standards from key international human rights 
conventions have been enshrined in the transitional Constitution of South Sudan. Another 
significant achievement was marked when the Council of Ministers, in November 2012, 
adopted a national agenda for human rights, which was drafted by the Human Rights 
Commission with the support of OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>16. The ability of South Sudan to guarantee human rights remains limited, with some 
signs of deterioration. Civilians living in conflict-prone areas continue to suffer from 
violence and intimidation, while in the capital of Juba violations of human rights attributed 
to members of the security forces have been reported. With a shortage of qualified 
personnel and an overreliance on customary and traditional justice systems outside the main 
population centres, the rule of law remains frail and the fight against impunity weakened. 
Arbitrary arrest, and acts of intimidation and harassment, of journalists, human rights 
defenders, foreign nationals or members of the political opposition still take place, with 
little accountability. These manifestations of a lack of respect for freedom of expression run 
counter to the Government&#8217;s publicly stated commitment to a democratic system based on 
the rule of law, pluralism and tolerance of diverse opinions. This commitment needs to be 
translated into action and reinforced at all levels.  
</p>
<p>17. In addition to the expulsion of a United Nations senior Human Rights Officer in 
October 2012 and the temporary detention of two others in January 2013, United Nations 
Human Rights Officers have faced a number of obstacles in carrying out monitoring and 
investigation work, including a frequent lack of access to detainees held in military or 
national security facilities. Denial of access has hampered the information-gathering 
process in some areas, hindering the ready identification of possible areas for technical 
assistance.  
</p>
<p>18. The Human Rights Commission has not been able to carry out its mandated 
functions effectively. Although the process to ratify the main international human rights 
treaties has been cumbersome, some progress was noted. 
</p>
<p>19. The capacity of the Government to protect civilians, particularly those who suffer 
the brunt of criminality and armed conflict, needs to be strengthened. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Government is responsible for ensuring the protection of the civilian population. 
The civilian population is, however, still subject to harm  as a consequence of the violence, 
especially in Jonglei and the tri-State area, which shows the authorities are not fulfilling this 
responsibility. According to data collected by the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs, inter-communal violence poses the greatest threat to civilians in 
South Sudan, particularly when linked with cattle raiding, which accounts for 73 per cent of 
all conflict-related deaths since independence. The perpetrators of violent acts largely </p>


<p>comprise armed young men conducting cattle raids, criminal groups carrying out 
opportunistic cattle-raiding attacks or heavily armed rebel militia groups.  
</p>
<p>21. Although the civilian disarmament process in Jonglei in March 2012 and the peace 
mobilization accompanying the All Jonglei Peace Conference in May 2012 led to a relative 
reduction in violence and greater stability, they were soon jeopardized by the re-emergence 
of the David Yau Yau militia during the second half of 2012, the return to the State of 
armed Murle youth from Ethiopia and the lack of resources and capacity to implement the 
decisions of the above-mentioned  peace conference. An increase in alleged human rights 
violations by the security forces during the disarmament process in Pibor County between 
March and August 2012 were brought to the attention of the relevant authorities by 
UNMISS for investigation and prosecution of perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>22. As a result of armed group activities and the response of the Sudan People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army (SPLA), many communities in Jonglei abandoned their homes and moved 
to safer rural areas. In an effort to tackle the threat posed by the David Yau Yau militia, the 
national authorities prioritized political efforts by engaging with Murle chiefs, politicians 
and youth groups, even extending an offer of amnesty to Yau Yau. Reports indicated, 
however, low civilian confidence in the reconciliation process as well as fear of reprisal 
from the security forces. The result has been that civilians in Jonglei have continued to face 
the most significant protection threats, particularly in Pibor, Akobo and Pochalla counties. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Administration of justice and the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>23. Despite progress in certain areas, the justice system in South Sudan remains weak 
and ineffective. There is a shortage of qualified judges and lawyers, poor infrastructure, 
underdeveloped management systems, poor coordination across the criminal justice system 
and lack of adequate communication and transport. At the local level, many criminal cases 
continue to be adjudicated through customary justice mechanisms that do not meet 
international human rights standards and, in many cases, also violate the transitional 
Constitution of South Sudan and other national laws. The South Sudan National Police 
Service (SSNPS) and other security agencies charged with enforcing the law still need 
significant further training and capacity-strengthening. 
</p>
<p>24. Even though South Sudan voted in favour of a global moratorium of the death 
penalty in November 2012 at the General Assembly,1 subsequent reports indicate that 
individuals continue to be sentenced to death. More than 233 individuals remain on death 
row throughout the country. Very few convicted individuals, including those sentenced to 
death, enjoyed legal representation during their trials. Bureaucratic and unclear procedural 
requirements also hinder the exercise of the right of appeal. 
</p>
<p>25. Prolonged and arbitrary detention remains a significant concern. Lack of means or 
understanding of the applicable procedural provisions and case backlogs in prosecutors&#8217; 
offices are among the most significant factors contributing to detention that regularly 
exceeds legally authorized limits. The Government has acknowledged the seriousness of 
the issue and established a high-level policy panel to take action, in particular by launching 
a mobile courts initiative to accelerate legal proceedings and to compensate for the shortage 
of judges, despite efforts made by the judiciary to recruit more judges for assignment to the 
various States. Cases of arbitrary arrest and detention by the police without a proper legal 
basis or without following proper procedural requirements, and arrest and detention by 
</p>
<p>  
 1 General Assembly resolution 67/176. </p>


<p>entities without a clear legal mandate for law enforcement, including the detention of 
civilians by the SPLA and national security forces, remain a major concern. 
</p>
<p>26. Cases of detention of civilians by the military have been observed, even though it 
does not appear that the military has a general legal mandate to detain civilians. Detention 
by national security forces, in particular, has been used in some cases to interfere with the 
full exercise of other rights, such as the right to freedom of expression. In this connection, 
interference by military and political figures in the justice system was also noted. 
</p>
<p>27. The excessive use of force by the security forces poses a persistent problem. The 
shooting of unarmed demonstrators by members of the security forces in the Western Bahr 
el Ghazal capital of Wau in December 2012, resulting in the death of nine and the 
wounding of at least 17 others is an example. In other serious incidents, the shooting of 
civilians by SPLA members in Jonglei on 1 April 2013 resulted in the death of at least two 
people, while allegations were received of extrajudicial execution of 13 civilians by the 
SPLA in the village of Lotho in Jonglei on 4 December 2012. An investigation by the 
Human Rights Division of UNMISS into the incident is under way. 
</p>
<p>28. In the majority of these cases, the relevant authorities are yet to hold the perpetrators 
accountable for such violations. In Wau, for example, no action has yet been taken to hold 
those responsible for killing the demonstrators.  
</p>
<p>29. Exceptions with regard to prevailing impunity have nonetheless been noted, such as 
in the case of three police officers accused of raping three women in Central Equatoria, 
who were arrested and are to undergo trial.  
</p>
<p>30. Following a human rights investigation by the United Nations Mission in the Sudan 
in 2010, the Government of South Sudan took measures for accountability for past 
violations, including allegations of rape and killings, committed at the National Police 
Training Centre, as well as for the prevention of violations. Some of the individuals found 
responsible were removed from duty, although it remains unclear whether any further 
measures have been taken against them. The Human Rights Division of UNMISS engaged 
in a capacity-building role at the centre, where it has conducted human rights training as 
part of a comprehensive curriculum. The provision of technical assistance for strengthening 
internal accountability mechanisms is also under consideration.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Protection of the rights to freedom of expression, association and 
</b></p>
<p><b>assembly 
</b></p>
<p>31. UNMISS has documented a number of cases of interference with the right to 
freedom of expression by State authorities, including the arbitrary arrest and detention and 
harassment of journalists and other individuals critical of the Government. At least 18 such 
incidents were registered following the killing in December 2012 of the nationally 
renowned columnist Isaiah Abraham. In several cases, UNMISS intervened to facilitate the 
protection of journalists, civil society activists or human rights defenders who were 
believed to be under imminent threat, some of whom have been obliged to leave the 
country. 
</p>
<p>32. UNMISS and other partners have been working to build the capacity of journalists, 
civil society and other actors. At present, however, a lack of training and resources, in 
addition to security concerns, have limited the ability of civil society to serve as an 
effective watchdog for monitoring violations of the rule of law and freedom of expression. </p>


<p><b> D. Promoting and protecting the rights of women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>33. Progress in eliminating discrimination and abuses against women and girls in South 
Sudan, including domestic violence, forced marriages and sexual violence, has been slow. 
Even though the transitional Constitution provides for the equality of men and women 
before the law, women continue to face discrimination regularly, including in relation to 
such fundamental matters as marriage, land and property ownership, inheritance and 
education. Harmful traditional practices also play a role in perpetuating women&#8217;s unequal 
position within communities, particularly in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>34. Women and girls also continue to face significant discrimination in the 
administration of justice. Women are regularly detained based on non-criminal, customary 
&#8220;offences&#8221;, such as adultery, for which women tend to be charged disproportionately. In 
addition, the extensive role of the customary legal system in resolving disputes and even 
adjudicating criminal cases leads to further violations of women&#8217;s rights, since the 
customary principles employed are often not in keeping with international human rights 
norm of non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. The poverty and underdevelopment in which the majority of the population of South 
Sudan still lives have not been conducive to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights. In this context, the recent implementation of the cooperation agreement of 
September 2012 between the Sudan and South Sudan is a significant development insofar 
as it has allowed the gradual resumption of oil exports. Benefits from increased national 
budget revenues cannot, however, be expected in the immediate term. Continuation of the 
prevailing austerity regime that has prevented more investment in human services could 
therefore be reasonably expected to prevail for some time. Once national revenue has been 
normalized, revision of the country&#8217;s budget should focus on social investment by 
allocating additional resources on historically neglected areas to improve the delivery of 
public services. 
</p>
<p><b> F.  Gaps in the national legal framework for the protection of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights 
</b></p>
<p>36. Numerous laws were enacted with implications for human rights during the  
parliamentary session of 2012-2013. Further action is still awaited on three important media 
bills are under review, one of which was scheduled for its second reading in Parliament in 
May 2013. Necessary legislation covering national civil society and the national 
intelligence services has not yet been enacted. In addition, legislative action is still needed 
to address the significant gaps arising from the unclear relationship between statutory and 
customary laws in many areas, which lead to violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>37. Enacted legislation includes the General Education Act (2012) and the Higher 
Education Act (2012). The General Education Act provides for free basic instruction for all 
in South Sudan, with the aim of improving education standards. Given the extremely low 
levels of literacy and the poor access to basic education, the implementation of this act is 
crucial not only with regard to the population&#8217;s enjoyment of the right to education, but also 
with a view to enhancing the understanding and application of human rights and 
obligations.  
</p>
<p>38. Despite these developments and the adoption of legislation on elections and political 
parties, which are  key elements of the transition process, significant legal gaps still need to </p>


<p>be addressed. Most critical is the review of the transitional Constitution. In the year since 
the decree issued by the President of the Republic effectively forming the Constitutional 
Review Commission, progress in this process has been slow. Many civil society 
organizations and members of the public have voiced concerns about the lack of 
transparency and inclusiveness of the process. On 26 February 2013, the mandate of the 
Commission was extended to 31 December 2014. 
</p>
<p>39. Existing laws also need to be reviewed and harmonized with the human rights 
clauses of the transitional Constitution and international human rights standards. Some 
existing laws contradict each other on human rights-related issues; for example, traditional 
practices, such as early and forced marriage, wife inheritance and the denial of property 
inheritance by women, contravene provisions of the transitional Constitution. The criminal 
law system requires overall harmonization with the constitutional human rights standards. 
A number of bills with an impact on human rights, the most important of which include 
three bills on the media and on access to information, are pending before Parliament. Other 
bills pending include the Petroleum Revenue Management Bill, the Advocacy Bill and the 
National Security Service Bill. The latter will be particularly important in defining the 
security service&#8217;s powers of arrest. Civil society organizations and other individuals have 
raised a number of concerns about the Voluntary and Humanitarian Organizations Bill 
currently before Parliament for its first reading, which will regulate the operations of non-
governmental organizations. Those working on human rights and governance issues were 
particularly concerned that provisions of the bill would impede their work, for example 
through restrictions on receiving funding from international bodies. 
</p>
<p>40. The Government has committed to the ratification of all major international human 
rights treaties with a view to constructing a national legal framework to protect human 
rights. Preliminary steps in the ratification process have been taken for three of the priority 
instruments identified by the Government, namely the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Legal opinions for accession to these and the 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees have been prepared in collaboration with the 
Human Rights Division of UNMISS and partner United Nations agencies. These opinions 
were submitted to the Council of Ministers on 17 May 2013, where they were approved and 
referred to Parliament. Discussions are also under way to launch the process for ratification 
of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. With 
regard to regional human rights instruments, in January 2013, South Sudan signed (though 
is yet to ratify) the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. This was also included 
in the package of instruments approved by the Council of Ministers on 17 May 2013. 
</p>
<p>41. The adoption of the Refugee Act and the Geneva Conventions Act in 2012 marked 
important developments in strengthening the legal protection framework. South Sudan 
acceded to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto after a bill 
was passed by Parliament on 16 July 2012. In addition, the Government informed the 
International Labour Organization in 2013 that it had accepted seven conventions, 
including those relating to forced labour, discrimination and the worst forms of child 
labour. 
</p>
<p>42. The Human Rights Division of UNMISS continues to provide technical assistance 
and support to build the capacity and expertise of the national and State assemblies through 
their relevant committees. At the request of Parliament, the Division will, at the end of May 
2013, implement training activities for members of Parliament on the processes for the 
ratification of and accession  to international human rights treaties, and subsequently for the 
harmonization of national legislation with international standards. The National Assembly, 
in accordance with its work plan for 2013, is seeking further technical and logistical </p>


<p>support, including short, specialized training sessions and an exchange programme with 
other national legislative bodies. 
</p>
<p>43. Continued support for the Government and the legislative assemblies at both the 
national and State levels will be crucial to ensuring that legislative processes are prompt, 
inclusive and transparent, and strengthen the legal human rights protection framework.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Priority areas for technical assistance 
</b></p>
<p>44. Significant efforts have been made and funds committed to the development of a 
legal and policy framework that prioritizes the protection of human rights in South Sudan. 
The South Sudan Development Plan for the period 2011-2013 and the United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework have identified human rights and gender equality as 
cross-cutting issues to be integrated into all development and State-building priorities. 
Because implementation of these plans has been severely constrained by the austerity 
budget imposed after the suspension of oil production, a proposal has been made to extend 
the validity of these parallel planning programmes until 2016. 
</p>
<p>45. Pursuant to Security Council resolutions 1996 (2011) and 2057 (2012), UNMISS 
was given a robust human rights mandate to strengthen the capacity of national 
stakeholders through enhancement of their skills and knowledge. A technical cooperation 
programme under the auspices of OHCHR has been embedded into the work of the 
UNMISS Human Rights Division as an important component of the Mission&#8217;s mandate. 
The programme has been implemented in the form of activities aimed at building the 
human rights capacity of specific stakeholders, in close collaboration with the Human 
Rights Commission and United Nations specialized agencies, funds and programmes.  
</p>
<p>46. Since the inception of UNMISS on 9 July 2011, under the Technical Cooperation 
Programme, 140 human rights capacity-building activities have been conducted in 
accordance with the UNMISS human rights mandate. These activities have focused on 
government ministries, the National Assembly, the South Sudan National Police Service, 
the SPLA (including Military Justice), corrections officers, traditional leaders, the Human 
Rights Commission, civil society organizations, human rights defenders and media groups. 
The activities, at the national, State and sometimes county levels, range from advice and 
recommendations on the human rights aspects of legislation to capacity-building 
workshops. 
</p>
<p>47. The work of the Human Rights Division of UNMISS is carried out in close 
collaboration with the Mission&#8217;s specialized components, namely United Nations police, 
the Rule of Law and Security Institutions Support Office, and the Child Protection, Civil 
Affairs and Gender units, to ensure the integration of human rights into all their institution- 
and capacity-building activities, including for civil society. As previously reported, the 
national Human Rights Commission remains a principle partner, though its work during the 
past year has been deeply affected by budget cuts. 
</p>
<p><b> A. South Sudan National Police Service  
</b></p>
<p>48. The South Sudan National Police Service needs to build its capacity to fulfil its 
mandate to prevent, combat and investigate crime, maintain law and public order, protect 
people and property, and to uphold and enforce the Constitution and the law. On 23 January 
2013, the President issued a decree for the appointment of a new head of the Service.  
</p>
<p>49. As reported by the High Commissioner in her previous report, the United Nations 
police developed the Strategic Training Plan for 2012-2015, in collaboration with </p>


<p>stakeholders.2 The plan, which lays the foundation for long-term institutional development, 
has been drawn upon the approved Strategic Plan for 2010-2013 and the National Police 
Service Framework for Action Plan for 2011-2015.  
</p>
<p>50. In accordance with the Strategic Training Plan for 2012&#8211;2015, 300 United Nations 
police officers are currently co-located with the South Sudan National Police Service with 
the aim of transferring knowledge and skills. The Human Rights Division of UNMISS 
works closely with United Nations police to provide human rights training modules for 
cadets in the national police training academy in Rajaf. A number of human rights training 
programmes have also been presented to various police units throughout South Sudan. As 
part of their monitoring of police detention, human rights officers provide advice on 
improving respect for human rights, particularly with regard to resolving cases of arbitrary 
detention. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Sudan </b>People&#8217;s Liberation Army<b>  
</b></p>
<p>51. The transitional Constitution of South Sudan envisages that the armed forces operate 
as a professional and disciplined body that respects human rights. The Human Rights 
Division of UNMISS provides training workshops with the SPLA on the application of 
human rights standards, with the main focus on strengthening military justice and 
accountability. During the period under review, training for the SPLA was held nationwide. 
Many of these activities have been undertaken in collaboration with the UNMISS Military 
Justice Advisory Section that engages with the SPLA to ensure respect for the rule of law 
and human rights. 
</p>
<p>52. The SPLA has established a training academy, the Rumbek Staff College, where 
ongoing training sessions are delivered by UNMISS military and bilateral partners. 
Accordingly, UNMISS has developed a strategy for strengthening engagement with the 
SPLA in which the Human Rights Division provides capacity-building and raises 
awareness on the human rights due diligence policy. Discussions are continuing with the 
SPLA on the inclusion of thematic human rights sessions in the college curriculum. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>53. In its human rights agenda and plan of action, the Government identified reform of 
the justice, law and order sector as an urgent priority and indicated that it would seek 
international assistance to strengthen its capacity. The weaknesses of the justice system &#8211; 
including lack of human, financial and material resources, the need for long-term training 
and specialist expertise &#8211; have been described extensively in United Nations and other 
reports and have had a deep impact on compliance with human rights principles. 
</p>
<p>54. According to the Legal Aid Strategy for 2012&#8211;2014 of the Ministry of Justice, the 
overwhelming majority (an estimated 95 per cent) of individuals in prison have not had the 
benefit of legal representation or the right to free legal aid in serious criminal, civil, land 
and family matters. Legal aid has emerged as a vital area for technical assistance, because 
the lack of legal representation jeopardizes the right to a fair trial and is most pressing in the 
case of those detained on death row. 
</p>
<p>55. The customary legal system, which operates alongside the statutory system  and is 
run by traditional leaders pursuant to the Local Government Act of 2009, is another 
challenge facing the administration of justice and human rights. While traditional courts are 
</p>
<p>  
 2 A/HRC/21/34, para. 54. </p>


<p>more accessible than statutory courts, the line between customary and statutory courts is 
often blurred in both law and in practice. The task of reconciling customary law with 
human rights standards is a challenge. To address this problem, the Human Rights Division 
of UNMISS has developed and delivered a series of training programmes in three States 
that will be followed by an additional 10 training activities for traditional courts in all 
States. 
</p>
<p>56. The judiciary, prosecutors and law enforcement officials need to strengthen their 
capacity to deal with vulnerable persons and to develop a comprehensive policy framework 
for vulnerable groups, including juvenile justice provisions. A juvenile remand review was 
established in July 2011 with the aim of reducing the amount of time that children spend in 
pretrial detention and providing advocacy with the judiciary and relevant stakeholders to 
promote and protect the rights of children in detention. Similar initiatives are under way in 
several States. The need for continuous capacity-building for the actors in the penal chain 
on juvenile justice is clear, as is the need to establish juvenile courts presided over by 
specialized judges. 
</p>
<p>57. Women detainees are among the most vulnerable and are often held for reasons that 
do not amount to criminal offences (such as adultery). Women are disproportionately 
arrested, detained and sanctioned under the adultery law, with harsh consequences for them 
and their children.  
</p>
<p><b> D. National Prison Service of South Sudan  
</b></p>
<p>58. The National Prison Service of South Sudan continues to fall short in fulfilling its 
mandate to be correctional, reformative and rehabilitative. International actors working 
with the prison system have commended the leadership of the Service, which is aware of 
applicable international standards, but faces severe resource challenges and a lack of 
capacity among prison personnel, particularly at the State level. In November 2012, the 
Government formed a high-level delegation to oversee the prison service, but the panel has 
not made any follow-up visits since its establishment. 
</p>
<p>59. The Corrections Advisory Section of the UNMISS Office of Rule of Law and 
Security Institutions provides the National Prison Service with advice and technical 
assistance, in addition to corrections advisers assigned to facilities throughout South Sudan. 
The Human Rights Division of UNMISS has developed and delivered extensive training 
programmes for correctional officers in all 10 States, besides monitoring prison conditions 
and assisting prison authorities in resolving human rights concerns. New facilities are 
needed, as is a greater financial and human capacity to maintain prison facilities and to 
enforce respect for international standards.  
</p>
<p>60. Special attention needs to be paid to vulnerable detainees, including women, 
juveniles and people with disabilities, who may spend weeks and months in detention 
awaiting trial as a result of delays in criminal investigations and trial processes, gaps in 
knowledge of applicable criminal laws and procedures, lack of coordination among 
criminal justice organs, the unavailability of victims and witnesses, lack of adequate 
transport, infrastructure, record-keeping and case-management, and lack of rights 
awareness and legal aid services.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Human Rights Commission of South Sudan was established prior to 
independence under the transitional Constitution and the Human Rights Commission Act 
</p><p>2009. By 2011, the Commission had established a presence in all 10 states, with UNMISS </p>


<p>Human Rights Officers providing technical advice and assistance across the country. This 
progress has been reversed in the past year because of drastic budget cuts under the national 
austerity measures: all State offices have been closed, and all 92 staff members of the 
Commission are currently located in Juba. 
</p>
<p>62. The above situation has been compounded by the fact that the Commission lacks any 
funds for implementing its operational activities, even in the capital. As a result, it has not 
been able to conduct investigations into gross human rights violations, issue public reports 
or receive and process individual complaints for many months. The limited number of 
activities that the Commission has been able to conduct, including investigations or 
capacity-building, has been implemented with the financial, technical and organizational 
support of the Human Rights Division of UNMISS through OHCHR, and of other United 
Nations agencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme and the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</p>
<p>63. Such support enabled the Commission to issue its annual report for 2011 in 2012 
(still pending approval by Parliament) and its second Strategic Plan for 2012-2015, which is 
being implemented with the technical support of OHCHR and other United Nations 
agencies, funds and programmes. The Commission was also able to develop its complaints 
and investigations procedure and its public investigation procedure with technical support 
from OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>64. A dynamic, robust and independent national human rights body is essential to work 
with government institutions in developing and implementing policies, practices and 
legislation that are in compliance with human rights norms and to advocate on behalf of 
individual victims of human rights violations. The Commission should also play a key role 
in supporting the development of an implementation plan for the human rights agenda, as 
well as ensuring that the Human Rights Forum, which it co-chairs, plays an important role 
in fostering dialogue among the various stakeholders. International support in terms of both 
funding and expertise will be essential to rebuild the Commission and to help it to become a 
leading voice in the protection and promotion of human rights in South Sudan.  
</p>
<p>65. In her previous report, the High Commissioner stressed that an institutional 
development grant, with clear benchmarks and implemented in an incremental and phased 
manner, could improve the capacity of the Commission. She added that the grant would 
gradually promote the emergence of an independent commission by linking disbursement to 
transparent appointments, security of tenure of commissioners and the issuance of public 
reports on key human rights issues.3  
</p>
<p><b> F. National human rights agenda 
</b></p>
<p>66. In November 2012, the Council of Ministers adopted a national human rights 
agenda, which sets out a plan of action based on five core priorities: the establishment of an 
effective legal framework for the promotion and protection of human rights; education, 
training and public awareness on human rights; strengthening implementation mechanisms, 
including measures to ensure that government policies, programmes and administrative 
practices are rights-based; strengthening monitoring, investigative and protective 
mechanisms, namely the Human Rights Commission, Parliament and civil society; and 
conflict resolution and management. 
</p>
<p>67. Although the agenda has yet to be tabled before Parliament, it could provide a useful 
framework for the development of an integrated national and State-level plan for 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Ibid., para. 60. </p>


<p>developing human rights-compliant legislation and the capacity of government, state and 
civil society entities to promote and protect human rights. The incorporation of benchmarks 
within such a plan would allow stakeholders to assess progress and to identify any obstacles 
to be overcome. The plan could also identify support that might be needed from the 
international community.   
</p>
<p>68. The agenda also emphasizes government support for the Human Rights Forum, 
which brings together human rights stakeholders, including government representatives, 
civil society and development partners to regularly dialogue on developing issues of human 
rights concern. The agenda was presented to the Forum in December 2012. The Forum 
itself could become an excellent vehicle for consultations on the development of the plan 
for the agenda. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Gender-awareness programmes 
</b></p>
<p>69. Since independence, significant potential for gender equality and respect for 
women&#8217;s rights has emerged in South Sudan. Women have taken an increasingly active role 
</p>
<p>in society, although gender disparities remain evident in key poverty indicators, including a 
female illiteracy rate as high as 86 per cent. Lack of education and access to health services, 
combined with early marriage, have resulted in extremely high rates of infant mortality and 
one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. Sexual and gender-based violence 
persists, with perpetrators enjoying a high degree of impunity.  
</p>
<p>70. As a mechanism to increase gender awareness, peace forums were held nationwide 
on Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security, to engage 
citizens in discussions on sexual and gender-based violence. In August 2012, the SPLA 
leadership agreed for the first time to undergo training on gender mainstreaming, which 
UNMISS facilitated for 26 officers, after which commanders pledged to undertake gender 
mainstreaming within the SPLA. 
</p>
<p>71. With regard to the promotion of girl-child education, the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund and the Ministry of General Education and Instruction are finalizing a national 
strategic plan on girl-child education that is expected to be launched and disseminated by 
July 2013. Through media and public events, advocacy efforts by the Government and 
other stakeholders are ongoing to support the enrolment and retention of the girl-child in 
school. 
</p>
<p>72. The Government has taken some steps towards ratification of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by establishing a working 
group that brings together the relevant directorate in the Ministry of Justice, UNMISS and 
United Nations agencies. The working group is undertaking preparatory work on 
Convention accession documents and conducting awareness-raising for stakeholders to 
improve their understanding of its provisions and to promote further harmonization with 
national legislation. Continued advocacy efforts are needed not only to create greater public 
awareness of the importance of ratifying the Convention but also to build parliamentary 
support for its ratification.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>In the two years since independence, South Sudan has taken important strides 
in its efforts to lay down the foundations of a new country and to establish the 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions necessary to respond to the needs of its population. In the area of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, some progress has been made at the institutional and legislative levels, but 
</b></p>
<p><b>actual implementation of measures remains extremely weak.  </b></p>


<p>74. <b>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends that 
the Government of South Sudan, with the support of the international community:
