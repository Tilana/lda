<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>,

</p>
<p>adopted in the framework of the United Nations, in particular by the General Assembly, in its

needed, at a request of a member of the Council with the support of one third of the membership 
</p>
<p>of the Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including its provision that 
</p>
<p>everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself 
</p>
<p>and of his family, including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and 
</p>
<p>Malnutrition and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular the first Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goal of eradicating hunger and extreme poverty by 2015, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, especially its article 11(2), which recognize the fundamental right of every 
</p>
<p>person to be free from hunger, and the duty of States to take, individually and through 
</p>
<p>international cooperation, the measures needed to implement this right, by improving the 
</p>
<p>methods of production, conservation and distribution of food, <i>Bearing in mind</i> the Rome 
</p>
<p>Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action of 1996, and 
</p>
<p>the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, adopted in Rome on 13 June 2002, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind also </i>the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and 
</p>
<p>recommending the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing 
</p>
<p>for the fight against hunger and poverty, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right 
</p>
<p>to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food 
</p>
<p>and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same 
</p>
<p>footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming further</i> that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
</p>
<p>environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will 
</p>
<p>enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the complex character of the worsening of the current global food crisis, in 
</p>
<p>which the right to adequate food is threatened to be violated on a massive scale, as a combination </p>

of several major factors, including macroeconomic factors, also impacted negatively by 
</p>
<p>environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters, and the 
</p>
<p>lack of the necessary technology to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries and 
</p>
<p>least developed countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>the situation of one sixth of the world population, mainly in developing and 
</p>
<p>least developed countries suffering from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, and alarmed 
</p>
<p>at the particular effects of the current global food crisis on many net food importing countries 
</p>
<p>and specially on least developed countries in Africa, Asia and Latin American and the 
</p>
<p>Caribbean, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the international community should provide its assistance to populations in 
</p>
<p>need in an effective and coordinated manner, with the consent and on the basis of the appeal by 
</p>
<p>the affected country, in order to ensure that such humanitarian assistance, in particular the supply 
</p>
<p>of food, reaches affected populations, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the United Nations Task Force established by the Secretary-General, and 
</p>
<p>supporting the Secretary-General to continue his efforts in this regard, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses</i> grave concern at the worsening of the world food crisis, which seriously 
</p>
<p>undermines the realization of the right to food for all; 
</p>
<p>2.  <i>Expresses</i> also grave concern that this crisis threatens to further undermine the 
</p>
<p>achievement of Millennium Development Goals, in particular objective Number 1 aiming at 
</p>
<p>halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; 
</p>
<p>3.  <i>Calls upon </i>States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, 
</p>
<p>relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all necessary measures 
</p>
<p>to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and 
</p>
<p>considering reviewing any policy or measure which could have a negative impact on the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before 
</p>
<p>instituting such a policy or measure; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Stresses</i> that States have a primary obligation to make their best efforts to meet the 
</p>
<p>vital food needs of their own population, especially of the vulnerable groups and households, </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-7/L.1/Rev.1

such as through enhancing programmes to combat mother-child malnutrition, and to increase 
</p>
<p>local production for this purpose, while the international community should provide, through a 
</p>
<p>coordinated response and upon request, support to national and regional efforts in terms of 
</p>
<p>providing the necessary assistance for increasing food production, particularly through transfer 
</p>
<p>of technology, as well as food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> United Nations Member States and other relevant stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>participate actively in the High-level Conference on World Food Security and the Challenges of 
</p>
<p>Climate Change and Bioenergy, to take place from 3 to 5 June 2008, in Rome, organized by the 
</p>
<p>Food and Agriculture Organization, while takes note of the results of the special meeting of 
</p>
<p>ECOSOC on this issue, held on 20 May 2008; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Invites </i>the Food and Agriculture Organization to extend an invitation to the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights and to the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to attend and 
</p>
<p>actively participate in the aforementioned High-level Conference, so as to help mainstreaming a 
</p>
<p>human rights perspective in the analysis of the world food crisis, with a focus on the realization 
</p>
<p>of the right to food; 
</p>
<p>7.  <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to make a presentation to the 8th session of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council on his participation in the Meeting mentioned in operative paragraph 5, 
</p>
<p>and on his initial recommendations regarding actions required, at all levels, to promote, respect 
</p>
<p>and protect the right to food and freedom from hunger in the midst of the current food crisis, 
</p>
<p>when actions are called for to promote mid and long term food security; 
</p>
<p>8.  <i>Requests also</i> the Special Rapporteur to present a report to the 9th session of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, inviting comments from States and other relevant actors, on the impact 
</p>
<p>of the global food crisis on the protection of the right to food, and required remedies from a 
</p>
<p>human rights perspective; 
</p>
<p>9.  <i>Requests further</i> the High Commissioner for Human Rights to bring this resolution to 
</p>
<p>the attention of all relevant international organizations and agencies; 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> A/HRC/S-7/L.1/Rev.1

</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue reporting on further 
</p>
<p>developments on this issue to the Human Rights Council and to the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>11. Decides to remain seized of the implementation of this resolution.
