Group Summary
Safety 
No lost time injuries (LTI) were recorded at the operations.
Environment 
There  were  no  significant  environmental  incidents  recorded  and  the  operations  were  conducted  within  all  statutory,  regulatory  and 
licence conditions.
Production 
Group production for FY2016 was 10,864t Ni contained in concentrate/ore.
Nickel – Savannah Project
General 
In April and May, the Savannah Project produced 1,958t Ni, 1,106t Cu and 96t Co contained in concentrate, before being placed onto 
care and maintenance. In FY2016, Savannah (including Copernicus) produced a record 9,845t Ni in concentrate, up 13% on the 
previous year.
Record metal production of 1,263t contained nickel was achieved in April, surpassing the previous monthly production record set 
in December 2011. Increased processing rates in March and April has confirmed that the Savannah plant can operate at 130-140tph, 
which equates to an annual throughput rate of 1.1-1.2Mt at 95% availability. The 889t of contained nickel in concentrate on hand at 30 
June 2016, valued at ~$9 million, was shipped in early July.
During April, plant trials were conducted with the combined assistance of Glencore Technologies, Integrated Global Partners and JK 
Tech. The purpose of the trials was to quantify the physical benefits of using IsaMillTM and Jameson CellTM technologies on Savannah 
ore. The test work results were very positive, showing improved concentrate grades and metal recoveries at various feed grades. The 
final results will be incorporated into the Savannah North Feasibility Study, which is scheduled to be completed during the December 
2016 quarter.
The record nickel production in April, lower site aggregate costs (excluding redundancy costs)  and the higher average milled nickel 
head grade of 1.50% resulted in a two month average payable cash costs of A$2.30lb (Table 1).
Two  concentrate  shipments  for  a  combined  1,667t  contained  nickel  were  exported.    The  final  shipment  of  11,095wmt  departed  for 
China on 5 July.

Care and Maintenance 
On  27 January  2016,  the  Company  announced  that due  to  the  weak  US$  nickel  price  and  uncertainty  around  the  timing  of  a  price 
recovery, the Project was to (1) immediately stop developing new stoping areas and (2) begin a transition onto care and maintenance.
In April and May, ore production and mill throughput were maximised in an efficient and safe manner until the operation was put onto 
care and maintenace in late May 2016. An additional 107 Savannah employees were made redundant at a cost of approximately $6 
million. The remaining redundancy cost following the completion of site rehabilitation and clean-up is approximately $2.5 million.
By taking this decision, the remaining Savannah Resource will be preserved until the US$ nickel price returns to a sustainable level 
where  the  mining  of  the  Savannah  Resource,  mostly  likely  in  conjunction  with  the  development  of  Savannah  North,  provides  an 
acceptable return to shareholders.
Restart Plan 
The remaining Mining Inventory at Savannah can be readily accessed with minimal new capital development. The Company plans to 
use the free cash flow generated from the remaining Resource at Savannah to offset the capital required to develop Savannah North.
The plan during the care and maintenance period is to:

complete the Feasibility Study on the combined Savannah and Savannah North Project;
  grow the Resource base by undertaking additional exploration;


study the technical aspects and economics of producing a higher nickel grade bulk concentrate, separate nickel and copper 
concentrates, and/or a nickel/copper/cobalt matte; and
identify the optimum mining and milling rates, recognising the existing mill has the capacity to treat 1.0-1.1Mtpa, through the 
use of new mining and haulage technologies to enhance productivity and reduce unit costs.
Once  these  work  streams  are  completed,  the  Company  will  finalise  and  release  the  Feasibility  Study  results  which  will  include 
guidance as to the long term A$ nickel price required to restart Savannah.

Lower Schmitz 
The maiden Lower Schmitz Resource Statement was released in the March 2016 Quarterly Report.
Native Title 
In November 2014, the Federal Court made a Determination of native title in favour of the Ngadju People, the consequence of which 
was  that  the  Company’s  tenements  at  the  Lanfranchi  Nickel  Project  were  invalid  to  the  extent  that  they  were  inconsistent  with  the 
continued  existence,  enjoyment  or  exercise  of  native  title  rights  held  by  the  Ngadju  People.  The  Determination  was  subsequently 
appealed by some of the Respondents to the Determination, and the Company joined as a non-participating Respondent Party to the 
appeal.
On 29 March 2016, the Full Federal Court handed down its decision in the appeal, which overturned the initial decision and confirmed 
the validity of the relevant tenements. The Ngadju People have filed applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court, which 
applications are yet to be determined.
Base Metal Exploration
Savannah and East Kimberley Regional
Savannah and Savannah North Project 
The  2016  Savannah  North  drill  programs  continued  throughout  the  quarter  with  drilling  completed  in  the  second  week  of  July.  As 
previously reported (refer to the Company’s ASX announcements of 26 February 2016 and 21 March 2016), the exploration activity so 
far in 2016 has consisted of three programs as follows, in order of priority:
1.  Up-dip to the east extension;
2.  Lower Zone infill drilling; and
3.  Upper Zone to the west extension.
Figure 1 shows the locations of the three drill programs. The principal objectives of programs 1 and 2 were achieved, as detailed in this 
report.
Page 4 of 19
News Release
Figure 1 – Plan View showing the position of the Savannah North Resource drill programs
Program 1 – Savannah North Up-Dip to the East (High Priority)
Previous studies have highlighted that the time and capital development required to access the first ore at Savannah North could be 
reduced significantly if the Savannah North Resource extends up-dip towards the existing Savannah mine levels. A program of up to 
20 diamond holes comprising approximately 8,000m was designed to determine the proximity of the Savannah North mineralisation to 
the existing Savannah mine levels. Seventeen drill holes were drilled up-dip to the east as part of Program 1.
Program 2 – Lower Zone infill high grade Inferred area (High Priority)
Preliminary  Savannah  North  mine  designs  highlighted  the  significant  contribution  delivered  by  the  deeper  levels  of  the  high-grade 
Savannah North Lower Zone Resource. This zone was essentially constrained by the limited number of drill intersections. In order to 
de-risk  the  mine  designs  in  this  area,  greater  Resource  confidence  is  required  and  a  ten  hole  program  comprising  approximately 
7,300m was planned to infill this area. Eight drill holes were completed.
Program 3 – Upper Zone western extension
Prior to ceasing the Savannah North Maiden Resource drill program in August 2015, it had been intended to infill (on a 100m by 100m 
spacing) the area between the western edge of the Maiden Resource test area (5700mE) and surface hole SMD164, a distance of 
~300m (Figure 2). A significant portion of the existing Inferred Resource and unclassified mineralisation in this area could be converted 
to Indicated category and a ten hole drill program comprising 5,800m was initially planned. The program was also designed to provide 
a clearer picture of the shape and grade of the Resource in this area, which in turn could be applied to the unclassified mineralisation 
that  has  been  modelled  to  extend  for  a  further  1km  to  the  west  from  SMD164.  The  results  were  expected  to  provide  a  better 
understanding of the resource potential of Savannah North. Three drill holes were completed as part of Program 3.
Figure 2 is a plan view showing the location of all drill holes completed as part of the 2016 Savannah North Resource drill program.

June 2016 Quarter Drill Hole Results
Note:  all  intersections  are  down-hole  lengths  and  not  true-widths.  A  full  list  of  drill  hole  details  and  JORC  Compliance  Tables  are 
contained in Appendix 1.
Program 1 – Savannah North Up-Dip to the East
Ten drill holes were drilled as part of Program 1. Better recent results received include:
  13.10m @ 2.43% Ni, 0.55% Cu, 0.18% Co(KUD1583); 
  7.60m @ 2.49% Ni, 0.17% Cu, 0.17% Co (KUD1584); and 
  8.10m @ 1.78% Ni, 0.50% Cu, 0.11% Co (KUD1592).
Program 2 – Lower Zone infill high grade Inferred area
Eight  drill  holes  were  targeted  at  the  Lower  Zone  as  part  of  Program  2.  Assay  results  are  awaited  on  the  more  recent  drill  holes. 
Results received to date include:
  13.45m @ 2.06% Ni, 1.07% Cu, 0.12% Co(KUD1591); 
  11.25m @ 2.09% Ni, 0.64% Cu, 0.14% Co (KUD1591W1); and 
  8.40m @ 1.36% Ni, 0.25% Cu, 0.07% Co (KUD1593).

News Release
Program 3 – Upper Zone western extension
Three drill holes targeting the Upper Zone mineralisation to the west of the current  Resource area were drilled. Drill hole KUD1577 
intersected  a  post  mineralised  dyke  at  the  anticipated  target  depth  for  the  mineralisation.  Results  from  a  follow-up  down  hole 
electromagnetic  (DHEM)  survey  on  KUD1577  indicates  the  dyke  is  coincident  with  a  very  large  and  highly  conductive  EM 
response. Modelling of the EM data indicates mineralisation is proximal to and surrounds the drill hole. Results for the other two holes 
are:
  13.50m @ 0.79% Ni, 0.46% Cu, 0.05% Co (KUD1578); and 
  9.50m @ 1.45% Ni, 0.37% Cu, 0.07% Co (KUD1585);
Way Forward
The Company is waiting to receive final assay results from six drill holes before updating the Savannah North Resource model, which 
is expected to be completed in September 2016.
DHEM surveys have been completed on drill holes KUD1550A, KUD1577, KUD1585, KUD1586, KUD1591 and KUD1594. The main 
objective  of  the  DHEM  program  is  to  use  the  data  to  assist  with  the  geological  interpretation  and  modelling  of  the  Lower  Zone 
mineralisation  of  the  Savannah  North  Resource.  The  DHEM  data  is  currently  being  modelled  and  interpreted  with  assistance  from 
Newexco Services Pty Ltd.
FY2017 Plans and budgets include a new surface diamond drilling program at Savannah North, scheduled to commence in 
the  December  2016  quarter.  The  main  objective  of  the  program  is  to  evaluate  and  test  for  strike  and  width  extensions  of  the 
Savannah North mineralised system to the east and west of the currently defined Resource. Two surface holes will be drilled to test the 
large EM plate extending to the west from the Savannah North Resource (Figure 1) and up to three surface holes will be drilled to the 
east of the Resource. It is planned to undertake DHEM surveys on all drill holes.
Lanfranchi
Lower Schmitz 
A maiden Mineral Resource estimate for Lower Schmitz of 131,000t @ 5.1% Ni for 6,700t Ni was released in the March 2016 quarterly 
report on 28 April 2016. Importantly, the deposit remains open down plunge and warrants further drilling to potentially increase the size 
of the Resource.
Gold – Gum Creek Project
Initial Public Offer (IPO)
On 11 July 2016, the Company announced that it had begun the process to partially divest of the Gum Creek Project by way 
of an initial public offering (IPO) on the ASX.
The indicative structure is to value the Gum Creek assets at $15 million and raise $15 million in new equity via a priority entitlement to 
existing  Panoramic  shareholders.  Subject  to  the  execution  of  a  formal  underwriting  agreement,  it  is  proposed  that  any  shortfall  of 
shares will be placed by Somers and Partners Pty Ltd as underwriter to the IPO.
Full  details  of  the  proposed  IPO,  timetable,  will  be  contained  in  a  prospectus  which  is  currently  being  prepared.  The  Company  is 
planning to have the prospectus finalised during September, however there is no certainty as to this timing.
The Company believes an IPO of the Gum Creek Project is the most appropriate way to unlock the intrinsic value of the Gum 
Creek asset with the new funds raised primarily used to fast track exploration and development studies.
While it is the Company’s intention to proceed with the IPO, there is no guarantee that this will occur and as always the success of any 
IPO is dependent on prevailing market conditions.

Metallurgical Test Work
In June 2016, metallurgical testwork of Wilsons mineralisation identified a potential processing route utilising mild conditions to oxidise 
flotation concentrate to achieve high gold recoveries. The process consists of a combination of low intensity magnetic separation and 
standard flotation to produce a gold concentrate.  This concentrate is then finely ground and pre-conditioned under acidic conditions at 
moderate temperature prior to Carbon in Leach (CIL) (refer to the Company’s ASX announcements of 29 June 2016).
Page 9 of 19
News Release
In comparison with the previously considered BIOX method, this process has the potential to reduce operating risk due to the nature of 
the oxidation process and expected lower capital and operating costs due to the relatively small volume of concentrate to be treated, 
combined with a rapid processing time.
A number of areas of optimisation have been identified which will be the focus of future test work.
Exploration
An Induced Polarisation (IP) test survey was completed over the Wilsons deposit (refer to the Company’s ASX announcements of 29 
June  2016).  The  survey  shows  a  clear  chargeable  source  coincident  with  the  known  Wilsons  mineralisation  and  demonstrates  the 
viability of using modern IP techniques as a tool to explore for similar mineralisation along the Wilsons Shear. Inversion modelling of 
the  Wilsons  IP  test  data  also  suggests  the  Wilsons  mineralisation  continues  down  plunge  to  the  west  beyond  the  current  depth  of 
drilling and existing Resource. Details on the IP survey, including 2012 JORC disclosures, are in Table 1, Section 2 in Appendix 2.
In  addition,  IP  surveying  across  the  host  shear  for  a  distance  of  6km  to  the  south  of  Wilsons  has  identified  two  discrete  IP 
chargeable  anomalies  similar  to  the  one  identified  by  the  test  survey  at  Wilsons  (Figures  3  and  4).  The  source  of  the  two 
chargeable anomalies identified to the south of Wilsons is unknown and justifies further exploration. Only an estimated ten percent of 
the Wilsons Shear within the Gum Creek Project area has been tested using modern IP techniques.
Gold – WA Exploration Projects (ex-Magma)
The  Laverton  Farm-in  Agreement  between  Poseidon  Nickel  Limited  (Poseidon)  and  Magma  Metals  Pty  Ltd  (100%  owned  by 
Panoramic) was terminated by mutual agreement.
PGM – Thunder Bay North Project
The Thunder Bay North (TBN) Project is located near Thunder Bay in northwest Ontario, Canada.  The advanced exploration project 
claims cover  an  aggregate  area  of  40,816  hectares.   The TBN  Project  Resource contains  10.4Mt  at  1.13g/t  Pt  and 1.07g/t  Pd  for 
~0.4Moz  Pt  and  ~0.4Moz  Pd  (refer  to  the  Company’s  ASX  announcement  of  30  September  2015  for  disclosures  on  the  TBN 
Resource) with exploration potential at depth and along strike.
On 30 July 2014, Panoramic announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Panoramic PGMs (Canada) Limited (PANP), had signed an 
Earn-in  with  Option  to  Joint  Venture  Agreement  (Agreement)  with  Rio  Tinto  Exploration  Canada  Inc.  (RTEC),  a  wholly  owned 
subsidiary  of  Rio  Tinto,  to  consolidate  their  respective  Platinum  Group  Metal  (PGM)  projects  in  northwest  Ontario,  Canada.  RTEC 
holds a single tenement called Escape Lake (EL) within the core of the TBN tenement package.  PANP and RTEC have recognised 
that the best way of realising value from both Projects is to combine TBN and EL into a single project (Consolidated Property).
In January 2015, the Company announced that RTEC had exercised its right under the Agreement by electing to move into the Earn-in 
Option Phase (Phase 2) of the Agreement. Under the terms of Phase 2, RTEC can earn a 70% interest in the TBN Project by sole 
funding C$20 million of expenditure over a five year period (minimum spend of C$5 million before RTEC can withdraw). During this 
period, RTEC will be responsible for managing the Consolidated Property and ensuring the tenements are kept in good standing. If 
RTEC does not earn its 70% interest, PANP has certain rights to purchase 100% of EL.
The 2015 RTEC diamond drilling program on the Project commenced in July and was completed in early November after drilling 11 
holes, totalling 4,955 drill metres. The results of the 2015 program were encouraging and a follow-up winter drill program using two 
diamond drill rigs commenced in mid-January 2016. The winter program was completed in late March after drilling 10 holes, totalling 
4,832 drill metres. Promising intersections were obtained from several of the Eastern Lake holes and one hole on the Beaver 
Lake portion of the Project, which has expanded the known mineralisation in several directions
The next stage of the exploration program is to undertake a semi-airborne HeliSAMTM magnetics survey over the Escape Lake Current 
Lake, Beaver Lake, SEA Intrusion, 025 Intrusion and Swamp Anomaly portions of the Project. This survey was delayed and is now 
scheduled to be undertaken in the September 2016 quarter.

PGM – Panton Project
Panton  is  located  60km  south  of  the  Savannah  Nickel  Project  in  the  East  Kimberley  region  of  Western  Australia.  Panton  is  a 
significant PGM Resource containing ~1.0Moz Pt at 2.2g/t and ~1.1Moz Pd at 2.4g/t  (refer to the Company’s announcement of  
ASX  Announcement  of  30  September  2015  on  “Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  at  30  June  2015”  for  disclosures  on  the 
Resource) with exploration potential at depth and along strike.
Panoramic  considers  the  Panton  Project  to  be  a  quality  PGM  development  asset  which  fits  within  the  Company’s  commodity 
diversification  and  growth  strategy.  In  March  2012,  the  previous  owner  announced  the  results  of  a  review  of  the  2003  Bankable 
Feasibility Study Review (2012 BFS Review).
The  Company  is  sponsoring  research  being  undertaken  by  Curtin  University  on  alternative  PGM  leaching  methods  applicable  to 
Panton ore. This research work is ongoing.
Corporate
Liquid Assets and Debt 
Liquid assets at the end of the quarter totalled $30 million, comprising $21 million in cash and ~$9 million of nickel in concentrate 
which was ready for shipment as at 30 June (shipped on 5 July). The movement in liquid assets outside of normal operating cash flows 
was primarily due to:
  $10.7 million from the pro-rata rights issue (before costs); 
  ~$6 million in redundancy costs at Savannah; and

News Release
Pro-Rata Renounceable Entitlement Offer 
On 26 April 2016, the Company completed a fully underwritten, pro-rata renounceable one for three rights issue at $0.10 per share to 
raise $10.7 million (before costs). The Entitlement Offer was strongly supported, with applications from existing shareholders totaling 
approximately  78%  of  the  107.1  million  new  shares  offered.  The  Company’s  major  shareholder,  Zeta  Resources  Limited,  co-
underwrote the issue in conjunction with GMP Securities Australia Pty Ltd and increased its holding to 24.7% of the Company’s issued 
capital after taking up a portion of the small shortfall.
Perth Office 
Following on from the operational changes made at the Savannah Project, staffing and remuneration levels in the Perth Office have 
been reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. As a result of this review, there has been a significant reduction in staff and senior 
executives remaining with the Company have accepted, from 1 July 2016, a 10% reduction in base salary. These cuts come after the 
non-executive directors agreed to a ~35%% reduction in director fees, effective 1 March 2016.
The  Company  would  again  like  to  thank  all  Panoramic  employees  for  their  commitment  and  dedication,  especially  those  that  have 
recently been made redundant at Savannah and in the Perth Office.
About the Company 
Panoramic  Resources  Limited  (ASX  code:  PAN)  is  a  Western  Australian  mining  company  formed  in  2001  for  the  purpose  of  developing  the 
Savannah Nickel Project in the East Kimberley. Panoramic successfully commissioned the $65 million Savannah Project in late 2004 and then in 
2005 purchased and restarted the Lanfranchi Nickel Project, near Kambalda. In FY2014, the Company produced a record 22,256t contained nickel 
and  produced  19,301t  contained  nickel  in  FY2015.  The  Lanfranchi  Project  and  Savannah  Project  were  placed  on  care  and  maintenance  in 
November 2015 and May 2016 respectively.
Following the successful development of the nickel projects, the Company diversified its resource base to include gold and platinum group metals 
(PGM). The Gold Division consists of the Gum Creek Gold Project located near Wiluna. The PGM Division consists of the Panton Project, located 
60km  south  of  the  Savannah  Project  and  the  Thunder  Bay  North  Project  in  Northern  Ontario,  Canada,  in  which  Rio  Tinto  is  earning  70%  by 
spending up to C$20 million over five years.
Panoramic has been a consistent dividend payer and has paid out a total of $114.3 million in fully franked dividends since 2008. At 30 June 2016, 
Panoramic had $30 million in liquid assets and no bank debt.
The  Company’s  vision  is  to  broaden  its  exploration  and  production  base,  with  the  aim  of  becoming  a  major,  diversified  mining  company  in  the 
S&P/ASX 100 Index. The growth path will include developing existing resources, discovering new ore bodies, acquiring additional projects and is 
being led by an experienced exploration-to-production team with a proven track record.

  The Savannah deposit and surrounding exploration areas are typically 
sampled by diamond drilling techniques.  Over 1500 holes have been 
drilled for a total in excess of 220,000m.  The majority of holes were 
drilled from underground drill platforms.
  About the mine the drillhole spacing is a nominal 25x25m grid spacing
over the extent of the mineralisation.
  All drillhole collars were surveyed using Leica Total Station survey
equipment by a registered surveyor.  Downhole surveys were typically

(eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
Material and should be stated.
  Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of
high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, 
the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated 
and some typical examples of such aggregations should 
be shown in detail.
  The assumptions used for any reporting of metal
equivalent values should be clearly stated.
  Weighted averages were calculated using parameters of 0.5% Ni lower 
cut-off, minimum reporting length of 1m and maximum internal waste of 
7m.
  Cu and Co grades were determined by the defined Ni grade interval, ie
they are not calculated independently.
  For all Savannah North Maiden Resource drill hole intercepts the
process is essentially the same except the individual sample SG values 
are also incorporated in to the weighting calculation.

such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, 
native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national 
park and environmental settings.
  The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting

to operate in the area.
Gidgee Gold Project, is a gold mining centre that has been 
on care and maintenance since 2005. The GCGP is 
currently secured by 46 tenements, comprising 9 
Exploration Licences (ELs), 21 Mining Leases (MLs), 6 
Prospecting Licences (PLs) and 10 Miscellaneous 
Licences (refer to the “Schedule of Tenements” in the 
latest PAN Annual Report). If there is production on the 
tenements, various royalties will be payable to third parties 
in relation to various tenements.
  All tenements and land tenure are current and in good
standing. Panoramic Resources Limited (PAN), through its 
wholly owned entity, Panoramic Gold Pty Ltd, has 100% 
ownership of the tenements and subject, to any necessary 
approvals, the sole right to explore for and/or mine all 
commodities within the area of the PLs, ELs and MLs.

deposits of both free milling and refractory character. All 
deposits are classified as belonging to the Archaean 
orogenic category of gold deposits.

o  dip and azimuth of the hole 
o  down hole length and interception depth

If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis 
that the information is not Material and this exclusion does 
not detract from the understanding of the report, the

If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are 
reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect 
(eg ‘down hole length, true width not known’).

misleading reporting of Exploration Results.
  The exploration results and information reported in this 
announcement are sufficiently detailed in nature for the 
announcement to be considered sufficiently balanced and 
not misleading.
