<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Social Forum was held in Geneva from 1 to 3 September 2008, in accordance with 
resolution 6/13 of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 6/13, the Council decided to preserve the Social Forum as a vital space for 
dialogue between the representatives of Member States, civil society, including grass-roots 
organizations and intergovernmental organizations on issues linked with the promotion of the 
enjoyment of all human rights by all. 
</p><p>3. In December 2007, the President of the Council appointed, from candidates nominated 
by regional groups, Mousa Burayzat, Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations 
Office at Geneva, as the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 2008 Social Forum. The 
Chairperson-Rapporteur, after consultations with Member States and other stakeholders, 
announced 1 to 3 September as the dates for convening the 2008 Social Forum. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report contains a summary of discussions held at the 2008 Social Forum and 
its conclusions and recommendations, as well as possible themes for the 2009 Social Forum. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SOCIAL FORUM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the 2008 Social Forum and invited the President of 
the Human Rights Council to make inaugural remarks. In his statement, the President made 
reference to the current challenges faced by the international community, including the food 
crises and continued existence of poverty, which constituted compelling reasons for hosting a 
meeting such as that of the Social Forum. He encouraged participants to make progress in 
identifying best practices in the fight against poverty. 
</p>
<p>6. The Chairperson-Rapporteur then addressed the Forum and highlighted the importance of 
focusing on the issue of poverty and how to eradicate it within the framework of globalization 
and human rights. He emphasized that there was a consensus that poverty was not just an 
economic and social problem, nor was it solely a security or political one; it was also a human 
rights problem, as it symbolizes the degradation of human dignity. 
</p>
<p>7. The Chairperson-Rapporteur furthermore stated that globalization could lead to the 
exacerbation of the problem of poverty if it were not dealt with seriously. It also harmed 
unsophisticated means of earning, such as traditional agriculture and livestock breeding in the 
countryside and rural areas. Moreover, privatization by freezing the cost of basic services 
increases the burden for poor people, not to mention other negative side effects of other 
well-known tools of globalization on poverty and the poor. 
</p>
<p>8. It is evident that the policies of economic liberalization have succeeded in increasing the 
number of the rich; however, they have also contributed to an increase in the number of the 
underprivileged in many regions, although they are not the sole factor in this regard. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. The recent world food crisis was an additional alarm bell for the international community 
and a warning of additional consequences of mounting poverty and the lack of food, as well as 
the negative possible effects of globalization. 
</p>
<p>10. The Chairperson-Rapporteur proposed four areas that the deliberations and thematic 
discussions of the Social Forum could address: (a) raising awareness and international concern 
regarding the problems of poverty and extreme poverty; (b) practical initiatives that are 
implementable; (c) technical support and capacity-building for countries and agencies in need; 
and (d) the need for a more structured role of the United Nations in developing and coordinating 
international efforts to tackle poverty. 
</p>
<p>11. The Chairperson-Rapporteur subsequently invited the United Nations Deputy 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to make welcome remarks. In her address, the 
Deputy High Commissioner drew the attention of participants to the report of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (A/HRC/SF/2008/2), which was prepared upon the 
request of the Council as a background contribution for deliberations at the Forum. She also 
emphasized that poverty was a human rights issue and the gravest human rights challenge facing 
the world. The Deputy High Commissioner believed that globalization could be given a human 
face if guided by the fundamental principles that underpin human rights, such as equity, 
participation, accountability and non-discrimination. Utilizing international human rights 
standards to influence the direction of globalization and enhance the effectiveness of poverty 
eradication was highlighted as an important area for further discussion. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>12. The programme of work of the 2008 Social Forum (see annex II) was prepared under the 
guidance of the Chairperson-Rapporteur, taking into account the input received from Member 
States and other relevant stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>13. Under the main themes of poverty and human rights and the social dimension of the 
globalization process, the 2008 Social Forum heard 28 expert presentations, followed by 
interactive debates, on 12 different thematic topics and their relationship to poverty. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>14. See annex III. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>15. The 2008 Social Forum had before it the provisional agenda (annex I), the 
programme of work (annex II) and the background report (A/HRC/SF/2008/2) submitted 
by the High Commissioner for Human Rights pursuant to paragraph 8 of Council 
resolution 6/13. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS 
</b></p>
<p>16. The section below contains a summary of the presentations and statements made during the 
interactive debate that followed the presentations.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Poverty and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Normative framework for human rights and extreme poverty 
</b></p>
<p>17. The independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena 
Sepulveda Carmona, recalled that previous sessions of the Social Forum had confirmed that 
human rights and poverty were linked in three ways: (a) poverty can be both a cause and 
consequence of human rights violations; (b) the realization of all human rights and efforts to 
eliminate extreme poverty are mutually reinforcing; and (c) human rights norms and principles 
provide the framework for poverty reduction and/or eradication. She also emphasized that the 
elimination of poverty is not a question of charity but an important and pressing human rights 
issue. Poverty is often linked to the denial or violation of human rights enshrined in the major 
human rights treaties, which, together with regional instruments, establish the normative 
framework for addressing the reduction of poverty from a human rights perspective. She further 
stressed that any initiative to address the situation of those living in poverty must be guided by 
the principles of equality and non-discrimination, participation, transparency and accountability. 
</p>
<p>18. The independent expert also referred to the important role of the Social Forum as a 
sounding board for emerging concerns around the world. Commenting on her expectations on 
the outcome of the Social Forum, she observed that it was ideally placed to identify best 
practices in poverty reduction and to promote the incorporation of a human rights approach into 
policies aimed at poverty reduction and elimination. She stated that the Forum should continue to 
focus on existing discrimination, as both a cause and a consequence of poverty, and that it should 
promote the participation of those living in poverty, particularly women. She concluded that the 
current session of the Forum should also build on the work of the previous sessions and continue 
promoting the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights: the rights of the 
poor, which were prepared in 2006 by the Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>19. The Deputy Chairperson and member of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, Ariranga Pillay, focused his presentation on the work of the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights with regard to poverty and human rights. He recalled that the 
Committee had provided a definition of poverty and stated that the international human rights 
normative framework was essential for sustainable reduction of poverty. He underlined the 
essential characteristics of a rights-based approach to poverty reduction, such as rights and 
obligations, accountability, equality, non-discrimination and participation. With regard to 
accountability, he made special reference to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as a justiciability tool for these rights.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Foreign debt and poverty 
</b></p>
<p>20. The independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international 
financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights, Cephas Lumina, stated that, from a human rights perspective, 
excessive debt burdens, high dependency on foreign assistance and extreme poverty together 
pose a major challenge to the realization of human rights in many countries by undermining the 
human rights obligations of States and the enjoyment of human rights by the poor in indebted 
countries. Studies indicate that some countries are spending much more each year on servicing 
debt than on human rights-related public services, such as education and health, combined. 
</p>
<p>21. The independent expert emphasized that the reduction of foreign debt through debt relief is 
considered one of the principal ways to contribute to poverty reduction and debt sustainability. 
However, he drew attention to a number of key concerns in debt relief initiatives, particularly 
with regard to the conditions attached to debt relief measures. Debt relief alone cannot facilitate 
development and poverty eradication in low-income countries; it must be complemented by 
additional development assistance, particularly in the form of concessional loans or grants. In 
this respect, he pointed out the fact that official development assistance (ODA) has been 
declining to levels well below the 0.7 per cent target reaffirmed in the Monterrey Consensus of 
the International Conference on Financing for Development. 
</p>
<p>22. The independent expert concluded by underlining the importance: (a) of consistency 
among trade, aid and debt policies, and that debt relief initiatives be accompanied by 
concessional aid; (b) that debt relief for poverty reduction be specific to country situations and 
not undermine the enjoyment of human rights by the poor in low-income countries; and (c) of 
the promotion of transparency and the participation of civil society and the poor in debt relief 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>23. Following the independent expert&#8217;s presentation, the Chairperson-Rapporteur announced 
that the speaker to follow, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Planning and International 
Cooperation of Jordan, Nasser Shraideh, was unable to attend the Social Forum and that his 
statement would be read out by a representative of the Permanent Mission of Jordan to the 
United Nations Office in Geneva. Mr. Shraideh&#8217;s statement focused on the direct and indirect 
impact of external debt on poverty. He explained that a large foreign debt can directly reduce 
Government resources available for the poor. High indebtedness can also indirectly increase 
poverty because it undermines economic growth by increasing uncertainty and reducing 
expenditure on economic infrastructure. It could also scare away foreign direct investment, 
which is important for economic growth. His statement also provided information, facts and 
figures on the efforts of the Government of Jordan to reduce its foreign debt. 
</p>
<p><b>The role and responsibility of the State in poverty eradication 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Permanent Representative of the People&#8217;s Republic of China to the United Nations 
Office in Geneva, Li Baodong, spoke about the role and responsibility of the State in poverty 
eradication. Observing that poverty is caused by social and historic factors, he emphasized that 
promoting human rights was an essential component for eradicating poverty. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>25. Mr. Li Baodong described efforts and strategies undertaken by the Government of China to 
eliminate poverty, and emphasized that, by promoting the right to self-sufficiency and 
development in China, poverty levels had been reduced and the Millennium Development Goals 
of halving poverty by 2015 had been achieved ahead of schedule. He explained that his State&#8217;s 
success was essentially due to the implementation of a nationally-owned development strategy 
that was people-centred and suited to its national context. He encouraged South-South 
cooperation in eradicating poverty and stressed that, in pursuing the elimination of poverty, 
countries should be allowed to follow their own path, taking into account the local context. 
</p>
<p><b>International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>26. The topic of international assistance and cooperation was addressed in a presentation by 
the Secretary of State of the National Solidarity Fund of Tunisia, Omar Ben Mahmoud. He 
described the activities and successful experiences of the Fund with regard to poverty alleviation 
in isolated and rural areas. The Fund is supported by voluntary contributions from the public and 
finances, such as housing, companies, schools and health centres. The initiative, complementing 
other governmental poverty reduction strategies, has resulted in a considerable reduction of the 
poverty level in the country. It has attracted international interest and is now being replicated in 
other countries. 
</p>
<p>27. Following the above presentations, the Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the floor and 
invited the participants to an interactive debate on the topics covered by the presentations. 
Interventions were made by representatives of Algeria, Brazil, Cuba, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic 
Republic of), Malaysia, Pakistan (on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference), 
South Africa, the Syrian Arab Republic, Turkey and Yemen, as well as of the Human Rights 
Council Advisory Committee, the International Labour Office (ILO) and North-South XXI. 
</p>
<p>28. There was general agreement that extreme poverty is both the cause and result of human 
rights violations and should be addressed with a multifaceted approach requiring short, medium 
and long-term action. It was stated that international human rights norms must be integrated into 
national poverty reduction plans and reflected in the international trade norms and regulations of 
international financial institutions in order to create a just and equitable international economic 
order. The importance of an open, equitable and non-discriminatory international trading system 
was underlined by several participants. 
</p>
<p>29. The majority of speakers also welcomed the decision of the Council to preserve the Social 
Forum as a unique space for interactive dialogue between the United Nations human rights 
machinery and various stakeholders, including grass-roots organizations. 
</p>
<p>30. Furthermore, a human rights-based approach to poverty, developed and pursued by the 
United Nations system, should rely on all relevant instruments, including ILO standards. The 
human rights content of relevant ILO instruments are particularly evident, especially those 
instruments concerning workers&#8217; rights, discrimination, child labour and forced labour. The 
linkage between international labour standards and the realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights was also highlighted. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to the definition of poverty, attention was drawn to the fact that often the 
terms &#8220;poverty&#8221; and &#8220;extreme poverty&#8221; are used interchangeably and that this should be 
avoided by the Social Forum. Similarly, the need to make a clear distinction between material 
and non-material poverty was emphasized. Measuring poverty by the index of a dollar per day 
was found to be misleading as the diversity of poverty in different countries cannot be reduced to 
a universal figure. 
</p>
<p>32. Commenting on the globalization process, a number of representatives highlighted its 
negative aspects and effect on poverty, and concurred with the view that the efficiency gains of 
globalization should be accompanied by social justice. It was stated that, while Governments 
have the primary responsibility for the implementation of national policies for poverty 
eradication, the implementation of such policies is often intertwined with a multitude of factors 
operating at the international level. Domestic efforts to combat poverty must be complemented 
by a conducive and supportive international framework and cooperation. In this context, the role 
of international assistance and cooperation was highlighted as a crucial factor in poverty 
eradication, whereas regrets were expressed for the difficulties of the majority of developed 
countries in meeting the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of their GDP to ODA. 
</p>
<p>33. In the view of some speakers, the causes of extreme poverty include lack of good 
governance and corruption at the national level, while others referred to foreign occupation, 
unilateral coercive measures and sanctions, which directly affect the social, economic and 
political development of independent and sovereign States, and pose additional obstacles to the 
full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under their jurisdiction. 
</p><p>34. Many interventions brought examples of best practices drawn from a variety of social 
programmes or social security schemes implemented at the national level, and shared 
information on the challenges and successes of national efforts to combat poverty. At the 
international level, specific measures to contribute to the global fight against poverty included, 
for instance, the draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights, the campaign 
&#8220;Action against hunger and poverty&#8221; and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
fund to combat poverty. In this respect, it was stressed that the fight against poverty from a 
human rights perspective should remain a key priority of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b>International trade policies and poverty 
</b></p>
<p>35. Addressing the topic of international trade policies and poverty, Jean-Pierre Lehmann, 
Professor of International Political Economy, IMD and Founding Director of the Evian Group, 
began his presentation by stating that trade per se would not reduce poverty and that 
organizations such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the 
World Bank had paid a disservice in suggesting that trade barriers and subsidies had contributed 
to poverty. While it is true that the reduction of subsidies in Europe and the United States 
of America will greatly benefit the poor in the developing world, he emphasized that the real 
problem of poverty is at the domestic level. In his opinion, adequate domestic conditions, such as 
good governance, human capital formation, entrepreneurship and macroeconomic stability are 
more important to poverty reduction than trade. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Singapore were mentioned as positive examples that have shown how to reduce poverty through 
human capital development and macroeconomic stability. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>36. Aileen Kwa, Programme Coordinator of the Trade and Development Programme, 
South Centre, maintained that most countries have been advised to become more integrated with 
the global economy through exports, which led to deepening poverty in the least developed 
countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, in spite of increasing worldwide economic growth 
and trade. She shared statistics on the agriculture and manufacturing sectors in a number of 
countries to show how imports have surged, resulting in serious drops in production, cuts in 
employment and reduction in household incomes. Since an exports-based economic policy is not 
sustainable in the long term for all countries and causes domestic markets to shrink, she 
advocated the re-agriculturalization and re-industrialization of countries and regions, while 
reviewing the fundamentals of the trade system in order to place human rights at the centre of 
trade liberalization obligations. 
</p>
<p>37. In his presentation, David Luke, Senior Trade Adviser and Coordinator of the Trade and 
Human Development Unit, UNDP/Geneva, indicated that globalization has resulted, on the one 
hand, in technological progress, economic and financial integration and higher productivity, and 
on the other, in widening income inequality across and within countries. He explained the 
activities and priorities of UNDP in the area of trade and development, and stressed that it had 
assumed a stronger analytical and substantive role since the 1990s. 
</p>
<p>38. The Chairperson-Rapporteur then invited the participants to an interactive debate. 
Statements were made by representatives of Barbados, Mexico, the Syrian Arab Republic and 
Yemen. It was recognized that trade as such does not directly mitigate poverty as there is no 
assurance that trade-generated wealth will have an impact on the poor. It was also noted that 
international trade has a role to play and that, in that sense, the Doha round was a step in 
attempting to reduce poverty. It was also emphasized that the realities and history of developing 
countries must be taken into consideration in the design of trade policies and agreements. Calls 
were made for the Social Forum to recommend the continuation of negotiations at WTO to 
conclude an agreement that will contribute to the alleviation of poverty, particularly in the least 
developed countries. 
</p>
<p><b>The role of civil society in the eradication of poverty at the grass-roots level 
</b></p>
<p>39. Ingrid Srinath, Secretary-General of CIVICUS, commented that State policies that exclude 
the marginalized segment of society from the enjoyment of its rights are often the cause of 
poverty. In her view, civil society exists as an amplifier of marginalized voices. She identified 
participatory governance as the solution to most of the issues that had been raised during the 
Social Forum, including poverty. Policies informed by the needs of the most affected and 
marginalized segments of the society ensure equitable and effective implementation. At the same 
time, the speaker expressed concern about draft laws in a number of countries that would restrict 
the freedom of civil society and therefore affect their action and efforts aimed at poverty 
reduction and elimination.  
</p>
<p>40. Ms. Perez de Perez and Mr. Genin, both representing ATD Quart Monde, described in 
detail the work of ATD Quart Monde with poor communities in the Central African Republic 
and Guatemala. Their experience with these communities demonstrated that people living in 
extreme poverty are always the first to act to transform their lives, and therefore they must be 
encouraged to participate fully in local and national strategies for eliminating poverty. Civil </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>society has a role to play in helping to build bridges between people living in extreme poverty 
and other segments of the society, particularly national and local authorities and public services 
in appropriate forums and dialogue. 
</p>
<p>41. The Chairperson-Rapporteur then opened the floor to participants. Representatives of 
Franciscans International, the International Council for Women, Atlas and the Union nationale 
de la femme tunisienne made statements on the theme at discussion. It was stated that civil 
society had been undertaking a great deal of work to combat extreme poverty; a specific example 
of the work of an organization in India was provided. References were made to the effect of 
poverty on women, and it was argued that women are disproportionately affected by poverty 
owing to structural inequalities. Speakers supported the view that strategies to eradicate poverty 
should not be generalized; they should take into account the gender dimension of poverty.  
</p>
<p><b>The role and social responsibility of transnational corporations in poverty eradication 
</b></p>
<p>42. Filippo Veglio, Business Solutions Leader of the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development pointed out that the business sector is part of the solution to development 
challenges. He presented several case studies of companies carrying out projects in developing 
countries involving and benefiting low-income sectors and promoting sustainable and inclusive 
business activities with partners from the development community and civil society. It is crucial 
that the role of business is viewed beyond the provision of resources and reflected as such in the 
debate on development cooperation. Business should be brought to the table as a key enabler of 
social and economic progress and as a key stakeholder in efforts to achieve sustainable 
development.  
</p>
<p>43. Gerald Pachoud, Special Adviser to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, believed 
that the private sector can contribute to poverty alleviation, since business is a major source of 
investment and job creation. The private sector can generate growth and increase demand for 
rule of law, thus creating conditions conducive to human rights and breaking the cycle of 
poverty. He also acknowledged the negative impact of the business sector on human rights, and 
identified as a solution to ease the impact, the tripartite framework of business and human rights, 
namely the State&#8217;s duty to protect human rights and remedy in case of violations, and the duty of 
business to respect all human rights at all times.  
</p>
<p>44. The Chairperson-Rapporteur emphasized that the topic under discussion was important and 
posed a dilemma for the international community, requiring further reflection and examination 
by the United Nations. He then opened the floor for comments and questions from participants. 
Statements were made by representatives of South Africa and the Syrian Arab Republic, as well 
as the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>45. Concern was expressed for the duty of the State to protect against abuses of transnational 
corporations. It was stated that there were a number of States that could not realistically control 
corporations, because, at times they have more resources than the State itself. Moreover, it was 
claimed that, with regard to multinationals, there are no clear rules on the responsibilities and 
areas needing protection by States. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. It was further emphasized that economic growth and the creation of employment are 
important to the reduction of poverty, but certainly not sufficient. People living in poverty do not 
often benefit from national growth, and they subsist with work that is ill-paid. The fight against 
poverty needs a multifaceted approach, not solely from the side of the companies. 
</p>
<p>47. It was also noted that an existing United Nations initiative, the Global Compact, aims at 
reinforcing the link between human rights, combating poverty and corporate social 
responsibility. Nevertheless, there is a need for the Global Compact to act with more tangible 
and realistic initiatives to move it out from the realm of theoretical discourse.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Social dimension of the globalization process 
</b></p>
<p><b>Decent and favourable work conditions 
</b></p>
<p>48. Focusing on the social impact of globalization, Raymond Torres, Director of the 
International Institute for Labour Studies, ILO, explained that globalization in the form of free 
trade and foreign direct investment had brought about new growth and job creation; yet, the 
benefits have been unequally shared both across countries and within them. Real wages have 
grown moderately and the labour market is more unstable. Financial globalization has further 
exacerbated labour market instability, as will be shown in the forthcoming ILO World of Work 
Report. In this context, attention was drawn to a comprehensive policy package developed by 
ILO, the Decent Work Agenda, and its four components: promotion of employment; social 
protection; fundamental principles and rights at work; and social dialogue. The Decent Work 
Agenda is complemented by two recent ILO initiatives: the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work and its follow-up, and the 2008 Declaration on Social Justice for a 
Fair Globalization and its follow-up. 
</p>
<p>49. According to Brent Wilton, Deputy Secretary-General of the International Organization of 
Employers, business and employers welcome globalization. While globalization is evidently 
concerned with multinationals, it predominantly affects small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
The vast majority of enterprises remain nationally based, and tend to be small and medium-sized. 
They are fragile in terms of access to financing, management skills, employee skills and access 
to markets. Mr. Wilton emphasized that Governments should assist small- and medium-sized 
enterprises to benefit from globalization. Most importantly, Governments should engage the 
private sector and encourage the creation of businesses and entrepreneurship. In conclusion, he 
urged States to support and implement the 1998 ILO Declaration of Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work and the 2008 Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization, which was 
unanimously adopted by all States members of ILO and has the potential to make ILO more 
responsive to the needs of Member States.  
</p>
<p>50. In her presentation, Anna Biondi, Director of the International Trade Union Confederation, 
Geneva Office, also made reference to the 2008 ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair 
Globalization and commented that, with regard to labour issues, the Declaration would help 
shape the globalization process. She welcomed economic and employment growth, but cautioned 
that it could come at the expense of neglecting workers&#8217; rights, particularly those of women 
workers, hence the need for instituting reality checks. She further called for the real application 
of labour legislation, particularly in terms of freedom of association and collective bargaining, 
and recalled that this had been previously recognized by the employers&#8217; organization.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. The Chairperson-Rapporteur then opened the interactive dialogue. Statements were made 
by representatives of Belgium, Chile, Ecuador, Italy, Peru and Ukraine, as well as the 
Association universelle d&#8217;esperanto. 
</p>
<p>52. It was noted that trade agreements have led to important economic success for a number of 
countries, though at times disregarding workers&#8217; rights. Globalization has weakened the 
collective bargaining power of workers as compared to the situation in the 1980s, and in certain 
situations has resulted in a worsening of labour conditions. There is a false expectation that 
economic growth will automatically increase work supply. Concerns were expressed for the 
situation of migrant workers not enjoying decent work conditions, particularly in the informal 
economy, where labour standards are not enforced.  
</p>
<p>53. The Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization was considered a landmark 
document in that it reaffirms links between economic and social development, sets fundamental 
commitments for ILO and Member States, and brings an innovative element into the trade labour 
nexus, namely that the violation of fundamental principles and rights at work cannot be invoked 
or otherwise used as a legitimate comparative advantage. The effective implementation of the 
Declaration remains a challenge. Views were expressed in support of incorporating the decent 
work programme of ILO into the agenda of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>Good governance and corruption 
</b></p>
<p>54. Nadia Balgobin, board member of Transparency International, Switzerland, stated that 
corruption is a major cause of poverty and an obstacle to development. Transparency 
International has developed the concept of an advocacy and legal advice centre, which helps the 
poor to address corruption and claim their rights through (a) receiving complaints; (b) providing 
legal advice; (c) advocacy; and (d) capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>55. Sharing his experience from a small village in South Africa, Derek Luyt, Head of Media 
and Advocacy at the Public Service Accountability Monitor, stated that a major obstacle to 
poverty alleviation in South Africa is poor governance, which includes not simply corruption, 
but also poor performance of Government officials in their management of public resources and 
a lack of political will to act against underperforming officials. To combat this, accountability 
monitoring by civil society is most important; the independence of civil society organizations 
allows them to conduct more effective accountability monitoring of State governance, as well as 
more independent advocacy around accountability issues. Governments at all levels, especially at 
the provincial and local levels, needs to be held accountable for efficient and effective planning 
and budgeting, programme implementation, and oversight and corrective action. The speaker 
recommended that accountability needs to be part of good governance and that civil society 
organizations need to be progressively empowered in order to hold Governments accountable. 
</p>
<p>56. Recalling that the Social Forum refers to poverty as cause and consequence of human 
rights violations, Nohay El-Mikawy, Policy Adviser of Governance and Poverty at the UNDP 
Oslo Governance Centre, stated that the democratic governance pillars of UNDP seek to address 
this by working on inclusive participation of rights holders as well as responsive delivery of 
equitable policies and services by duty bearers. She emphasized that the democratic governance 
group, the Bureau for Development Policy, approaches governance and poverty reduction as two </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>sides of the same coin, and provided examples of tools and programmes of the Oslo Governance 
Centre, relating to (a) nationally owned governance assessments that are disaggregated to capture 
the experience of the vulnerable and marginalized and embedded in development processes; and 
(b) knowledge-sharing from the field and partnership-building for capacity development in 
cross-cutting issues, such as land governance and the equitable governance of services and 
Millennium Development Goals sectors. 
</p>
<p>57. The Chairperson-Rapporteur invited the participants to an interactive dialogue on the 
above presentations. The representatives of Bangladesh and the Syrian Arab Republic, as well as 
North-South XXI, made statements, as did the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the independent expert on the question of human 
rights and extreme poverty. It was reaffirmed that corruption had a disproportionate impact on 
poor people, for example, by increasing the cost and decreasing the quality of public services on 
which people living in poverty depend. A human rights-based approach would greatly benefit the 
fight against corruption by adding its central elements, such as access to information, 
accountability and empowerment. 
</p>
<p>58. It was also noted that the traditional focus on anti-corruption had been entirely on the 
national Government in developing countries, the corrupted but not corrupters. The latter are 
often hidden in financial centres, transnational corporations, intermediary lawyers and consultant 
services. It was stated that, in certain situations, bribes paid by transnational corporations could 
amount to more than the official development aid given to certain developing countries. 
Consequently, it was stressed that accountability for corruption at the international level is as 
necessary as at the national level. Adequate laws, institutions, administrative procedures, 
Ombudsmen, national human rights institutions and parliamentary scrutiny of public officials are 
essential to eradicate an environment that fosters corruption. 
</p>
<p><b>Access to affordable essential drugs and health care 
</b></p>
<p>59. Richard Laing, a medical officer at Policy, Access and Rational Use, Medicine Policy and 
Standards of the World Health Organization (WHO) made reference to the right to health and 
stated that one way to measure the enjoyment of this right was through the analysis of access to 
medicines. He noted that, in order to improve the availability and affordability of essential 
medicines, it is necessary to have reliable evidence on medicine prices, availability, affordability 
and price components. He commented on a survey tool developed by WHO and Health Action 
International that facilitates data collection and analysis and provides a standard method that has 
been used in more than 50 surveys in all regions of the world. The results have exposed many 
instances of poor access to medicines including cases of unaffordable medicines for chronic 
diseases, deficit of important medicines to patients at the local level, Governments not passing 
on low procurement prices to their citizens, excessive mark-ups in the private sector and taxes 
and duties being applied to essential medicines. 
</p>
<p>60. Margaret Ewen of Health Action International highlighted that it was essential that surveys 
have an impact on policies. She provided several positive examples of policy changes following 
medicine price and availability surveys. There are multiple policy options to reduce the price of 
medicines, such as improving procurement efficiency (national pooled purchasing, procurement 
by generic name), ensuring adequate, equitable and sustainable financing (health insurance </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>systems that cover essential medicines), and particularly by promoting the use of generic drugs. 
She also stated that the current challenge is to determine the most effective policy actions in a 
different context which, in her view, requires examination of country experiences. 
</p>
<p>61. The Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the floor to participants for the interactive dialogue. 
Representatives from Brazil, Chile and Malaysia and the Association of World Citizens and 
People&#8217;s Health Movement made statements. 
</p>
<p>62. The issue of access to essential medicine and health care should be discussed in tandem 
with such issues as the need for affordable technology, international cooperation and intellectual 
property rights in particular. It was pointed out that intellectual property rights are a barrier to 
access to essential drugs, especially for developing countries, since research and development is 
expensive and requires considerable investment. Intellectual property rights raise the final price 
of medicines, particularly in developing countries. At the same time, essential medicines, with 
the exception of anti-retroviral drugs, are in general off-patent, hence there is no real intellectual 
property barrier. In this context, support was expressed for wider dissemination of generic 
versions of essential medicines. Another speaker highlighted the urgent need to move beyond 
treating symptoms to address underlying structural determinants of health, for example, access to 
clean water. Speakers recalled the importance of the 1978 Declaration of Alma Ata on primary 
health care, which remains an objective still far from realization.  
<b>Climate change 
</b></p>
<p>63. Theodor Rathgeber of the German Forum on Human Rights identified the negative effects 
of climate change, particularly the resulting forced migration and the threat to food and water 
security. He also stressed that climate change has a disproportionate impact on the poorest 
regions because they are least able to adjust to new conditions. Providing a number of examples 
of how different communities around the world perceive the changes, the speaker observed that, 
from the viewpoint of a grass-roots approach, a major problem seemed to be the lack of 
involvement of local people in decision-making processes and in the design and implementation 
of initiatives to address climate change at the national, regional and international levels.  
</p>
<p>64. Tomas Alarcon, President of the Comisi&#243;n Jur&#237;dica para el Autodesarrollo de los Pueblos 
Originarios Andinos stated that, in his Andean region, water is diverted from the Andes to the 
cities for mining operations and industrialization, which negatively affects the overall ecosystem 
and sustenance of Amazonian biodiversity. In this context, he stressed the effective 
implementation of relevant international conventions, such as ILO Convention 169 and the 
Convention on Biological Diversity, particularly with regard to respect for traditional methods 
and knowledge, and obligations to obtain prior consent of local communities prior to any action 
affecting their livelihood. He also called for the creation of a mechanism for international 
monitoring of such implementation and for decriminalization of the de facto persecution of local 
movement and activities against action affecting climate change. 
</p>
<p>65. Ismail Elgizouli of the Programme on Climate of the High Council for Environment, 
Sudan, referred to the particular vulnerability of the Sudan to the effects of climate change 
because of the fragile ecosystem, weak infrastructure and economy, and the fact that 70 per cent 
of the country is reliant on climate-dependent resources for livelihood. The sectors affected by </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>climate change include the water sector, agriculture and natural resources, biodiversity, health 
(vector and epidemic diseases), the industrial economy, and political geography leading to 
conflict over natural resources. Mr. Elgizouli pointed out that the combination of decades of 
drought, desertification and overpopulation was among the causes of the conflict in Darfur, 
because the nomads searching for water had to take their livestock further south to land mainly 
occupied by farming communities.  
</p>
<p>66. The Chairperson-Rapporteur then opened the floor to participants. A representative from 
the Sudan made a statement, as did representatives from the Commission for Legal Aid to 
Andean and Amazonian People for Development, the International Council on Human Rights 
Policy and the International Organization for Migration.  
</p>
<p>67. Reference was made to Council resolution 7/23 on the link between climate change and 
human rights. There was a suggestion that an international monitoring system for water 
resources be established. Speakers pointed out the need for continued open debate on human 
rights and climate change at all relevant forums, including the future sessions of the 
Social Forum. 
</p>
<p>68. With regard to migration, it was stated that migration in relation to climate change is not 
only a failure to adapt, but an adaptation in itself. Migration is motivated for different reasons, 
one being climate change. Migrants should be regarded as agents of change, not just victims. 
There is a need to develop a legal framework and apply a rights-based approach to migration to 
improve the situation of migrants. It was emphasized that, despite the fact that migration 
transcends borders, responses to deal with migration are regulated by borders; increased 
cooperation between States is therefore essential.  
</p>
<p><b>Food security, the food crisis and the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>69. Manzoor Ahmad, Director of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
Liaison Office in Geneva focused his presentation on the food crisis, with particular emphasis on 
its relationships to poverty and globalization. He noted that, while globalization seems to have 
reduced overall poverty levels, it has not reduced extreme poverty, and has not helped the fight 
against hunger, because globalization has acted perversely in agriculture. Huge subsidies in 
developed countries that provide them with an unfair advantage, a decrease in aid for agriculture 
and the non-existence of adjustment policies for farmers suffering the adverse effects of 
globalization are but some of the reasons for the increase in hunger globally.  
</p>
<p>70. Mr. Ahmad emphasized the need for short- and long-term policies to tackle the food crisis. 
Urgent action is required to meet the immediate needs, for example, by improving access of the 
vulnerable to emergency food assistance, nutrition interventions and other social safety nets, 
boosting smallholder farmer food production and adjusting trade and taxation policies to support 
immediate food availability. For long-term policies, Mr. Ahmad suggested sustaining growth in 
food availability through smallholder-led production, increasing coverage and efficiency of 
social protection systems, and strengthening food security risk management. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier de Schutter, referred to the current 
food crisis and highlighted the benefits of incorporating a human rights-based approach to the 
efforts to address the crisis. He identified some of the causes of the current food crisis and two </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>risks the international community is running in its reaction to the causes and the crisis: a focus on 
levels of prices exclusively, and a focus solely on overall levels of production in agriculture. He 
believed that a human rights approach would help avoid falling into these traps. The role of good 
governance, highlighted as an important element, has been ignored in efforts to address the crises 
so far. The Secretary-General was very reactive by setting up a high-level task force on the issue, 
however, the right to food was not taken into account sufficiently in the prescriptions for its 
work.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur further stated that human rights can guide the response to the crisis 
and policy development at two levels: they can encourage Governments to ensure adequate 
mapping of insecurity and vulnerability, and hence ensure targeted responses to the people most 
at risk and better monitoring and accountability by providing remedy mechanisms to victims. At 
another level, a human rights approach can encourage other forms of international cooperation, 
for example by establishing a global reinsurance fund to allow Governments to finance 
intervention funds and social safety nets to shield the population from negative effects. He 
concluded by emphasizing once more the role of human rights. He stated that the food crisis is 
not just a matter for technocrats, in terms of increasing the overall level of production; it is a 
human rights issue in terms of understanding who benefits and who loses out.  
</p>
<p>73. Christian Courtis, Legal Officer for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the 
International Commission of Jurists supported the added value of applying a human rights 
approach to the food crisis. Human rights provide a number of procedural safeguards or checks: 
for instance, if processes are participatory and transparent, if there is access to remedy and 
information, and if accountability of the Government is ensured. However, he recognized that 
the most difficult task is to frame substantive rather than procedural issues regarding human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>74. Mr. Courtis further explained that distribution of food and natural resources are 
encompassed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There are 
core obligations and minimum targets that should be addressed, including the focus on those 
living in conditions of food insecurity.  
</p>
<p>75. Following the above presentations, the Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the floor for 
interactive debate. Speakers included representatives of Algeria, Brazil, Chile, France, the Syrian 
Arab Republic, Viet Nam and Yemen, as well as the organization ATLAS. Jos&#233; Bengoa, a 
member of the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee and the Deputy Chairperson of the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also took the floor.  
</p>
<p>76. It was stated that the food crisis is complex, and a combination of various factors have 
caused it, including high oil prices, a decline in crop yields owing to climate change, increased 
freight costs, speculation and the rise in food consumption in developing countries. It was also 
mentioned that the crisis reveals a problem in the distribution and purchasing power of food 
rather than in its production. A view was expressed arguing that the issue of biofuels should be 
disassociated from the food crisis. It was explained that, when biofuels are produced in a 
balanced manner to meet the needs of each country, it can be an important means of production 
beneficial to grass-roots communities.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>77. Protecting the interests of farmers was highlighted as central to the mitigation of the food 
crisis. Farmers are currently threatened by an increase in the price of seeds and means of 
production. The need for policies to improve the position of small farmers and the production 
levels of the agricultural sector was also emphasized. In this connection, guaranteeing land rights 
was also seen as a key to promoting farmers&#8217; rights. It was also stated that more attention should 
be given to the impact of intellectual property rights on agriculture, the food crisis and exploring 
innovative ways to alleviate hunger. 
</p>
<p>78. There were calls for urgent measures by the international community to avoid a situation 
wherein whole regions of the world are deprived of food and others are plunged into violence. 
Reference was made to a number of successful national strategies to combat hunger as well as 
international initiatives, such as the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and 
Poverty of 20 September 2004. Also, there were expressions of appreciation for the efforts of the 
Human Rights Council regarding food security. Reference was made to the prominent role 
played by the Council in the current food crisis by convening a special session to discuss the 
matter and at which it adopted resolution S-7/1 on the negative impact of the worsening of the 
world food crisis on the realization of the right to food for all. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Interactive debate with relevant thematic procedures  
mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Social Forum devoted a segment of its session to an interactive debate with thematic 
procedures mandate-holders of the Council, namely the independent expert on the question of 
human rights and extreme poverty, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the 
independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial 
obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>80. In inviting the participants to the debate, the Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled the four 
areas of discussion he had proposed in his statement at the opening of the Forum (see 
paragraph 10 above). He proposed that the interventions focus on those areas and be made with 
the view of contributing to the formulation of recommendations and conclusions of the 
discussions, held during the three-day meeting, and that themes for the 2009 Social Forum be 
suggested. 
</p>
<p>81. Cuba, France, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Thailand, as well as the 
Association of World Citizens, Association universelle d&#8217;esperanto, ATD Quart Monde, 
Franciscans International and the International Federation of Social Workers participated in and 
made interventions at the debate. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND  
THEMES FOR THE 2009 SOCIAL FORUM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>82. The conclusions below are based on presentations and statements made during the 
interactive debate.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>83. The 2008 Social Forum welcomed the decision of the Human Rights Council to preserve 
the Social Forum as a unique space for interactive dialogue between the United Nations human 
rights machinery and various stakeholders, including grass-roots organizations. 
</p>
<p>84. The Social Forum should be open to all stakeholders, particularly grass-roots organizations, 
and efforts should be made to bring to future sessions of the Forum representatives from a 
broader range of stakeholders, in particular from developing countries and including those living 
in poverty, particularly women. Civil society organizations are recognized as amplifiers of the 
voice of the poor. 
</p>
<p>85. The Social Forum is considered ideally placed to identify best practices and to promote the 
incorporation of a human rights approach into poverty reduction. 
</p>
<p>86. There was prevailing agreement that poverty and human rights are linked in at least 
three ways: (a) poverty can be both a cause and consequence of human rights violations; (b) the 
realization of all human rights and efforts to eliminate extreme poverty are mutually reinforcing; 
and (c) human rights norms and principles provide the framework for poverty reduction and/or 
eradication. In this respect, it was stressed that the fight against poverty from a human rights 
perspective should remain a priority of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>87. A multifaceted human rights-based approach was considered paramount to poverty 
reduction. Participation of the poor, accountability and access to remedies were highlighted as 
the most important added values of the human rights-based approach to poverty reduction 
strategies. 
</p>
<p>88. Participation of the poor is considered vital in the design and implementation of strategies 
and programmes aimed at poverty reduction. The Social Forum provides the opportunity to 
exchange good practices with a participatory approach to development policymaking. 
</p>
<p>89. International assistance and cooperation play a fundamental role in poverty eradication. In 
this context, it is regrettable to note the difficulties of the majority of developed countries in 
meeting the target reaffirmed in the Monterrey Consensus of allocating 0.7 per cent of their GDP 
to ODA. 
</p>
<p>90. While it was recognized that trade as such does not directly mitigate poverty and that there 
is no assurance that trade-generated wealth will have an impact on the poor, it was also noted 
that international trade has the potential of reducing poverty levels. The importance of an open, 
equitable and non-discriminatory international trading system was highlighted. 
</p>
<p>91. The role of the private sector in poverty eradication was recognized as an enabler of social 
and economic progress since business is a major source of investment and job creation. 
However, attention was also drawn to the negative impact of the business sector on human rights 
and to the fact that economic growth and the creation of employment are but contributing factors 
to the reduction of poverty.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>92. Corruption was repeatedly referred to as a critical issue in poverty and human rights. 
Corruption is a major cause of poverty, an obstacle to development, impairs the enjoyment of 
all human rights and affects the rights of the poor disproportionately. A human rights-based 
approach would greatly benefit the fight against corruption by adding its central elements, 
including access to information, accountability and empowerment. Good governance and 
anti-corruption efforts are therefore essential in combating poverty.  
</p>
<p>93. The food crisis is a complex issue caused by a combination of factors, including high oil 
prices, reduction in crop yields caused by climate change, increased freight costs, speculation 
and the rise in food consumption in developing countries. It was agreed that the crisis reflects a 
problem in the distribution and purchasing power of food rather than in production. Protecting 
the interests of farmers and guaranteeing land rights was highlighted as central to the mitigation 
of the food crisis.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Participants to the 2008 Social Forum proposed recommendations for consideration 
and action by the Human Rights Council which are summarized below.</b> 
</p>
<p>95. <b>It is essential to ensure a larger participation of grass-roots organizations as well as 
those living in poverty, particularly women, in future sessions of the Social Forum, 
particularly from developing countries. To this end, the Human Rights Council could set 
up a voluntary United Nations fund to provide resources to these organizations so that they 
can participate in and contribute to the deliberations of future forums.</b> 
</p>
<p>96. <b>The Social Forum should function as an instrument for dialogue and as a think tank 
on a human rights-based approach to poverty reduction. It should also promote better 
interaction between developed and developing countries, particularly through concerted 
efforts to achieve poverty reduction. In this respect, the fight against poverty from a 
human rights perspective should remain a priority of OHCHR.</b>  
</p>
<p>97. <b>The Social Forum should have a focused discussion on topics which are better 
defined. The themes to be assigned for future sessions of the Social Forum should be 
narrower in scope. The Social Forum should continue to focus on discrimination as both a 
cause and a consequence of poverty.</b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>The role of the universal periodic review mechanism was highlighted as a useful tool 
to monitor poverty reduction strategies. The Social Forum recommends that the 
implementation of poverty reduction policies at the national level be monitored through the 
mechanism.</b> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>Emphasis was placed on the shared responsibility of all Member States in 
international cooperation and assistance aimed at poverty reduction. In this respect, the 
Human Rights Council should urge the concerned States to increase their ODA and to 
establish adequate mechanisms to ensure that assistance reaches the most poor and is 
implemented in accordance with the principles of transparency and accountability.</b>  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>100. <b>Governance indicators should be included in poverty reduction programmes. There is 
a need to develop indicators for the next Social Forum, which could serve as a point of 
reference for dialogue and on the basis of which concrete results can be achieved.</b> 
</p>
<p>101. <b>The private sector is regarded as an enabler of social and economic progress, but it 
can also have a negative impact on human rights and development. The role of the private 
sector in poverty eradication should be taken up with more attention and depth by the 
United Nations. </b> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>The Council could incorporate into its agenda consideration of the ILO decent work 
programme. </b>  
</p>
<p>103. <b>Corruption is considered one of the main causes of poverty and violations of human 
rights. The Council should make efforts to advance a human rights-based approach to the 
global fight against corruption. The Council should call on States to abide by international 
conventions against corruption, such as the United Nations conventions against corruption 
and the African Union convention on corruption, so that they are transposed into national 
laws.</b> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>The Council should call on States to advance work on the draft guiding principles on 
extreme poverty and human rights and encourage active participation by all stakeholders 
in related future events. </b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Possible themes for the 2009 Social Forum 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The following themes were proposed by Member States and other participants for 
consideration by the 2009 Social Forum:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) National anti-poverty programmes: best practices of States from different 
regions in implementing social security programmes from a human rights perspective; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Accountability mechanisms: in-depth discussion and sharing of experiences and 
best practices on accountability mechanisms, including through monitoring based on 
indicators; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Discrimination and social exclusion, including the economic, social and cultural 
rights of persons with disabilities; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Participation and empowerment of the poor and best practices at all levels; 
 (e) International assistance and cooperation in combating poverty, including the 
obligations of international institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Armed conflict, foreign occupation and unilateral coercive measures, such as 
sanctions imposed by certain States in contradiction with the Charter of the United Nations, 
as causes of poverty and violations of human rights; </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (g) The human rights perspective of good governance in poverty reduction 
programmes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) The gap between policies promoted at the macrolevel and the reality of those 
living at the microlevel; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Anti-corruption initiatives: best practices of States from different regions in 
implementing anti-corruption programmes from a human rights perspective; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Migrants: first-, second- and third-generation migrants and their fight against 
poverty. </b></p>
