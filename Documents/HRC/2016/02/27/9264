<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In the second half of 2007, five international multi-stakeholder consultations were 
convened to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises in developing a conceptual 
and policy framework to anchor the business and human rights debate and to help guide all 
relevant actors. 
</p>
<p> The consultations addressed the following issues: (a) the role of States in effectively 
regulating and adjudicating the activities of corporations with respect to human rights; 
(b) business and human rights in conflict zones: the role of home States; (c) the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights; (d) accountability mechanisms for resolving 
corporate-related human rights complaints and disputes; and (e) improving the human rights 
performance of business through multi-stakeholder initiatives. Each of the consultations was 
co-convened with a non-governmental organization. 
</p>
<p> Summaries of all four workshops and lists of participants are available on the Special 
Representative&#8217;s website. The present addendum to the 2008 report of the Special Representative 
combines the summaries of the five consultations. 
</p>
<p> During the consultation on the role of States in effectively regulating and adjudicating the 
activities of corporations with respect to human rights, participants considered issues in relation 
to subparagraph 1 (b) of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/69, in which the 
Commission requested the Special Representative to elaborate on the role of States in effectively 
regulating and adjudicating the role of transnational corporations and other business enterprises 
with regard to human rights, including through international cooperation. 
</p>
<p> The main goal of the consultation was to generate ideas concerning the legal and policy 
dimensions of home and host State duties; to that end, seven main topics were considered: (a) the 
meaning, sources and scope of the State duty to protect; (b) balancing economic policy with 
human rights concerns; (c) investment policy and human rights; (d) trade policy and human 
rights; (e) State support for corporations operating abroad, including through export credit 
agencies; (f) extraterritorial regulation; and (g) domestic and international policy coherence. 
</p>
<p> There were some recurring themes. First, most participants agreed that States had a duty to 
protect against abuses by corporations within their jurisdiction but that many States either did not 
fully understand or were unwilling to fulfil that duty. Second, there was acknowledgement that, 
while the extraterritorial scope of that duty remained controversial in legal terms, there were 
strong policy grounds for home States to take concrete action to prevent overseas abuse by 
corporations based in their jurisdiction. Third, there was general consensus that domestic policy 
incoherence was a major contributor to the lack of effective action by home and host States alike. 
Finally, there was a sense that both home and host States might worry about being competitively 
disadvantaged if they were too strict on business and that more should be done at the 
international level to address such concerns. 
</p>
<p> The Special Representative concluded by noting the growing recognition that the 
status quo did not provide sufficient guidance to companies and Governments, or sufficient 
protection to individuals and communities. Nevertheless, he stated that the consultation&#8217;s </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p>exploration into highly specific avenues for change had identified multiple ways that States 
could improve corporate respect for rights without threatening economic and development 
opportunities. 
</p>
<p> In an effort to further elaborate on the role of States in regulating and adjudicating 
corporations with regard to human rights, another consultation focused on the actual or potential 
role of home States when &#8220;their&#8221; companies operate in zones of conflict abroad. 
</p>
<p> The consultation addressed three core questions: 
</p>
<p> (a) What, if anything, do home States currently do to prevent or deter human rights 
abuses by their corporations operating in conflict zones? 
</p>
<p> (b) What could home States do to prevent or deter such abuses? 
</p>
<p> (c) How could States deal with wrongdoing by their companies in conflict zones? 
</p>
<p> Participants in the consultation concluded that home States should play a bigger role in 
addressing business and human rights concerns in conflict areas. There was general consensus 
that home State policies and practices in relation to this challenge, where they existed at all, were 
limited, fragmented, mostly unilateral and ad hoc. Many home States also appeared to lag behind 
both international lending institutions and responsible businesses in grappling with these difficult 
issues. Furthermore, many if not most home States were found to appear to assign considerably 
greater weight to promoting exports and foreign investments than to human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p> Participants agreed that home States should exercise at least some degree of due diligence 
before encouraging &#8220;their&#8221; companies to operate in conflict zones. This would include ensuring 
that officials in all Government agencies promoting foreign investments were aware of the 
human rights situation in the conflict zones where an investment is proposed; that those agencies 
provided companies with current, accurate and comprehensive information of the local human 
rights context so that companies could act appropriately, particularly when engaging with local 
parties accused of abuses; and having export credit agencies require adequate human rights due 
diligence before providing loans to companies operating in conflict zones. 
</p>
<p> Both corporate and civil society participants expressed the need for clear and concise 
guidance from home States with regard to what were and were not acceptable practices in 
conflict zones from a human rights perspective. There was also general consensus that a &#8220;red 
flags&#8221; approach - namely, a set of indicators signalling grounds for business and human rights 
concerns, which would also indicate the need for home State engagement - would be an 
important guiding tool. 
</p>
<p><b> </b>The consultation on the corporate responsibility to respect human rights explored the 
conceptual and operational aspects of this responsibility, including the steps that companies 
needed to take to satisfy themselves and their stakeholders that their practices did indeed respect 
human rights. The corporate responsibility to respect human rights in essence means 
non-infringement on the enjoyment of rights - or put simply, &#8220;doing no harm&#8221;. Doing no harm 
may require companies to take positive steps. The responsibility to respect is a universal 
requirement, applicable in all situations. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> In order to contextualize the discussion of the corporate responsibility to respect 
human rights, two recent studies of alleged corporate human rights abuses were presented. The 
first study was conducted by the International Council on Mining and Metals; the second, by the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in support of the Special 
Representative&#8217;s mandate. Both studies showed that companies could and did have an impact on 
the full spectrum of human rights. Efforts by companies to ensure respect for rights should 
reflect this fact. 
</p>
<p> Participants in the consultation went on to address the need for an overarching analytical 
framework that could guide corporate policies and management practices in respecting 
human rights and ensuring that their business operations &#8220;do no harm&#8221;. The concept of due 
diligence was proposed and was found to be a useful starting point for companies as they sought 
to integrate respect for human rights into their practices. 
</p>
<p> Participants then explored the scope and content of the due diligence required of 
companies when discharging their responsibility to respect human rights. Discussion focused on 
the need to adopt and integrate human rights policies throughout the company, and to consider 
the potential implications of company activities by conducting human rights impact assessments. 
Monitoring and auditing processes permitting a company to track ongoing developments were 
also discussed, as was accountability through grievance mechanisms and remediation. 
Participants also explored how concepts such as sphere of influence and corporate complicity 
related to the corporate responsibility to respect rights. 
</p>
<p> The consultation on accountability mechanisms for resolving corporate-related human 
rights complaints and disputes focused on non-judicial grievance mechanisms available to 
individuals or groups affected by corporate activities. It considered grievance mechanisms 
located at the company or project level, at the national level, the level of multi-stakeholder and 
industry initiatives, and the multilateral level. Discussions covered: 
</p>
<p> (a) How existing non-judicial grievance mechanisms could be made more effective and 
how gaps between them could be addressed; 
</p>
<p> (b) What purpose company-level grievance mechanisms could and should serve; 
</p>
<p> (c) What principles should guide the design of grievance mechanisms at the company or 
project level; 
 (d) What institutional innovations might address some of the current deficits. 
</p>
<p> Discussions reflected the importance of involving, where possible, relevant local or 
national Government officials in the handling of major disputes and the benefits of collaborative 
approaches in general. There was debate around the challenge faced by many mechanisms of 
scaling up, while recognizing that mechanisms in multi-stakeholder initiatives could act as 
bridge-builders and those in multilateral institutions could both provide leverage and establish 
precedents. There was a strong view that mechanisms should adopt a rights-based approach, 
integrating human rights norms, standards and principles into the process of grievance 
mechanisms, whether or not the issues in dispute raised substantive human rights. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p> Particular challenges identified for mechanisms at the company level were the alignment 
with management systems and incentive structures, handling power disparities, ensuring access, 
providing accountability, marshalling resources and measuring effectiveness. Ideas for 
institutional innovations included a global ombudsman function, an institute for business and 
human rights, resource hubs to facilitate information flows about grievance mechanisms and 
open-source networking with similar aims, a foreign investor accountability mechanism and 
privatized national contact points. 
</p>
<p> The consultation on improving the human rights performance of business through 
multi-stakeholder initiatives followed the report of the Special Representative to the 
Human Rights Council of 2007 (A/HRC/4/35), in which he identified multi-stakeholder 
initiatives as an important complement to the traditional State-based treaty-making and soft law 
standard-setting processes affecting business and human rights. 
</p>
<p> The consultation was aimed at identifying (a) &#8220;good&#8221;, if not necessarily the &#8220;best&#8221;, 
practices in the governance of multi-stakeholder initiatives, and (b) criteria for credible and 
effective implementation of supply chain codes of conduct. In relation to the first objective, 
participants identified clarity of purpose, the involvement of relevant stakeholders, an 
appropriate balance of power and responsibility among stakeholders, accountability and a 
grievance mechanism as important governance principles of multi-stakeholder initiatives. There 
were mixed views on the optimal level of transparency for a multi-stakeholder initiative, but 
participants agreed that, at minimum, process transparency was required. With regard to the 
second objective, participants identified quality and credibility, cost and effectiveness as 
important features of social auditing and follow-up. They noted that many social auditing and 
follow-up systems today failed to uncover the root causes of human rights violations and did not, 
in and of themselves, build the capacity required for change. 
</p>
<p> Participants in the consultation felt that the most important measure of success of 
multi-stakeholder initiatives was on-the-ground change in people&#8217;s daily lives, and that, in this 
respect, most initiatives have so far fallen short. Two of the most important strategic questions 
and challenges that surfaced were how to achieve the critical mass needed to shift markets, and 
the relationship of largely voluntary multi-stakeholder initiatives to the sphere of regulation. 
Although there are no easy answers or ready-made solutions to these challenges, participants felt 
that there were four strategic themes worth exploring further as multi-stakeholder initiatives 
moved forward towards systemic impact, sustainability and scale: going beyond monitoring; 
increasing local ownership; exploring strategic and operational integration with one another; and 
paying greater attention to the actual drivers of operational effectiveness. </p>

<p><b>.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. During the second half of 2007, five international multi-stakeholder consultations were 
convened to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises in developing a conceptual 
and policy framework to anchor the business and human rights debate, and to help guide all 
relevant actors. The framework is contained in the Special Representative&#8217;s report to the 
Human Rights Council and comprises three core principles: the State duty to protect against 
human rights abuses by third parties, including business; the corporate responsibility to respect 
human rights; and the need for more effective access to remedies. Each of the consultations was 
co-convened with a non-governmental organization. 
</p>
<p>2. The consultations addressed the following issues: (1) the role of States in effectively 
regulating and adjudicating the activities of corporations with respect to human rights; 
(2) business and human rights in conflict zones: the role of home States; (3) the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights; (4) accountability mechanisms for resolving 
corporate-related human rights complaints and disputes; and (5) improving the human rights 
performance of business through multi-stakeholder initiatives. Participants included Government 
representatives, business representatives, representatives from non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), academic experts and legal practitioners, and at each workshop best efforts were made 
to achieve broad regional representation and gender balance. 
</p>
<p>3. Summaries of all four workshops and participants lists are available on the Special 
Representative&#8217;s website.<b>1</b> This addendum to the 2008 report of the Special Representative 
combines the summaries of the five consultations. The Special Representative and his team have 
benefited greatly from all these discussions and wish to thank the co-conveners of each 
consultation, as well as the participants, for their time and contributions. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ROLE OF STATES IN EFFECTIVELY REGULATING AND 
ADJUDICATING THE ACTIVITIES OF CORPORATIONS 
WITH RESPECT TO HUMAN RIGHTS: SUMMARY OF 
THE COPENHAGEN WORKSHOP 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Background and goals of the consultation 
</b></p>
<p>4. Subparagraph (b) of the SRSG&#8217;s mandate requires him to &#8220;elaborate on the role of States in 
effectively regulating and adjudicating the role of transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises with regard to human rights, including through international cooperation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>5. The SRSG, in Section I of his 2007 report to the Human Rights Council, documented that 
under international human rights law States have the duty to protect against human rights abuses 
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>by third parties, including business.<b>2</b> The role of States in regulating and adjudicating business 
activities with regard to human rights arises from this duty. At the same time, questions remain 
about the precise nature, scope and content of the duty to protect, and its full implications for 
States&#8217; regulatory and adjudicative functions in the business and human rights context. 
6. Accordingly, the SRSG convened an expert consultation in Copenhagen 
on 8-9 November 2007 to help clarify some of these questions. The consultation was hosted by 
the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and organized in cooperation with the Danish section of 
the International Commission of Jurists. Additional support was provided by the Canadian 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. The SRSG is grateful for this assistance, 
and for the contributions made by all participants. 
</p>
<p>7. The consultation included representatives from States, corporations and civil society as 
well as academics and legal practitioners. Annex 1 contains a list of participants and their 
affiliations. 
</p>
<p>8. In order to encourage full and frank discussion, the consultation was held under 
non-attribution rules. Accordingly, the following is a general record of the discussion. 
</p>
<p>9. The consultation aimed to generate key ideas concerning the legal and policy dimensions 
of home as well as host State duties and their implications for the SRSG&#8217;s mandate, which could 
feed into the recommendations he is invited to submit to the Human Rights Council in 2008. 
</p>
<p>10. The SRSG explained in his opening remarks that he saw no &#8220;single silver bullet&#8221; solution 
to the many issues raised in his mandate, including States&#8217; roles. Accordingly the consultation 
would examine not only the general provisions of the State duty to protect, but also its 
implications for a variety of specific policy areas that may affect, positively or negatively, the 
ability of States to reduce the incidence of corporate-related human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Meaning, sources and scope of the duty to protect 
</b></p>
<p>11. Session I explored the current status of the State duty to protect against corporate 
human rights abuses, both within and outside a State&#8217;s jurisdiction. Participants agreed that 
States are the primary duty bearers under international law with respect to preventing corporate 
abuse. However, they also noted that States often do not seem fully to understand their duties or 
are unwilling to fulfil them. 
</p>
<p>12. It was acknowledged that the State duty to protect is an obligation of conduct, not result. 
States are not automatically responsible for abuse by a corporation that is not acting under their 
control. But they do have a responsibility to implement systems of &#8220;due diligence&#8221; to prevent, 
investigate, punish, and redress interference with rights by all types of corporations. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>2
</b>  A/HRC/4/35. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>13. It was highlighted that there is often confusion as to the difference between States&#8217; primary 
and secondary obligations in relation to preventing corporate abuse. For example, the secondary 
rules of State responsibility, as described in the International Law Commission&#8217;s Articles on 
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ILC Articles), may be used to 
attribute responsibility to a State for the &#8220;internationally wrongful&#8221; acts of a corporation at home 
or abroad where the corporation was exercising elements of government authority or acting 
under government control.<b>3</b> However, even without such a connection between the corporation 
and the State, the latter may be held responsible for corporate abuse through a failure to fulfil 
primary duties under the core human rights treaties and customary international law to protect 
individuals against third party abuses. 
</p>
<p>14. Participants agreed that there is still uncertainty as to the extraterritorial dimensions of the 
State duty to protect against corporate abuse, i.e. whether the duty extends beyond protecting 
individuals within a State&#8217;s own jurisdiction. Nevertheless, some participants noted that many 
States are moving away from the belief that the use of extraterritorial regulation to hold 
corporations accountable for overseas abuse is illegal under jurisdictional principles of 
international law. 
</p>
<p>15. The discussion moved on to address the emerging web of potential corporate liability for 
the worst forms of human rights abuses, reflecting international standards but imposed through 
national courts.<b>4</b> The growing number of jurisdictions in which corporations may be held liable 
for both direct and complicit involvement in international crimes, including overseas violations, 
means that the risk environment for corporations is expanding, as are remedial options for 
victims. 
</p>
<p>16. In relation to human rights abuses other than crimes, one participant described a growing 
trend for States to adopt human rights charters and codes that impose obligations on companies 
that perform State functions. 
</p>
<p>17. Participants raised the issues of government capacity, funding, and political will, 
explaining that even the strongest legislation and regulations &#8220;in form&#8221; will be ineffective in 
substance without these elements. Matters of policy coherence were also discussed, such as how 
to ensure that relevant State agencies are working effectively together to provide protection 
against corporate abuse. 
</p>
<p>18. Several participants noted the importance of considering corporate law when exploring the 
tools available to States in improving corporate behaviour. Corporations receive judicial 
personality through government approval, and these participants said more thought should be 
given to how that privilege could be made conditional on respect for human rights.

<p>19. One participant suggested that further comparative research be conducted on the use of 
judicial review to make government agencies more accountable for decisions made without due 
consideration of human rights implications. Another participant noted that State practice might 
show that while judicial review is readily available, claimants may face hurdles where judges are 
not willing to accept that human rights are &#8220;relevant considerations&#8221; for administrative agencies. 
</p>
<p>20. Turning to guidance from international human rights mechanisms, one participant 
highlighted that there are several ways whereby the duty to protect is specified, including 
through treaties, declarations and the commentaries of human rights bodies. However, he noted 
that the international community is still without definitive guidance as to the precise nature and 
scope of the duty. He questioned how best to increase the level of specification, particularly 
through the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and the Human Rights Council. Another 
participant wondered whether an optional protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights should expressly define the State duty to protect against corporate abuse. 
</p>
<p>21. The SRSG noted that his mapping of United Nations human rights treaty bodies&#8217; 
commentaries provided insights into the specification of State obligations under the duty to 
protect.<b>5</b> He also briefed participants on his meeting with the treaty bodies, in which he 
encouraged them to further develop guidance for States in this area. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  State economic policies and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>22. The State duty to protect against corporate-related human rights abuses is not confined to a 
self-contained domain labelled &#8220;human rights&#8221;. States have that duty within all policy domains. 
Therefore, Session II examined the considerations involved in States&#8217; balancing human rights 
concerns with economic and other interests when they make economic policy. Participants were 
asked to consider the trends in State practice with respect to balancing these interests; arguments 
for and against providing States with a wide margin of appreciation when engaging in such 
balancing; and the obligations States have or should have under international human rights law 
to consider human rights when entering into trade, investment, and other commercial 
agreements. 
</p>
<p>23. At the outset, one participant questioned whether States today in fact are adequately 
balancing community interests against economic interests. It was suggested that when economic 
interests consistently trump human rights, the result may lead to major discord between the 
affected community, relevant corporations, and the State - thereby undermining the economic 
viability of the investment itself. One participant said that finding the right balance between 
economic interests and human rights is a task for the international community as a whole so as to 
avoid prejudicing States that choose to pay more attention to rights. 
</p><p>24. It was recognized that there also may be a divide between human rights doctrinalism and 
economic analysis that needs to be overcome. One participant pointed out that the market itself 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  A/HRC/4/35, Add.1. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>was generating innovations supportive of human rights, such as social reporting and shareholder 
activism. However, it was also noted that States may undermine such market mechanisms by 
weakening the ability of shareholders and third parties to complain about corporate conduct. 
</p>
<p>25. Another participant questioned the market&#8217;s morality. He spoke of corporations 
undertaking projects in developing countries and leaving after depleting the available resources. 
He questioned whether States should require such companies to act in a more sustainable and 
responsible manner. 
</p>
<p>26. It was noted that Governments themselves can face reputational risks, and that such risks 
are leading more States to consider human rights when making economic and commercial 
decisions. However, because of problems in implementation, even if human rights are considered 
when making economic decisions it may be difficult to ensure that they remain on the policy 
agenda. Participants suggested that one of the issues adversely affecting implementation is policy 
incoherence, particularly where the economic policy arms of Governments dominate or ignore 
departments dealing with corporate social responsibility and human rights. 
</p>
<p>27. A State representative suggested that States should have a wide margin of appreciation 
when deciding how to balance economic interests with human rights, while still making sure to 
abide by their international obligations. It was also argued that States may have reasons for 
allowing their companies to invest in questionable situations abroad: they may believe that some 
oversight is better than none and that opposing investment might harm the local population to a 
greater extent. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Investment and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>28. Session III addressed concerns regarding the potential effects of host Government 
agreements (HGAs) and bilateral (and multilateral) investment treaties (BITs) on the willingness 
and ability of States to safeguard human rights. It also aimed to explore policy options for how 
such agreements (both private and State-to-State) could be better formulated and implemented so 
as to alleviate some of these concerns while still encouraging and supporting investment. In 
particular, participants were asked to consider how stabilization clauses in HGAs may impact 
State action to promote and protect rights and the ways to address such impacts. 
</p>
<p>29. The discussion started with a briefing on a joint study by the International Finance 
Corporation and the SRSG to identify how the use of stabilization clauses might constrain the 
protection of human rights in host countries. The study is the first major research effort ever 
undertaken to look at private investment agreements spanning a large number of industries and 
regions. It provides a unique opportunity to see how States and private actors may better work 
together to reduce any effects of such clauses on Governments&#8217; ability to protect rights. 
</p>
<p>30. One participant described the different types of stabilization clauses included in HGAs. 
There are &#8220;freezing clauses&#8221;, which might negate any changes to relevant laws for the life of the 
investment or another term set out in the agreement. There are also &#8220;economic equilibrium 
clauses&#8221;, which provide that if new laws disturb the investment&#8217;s economic equilibrium there 
may be an apportionment of costs between the investor and the Government. It was argued that </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>both types of clauses may disincentivize a Government from changing laws to better protect 
rights and pursue other social and environmental policies. Some participants were also concerned 
by the fact that disputes in relation to HGAs can go directly to international arbitration, 
bypassing host country courts, with little or no transparency as to cause, process, or outcome. 
</p>
<p>31. The link between HGAs and BITs was also explored. Participants explained that the latter 
generally contain rights for investors, set out State obligations, and contain a dispute settlement 
process which may be triggered by investors. Such agreements rarely mention human rights. One 
participant highlighted that a party to an HGA might be able to complain under a BIT about host 
State changes in laws by arguing that there has been a form of expropriation of their assets, with 
expropriation generally being a ground for arbitration and compensation. 
</p>
<p>32. It was argued that arbitrators for HGA or BIT disputes rarely consider the human rights 
impacts of their decisions. Participants said it was also difficult to discern any clear patterns from 
such decisions because the process is so confidential and ad hoc. However, there was some 
knowledge about disputes relating to water services, health legislation, and economic 
empowerment of historically disadvantaged groups that could provide insights into how 
human rights issues are raised in these forums. 
</p>
<p>33. Similar to some of the arguments made in session II, one participant questioned the 
traditional meaning of stability for investors, arguing that an investment is likely to be more 
stable where it is responsive to its social context rather than restrictive of positive change. 
</p>
<p>34. Participants considered a number of recommendations to improve the ability of States to 
negotiate both BITs and HGAs so as to safeguard their capacity to protect rights while still 
retaining certainty for investors. For instance, arbitrators could refuse to hear a dispute on its 
merits if the investor is clearly trying to circumvent human rights protection. Interested parties 
could be permitted to submit amicus briefs as to why and how arbitrators should consider human 
rights issues. It was also suggested that the parties to a dispute could take steps to include at least 
one person on an arbitral panel with human rights knowledge. Transparency was viewed as a 
critical issue - it was argued that the public should be aware of the types of agreements their 
Governments are signing as well as the outcome of disputes. While certain business issues must 
be kept confidential, it was felt that there is little justification for keeping entire agreements and 
disputes from the public. 
</p>
<p>35. It was also suggested that model stabilization clauses could be drafted so that regulatory 
certainty is secured in relation to only a limited number of new laws, and to allow for more 
flexibility for States regarding environmental and social issues. In relation to BITs, several 
participants referred to the International Institute for Sustainable Development&#8217;s Model 
International Agreement on Investment for Sustainable Development.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>36. In a discussion about power imbalances between host States and corporations, one 
participant argued that corporations do not always have the upper hand. He explained that States 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  See http://www.iisd.org/investment/model/ for more information. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>may be able to exert considerable influence over the scope and structure of an HGA. Thus any 
recommendations should bear in mind that States must also be willing to abide by their 
international law obligations when negotiating and implementing agreements. It was highlighted 
that even where States lack the resources for careful negotiation of HGAs, corporations cannot 
be expected to negotiate &#8220;for both sides&#8221; - more needs to be done to better equip States so that 
there can be an effective meeting of the minds on risk allocations. This would help to avoid bad 
deals on both sides. One solution could be targeted training programmes for government lawyers 
to increase their understanding of the risks that stabilization clauses may pose to human rights 
protection. 
</p>
<p>37. It was also argued that home States should consider ways to encourage corporations to 
think more about whether provisions in their contracts might have a negative impact on a host 
State&#8217;s ability or willingness to safeguard rights, and how to minimize any such impacts. 
</p>
<p>38. By the end of the session there was consensus that changes in approaches are needed for a 
wide range of actors in this context, most obviously for States and investors but also for 
arbitrators, lawyers and civil society. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Trade and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>39. Session IV looked at the potential impacts the world trading system and multilateral trade 
agreements may have on human rights protection, and the policy options that are available to 
States for encouraging positive impacts and minimizing any negative impacts. For instance, 
participants were asked to think about how to encourage the recognition of core human rights 
principles throughout the trading system. They were also asked to consider the role of 
international institutions in encouraging and facilitating States to consider human rights in their 
commercial relations while still safeguarding the ability of States to trade freely. 
</p>
<p>40. Similar to the disconnect already noted between broader economic policies and human 
rights, one participant argued that trade policymakers rarely consider human rights in their 
deliberations. 
</p>
<p>41. With regard to the role of the World Trade Organization (WTO), participants also argued 
that WTO members should pay more attention to upholding the rule of law in all areas, including 
in export processing zones and conflict zones. 
</p>
<p>42. The need was expressed to dispel the assumption that trade and investment laws are 
&#8220;harder&#8221; law than States&#8217; international human rights obligations. States operating within the 
trade and investment regime must still abide by their international human rights obligations. One 
participant called for greater transparency at the WTO to make it clearer how trade agreements 
may impact human rights. At the same time, several participants maintained that the WTO may 
not be the most appropriate forum to deal with human rights, and that it may be more effective 
for human rights mechanisms to increase their attention to trade issues. 
</p>
<p>43. Participants were optimistic that more could be done at the drafting stage of trade 
agreements to better safeguard rights. One suggestion was for trade negotiators to be informed 
about human rights issues. It was also noted that lessons could be learned from the labour and </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>environmental side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement, intended to 
encourage enforcement of domestic environmental and labour laws within the participating 
countries. 
</p>
<p>44. The Kimberley Process was cited as an example of States working to protect rights through 
a WTO waiver. From a different point of view, one participant suggested that more thinking is 
needed on the links between trade and human rights so as to avoid any adverse effects on rights 
from unduly restricting trade. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  State support for companies operating abroad 
</b></p>
<p>45. Session V explored the various types of support, financial and otherwise, that States 
provide to companies operating abroad. It addressed the challenges of incorporating human 
rights considerations into the provision of assistance, with a particular focus on export credit 
agencies (ECAs). 
</p>
<p>46. The session began with a discussion of State responsibility for the acts of publicly 
controlled ECAs. One participant argued that under the ILC Articles, States are responsible for 
the international wrongful acts of such ECAs, including breaches of international human rights 
law. It was also contended that States could be held complicit under the ILC Articles for abuses 
by host States as a result of certain ECA activities - for instance, where an ECA funds a 
corporation that enters into a HGA which prevents a host State from protecting rights. It was 
argued that to avoid such complicity, States should adopt legislation requiring ECAs to 
implement policies and practices to protect against interference with human rights by clients. 
States should then monitor compliance with such policies and establish remedies for abuses 
associated with ECAs. Not all participants shared this interpretation of States&#8217; legal obligations. 
</p>
<p>47. Several participants also considered that it was vital for ECAs to be transparent about their 
human rights policies so that clients understand exactly what is expected of them, and the public 
understands why a project was or was not allowed to proceed in light of human rights concerns. 
One participant argued that company disclosures to ECAs on the potential human rights impacts 
of projects should be made public so that interested parties could consider taking action if it 
becomes known that a corporation has misrepresented the facts and risks. 
</p>
<p>48. Some participants noted that while ECAs already may have discretion to consider 
environmental and social impacts of proposed projects, they are rarely expressly mandated to 
consider human rights concerns - for example, by requiring human rights impact assessments in 
addition to or part of environmental and social impact assessments. 
</p>
<p>49. One ECA representative said that some ECAs hardly know where to start on this issue. It 
was explained that ECAs may be quite far down the &#8220;supply chain&#8221; of policymaking when it 
comes to knowledge about government policy with respect to human rights. It was also 
suggested that any recommendations the SRSG may make vis-&#224;-vis ECAs should be applicable 
to the range of projects that ECAs support, including situations where an ECA only provides a 
small percentage of finance or insurance for a project. Further, more thought should be given to 
how ECAs may better coordinate at the multilateral level, including through the OECD. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>50. Several participants felt that ECAs should take more responsibility for their actions, noting 
that as State agents they should understand and abide by their State&#8217;s human rights obligations. 
One participant said that ECAs should require greater due diligence, be more transparent, and 
hire more staff with human rights experience. Some participants also spoke of various tools that 
are available to ECAs wanting to learn more about human rights, including human rights impact 
assessment guides. One participant suggested that ECAs should require clients to follow human 
rights standards similar to those they respect in the home country. 
</p>
<p>51. Other participants asked why ECAs agree to insure a client without full disclosure as to the 
human rights risks of the project. One responded that given ECAs&#8217; mandates, it made sense that 
their financial risk assessments would not necessarily consider human rights unless there is 
financial accountability for human rights violations. An ECA representative explained that while 
risk assessment was certainly a priority for ECAs, they were still moving from a history of 
assessment based only on fiscal risk to greater consideration of social and environmental risk. 
</p>
<p>52. Responding to earlier arguments about home State complicity, a State representative said 
that States may not believe they should stop ECAs from supporting questionable projects abroad 
because they do not feel obliged to protect individuals in other jurisdictions. The SRSG 
acknowledged that the extraterritorial scope of the duty to protect remains controversial. 
However, he added that participants need not enter into that debate in order to recommend better 
practices for ECAs. The relevant question was whether ECAs can and should act on policy 
grounds to ensure that investments they support abroad do not contribute to human rights abuses, 
especially when the investments are made in difficult areas such as conflict zones. That said, the 
SRSG noted that his focus was on ECAs mitigating or reducing human rights risks abroad, not 
on ECAs taking steps to promote or fulfil rights. 
</p>
<p>53. The SRSG also stated that a significant challenge in business and human rights is that 
Governments may believe they are doing business a favour by discounting the potential for 
certain problematic investments to have adverse human rights effects, when in fact they are 
exposing companies to unnecessary risks thereby. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Regulatory steps to prevent corporate abuse abroad 
</b></p>
<p>54. Session VI considered what legal, political, or practical challenges might interfere with a 
State&#8217;s willingness or ability to regulate the extraterritorial acts of corporations in order to 
safeguard rights. It also explored policy options for alleviating some of these challenges, 
including prescriptive regulation in encouraging better corporate practice. Participants were 
asked to consider arguments for and against particular situations meriting regulation with 
extraterritorial effect; challenges faced by victims in obtaining access to justice; and policy 
options in addition to regulation, including incentive schemes and support of voluntary company 
initiatives. 
</p>
<p>55. The discussion began with one participant introducing the concept of &#8220;human rights 
investment risk&#8221;. He explained that the concept assessed the risk to human rights of a company 
investing or operating in a particular State or region. The risk would vary according to several 
factors, including the host State&#8217;s governance capacity in the geographic area concerned, and the 
particular industry&#8217;s propensity to abuse rights. This participant argued that the higher the human 
rights investment risk, the stronger the home State&#8217;s interest should be in monitoring the relevant </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>company&#8217;s behaviour. Thus it is important for States to have high quality advisory functions in 
place so that they are able to assess this risk and act accordingly. The concept could also be 
incorporated when drafting investment and trade agreements. 
</p>
<p>56. Nevertheless, the participant emphasized the need to recognize the reality of foreign 
policy - Governments may not act to reduce a human rights investment risk if it jeopardizes 
&#8220;higher&#8221; political objectives. Another participant questioned whether a government decision to 
withdraw support for a company&#8217;s overseas activities based on human rights investment risks 
could harm rights to a greater extent than if the company was encouraged to work with the host 
Government and local communities to improve rights. 
</p>
<p>57. Turning to the use of prescriptive and adjudicative extraterritorial jurisdiction, several 
participants expressed the view that international law does not prohibit the use of such 
jurisdiction to hold corporations accountable for rights abuses overseas. One participant argued 
that the greatest challenge facing the effective use of adjudicative jurisdiction is access to justice 
for victims. One important procedural hurdle is judicial unwillingness to &#8220;pierce the corporate 
veil&#8221; to hold parent companies responsible for the acts of subsidiaries. Other impediments to 
access to justice include the cost of evidentiary collection; fee shifting issues; and the general 
inability or unwillingness of home State legal systems to support cases against overseas 
corporate abuse. 
</p>
<p>58. One participant noted that even if these challenges are overcome, victims could still lack 
effective access to justice if the home Government is not truly supportive of corporate 
accountability. It was contended that all Governments need to recognize that concepts relating to 
sovereignty have evolved to an extent that international law is unlikely to frown on a home State 
taking reasonable steps to strengthen corporate accountability for abuse in another State. 
Governments should keep this in mind when deciding whether to object to an action in a 
corporation&#8217;s home State against abuse committed overseas. Another participant argued that 
judicial review of administrative decisions may be a powerful tool where procedural hurdles 
slow down or thwart more traditional civil and criminal actions. 
</p>
<p>59. Participants generally favoured greater use of prescriptive extraterritorial jurisdiction 
through legislation. It was suggested that legislative changes, including incentive schemes and 
the use of corporate law tools, might more effectively prevent corporate abuse, compared to the 
reactive nature of adjudication. One participant emphasized that legislators should design 
regulatory tools with the knowledge that corporate abuse is generally unintended. Thus, 
legislation addressing corporate policies, processes, and culture could be more effective than 
proscriptive rules. Corporate law tools were again discussed, with a focus on social reporting, 
fiduciary duties, and the prohibition of unfair commercial practices. Several participants 
mentioned that legislation could be used to help pierce the corporate veil considering that State 
judiciaries often seem unwilling to take innovative steps in this regard. 
</p><p>60. The participants also discussed self-regulation, with one arguing that while command 
and control tools are important, self-regulation by companies through individual and 
multi-stakeholder initiatives may serve to raise levels of consciousness which can also lead to 
effective change. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Strengthening domestic and international policy coherence 
</b></p>
<p>61. Session VII considered key issues of policy coherence in facilitating States to fulfil their 
duty to protect. The session considered ways to improve knowledge sharing and collaboration 
within Governments so that relevant departments are better equipped to deal with business and 
human rights issues. It also explored the ways States could work together more effectively to 
encourage better corporate behaviour, as well as the role international institutions could play to 
assist States in fulfilling their duty to protect with respect to business and human rights. 
</p>
<p>62. The discussion began with a participant comparing government decision-making processes 
to those featured in company supply chains: even if a State at its highest level commits to protect 
certain rights, such promises may not be implemented further down the &#8220;chain&#8221;. Implementation 
problems may be due to a lack of commitment from State agencies. But it is probably more 
common for agencies to lack critical knowledge and resources, which may be more easily 
addressed. 
</p>
<p>63. Several participants referenced the Canadian Roundtables on the Extractive Industries.<b>7</b> 
While acknowledging that the round-table process had flaws, participants generally 
recommended that other States engage in similar processes because they provide an opportunity 
for government, business, civil society and other experts to work through key issues. One 
participant noted that the round tables in some cases highlighted lack of communication within 
government, as well as between business and the Government, on the relevance of human rights 
to key business interests. It seems that despite beliefs to the contrary, in some instances 
companies were willing to accept more guidance and even regulation on the human rights front, 
especially if the benefits included greater certainty and more sustainable projects. This 
development showed the benefit of engaging with business in policy generation. 
</p>
<p>64. Turning to international policy coherence, one participant mentioned the challenge of 
gathering systematic information about corporate activities, as well as differences in national 
priorities in how to respond collectively. Another recommended that Governments be creative 
when choosing appropriate regional and international forums in which to raise business and 
human rights issues, citing the discussion of corporate social responsibility at a recent G-8 
summit. 
</p>
<p>65. In relation to international human rights mechanisms, several participants suggested that 
the Human Rights Council should be encouraged to use the universal periodic review process to 
learn more about State practices vis-&#224;-vis business and human rights. Another appealed to civil 
society to provide more information to both States and human rights bodies about allegations 
regarding business abuse. Several participants discussed opportunities for further collaboration 
amongst United Nations human rights special procedures.

<p><b>I.  Summing up 
</b></p>
<p>66. The SRSG noted that the consultation&#8217;s high level of discussion indicated how much 
progress had been achieved in the business and human rights debate since the beginning of the 
mandate. One could see an emerging community of actors who, while approaching the 
challenges from different perspectives, nevertheless are working to improve current practices. 
There is a growing recognition that the status quo provides neither sufficient guidance to 
companies and Governments, nor sufficient protection to individuals and communities. 
</p>
<p>67. The SRSG concluded that while international legal standards have an important role to 
play in this context, such instruments typically take considerable time to bring to fruition. In 
view of the need to achieve progress here and now, all available options must be pursued. The 
SRSG considered the consultation to have been extremely valuable in exploring concrete steps 
States can take to improve corporate respect for human rights in the short to medium term. 
</p>
<p><b>III. BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CONFLICT ZONES: THE ROLE 
OF HOME STATES. SUMMARY OF THE BERLIN CONSULTATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on business and 
human rights (SRSG), John Ruggie, is mandated to consider, among other subjects, &#8220;the role of 
States in effectively regulating and adjudicating the role of transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises with regard to human rights, including through international cooperation&#8221;. 
Because the most egregious human rights violations, including those associated with companies, 
take place in conflict zones, the SRSG convened a consultation on the subject of business 
operations in such zones. And because the roles that the &#8220;home States&#8221; of companies could or 
should play has not been extensively explored in the business and human rights debate, the 
consultation focused on the actual or potential roles of home States when &#8220;their&#8221; companies 
operate in conflict zones abroad.<b>8</b> The one-day expert session was held at the Berlin Center for 
Civil Society on 5 November 2007, co-convened with Global Witness as part of its collaboration 
with the SRSG&#8217;s mandate, and was funded by the Die Zeit Foundation and the Vodafone 
Foundation. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Objectives 
</b>69. The meeting addressed three core questions: 
</p>
<p> (a) What if anything do home States currently do to prevent or deter human rights 
abuses by their corporations operating in conflict zones? 
</p>
<p> (b) What could home States do to prevent or deter such abuses? 
</p>
<p> (c) How could States deal with wrongdoing by their companies in conflict zones? 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Simply defined, home States are considered those States in which a corporation is registered or 
</p>
<p>incorporated. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Consultation conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>70. Overall, the meeting concluded that home States should play a bigger role in addressing 
business and human rights concerns in conflict areas. There was general consensus that: home 
State policies and practices in relation to this challenge - where they exist at all - are limited, 
fragmented, mostly unilateral and ad hoc. 
</p>
<p>71. Many home States seem to lag behind international lending institutions and also 
responsible businesses themselves in grappling with these difficult issues.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>72. Many if not most home States appear to assign considerably greater weight to promoting 
exports and foreign investments than to human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p>73. Participants agreed that home States should perform at least some level of due diligence 
before encouraging &#8220;their&#8221; companies to operate in conflict zones. This would include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that existing laws are properly enforced 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that officials in all government agencies promoting foreign investments are 
aware of the human rights situation in the conflict zones where an investment is 
proposed 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that those agencies provide companies with current, accurate and 
comprehensive information of the local human rights context so that companies can act 
appropriately, particularly when engaging with local parties accused of abuses 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing meaningful advice to companies through their embassies in host countries on 
whether they should continue to conduct business in conflict areas or how they should 
manage human rights risks 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Having Export Credit Agencies require adequate human rights due diligence before 
providing loans to companies operating in conflict zones 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperating with other Governments to ensure that investments comply with human 
rights standards 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>74. Both corporate and civil society participants expressed the need for clear and concise 
guidance from home States regarding what are and are not acceptable practices in conflict zones 
from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>75. The group also reached a general consensus that a &#8220;red flags&#8221; approach would be an 
important guiding tool, that is, a set of indicators signalling grounds for business and human 
rights concerns, which would also indicate the need for home State engagement.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Session summaries 
</b></p>
<p>76. Session 1 asked whether situations creating a need for home State engagement can be 
identified <i>ex ante</i>. Many participants noted that the definition of conflict zones is currently 
unclear. Thus, when identifying triggers for home State action they believed that focusing on 
actual situations on a case-by-case basis is more effective than relying on definitions of conflict 
zones drawn from international law. Doing so is particularly helpful in cases of sporadic violence 
that do not meet international definitions of conflict zones. One participant suggested that a 
case-by-case assessment of whether the home State should act would need to include an analysis 
of whether the local population would benefit or suffer more from the company&#8217;s presence. 
</p>
<p>77. Participants generally agreed that home States should ask more questions, and to ask them 
earlier in the investment cycle, concerning the possible impacts of their companies in conflict 
zones. At minimum, the questions should include whether the investments are likely to 
strengthen an oppressive host State regime and thereby minimize benefits to the population; and 
whether companies should be permitted to participate in business ventures that plausibly could 
lead to their being complicit in violations of international humanitarian law, war crimes, or 
crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>78. A number of participants noted that home States&#8217; reputations are also at stake, not only the 
reputations of companies. Participants indicated that home State embarrassment linked to 
corporate wrongdoing can trigger action such as in-country investigations carried out by teams 
appointed by home Governments. One example is the Canadian Government-commissioned 
report on Talisman&#8217;s operations in Sudan. 
</p>
<p>79. Participants agreed that when home States act at all, their approaches exhibit a lack of 
coordination among government departments, and a lack of collaboration with other States. All 
participants expressed the need for greater coherence within and across States. Participants 
suggested that Governments will need to be persuaded to work together to define acceptable 
corporate and human rights benchmarks. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  One example discussed was the FAFO Red Flags paper (due for publication shortly) that 
</p>
<p>identifies nine sets of serious liability risks for companies operating in high-risk zones. 
Depending on the situation, the existence of one or more of these red flags should raise concern 
within the company and also alert home States. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p>80. In order to introduce greater analytical refinements into the discussion, the next four 
sessions explored different scenarios. The first was possible &#8220;no-go&#8221; areas for business - where 
the human rights situation might pose such risks to the company and the home State that an 
investment simply should not go forward. The second depicted situations where companies 
knowingly contribute to conflicts that, in turn, lead to corporate-related human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>81. The third addressed the situation where companies may do unintended harm through their 
operations in conflict zones. And the fourth examined how home States can facilitate and support 
positive contributions by companies to the respect for human rights in conflict zones. 
</p>
<p>82. Session 2 focused on whether there were circumstances so extreme that home States 
should advise companies against starting operations there, and advise those with existing 
operations to suspend them - or leave the companies to decide for themselves whether or not to 
continue with their investment, but without the home country providing any financial or 
diplomatic support. Participants felt that greater clarity was required on the no-go concept. For 
example, would it require divestment? Would it focus on a specific industry or region within the 
host country? Would it focus on doing business with specific parties who are known to commit 
human rights violations? 
</p>
<p>83. Participants suggested that &#8220;no-go&#8221; indicators could be taken from United Nations 
Chapter VII sanctions and international humanitarian law, but they indicated that other signals 
would also be required. It was emphasized that it may be difficult for a company to avoid 
complicity when operating in areas where massive human rights violations are committed. Thus, 
several participants argued that a &#8220;no-go&#8221; warning should always exist for areas where war 
crimes and crimes against humanity are taking place. 
</p>
<p>84. Other participants expressed concern over how the &#8220;no-go&#8221; concept would be applied 
when an area becomes a conflict zone only after a company arrives, or if the conflict becomes 
exacerbated by the company&#8217;s presence - as has been the case with numerous investments in the 
extractive sector. 
</p>
<p>85. In addition, some participants expressed apprehension about &#8220;no-go&#8221; areas because of the 
global competition for resources from conflict areas, arguing that if one business pulls out due to 
human rights concerns or home State restraints, another private or State-owned enterprise that 
does not face similar restraints will take over. It was suggested that companies from developed 
States are more willing to respect human rights than those from emerging markets, thus 
disadvantaging the former, but others argued that this remained an unproven assumption. 
</p>
<p>86. Several participants stressed that the home State&#8217;s decision in relation to a company 
operating in a conflict zone should not be unduly swayed by the company&#8217;s philanthropic efforts 
if its core operations do demonstrable harm. 
</p>
<p>87. In addition, participants involved in the FAFO &#8220;Red Flags&#8221; project expressed the view that 
home States should become involved when company operations include or result in displaced 
peoples, forced labour, the handling of looted assets, material transactions with abusive security </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>forces, the financing of crimes, and corporate complicity including by providing the means to 
kill. A few participants also put forward that any trade in conflict resources should also act as a 
red flag that could give rise to a role for home States.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>88. Session 3 focused on the role of home States in preventing deliberate adverse effects of 
domiciled companies operating in conflict zones. Participants observed that the main problem in 
this area related to poor enforcement of laws by host States, where the judiciary may lack 
capacity or will, or be subjected to political pressures. Participants agreed, therefore, that greater 
engagement is needed by home Governments, which have been extremely reluctant to act. For 
example, corporate breaches of United Nations Chapter VII sanctions are poorly enforced and 
infrequently punished. Some participants said that greater home State involvement might result if 
there were clearer international guidance as to whether States are required to protect against 
abuse by their citizens and corporations abroad. Indeed, the question was raised whether home 
States could encounter State responsibility under international law if they do not take certain 
preventative actions. At the very least, it should be made clearer that States are not prohibited 
from taking reasonable actions under international law. 
</p>
<p>89. Participants agreed that home States should take the following actions to deal with 
domiciled companies that deliberately cause harm: increase their own commitment and capacity 
to hold such corporations accountable, provide adequate resources to carry out investigations in 
foreign countries, and strengthen intra-State policy alignment as well as intergovernmental 
cooperation among States. A few participants raised the possibility of using property crimes and 
cases focusing on pillage and plunder as alternatives to attract Governments that may feel 
uncomfortable supporting &#8220;human rights actions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>90. Session 4 focused on the role of home States in preventing unintended harm by companies 
in conflict zones. All participants agreed that there was an important home State role in 
increasing corporate awareness of the risks of doing business in conflict zones. 
</p>
<p>91. Participants also agreed that if companies do go into conflict zones, home States should act 
proactively by flagging their concerns. Many participants believed that informing companies of 
the possibility that their operations may cause harm would set the standard for operations and 
help companies reduce harm to human rights from the beginning. Some participants expressed 
the view that companies need a form of reassurance or direction from home States on how to 
carry out operations, including suggestions of human rights sensitive activities that could be 
undertaken in conflict areas. It was also suggested that home Governments are in a position to 
monitor human rights risks posed by companies in conflict zones and should do so.

Resources&#8221;, A Briefing Document by Global Witness dated November 2006. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p>92. Similarly, some participants suggested that home States could share information in order to 
create a more level playing field between more and less experienced companies. It was suggested 
that this could assist new companies to learn from problems already faced by more experienced 
companies. Other participants observed that home States could enter into dialogue with host 
Governments to confirm and create clear expectations regarding human rights benchmarks for 
their company&#8217;s operations within a conflict area. A few participants noted that this could have 
greater benefits for human rights since company operations in host countries are often part of 
joint ventures with national firms, which may hold operating control. 
</p><p>93. Many participants emphasized that there should be no tolerance for ignorance within a 
company for the human rights implications of its operations, especially after it has been warned 
by reputable internal or external sources. 
</p>
<p>94. Session 5 focused on the role of home States in supporting positive contributions by 
companies to the respect of human rights in conflict zones. Several participants stated that it was 
essential for companies to have their own policies and processes that respond to different types 
of conflict situations and the escalating problems that may be encountered during operations. But 
home States could provide support for such efforts. 
</p>
<p>95. To support business operations in conflict zones, some participants suggested that home 
States help develop clearer standards for companies. Most participants agreed that a clearly 
developed home State policy would make company operations more predictable and clarify 
expectations for businesses. 
</p>
<p>96. One participant suggested that home States also could provide advice to business on 
pressing dilemmas. These include what a company should do when some stakeholders want 
them to divest and others want them to stay, and how a level playing field can be established for 
companies if civil society pressures on them vary depending on where investors are located and 
where the company is incorporated. These are not issues that companies can solve on their own. 
</p>
<p>97. Finally, Session 6 addressed the impact of existing initiatives aimed at supporting positive 
business involvement in conflict areas. Discussing the Voluntary Principles on Security and 
Human Rights (VPs), one participant noted that the VPs had sent the right signals to relevant 
audiences in conflict situations by indicating that the international community now is less 
permissive of corporate-related human rights violations, while also building a corporate culture 
that respects human rights. Participants indicated that home States could contribute to such 
initiatives by ensuring that the analyses of the human rights situations in conflict zones are 
properly conducted, accurate and up to date. 
</p>
<p>98. In addition, one participant discussed a role for home States in identifying records of host 
State security forces and advising on the identities of human rights abusers. Participants 
discussed other measures that could be used including: the ability of home States to draw upon 
and learn from the OECD National Contact Points in creating new complaints mechanisms 
specific to conflict zones, and requirements to improve disclosure laws and listing requirements 
for companies. </p>

</p>
<p><b>E.  Next steps 
</b></p>
<p>99. The consultation wrapped up by suggesting the following steps for home States: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Recognition of the unique circumstances that prevail in conflict zones, including 
sporadic or sustained violence, breakdown of governance, coupled with the absence of 
the rule of law, making it essential for home States to engage with host States and 
develop consistent policies regarding business and human rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Specific guidance for companies interacting with security forces and belligerent militia 
in problematic areas 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Better provision of information and advice to businesses operating in conflict zones 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identification of simple indicators that trigger action for home States with respect to 
their companies operating in conflict zones 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Better policy alignment between government departments in home States, such as 
finance, foreign affairs, trade and international development 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperation among home Governments to define minimum standards of corporate and 
human rights benchmarks 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>100. The Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on business and 
human rights (SRSG) held a series of multi-stakeholder consultations in the fall of 2007, which 
were intended to inform his 2008 report to the Human Rights Council. These consultations were 
broadly framed in terms of three baskets of issues: the State duty to protect against human rights 
abuses by third parties, including business; the corporate responsibility to respect human rights; 
and the need to create more effective remedies to address corporate-related human rights 
disputes. 
</p>
<p>101. The consultation on the corporate responsibility to respect human rights - what it means 
and implies for companies, both in conceptual and operational terms - took place in Geneva 
on 4-5 December 2007. It was convened in cooperation with <i>Realizing Rights: the Ethical 
Globalization Initiative</i>; co-chaired by Mrs. Mary Robinson and Sir Mark Moody Stuart; and 
hosted by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The SRSG is 
grateful for this assistance, and for the contributions made by all participants. 
</p>
<p>102. Participants at the consultation included representatives from corporations and civil society 
as well as academics, legal practitioners and international organizations. A list of participants 
and their affiliations is appended below. 
</p>
<p>103. In order to encourage full and frank discussion, the consultation was held under 
non-attribution rules. Accordingly, the following is a general summary of the discussion. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 27 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Introduction and objectives 
</b>104. Society expects companies to respect human rights, and companies generally believe they 
do. However, most companies cannot make that claim with high degrees of confidence because 
they lack the systems to ensure it. The consultation&#8217;s aim was to explore what steps companies 
need to take in practice to satisfy themselves and their stakeholders that their practices indeed do 
respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>105. The corporate responsibility to respect human rights in essence means &#8220;non-infringement&#8221; 
on the enjoyment of rights - or put simply, &#8220;doing no harm&#8221;. Doing no harm may require 
companies to take positive steps. For example, a company that wishes to respect the right to 
non-discrimination in the workplace will need to adopt appropriate hiring policies and engage in 
employee training to be sure that the right is honoured. 
</p>
<p>106. Furthermore, companies may have additional responsibilities in particular situations - for 
example, if they perform governmental functions. Or they may take on additional obligations 
with regard to human rights voluntarily. 
</p>
<p>107. The consultation stressed that companies cannot &#8220;buy offsets&#8221; to counterbalance harm to 
human rights for which they are responsible, through philanthropic acts or by fulfilling rights in 
other areas. The responsibility to respect is a universal requirement, applicable in all situations. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Understanding when and how corporations may harm rights 
</b></p>
<p>108. In order to contextualize the discussion of the corporate responsibility to respect human 
rights, two recent studies of alleged corporate human rights abuses were presented. The first 
was conducted by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). It examined 
38 allegations against mining companies in 25 countries. The most common allegations include 
adverse impacts of company operations on health and environment, indigenous peoples, security, 
and conflicts. Of the &#8220;underlying issues&#8221; that may have helped drive the allegations, economic 
effects were the most frequently cited, either because company activity negatively impacted the 
local community&#8217;s economic situation or because the local economy failed to benefit. Lack of 
consultation also was frequently mentioned. In up to 70 per cent of the cases, both the company 
and another entity, usually the State, were alleged to be responsible for the abuse, raising the 
issue of corporate complicity - that is, when a company is held responsible for the actions of 
another entity with which it has relations because it contributed to and had some knowledge of 
those actions. 
</p>
<p>109. The second study is being carried out by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in support of the SRSG&#8217;s mandate. It analyses a sample 
of more than 300 allegations of corporate human rights abuses from all sectors, collected by the 
Business and Human Rights Resource Center. Initial findings indicate that companies have been 
accused of having negative impacts on the full range of human rights. Most of the cases allege 
direct violations by a company, although some claim that the company contributed to or 
benefited from violations by States, the supply chain, or other third parties. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>110. The two studies show that companies can and do impact the full spectrum of human rights. 
Therefore, the <i>ex ante</i> specification of rights for which companies might bear some 
responsibility is an inherently fruitless exercise; in principle, all rights can be affected. Efforts by 
companies to ensure respect for rights should reflect this fact. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Due diligence 
</b></p>
<p>111. The consultation then addressed the need for an overarching analytical framework that can 
guide corporate policies and management practices in respecting human rights and ensuring that 
their business operations &#8220;do no harm&#8221;. The concept of &#8220;due diligence&#8221; was proposed and was 
found to be a useful starting point for companies as they seek to integrate respect for human 
rights into their practices. 
</p>
<p>112. One speaker described due diligence as understood in the United States as the steps taken 
by directors to discharge fiduciary duties of care and loyalty, which can include overseeing the 
operations of a company to ensure it is acting both legally and ethically.<b>12</b> This requires proactive 
conduct on the part of the company. The corporate duty of care and loyalty in the United States 
is one of oversight, requiring directors to take reasonable steps to identify and address risks. The 
corporate fiduciary duty of care also is defined by the United States Sentencing Guidelines as 
due diligence to ensure that companies are in compliance with both legal and ethical guidelines, 
which the speaker believed could include international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>113. Another speaker indicated that in Canadian employment law due diligence means taking 
all reasonable steps and precautions to avoid harm. They include having written policies and 
procedures concerning health and safety systems, for example: instruction and training in the use 
of such procedures; ongoing communication; consultation regarding problems and follow-up 
concerning results; and effective monitoring and enforcement. 
</p>
<p>114. The concept of due diligence was also explored in the context of international investment 
law. One speaker noted that while bilateral investment treaties do not specify duties for the 
investor, international investment tribunals nevertheless have started to consider whether foreign 
investors have assessed risks adequately through due diligence and refrained from 
&#8220;unconscionable conduct&#8221;. Investment tribunals have noted the relevance of human rights in a 
few water-related cases, which may indicate that companies will be expected to take into account 
the human rights situation of the country in which they invest as part of their due diligence. 
</p>
<p>115. Clearly more research is needed to establish greater clarity. But as a first cut, participants 
felt that the concept of due diligence offers a good starting point for companies seeking to 
establish that they respect rights. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  The International Bar Association is conducting research for the SRSG that examines how 
</p>
<p>concepts of due diligence and fiduciary duties are understood in various jurisdictions. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 29 
 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Policy formulation 
</b></p>
<p>116. The next step would be for companies to adopt human rights policies or integrate human 
rights into existing policies. The consultation explored the lessons learned and the challenges of 
incorporating human rights standards into company policy areas. 
</p>
<p>117. General aspirational statements about respect for the principles of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), for example, need to be supplemented by specific 
guidance for managers with limited understanding of international human rights standards. Some 
participants argued for the need to articulate human rights standards in business friendly 
language that applies to specific areas of company policy and practice. 
</p>
<p>118. Participants had different views about whether a stand-alone human rights policy was 
necessary. Most agreed that human rights must be integrated into existing company policies and 
management practices and should not be kept in a silo. Some thought it would be sufficient for 
companies to check their existing policies and procedures against international human rights 
instruments to make sure the key elements were in place. Participants also commented on the 
need to train employees regarding the policies to ensure they are implemented. 
</p>
<p>119. Speakers mentioned two tools that provide detailed policy guidance. The Business 
Leaders&#8217; Initiative for Human Rights matrix looks to the UDHR and articulates its relevance for 
business by policy area. And the Danish Institute for Human Right&#8217;s Compliance Assessment 
tool allows companies to assess their policies and practices in different operational areas for 
compliance with human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Human rights impact and compliance assessments 
</b></p>
<p>120. There is a growing realization that the assessment of human rights impacts and compliance 
before operations begin are a critical part of due diligence to ensure respect for human rights. 
Participants noted increased investor pressure on companies to use human rights impact 
assessments, and the ability of Governments, commercial banks, and multilateral lenders to 
encourage uptake in their use. The consultation considered when such assessments should be 
carried out and what form they should assume. 
</p>
<p>121. Participants agreed that impact assessments should be conducted as early as possible, 
ideally before the decision to invest has been made, so that companies can alter their decisions 
about location, timing, design, and costing, and thus the investment&#8217;s overall viability, based on 
the impact assessment. Participants indicated that this sort of &#8220;pre-check&#8221;, usually comprising 
desk research and some expert consultation, should be done in any business sector. 
</p>
<p>122. These desk-based impact assessments were differentiated from assessments that include 
consultation with the potentially impacted individuals and communities. Some participants 
indicated that whether such &#8220;on-the-ground&#8221; activity was necessary would depend on sector, 
type of activity, or scale of the investment. Participants diverged on the practicability of 
disclosing the results of the impact assessment to the public, although they agreed this was in 
principle desirable. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>123. Participants also differed on whether human rights impact assessments should be 
free-standing or could be integrated into existing risk management processes. It was suggested 
that, if they were to be integrated, it was essential to maintain a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>124. It was noted that several tools for human rights impact assessments are now available, 
including the Human Rights Compliance Assessment tool, produced by the Danish Institute for 
Human Rights; the Guide to Human Rights Impact Assessments (road-testing draft from 
June 2007), produced by the International Finance Corporation, the International Business 
Leaders Forum and the United Nations Global Compact; and Human Rights Impact Assessments 
for Foreign Investment Projects, produced by Rights &amp; Democracy (for use by affected 
communities). 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Accountability through monitoring, auditing and assurance 
</b></p>
<p>125. This session considered the role of monitoring and auditing of corporate human rights 
policies and practices as a means of ensuring respect for rights. 
</p>
<p>126. It was agreed that monitoring and auditing are needed to raise awareness within the 
company about human rights issues and to help address issues of non-compliance. Auditing 
results can also help focus training efforts. However, some participants indicated that there is a 
significant difference in the quality of auditing depending on the degree of independence of the 
auditors. 
</p>
<p>127. It was agreed that monitoring and auditing have improved health and safety standards in 
the workplace, but they have not always successfully addressed issues such as freedom of 
association, collective bargaining, and non-discrimination. One participant suggested that the 
latter issues could be addressed if auditing systems were designed to enhance accountability, 
build worker and community capacity, and bring about structural change in how the company 
operates. Participants noted that these processes can be expensive, especially for mid-sized 
companies, but others noted that they are a necessary component of business excellence and 
sustainability. The particular role that unions can play on behalf of workers was highlighted. 
</p>
<p>128. The buying practices of global brands were also raised, with participants noting that they 
place undue pressures on factories that were at the same time held to very strict cost-constraints. 
Some multi-stakeholder initiatives are trying to take into account the human rights impacts 
caused by purchasing practices in their audits. It was suggested that this topic merited further 
attention. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Accountability through grievance mechanisms and remediation 
</b></p>
<p>129. When corporations adversely affect the enjoyment of human rights of individuals and 
communities, mechanisms need to be in place to provide remedies for grievances or harms. 
However, there has been little analysis of what such mechanisms should look like, particularly at 
the operational level in companies. This session explored what constitutes effective and credible 
grievance mechanisms to help ensure corporate respect for human rights. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 31 
 
</p>
<p>130. One speaker suggested that grievance mechanisms can be divided in three categories. The 
first includes those created by the company at the level of a specific site or operation, such as a 
mine or factory. The second comprises mechanisms that are outside of companies but not part of 
the formal legal system, such as the ombudsman function of the International Finance 
Corporation, the OECD National Contact Points, or complaint mechanisms of multi-stakeholder 
initiatives such as the Fair Labor Association. The third category consists of judicial institutions 
at the national and international level. All three categories are needed to ensure effective 
remediation. 
</p>
<p>131. The conversation mainly focused on company grievance mechanisms. The point was made 
that such mechanisms could be particularly effective because they were located in the physical 
and cultural context in which the issues arose and could enable solutions to be found more 
quickly. Participants agreed that operational level grievance mechanisms should most 
appropriately use mediation or negotiation rather than an adjudication process. 
</p><p>132. Several participants noted the potential for operational level grievance mechanisms to be 
empowering if they involved workers or communities in the process in a meaningful way, giving 
them information and support. Other participants expressed concern about the fairness and 
independence of such a process, in terms of funding and access to information. Participants 
agreed that safeguards and some solution to the funding conundrum were necessary so that, for 
example, any mediator could be seen as neutral. Participants believed that a mechanism 
specifically for &#8220;human rights&#8221; grievances would not be feasible or necessary, so grievance 
mechanisms should be able to consider complaints related to environmental problems and other 
harms to communities or employees. 
</p>
<p>133. Concerning the second category of grievance mechanisms, it was suggested that 
non-judicial mechanisms external to companies should support dialogue and mediated solutions. 
They could also encompass adjudication, without having the legally binding effect of a court 
ruling. One speaker noted the need to avoid undermining government investigation and 
complaint mechanisms, such as national human rights institutions. Some of these institutions 
already address corporate-related human rights issues, and this capacity could be strengthened 
and extended. 
</p>
<p>134. Finally, redress through the legal system for corporate infringements of human rights was 
discussed. One speaker expressed concern regarding the slowness and inaccessibility of the court 
system. It was agreed that courts were always needed as a backstop to other types of 
mechanisms, and for some types of grievances, such as those raising issues of criminal liability, 
they were indispensable. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  Beyond the &#8220;sphere of influence&#8221;? 
</b></p>
<p>135. This session addressed the question of<i> when </i>the corporate responsibility to respect human 
rights applies, and <i>how</i> a company delineates the sphere within which it will be expected to take 
steps to do no harm. Since the launch of the United Nations Global Compact, the concept of 
&#8220;sphere of influence&#8221; has been commonly accepted as an analytical tool to delineate the scope of 
company responsibilities, though the practical application of the concept still gives rise to 
confusion and disagreement. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>136. Sphere of influence is not about what <i>rights</i> companies must respect, but rather about <i>when 
</i>and <i>where</i> companies must take steps to ensure that they respect human rights. While the 
concept of sphere of influence has been compared to a State&#8217;s jurisdiction, within which its 
human rights obligations apply, a corporate sphere of influence cannot be similarly defined by 
geographic boundaries. 
</p>
<p>137. Two members of the SRSG&#8217;s team recently published an article in <i>Ethical Corporation 
</i>magazine that sought to clarify the concept of corporate sphere of influence. The article argued 
that the concept as previously articulated lumped together too many disparate concepts, such as 
control, causation, physical proximity, benefit, and political influence, and thus was unable to 
provide crisp policy guidance to companies and stakeholders.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>138. Some participants suggested that just because a company may have influence or power 
over an entity that affects human rights does not necessarily mean that it has a <i>responsibility</i> for 
those human rights impacts. Participants generally agreed that factors such as control, causation, 
and benefit need to be part of the formula for assigning responsibility. But more uncertainty 
surrounded the relevance of geographic proximity and political influence. 
</p>
<p>139. If a company causes harm, or if it controls an entity causing harm, most participants agreed 
that the harm would fall within the company&#8217;s sphere responsibility to respect human rights. 
Control of another entity might exist when the company has a direct contractual relationship with 
the entity causing the impact, or perhaps if it buys a high percentage of a supplier&#8217;s output. 
Similarly, where a company&#8217;s product is directly causing harm, and such an outcome was 
foreseeable, the harm may be the responsibility of the company. Some participants also found it 
reasonable that companies benefiting directly from the human rights violations by others might 
have some responsibility for the harm. However, it was unclear how direct that benefit needs to 
be and whether the violation would need to be supported by the company. 
</p>
<p>140. Most participants agreed that when a company has political influence over a third party 
that is harming rights, but the harm is neither conducted on the company&#8217;s behalf nor otherwise 
linked to the company&#8217;s activities, the company may not be responsible for that harm, although it 
may well face reputational risks by remaining silent. 
</p>
<p>141. Participants indicated that several additional concepts may be relevant to delineating the 
scope of a company&#8217;s responsibility to respect human rights, including knowledge, duration, and 
severity of the human rights impact. 
</p>
<p>142. It was suggested that the SRSG continue exploring the concept of sphere of influence and 
how it may become a more useful tool for companies from different sectors, including those 
without major physical footprints.

</p>
<p><b>J.  Corporate complicity 
</b></p>
<p>143. Many of the charges made against corporations for failing to respect human rights allege 
corporate complicity in human rights violations committed by others. The SRSG&#8217;s mandate 
requests him to clarify the implications of the concept of complicity in the corporate context. The 
session aimed to explore both the legal and non-legal dimensions of the concept. 
</p>
<p>144. The discussion focused primarily on international criminal law definitions of complicity, 
which have been employed by international tribunals and domestic legal systems. The 
International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) presented preliminary findings from an expert panel 
that was established in 2005 to clarify the legal standard for corporate complicity in violations of 
human rights. The expert said that the preliminary findings of the panel suggest that three 
elements could or should qualify an act or omission as complicity: conduct that enables a 
violation to occur where the violation could not have occurred without that contribution; that 
exacerbates the violation&#8217;s impact; and or that facilitates the violation. Being a silent onlooker 
would almost never by itself lead to a legal ruling of complicity, though in a very small number 
of situations where companies carry great influence over the perpetrator, such silence could be 
construed as a sign of approval and thus constitute support. 
</p>
<p>145. In relation to the required knowledge to establish complicity, the expert panel found that a 
company need not have desired that the violation occur for it to be found complicit. Rather, it 
simply must have had knowledge that its conduct was likely to contribute to a human rights 
violation - such a result must be reasonably foreseeable, although it is not clear whether the 
standard is actual knowledge or that the company &#8220;should have known&#8221;. Participants expressed 
concern that the requirement of actual knowledge could lead to companies seeking to &#8220;know 
less&#8221; in order to avoid being found complicit. The SRSG is currently reviewing the draft report 
of the expert panel. 
</p>
<p>146. Participants also discussed steps a company can take to avoid allegations of complicity. 
Companies may be accused of complicity even where there is little chance they would be found 
legally liable. Therefore, many companies view the issue as part of a reputational rather than 
legal risk analysis. It was suggested that as part of their due diligence companies incorporate 
human rights clauses into their business contracts. 
</p>
<p>147. One participant suggested that when companies operate in conflict zones, stakeholders may 
expect the company to show that they are part of the solution by promoting and fulfilling rights 
to avoid being seen as complicit. Several participants responded that while companies may 
undertake additional responsibilities in particular cases, the corporate responsibility to respect 
human rights encompasses a responsibility to ensure that corporations are not complicit in acts 
that harm rights, and that this standard applies irrespective of any additional commitments made 
by a company. 
</p>
<p><b>K.  When standards come into conflict 
</b></p>
<p>148. As multinational companies try to meet their responsibility to respect human rights, they 
may encounter situations where international human rights standards conflict with local law, or </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>where local law to protect human rights is not enforced. The session focused on approaches that 
companies should consider when operating in such situations to ensure themselves and others 
that they are not violating rights. 
</p>
<p>149. Participants agreed that companies must take steps to ensure that they are not violating 
rights. Reference was made to a recent paper by the International Organisation of Employers, 
the International Chamber of Commerce, and Business and Industry Advisory Committee to 
the OECD, which states that companies &#8220;are expected to obey the law, even if it is not 
enforced, and to respect the principles of relevant international instruments where national law 
is absent&#8221;.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>150. When a company faces not the absence of legal standards or their enforcement, but an 
outright conflict between national and international standards, it was suggested that the company 
should articulate guiding principles in support of human rights; outline the steps it is taking to 
deal with the conflicting standards; engage third parties for assurance and evaluation of its 
actions; and disclose as much of the human rights-related information about the situation as 
possible. 
</p>
<p>151. The company also could adopt a standardized process that includes expert consultation 
when considering entering a new market; create a company-wide clearinghouse of policies and 
approaches to dealing with human rights dilemmas, and engage with home and host 
Governments, alone or with other companies and stakeholders. Participants noted that when 
Governments do take steps to enforce their human rights obligations, companies should be 
supportive. 
</p>
<p><b>L.  Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>152. The consultation focused on the question of how companies can ensure that they respect 
human rights. Further discussion and elaboration is needed concerning some of the difficult 
conceptual and operational issues the consultation addressed. Nevertheless, there was broad 
acceptance of the underlying premise of the consultation, that companies have a responsibility to 
respect human rights, and of due diligence as a useful overarching concept enabling companies 
to operationalize the responsibility to respect. This marks an important contribution to the work 
of the SRSG as he moves forward in developing a new framework for the business and human 
rights discourse along the lines outlined in the introduction: the State duty to protect against 
human rights abuses by third parties, including business; the corporate responsibility to respect 
human rights; and the need to create more effective remedies to address corporate-related human 
rights disputes.

</p>
<p><b>V. CORPORATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS: ACCOUNTABILITY 
MECHANISMS FOR RESOLVING COMPLAINTS AND DISPUTES 
</b></p>
<p>153. On 19-20 November 2007, the Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative at Harvard 
University&#8217;s Kennedy School of Government hosted a multi-stakeholder workshop as part of its 
project &#8220;Corporations and Human Rights: Accountability Mechanisms for Resolving Complaints 
and Disputes&#8221;. This was the second of two such events organized in 2007, which brought 
together a core group of expert stakeholders to consider how to improve the effectiveness of 
extrajudicial grievance/dispute resolution mechanisms in the business and human rights arena. 
Participants included experts from NGOs, government, business, multi-stakeholder initiatives, 
financing institutions, lawyers, mediators, investment funds and academia. 
</p>
<p>154. Discussion was divided between two levels of non-judicial grievance mechanism: those 
located in institutions at the national, industry/multi-industry and international levels; those 
located at the operational level, specific to a corporate project or site. 
</p><p>155. The debate also considered how mechanisms at these two levels do and/or should relate to 
each other, and what new mechanisms might be needed to fill gaps or supplement the growing 
&#8220;system&#8221; of extrajudicial grievance processes. 
156. Discussions were founded on the following starting assumptions: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Effective judicial processes are of fundamental importance in any society to the 
accountability of non-State actors for the respect of human rights. They should be 
supported 
</p>
<p>&#8226; However, these institutions remain weak in many States, and even in societies with 
strong rule of law institutions many grievances do not raise clear legal issues providing 
a basis for litigation; and court processes may be too long and expensive for 
complainants to see them as a viable avenue for remedy 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Moreover, parties often have a shared interest in addressing grievances as early as 
possible before they escalate to the point of litigation 
</p>
<p>&#8226; So extrajudicial mechanisms have an important, complementary role to play in the 
context of business and human rights, whilst they must be careful not to undermine the 
continuing crucial role and development of judicial processes 
</p>
<p>157. The following documents were on the table as a platform for discussions:

</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Principles for Effective Human Rights-Based Grievance Mechanisms&#8221; - draft 
principles for the design of rights-based grievance mechanisms at the company level 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Discussions at the workshop were conducted under the Chatham House Rule of 
non-attribution. This report is designed to capture the key issues and ideas that emerged 
</p>
<p><b>A. Session 1: Enhancing the network of extrajudicial grievance mechanisms 
in the business and human rights arena 
</b></p>
<p>158. In this session, discussion groups looked separately at the role and experience of: 
</p>
<p> (a) National-level mechanisms (National Human Rights Institutions, OECD National 
Contact Points, industrial relations dispute bodies etc.); 
</p>
<p> (b) Multi-stakeholder and industry initiatives (e.g. Fair Labor Association, Social 
Accountability International, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, the 
Equator Principles etc.); and 
</p>
<p> (c) Multilateral institutional initiatives (within the World Bank Group, regional 
development banks etc.) as well as the links and gaps between these tiers. 
</p>
<p><b>National level 
</b></p>
<p><i>Role of government 
</i>159. There was broad agreement on the need for greater attention to the role of government and 
judiciaries in addressing disputes between companies and their stakeholders at the national level. 
Strong judicial systems were essential to accountability. They could also provide useful 
incentives for non-State actors to resolve disputes directly, without going to litigation. Equally, 
extrajudicial grievance processes should where possible involve those Government officials with 
responsibility for overseeing the relevant standards, in order to reinforce their role. 
</p>
<p>160. One of the roles identified for State institutions was to help redress imbalances in power 
that typically characterized conflicts between communities or workers and companies. Yet there 
was scepticism from some that the State could be an effective arbiter of disputes. Government 
was not monolithic, but represented different views and interests across departments and even 
individuals. In the context of disputes, a Government might variously be a convener of other 
actors, a defendant, a promoter of investment etc. In this context, some felt that most OECD 
National Contact Points carried fundamental design flaws: the often partial role of government; a 
resulting reticence to deliver clear findings of non-compliance; and a lack of incentives or 
requirements for companies to engage in the NCP process. 
</p>
<p><i>Collaborative approaches 
</i></p>
<p>161. One discussant reported that of the 65 cases of alleged corporate human rights abuse 
surveyed in the first report of the SRSG on business and human rights, 38 had related to the 
extractives sector. While they ranged from situations entirely within the company&#8217;s control to </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 37 
 
</p>
<p>those entirely beyond its control, a study had shown that nearly all sat in the middle, with shared 
responsibility. So a key question had to be how to get different actors - corporate, government 
and civil society - working together in the national context to address disputes. 
</p>
<p>162. Another participant noted that disputes in the extractives sector frequently related to 
communities&#8217; concerns that they were not benefiting from an investment. Multilateral 
institutions, Governments (host and donor) and companies needed to work together to align local 
social investment strategies and build local government capacity such that fiscal revenues were 
managed in a positive and participatory manner. 
</p>
<p><i>Cultural preferences 
</i>163. A participant from one developing country noted that their history under dictatorship had 
left the legal system widely discredited. The democratic government of today was therefore more 
interested in ombudsman approaches to dispute handling. Eighty per cent of cases going to one 
ombuds office had been resolved through mediation. The ombudsperson could, of course, not 
bind parties. A participant from another developing country noted that the adversarial win/lose 
nature of lawsuits sat ill with their culture. Experience suggested they could worsen both the 
dispute and relations between those involved. It was better to start with grievance mechanisms at 
the company level, moving on to locally-based multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) and then up 
the line from there before going to national courts. 
</p>
<p><b>Industry/multi-stakeholder initiative level 
</b></p>
<p><i>Risks 
</i></p>
<p>164. Some participants felt that multi-stakeholder initiatives were inherently sub-optimal 
arrangements. In a worst-case scenario, host Governments wanted them to substitute for 
necessary regulation; home Governments promoted them in patronizing ways; companies 
exploited them to enhance image and keep litigation at bay; and international NGOs wished 
them to fail to prove a need for global regulation, even though local NGOs often wanted the 
quick, local remedy they might provide. 
</p>
<p><i>Bridging roles 
</i></p>
<p>165. Others noted that while MSI and industry initiatives had their limitations, they provided an 
important bridging role where government-driven checks on compliance with standards were 
absent or deficient. Some thought they were not necessarily a temporary bridge: as national 
capacity expanded, their bridging role might evolve to address different needs. Another 
participant noted that in a post-conflict environment there was little State capacity to provide for 
dispute resolution and some southern Governments were naturally reluctant to take prescriptions 
from northern Governments and multi-stakeholder initiatives. So NGOs and companies may 
have no option but to step in collaboratively to build mechanisms that could address grievances. 
</p>
<p>166. One discussion group suggested that MSIs provided important platforms to advance 
both standards and grievance handling, but needed to move to a new level. It could be a 
deepening - pushing individually for higher standards and tighter accountability - or a </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 38 
 
</p>
<p>broadening - bridging between existing MSIs or even bringing them under a single, common 
tent. There at least needed to be greater cross-learning between these initiatives, going beyond 
the limited experiment of the Jo-In project linking six MSIs in Turkey. The FLA&#8217;s grievance 
process was suggested by some as a best practice model. 
</p>
<p>167. Another challenge was to look at cultural transferability. The basic model of bringing 
actors with different interests together to find answers to common problems was relevant to 
different cultures. But existing MSIs and industry initiatives were largely European and 
American and needed to bridge to other regions. 
</p>
<p><b>Multilateral/international level 
</b></p>
<p><i>Leverage 
</i></p>
<p>168. Some thought World Bank and regional development bank grievance processes would 
have a declining role in light of the surge in investment from sovereign wealth funds, other 
emerging economy investors and private equity. As the multilateral banks became decreasingly 
competitive financiers, their leverage to oversee and enforce compliance with standards would 
equally reduce. 
</p>
<p>169. Others stressed that these institutions still retained significant strategic leverage but needed 
to do more to use it to achieve remedy. Whilst it was true that, for instance, World Bank 
grievance processes could handle only a limited number of disputes a year, the outcomes of 
those processes were carefully watched by many actors and often had a much wider impact and 
value. One participant suggested that the outcomes of World Bank grievance processes should 
have validity in other forums. It was positive that Equator Principle banks were buying into the 
International Finance Corporation&#8217;s performance standards, helping them become the norm. But 
the same parallel in terms of compliance and remedy was yet to develop. 
</p>
<p><i>Awareness-raising 
</i></p>
<p>170. A particular challenge for multilateral/international level grievance mechanisms (though 
others as well) was spreading awareness about their existence and tackling the lack of capacity 
among local actors to access them effectively. It was suggested these institutions should take a 
stronger role at the local level - where many carried credibility - in building such awareness and 
capacity. Some suggested this challenge would be easier if the banks converged round some 
common principles and practices. They might also support the development of intermediate 
mechanisms such as ombuds functions. 
</p>
<p><b>Cross-cutting linkages/deficits/gaps 
</b></p>
<p><i>Understanding the options 
</i></p>
<p>171. One participant noted that the spirit of people the world over was to challenge the way 
things worked. The voice of local people was increasing, so absent relationships of trust, 
conflicts were inevitable. Grievance mechanisms were an opportunity to address this, but 
expectations had to be clear: was a mechanism going to provide a judgement on compliance or </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 39 
 
</p>
<p>a mediated agreement to a dispute? If both were combined in one mechanism, this could create 
competing and incompatible expectations. Parties to a dispute needed to know all their options 
and what they could deliver. People chose to mediate only where they thought it better than the 
alternatives. So those alternatives must be known - including judicial options. 
</p><p>172. Various participants emphasized the need for education on the different mechanisms, to 
raise awareness about what was available and how it worked and could be accessed. One 
participant underlined the importance of consumer awareness and markets in helping raise the 
bar not only on standards, but also on responsible dispute handling processes. This would then 
create an opportunity for business to respond to consumer demand. There might be a particular 
role for MSIs in educating customers/consumers. Governments also had a communication role in 
this regard. Some participants stressed the need to address all parties in raising awareness and 
capacity with regard to grievance processes. Empowering workers to claim their rights without 
building the capacity of management to understand their roles and responsibilities and respond 
appropriately could raise expectations without raising the ability to meet them. 
</p>
<p><i>Adopting rights-based approaches 
</i></p>
<p>173. Various participants argued for a rights-based approach to grievance mechanisms. This 
would place the focus on integrating human rights norms, standards and principles into the 
process of grievance mechanisms, whether or not the issues in dispute raised substantive human 
rights. It would emphasize principles of equality, equity, accountability, empowerment and 
participation. It was suggested that a rights-based approach could help make grievance 
mechanisms both more scalable and more culturally transferable. One participant underlined the 
importance of making the human individual central to grievance processes - rights-based 
approaches could be important in this regard. 
</p>
<p><i>Using multiplicity to advantage 
</i></p>
<p>174. The benefits of a diversified, multi-layered approach to grievance handling was stressed by 
one participant, drawing on the precedent of the labour rights arena, where processes provided 
by the ILO, International Framework Agreements, national labour mediators and tribunals, 
multi-stakeholder initiatives and civil society processes had all contributed to providing remedy 
and embedding rights in different and complementary ways. The question was how to transfer 
this experience across to other rights issues such as economic and social rights that were less 
widely accepted internationally. 
</p>
<p>175. It was stressed that the key question was not necessarily which level of mechanism was 
more appropriate or effective, but how to get the different levels to connect or work together to 
maximize their impact by combining their different leverage points. MSIs had the advantage of 
independence from Governments but were insufficient on their own because too many 
Governments and consumers did not care about their work. Banks had another type of leverage 
and angle on grievance processes. One speaker commented that grievance mechanisms that 
provided an immediate local point of access for complainants were important, but there needed 
to be a second point of recourse if they failed, with more of an appellate, fact-finding role. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p><i>Setting out clear standards 
</i></p>
<p>176. A number of participants noted that extrajudicial mechanisms suffered where there was a 
lack of clarity as to the human rights and other standards that applied. Even some institutions 
with their own codes and standards left them at a level of generality that made it difficult for 
companies to know exactly what was expected and for complainants to know when they had a 
real case for complaint. Another participant argued that disputes involving indigenous peoples 
often raised different rights issues and needed particular attention. These communities tended to 
focus less on a desire for remedy through compensation and more on their right to preserve their 
cultural identity. 
</p>
<p><i>Achieving scale 
</i></p>
<p>177. The challenge of achieving scale was emphasized across all kinds of mechanisms. They all 
had limited capacity to address grievances. Some speakers stressed that the scope for grievance 
mechanisms to scale up correlated with their simplicity of process. Companies and others could 
neither execute nor engage effectively with a process that was poorly devised or excessively 
complex. Some participants took the view that combating scale constraints was a lesser concern 
than achieving legitimacy and effectiveness. Where these latter goals were achieved, the 
mechanisms could still provide added value, whatever scalability they offered. 
</p>
<p><i>Measuring effectiveness 
</i>178. The absence of means to measure the effectiveness of these mechanisms was raised 
repeatedly. Some argued for a common set of substantive human rights standards as a 
necessary starting point to measure effectiveness. Some suggested that the draft Principles for 
operational-level grievance mechanisms (see below) could usefully be adjusted as process 
standards for these other levels in the system. Measurable performance indicators could then be 
further developed and assessed. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Session II, part 1: Company-based human rights grievance mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>Purposes 
</b></p>
<p>179. Various participants stressed the need to improve how grievances were handled at the 
factory/company level. The focus had for too long been on top-down systems of monitoring and 
auditing. Bottom-up grievance processes were key not only to empowering aggrieved parties to 
raise their voice but also to making them part of the solution. Since there were scale limits on 
what MSIs and other institutional mechanisms could offer in addressing grievances, resolving 
the majority at the local level was also crucial for the whole &#8220;system&#8221; to function. 
</p><p>180. Another discussant noted that many major companies would say they already took a 
transparent, accountable, consultative approach to addressing grievances and disputes. The 
deficit was often in getting them to mainstream these principles into their management systems 
so that they were not compromised at the first serious challenge or tension in their own interests. 
It would help in this regard to have a set of guiding principles as a tool. The value of a grievance 
system was precisely in its being systematic, providing robust and predictable processes for all. 
Ad hoc responses to disputes were much weaker procedurally and therefore often substantively. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 41 
 
</p>
<p>181. A couple of participants suggested that process benchmarks for grievance mechanisms 
could be important for socially responsible investors as indicators of human rights performance, 
and could be combined with indicators on human rights impact assessments and transparency as 
a much better guide to performance than the existence or content of a human rights policy alone. 
</p>
<p><b>Potential and limitations 
</b></p>
<p>182. A number of participants noted distinctions between compliance, adjudication and 
dispute resolution. One suggested that where a company was working to clear standards, it was 
well-placed to assess compliance when someone alleged a breach. But disputes may not relate to 
any predefined standards - they may rather reflect needs and desires. This required more 
innovative processes built by communities and companies together - project mechanisms more 
than company mechanisms. Other participants took the view that companies should not be the 
last word even on compliance - they were judging themselves. And a grievance might reflect 
human rights considerations even where specific standards were not in place or had not been 
agreed. 
</p>
<p>183. One participant stressed the need to use terminology carefully. The vindication of rights 
belonged in an adjudicative process rather than a problem-solving one. This could not be 
delivered at the company level but required an independent external body. However, 
adjudicative processes were not able to recognize the legitimate conflicting forces that were 
often at play in a complex problem. Another participant suggested the key question was how to 
articulate the relationship between the two types of process - how could one make this 
relationship between problem-solving and adjudication work as part of a continuum or a system. 
</p><p>184. It was agreed that mechanisms at this operational/project-level had to be part of a wider 
system, wherever possible backstopped by effective judicial mechanisms. They had value in 
themselves if done right, but could only be one part of the answer to the need for remedy. Most 
agreed they could not provide a solution where they could not deliver a fair process, and the 
appearance of fairness. This was the case where disputes raised questions of criminal liability. It 
may also be the case where the safety of individuals was at risk or in zones of bad governance or 
conflict (see &#8220;government role&#8221;, p. 8). 
</p>
<p><b>Management systems 
</b></p>
<p>185. It was noted that some company management systems inevitably led to more grievances by 
providing inappropriate reward structures to staff. For instance, they might reward high numbers 
of MOUs signed with communities rather than measures of the quality and inclusiveness of 
engagement. This encouraged hasty and questionable deals with local individuals. Another 
comment was that some management systems failed to hold responsible those in a company who 
generated grievances, e.g. an accounting department that delayed paying land compensation to 
locals. The Community Relations Department therefore became a fire-fighter for other 
departments&#8217; errors, the same grievances recurred, and there was no institutional learning. There 
was a case for reviewing management systems through a grievance perspective to remove such 
obstacles to effective stakeholder engagement. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p>186. One participant stressed that any grievance mechanism that did not prioritize and 
mainstream relationships would not work. On the company side, a single individual with the 
right skills could make the difference in building relations with a community. But where every 
complaint or disagreement was run through the legal department, relations rarely worked. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarity, predictability and transparency of process 
</b></p>
<p>187. Many participants stressed the need for any mechanism to provide clarity as to what 
function it could and would provide, what it could not do, and what alternatives were available. 
This was essential to enable informed decisions and avoid false expectations. The process 
offered must be timely, predictable and transparent in order to be fair. An appropriately 
constituted local multi-stakeholder group to oversee the mechanism and its funding was crucial 
for credibility. 
</p>
<p><b>Representation 
</b></p>
<p>188. Some participants noted the challenge of identifying who should be involved in a dispute 
resolution process and who represented what groups or interests. It was suggested that this could 
only be answered in the specific context. And the parties had to take responsibility for who 
represented them - nobody should play kingmaker. Others noted that community leaders at times 
failed to take account of gender, caste or other inequities, so it could be too culturally relativistic 
to expect that existing local leadership would be fairly representative. There was a risk of 
incorporating and compounding local prejudices within the process. Another participant recalled 
experience of communities being highly susceptible to outside influence in their choice of advice 
and representation, bringing in individuals with their own agendas who could hijack the process. 
Ideally there should be safeguards to prevent this. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Session II, part 2: Draft principles for effective company-based 
human rights grievance mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>189. This session focused discussion specifically on the draft Principles developed under the 
project, which had been circulated to workshop participants prior to the meeting. 
<b>Viability 
</b></p>
<p>190. Many participants thought that the Principles - or an amended version of them - had a 
valuable contribution to make. They could help companies see how to incorporate appropriate 
grievance processes into their management systems and help socially responsible investment 
funds institute benchmarks of good practice for assessing companies. 
</p>
<p>191. Some participants proposed that the Principles should be presented as a tool for all 
stakeholders, not just companies. Communities and other affected groups could equally use them 
to demonstrate what they expected of companies and to help them in the joint design process. As 
such, they could be an empowering tool for these groups. At the same time, it was stressed that 
grievance mechanisms were not stakeholder engagement writ large. Rather, grievance 
mechanisms were a single, coherent part of a larger set of strategies for responsible engagement 
and risk management. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 43 
 
</p>
<p>192. While some queried whether the Principles could gain purchase beyond western companies 
and, indeed, beyond the &#8220;usual suspects&#8221; within the West, others felt that they could also be of 
interest, e.g. to Chinese companies as a model of international best practice. While the Principles 
could be presented as rights-focused, through another lens they were about relationship-building 
and addressing problems before they became acute. This latter perspective may have traction 
beyond States that were receptive to rights terminology. 
</p>
<p>193. Various people suggested that the Principles should be cast as guidance, for risk of being 
seen as a set of rigid standards as against guidelines for a design process. Others noted a concern 
that they not be used as a tick-box exercise or manipulated such as to abuse power differentials. 
Some kind of quality check was needed (see &#8220;accountability&#8221;, p. 9). 
</p>
<p>194. One participant noted that most disputes arose in a situation of pre-existing distrust, which 
made it hard to work together. Building a platform for collaboration might be a prerequisite to 
addressing a dispute. Another noted that this argued for having a grievance process in place from 
the start of an investment or project, before problems arose. Proposing a jointly-created 
grievance mechanism may itself help build trust. 
</p>
<p><b>Framing the scope of application 
</b></p>
<p>195. Various participants suggested that the framing of the draft Principles might be broadened 
in one or more of three directions: (a) from a focus on substantive human rights disputes to a 
broader rights-based approach to handling any kind of dispute; (b) from a focus on specific 
sectors to a broader application across other sectors; (c) from the company level to other levels 
of grievance mechanism, including MSIs and industry initiatives and multilateral/international 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>196. There was broad support for focusing the document on rights-based approaches to handling 
all grievances, including but not limited to those that raised substantive human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>197. Views differed on the Principles&#8217; applicability across wider sectors. Some felt they might 
be less applicable in sectors where the safety of complainants was often at stake or where 
disputes frequently reflected irreconcilable conflicts of interest between parties, such as a 
community rejecting the very presence of a company in its midst. Others suggested that it was 
certain kinds of grievance that could not be handled at the company level, rather than sectors 
themselves that were excluded. However, SMEs, SOEs and the informal sector might face 
particular practical challenges in implementing the Principles. Some felt there was good potential 
for applying the Principles to grievance mechanisms above the operational level and that this 
should be explored in discussion with MSIs and others. One discussion group suggested that the 
Principles might apply differently at different stages of a dispute or conflict, or that different 
types of mechanism might be needed at the different stages. This might be examined through 
some road-testing. 
</p>
<p><b>Government role 
</b></p>
<p>198. A common theme was the need to bring out more clearly in the draft Principles the 
potential role of government, while acknowledging that the document could not be too </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p>prescriptive since government in some places was a potential part of solutions and in other places 
an entrenched part of the problem. However, mechanisms should not ignore or undermine State 
responsibility with regard to the implementation of human rights. 
</p>
<p>199. A distinction was drawn between States with weak governance and States with bad 
governance. In the former, there were opportunities to enhance the State&#8217;s role by involving 
relevant officials in a grievance process, even if just as observers. This could influence policies 
and build capacity in the medium term. In zones of bad governance characterized by systematic 
abuses the challenge of engaging government was greater as it required shifting their entire 
approach. Interestingly, some felt company/operational level mechanisms were least likely to be 
viable in these setting, while others felt that this was where they were most essential. 
</p>
<p><b>Power imbalances 
</b></p>
<p>200. The challenge of appropriately addressing power imbalances between the company and 
other stakeholders was a recurring point of discussion. There was broad agreement on the need 
for particular attention to redressing this disparity. One participant noted that conflict was 
sometimes the only leverage communities had and it would be problematic if a local grievance 
mechanism neutralized that with a technical fix. Another suggested that the first Principle, 
requiring joint design of the grievance mechanism by all stakeholders was fundamental to 
addressing power imbalances as well as to building legitimacy. 
</p>
<p><b>Measuring effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>201. Many participants stressed the importance of good Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), 
both from the perspective of the company and of external observers. Most felt that it was 
dangerous to include a KPI on the number of complaints received - a high number of complaints 
may well be a sign of a good mechanism that provided access and carried confidence. This 
should be encouraged, not discouraged in any indicators. That said, some thought that combining 
a quantitative measure of a decline in grievances <i>over time</i> with a qualitative survey of 
stakeholder satisfaction with the mechanism could be a good indicator of effectiveness. Whilst 
stakeholder satisfaction with outcomes might be one measure, some suggested it was even more 
important to test complainants&#8217; satisfaction with the process - getting this right was essential to a 
mechanism&#8217;s credibility. Other suggested measures were a reduction in &#8220;incidents&#8221; - i.e. 
manifestations of a grievance outside the mechanism; a reduction in complaints taken to other 
mechanisms; and reduced recurrences of similar grievances. 
</p>
<p><b>Cultural preferences 
</b></p>
<p>202. It was suggested that the Principles acknowledge explicitly that local cultures may have 
their own dispute resolution mechanisms, cultures or approaches. It was important not only to 
avoid undermining local legal mechanisms, but also to work in collaboration with, or at least in a 
manner consistent with, local non-judicial mechanisms where possible. This reinforced the need 
to design any mechanism jointly with local stakeholders. Again, this was caveated by the need to 
place cultural specificity within overarching principles of fair process and inclusion of the 
vulnerable. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 45 
 
</p>
<p><b>Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>203. Some flagged the risk that the Principles might be manipulated by a powerful corporate 
actor - whether consciously or unconsciously. It was suggested there should be an accountability 
mechanism for the Principles, testing whether they were being applied appropriately and in good 
faith. 
</p>
<p>204. Where grievances involved substantive issues of human rights, it was seen as important to 
involve human rights expertise to ensure that these processes did not reinterpret or undermine 
basic human rights standards. Not all mediated agreements would otherwise pass the test of 
international human rights standards. And there was a risk that the Principles might otherwise be 
taken to imply that implementing human rights standards was a negotiable option, which it 
clearly was not. Again this was a point where Governments should ideally be guarantors. If they 
could not or would not take this role, other means of assurance would be needed. 
</p>
<p><b>Resource limits 
</b></p>
<p>205. A number of participants noted that the demands of applying the Principles might limit 
their application to large, well-resourced companies. But one group thought it might be possible 
to produce a version that could reasonably be implemented by smaller enterprises. At root the 
Principles should be the same, but how they were applied would differ according to size and 
resource. One participant reflected that multiple small or medium-sized enterprises such as 
supply factories could form a collective grievance mechanism in line with the Principles, sharing 
resources and reducing costs. The Principles could be particularly helpful for designing such 
joint approaches. 
<b>Next steps 
</b></p>
<p>206. Many felt it important now to do some form of road-testing and then revisit the Principles 
with that learning in mind. This could help test the universality of the Principles&#8217; applicability 
across countries and sectors as well as different rights issues. It was suggested it would also be 
useful to test the Principles against companies&#8217; existing practices and to develop examples of 
some best practices, which would help to show that the Principles were practicable and good for 
business. 
</p>
<p>207. One participant underlined the importance of being able to &#8220;sell&#8221; the Principles to 
companies. Grievance mechanisms could not be done on the cheap - they linked to the 
fundamental question of how a company engaged with its affected stakeholders on a day-to-day 
basis. The Principles document was potentially very useful for companies, but should bring out 
clearly and simply what concrete first steps they would need to take to move forward. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Session III. Institutional innovations with regard to grievance mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p><b>Global ombuds function 
</b></p>
<p>208. One discussant highlighted the potential added value of a global ombuds function as a 
higher-level grievance mechanism. It would have to carry wide legitimacy and so could not </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p>be politically-driven. It should ideally be based on a common set of standards, which experience 
showed was hard to achieve. Key questions that would have to be answered in its creation were: 
</p>
<p>209. Could you establish such a function without common standards - could part of its role be to 
lay the groundwork for their development?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Could you establish such a function without a treaty, or would you need treaty backing 
for it to have authority? If so, that could take a couple of decades. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; What kind of institutional setting would help make it legitimate? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; How would it be resourced? Could you get industry to resource it? Would that 
compromise its integrity? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; How could you ensure it innovated rather than becoming a stale, litigious body able 
only to handle a couple of cases a year? 
</p>
<p><b>Institute for business and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>210. Another discussant noted that certain key initiatives in the business and human rights arena 
were coming to an end in the next two years, including the Business Leaders Initiative on Human 
Rights and the current SRSG mandate. They had produced a lot of outputs, on which future work 
should build. An Institute on Business and Human Rights might help take up the reins in 
advancing the agenda. Consultations were currently under way to explore thinking on the best 
role for such a body and how to build a multi-stakeholder framework for its work. One idea was 
that it provide a forum for stakeholders to debate human rights dilemma situations involving 
companies. It might also support the creation of information networks around grievance 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>Resource hubs 
</b></p>
<p>211. A third discussant reflected that there was a lack of information on how grievances were 
handled in practice, what the outcomes were and what good performance looked like. There 
were few qualitative or quantitative analyses in this area, of either judicial or alternative dispute 
resolution processes. As a result, one often ended up in rhetorical conversations about the 
options. Dispute cases remained very much in the private domain, as if they were something to 
be concealed. A resource hub or hubs might help people to share information on grievances and 
processes, create a space for innovation and learning among different grievance mechanisms, 
and take a data-driven approach to analysing the different frameworks for monitoring and 
evaluating performance. 
</p>
<p><b>Foreign investment accountability mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>212. One discussant presented a proposal for a Foreign Investor Accountability Mechanism 
(FIAM). This would focus on situations where multinational corporations had signed up to 
particular norms and standards but there was no mechanism to check compliance and hold them </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 47 
 
</p>
<p>to account to communities affected by their operations. The FIAM would receive complaints of 
non-compliance and provide an independent investigation and public reporting. Its membership 
would include companies, NGOs and other stakeholders, with care to avoid it being 
institutionally &#8220;captured&#8221; by any one group. Its rules and procedures would be decided 
collectively. For companies, it would provide a risk management tool, but one that was not a 
box-ticking exercise. Initiatives such as the Equator Principles or the Voluntary Principles could 
benefit from this kind of external mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b>Privatized national contact points 
</b></p>
<p>213. Another discussant focused on the prospect of privatizing OECD National Contact Points, 
as recently done by the Dutch Government. Currently, nobody really noticed the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Corporations. NGOs hardly knew they existed and companies knew 
but were not bound by them. In the Netherlands, ownership of the NCP had been passed to a 
quadripartite group whose members were from a labour union, NGO, academia and the private 
sector respectively. They could mediate complaints and promote the guidelines, not least as a 
means to dispute prevention. Furthermore, the 2007 G-8 Summit at Heiligendamm had appealed 
for the OECD, ILO and Global Compact to converge their efforts. Principles for effective 
grievance mechanisms could help support such a convergence and bring new cohesion across 
these mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>Linking existing mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>214. One participant noted the deficit of many existing mechanisms in terms of linking up with 
other parts of their home institutions and with each other. The Compliance/Advisor Ombudsman 
of the World Bank might audit a project, but the Board of Directors had no way of checking 
whether its findings had been addressed when they made their decisions. In one complaint to an 
NCP the case had been closed based on the fact that the company had signed the Global 
Compact, but without any check as to what that meant in practice. The Equator Principle Banks 
followed the IFC&#8217;s Performance Standards but not its compliance assessments, which were 
internal documents to the World Bank Group. These lines of communication needed to be fixed. 
</p>
<p><b>Supporting learning and building capacity 
</b></p>
<p>215. Another participant noted that there was a good amount of analysis of where companies 
were undermining human rights, but little on where they were helping to strengthen them. This 
gap could usefully be filled for positive learning purposes. Another deficit identified was in 
capacity-building, whether of a community, local government, company management or 
workers. Might there be scope for an equivalent of the Investment Climate Facility in the human 
rights arena to support country-level capacity-building, funded by companies, Governments, 
donor agencies and working with local universities or other entities? One participant noted a lack 
of follow-through once grievances were nominally resolved. Individuals often did not know how 
to access compensation funds or understand how they might best invest and use these resources. 
Experience showed such opportunities for development were often squandered for lack of such 
knowledge. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 48 
 
</p>
<p><b>Open-source networking 
</b></p>
<p>216. One risk that was highlighted with regard to some of the above proposals was that they 
would replicate existing &#8220;ghettoes&#8221; of the usual western actors, whilst talking predominantly 
about problems that occurred in non-western countries. Building on the suggestion for resource 
hubs, a number of comments revolved around the potential for &#8220;wiki&#8221;-style/open-source 
networks, developing a collaborative space or architecture that broke out of current elite 
conversations and set a low threshold for interested actors around the world to get engaged and 
move the debate beyond western paradigms. Many participants felt this could be more nimble 
than institutionalized processes with the politics they usually carried. One participant saw this 
kind of development as inevitable to some degree as new technologies stimulated horizontal 
communications. Others saw need for impetus from existing institutions to help promote this 
kind of network. There was a broad sense that combining the idea of resource hubs and networks 
with this kind of organic/open-source approach offered one of the areas of greatest potential 
going forward. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>217. The project leader concluded that she would: 
&#8226; Prepare and circulate a report of the workshop discussions. This would aim to capture 
</p>
<p>participants&#8217; main comments and ideas on meta-level mechanisms, which would 
provide food for continuing thought, discussion and analysis of how these mechanisms 
might best evolve. It would also cover comments on the draft Principles 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Revise the draft Principles in light of the comments received and circulate a new version 
to workshop participants prior to posting it on the CSRI and Business and Human 
Rights Resource Centre websites. Based on this version - which would still be a work in 
progress - the project would look at collaborating with various organizations to road-test 
and further refine the Principles in the course of 2008  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reflect on ideas for institutional innovations to address gaps in the current multi-level 
architecture of grievance mechanisms. Some were already being taken forward. The 
project might have a role to play in supporting &#8220;virtual&#8221; resource hubs and networks 
working in collaboration with other institutions  
</p>
<p>218. The project would continue to be driven by broad consultations across stakeholder groups 
and regions, with key documents posted on the CSRI and the Business and Human Rights 
Resource Centre websites. 
</p>
<p><b>VI. IMPROVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS PERFORMANCE OF BUSINESS 
THROUGH MULTI-STAKEHOLDER INITIATIVES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>219. &#8220;Improving the Human Rights Performance of Business through Multi-Stakeholder 
Initiatives&#8221; was one of a series of expert consultations convened on behalf of Professor 
John Ruggie in his capacity as Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 49 
 
</p>
<p>United Nations (SRSG) on the subject of business and human rights. The consultation began 
with the premise that it is the duty of States under international law to protect against human 
rights abuses. Yet, irrespective of the duties of States, there are strong arguments for companies 
to take responsibility as well. In his 2007 report to the Human Rights Council, the SRSG 
identified multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) as an important complement to the traditional 
State-based treaty-making and soft law standard-setting processes. But relatively little is known 
systematically about how - or indeed whether - particular features of these initiatives influence 
their effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>220. The consultation, convened by the Clean Clothes Campaign and hosted by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands in The Hague, brought some of the leading MSIs together 
with representatives from business, government, and civil society to address two interrelated 
objectives:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; First, to identify &#8220;good&#8221;, if not necessarily &#8220;best&#8221;, practices in the governance of 
multi-stakeholder initiatives, and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Second, to identify criteria for credible and effective implementation of supply chain 
codes of conduct 
</p>
<p>221. While exhibiting great diversity, MSIs generally are characterized by multi-stakeholder 
governance structures and activities, and by mechanisms for enforcement through mutual 
accountability, market leverage, and/or non-market pressures (both regulatory and 
non-regulatory). MSIs have emerged in response to governance gaps in which regulatory, 
judicial, and broader economic and political systems have failed - whether by intent or lack of 
capacity - adequately to protect human rights. If governance systems all worked the way they are 
supposed to, many participants felt, MSIs would be a much less important feature of the human 
rights landscape. 
</p>
<p>222. In some areas, MSIs may become new modes of governance, changing the traditional roles 
and relationships of the State and other actors. But even if MSIs are only transitional phenomena 
on a historical timescale, it is important to determine how to make best use of them in building a 
sustainable system for the protection and realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p>223. The consultation was structured around four primary topics:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; MSI Governance 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Role of Governments in MSIs 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Monitoring and Auditing 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Remediation  
</p>
<p>224. Throughout the discussion, participants highlighted successes and failures MSIs have had 
to date, as well as the opportunities and challenges they face going forward. For the purposes of 
this summary report, those successes, opportunities, and challenges are drawn out and 
summarized at the end of the document. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 50 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Governance of multi-stakeholder initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>225. There was broad agreement that credible MSIs shared at least the following six features: 
</p>
<p><b>Clarity of purpose 
</b></p>
<p>226. Participants felt it essential for MSIs to define clearly the scope of their mission, based on 
an accurate problem definition. The MSI&#8217;s value proposition in relation to the problem it is 
intended to redress should be easy to identify and articulate. 
</p>
<p>227. Some participants felt that a narrow focus was a success factor. For example, the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs) are not addressed to the full range of human 
rights challenges, but to the policies and practices of security forces guarding company assets. 
Similarly, the Ethical Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) alone will not solve the resource 
curse. A narrow focus helps manage expectations and prevents unsustainable mission-creep. 
</p>
<p>228. Others noted that an MSI&#8217;s problem definition must also be framed to attract relevant 
stakeholders, and communicated so as to generate a shared understanding among them. For 
instance, one MSI faced the misperception by a local government that its objective was in effect 
to create a monopoly amongst the companies involved. Another was accused of threatening the 
reputation of the host country. In a slightly different example, Chinese firms may be reluctant to 
join MSIs that frame their goals explicitly in terms of &#8220;human rights&#8221; - and yet they are not 
necessarily averse to components of human rights, disaggregated and framed in ways that are not 
considered threatening to the country&#8217;s political system. 
</p>
<p><b>Involvement of relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>229. &#8220;Relevant stakeholders&#8221; include, first and foremost, those with the power to address the 
problem defined. There is usually a challenge of getting the right mix of stakeholders, as the 
problem is often systemic, involving a wide range of actors across sectors and geographies. If the 
problem is defined broadly, a very high number of stakeholders will be implicated; if it is 
defined more narrowly, fewer will be. Collective power to fix the problem is also a function of 
sufficient seniority among the individuals involved, helping to ensure that organizational 
commitments and resources are available to follow through. There are also questions about who 
represents the victims or potential victims, and how to be sure that they are represented 
effectively. 
</p>
<p>230. Despite the systemic nature of most of the problems MSIs have been created to solve, there 
may be credibility reasons NOT to include certain stakeholders - for example, a corrupt 
Government. Often this decision is far from clear-cut. For most MSIs, the challenge is in 
deciding how wide to spread their wings. Is it more effective to be inclusive or like-minded? Is it 
better to let currently underperforming companies and other actors into the tent and then 
encourage them to improve from within? Or is it better to set barriers to entry and encourage 
them to improve in order to join? Similarly, is it credible for a group of companies to take an 
initiative on their own, while simply communicating externally with non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and other parties? Some say that it is not, while others say there is no need 
for companies acting collectively to dress up as an MSI, depending on the group&#8217;s objectives and </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 51 
 
</p>
<p>their performance in achieving them. Finally, the issue was raised about the legitimacy of 
stakeholders participating in MSIs when they are on record as opposing voluntary initiatives as a 
viable solution to human rights challenges, thereby possibly being in a position to create the 
self-fulfilling prophecy that voluntarism cannot work. Many of these questions remain 
unresolved. 
</p>
<p><b>Appropriate balance of power and responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>231. In addition to involving all relevant stakeholders, it is important to engage them in 
meaningful ways. This is a function of timing as well as their role in the governance and 
day-to-day operations of the MSI. On timing, many participants felt that all stakeholders should 
be involved as early as possible - i.e. at the &#8220;creation&#8221; stage of the MSI. On governance, many 
participants felt it was important to distribute decision-making power widely, though others said 
this should be considered on a case-by-case basis rather than being considered a foundational 
principle, cautioning that broadly-shared decision-making power could actually be 
counterproductive in some cases, depending on the MSI&#8217;s objectives. On day-to-day operations, 
many participants felt that the role of local stakeholders in particular should be clarified, 
strengthened, and made more integral to the MSI&#8217;s work - that local stakeholders&#8217; roles should 
go &#8220;beyond consultation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>232. Most MSIs require a clear commitment from members, at least those in the corporate 
sector. Participants in the consultation emphasized that the decision to make such commitment 
by joining an MSI was voluntary, but that once made, compliance was mandatory. To be 
credible, an MSI must have effective sanctions for non-compliance, based on a robust system for 
monitoring and measuring performance. Some initiatives require a probationary period (as in the 
International Council of Toy Industries&#8217; CARE programme, for example, which also requires 
members to hire social compliance officers during that period). Sanctions may include 
suspension or even expulsion. Participants had mixed views on the effectiveness of these 
sanctions. 
</p>
<p><b>Grievance mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>233. Participants felt that grievance mechanisms were important. They stressed that access by 
victims was critical not only to the effectiveness of any grievance mechanism, but also to the 
credibility of the MSI - whether it hosts the mechanism itself or mandates participating 
companies to host their own. Participants noted that MSIs that encourage complaints must be 
prepared to support those who incur legal or other forms of retaliation for making them. 
</p>
<p><b>Transparency 
</b></p>
<p>234. Participants had mixed views as to the optimal level of transparency for an MSI. However, 
there seemed to be consensus on <i>process </i>transparency as a minimum. It was felt that whether or 
not <i>content </i>transparency was desirable seemed to be a function of timing, consent of the parties, 
security risk to the victim, and other factors. One participant defined transparency not as 
100 per cent disclosure, but rather as &#8220;a systematic way for information to flow&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 52 
 
</p>
<p>235. There was broad agreement on these good governance principles. One participant also 
suggested that having a secretariat seems to be a success factor - some structure that can act on 
the MSI&#8217;s behalf. However, it was unclear whether/to what extent each of these governance 
principles actually contributes to operational effectiveness on the ground and improvements in 
people&#8217;s lives. The SRSG noted that there has been a tendency to define &#8220;effectiveness&#8221; in terms 
of institutional inputs, such as the way initiatives are structured, who gets to participate, their 
level of transparency, and so on. While such features may enhance MSIs&#8217; short-term social 
legitimacy and credibility, they do not necessarily translate into longer term effectiveness in 
solving the specific problems they are intended to address. Indeed, participants gave several 
examples of MSIs being increasingly overburdened by top-heavy governance structures that 
actually impede their ability to fulfil their core mission. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The role of Governments in multi-stakeholder initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>236. Participants had mixed views as to whether Governments should have roles in MSI 
governance. The consensus answer seemed to be &#8220;it depends&#8221; on the tasks at hand. It would 
make little sense to have a Kimberley Process or an EITI without government participation; the 
same may be true of the Voluntary Principles. But government participation can pose risks if it 
means other stakeholders will not speak freely, or if it compromises the perception of objectivity, 
neutrality, and independence of action which is so important to many MSIs. Lack of government 
participation can also pose risks, for example to the financial or political sustainability of the 
effort or its ability to get to the heart of the problem, particularly where it is clear that lack of 
strong State governance led to the initiative&#8217;s creation in the first place. 
</p>
<p>237. The consultation identified a number of ways Governments can support MSIs, in addition 
to or instead of becoming actively involved in MSI governance through Board membership or 
other means. Beyond funding, which was agreed NOT to be the most important contribution 
Governments could make, these include:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Convening and facilitating 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Endorsing 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Home government diplomacy with host Governments 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promoting and mainstreaming the learning from MSIs across industry sectors 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Educating consumers to help generate demand for responsible goods and services 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Aligning their roles in MSIs with other levers of corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
</p>
<p>238. Participants spent a considerable amount of time on this last form of support. Consultation 
participants agreed that the distinction between &#8220;voluntary&#8221; and &#8220;mandatory&#8221; was somewhat 
artificial; there is in fact a broad spectrum of ways Governments can incentivize participation in 
MSIs. Governments already, to some extent, use levers like export credit agencies, export 
promotion instruments, public procurement requirements, domestic credit facilities, trade and </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 53 
 
</p>
<p>investment agreements, and government pension funds to promote socially responsible 
behaviour by companies. Governments could use these levers more explicitly - and more 
systematically, and on a larger scale - to ensure corporate respect for human rights, e.g. through 
participation in MSIs. This would require interdepartmental coordination among agencies 
directly responsible for MSI participation or relations (if any), and agencies responsible for these 
various levers, such as ministries of development, foreign affairs, treasury, and trade, as well as 
embassies and diplomatic academies. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Monitoring and auditing 
</b></p>
<p>239. Participants felt that the social auditing model has been effective in identifying health and 
safety-type problems, but generally ineffective in identifying more fundamental, rights-based 
issues such as freedom of association, discrimination, harassment, and physical abuse. Social 
auditing models that do go beyond how to fix a blocked fire exit to these more fundamental 
issues - e.g. through collaboration with civil society groups - are difficult to scale for a variety of 
reasons. Participants seemed to agree that to address fundamental human rights issues at scale, 
social auditing and follow-up need to change dramatically. Among the challenges identified were 
quality and credibility; cost; and effectiveness. 
</p>
<p><b>Quality and credibility 
</b>240. Suggestions for improvement included hiring auditors through a multi-stakeholder 
committee; requiring auditors to go through an apprenticeship phase; continuous human rights 
learning and training for auditors; and periodic review of compliance criteria, drawing on 
international standards, local law, and auditors&#8217; experience. 
</p>
<p><b>Cost 
</b></p>
<p>241. Participants suggested that some redistribution of the cost of compliance and certification 
among suppliers and buyers up and/or down the value chain might be feasible in cases where 
certification actually adds value in the marketplace. Currently, costs are largely borne by 
suppliers without significant cost-sharing by buyers, even in the form of higher prices. 
</p>
<p><b>Effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>242. Among the many possible indicators of effectiveness one could use to evaluate social 
monitoring and auditing, the most important was effectiveness in catalyzing sustainable, 
systemic change in the context of the problem an MSI has been developed to address. 
</p>
<p>243. Participants suggested that social monitoring and auditing were limited in their ability to 
catalyze such change for a number of reasons, notably: 
</p>
<p>244. <b>They often fail to uncover the root causes of human rights violations. </b>To remedy a 
problem, we need to know why it is occurring. Participants suggested that needs and risk 
assessments could be useful supplements - or even substitutes - for social audits, providing the 
information MSIs need to identify not only problems but also potential solutions. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 54 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>They do not, in and of themselves, build the capacity required for change. </b>Several 
participants&#8217; experience indicates that explicitly linking capacity-building to monitoring 
and auditing greatly enhanced impact. With capacity-building, might monitoring and 
auditing be things we have to do only in the short term? Will workers eventually be able 
to identify and escalate issues on their own, and will managers eventually respond out 
of their own initiative? The importance of capacity-building is explored further below. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Remediation 
</b></p>
<p>245. Participants felt that to date, MSIs have had different degrees of success remediating 
abuses in different categories of rights. MSIs have had good success remediating problems of 
occupational health and safety, such as poor cleanliness and lighting. In contrast, they have had 
little success remediating abuse of employer-employee relationship-related rights, such as 
violations related to wages, overtime, and social security. With respect to freedom of association 
and collective bargaining participants seemed to agree that MSIs have had even less success. 
</p>
<p>246. Freedom of association and collective bargaining were described as enabling rights, needed 
to sustain any changes MSIs are able to make in the realization of other rights. MSIs&#8217; lack of 
success in this enabling category raised a key question: can remediation fix systemic problems or 
is it best suited for dealing with isolated incidents? Participants were unanimous that change has 
to be systemic, not piecemeal or one-off. They suggested that a &#8220;long fix&#8221; - as opposed to a 
&#8220;quick fix&#8221; - was required. Elements of a &#8220;long fix&#8221; would include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Empowering workers</b>, for example through education and awareness-raising, 
formation and capacity-building of workers&#8217; committees 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Building the capacity of suppliers</b>,<b> </b>for example through awareness and training for 
supervisors and managers. Some participants suggested that basic business process 
improvements - e.g. in scheduling, production planning, costing, and human resources 
management - could also help prevent violations of rights, either directly (by 
eliminating inefficiencies that lead to, for example, forced overtime) or indirectly (by 
providing MSIs with a &#8220;hook&#8221; on which to build relationships of trust). Other 
participants suggested that many suppliers were efficient and sophisticated enough 
already that such improvements were unlikely to be effective channels for further 
protection of rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Changing buyer&#8217;s policies and practices</b>, such as late confirmation of orders 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Building the capacity of States</b>, e.g. labour inspectorates 
</p>
<p>247. As discussed above, remediation is a response to non-compliance with a human or labour 
rights code or standard by a company. The objective is to achieve compliance with that code or 
standard. The term &#8220;remediation&#8221; or &#8220;remedy&#8221; can also be used to refer to efforts to redress past 
wrongs to victims through compensation, apology, or other means, which may or may not 
include compliance with a particular code or standard. Participants in the consultation agreed 
that these two types of remediation - remediation to come into compliance and remediation to 
redress past wrongs to victims - required different mechanisms, though changing corporate 
behaviour to prevent future wrongs could and possibly should be part of both types. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 55 
 
</p>
<p>248. With respect to remediation that seeks some form of redress for the victim, participants felt 
that dialogue-based alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms can be effective in some 
circumstances. At the same time, given that international human rights law requires States to 
ensure victims&#8217; rights to an effective remedy, participants asked how MSIs that sponsor 
ADR-based access to justice mechanisms should engage the national justice systems of home 
and host countries. Here again the answer was generally &#8220;it depends&#8221;, but participants agreed on 
the baseline need to ensure that what is offered is consistent with human rights standards, and to 
consider how that might strengthen and feed into national justice systems rather than provide 
only one-off solutions. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Successes 
</b></p>
<p><b>Issue validation 
</b></p>
<p>249. In the mid-1990s, human rights issues had little currency within the market system. There 
was general consensus amongst the participants that in varying degrees, MSIs since then have 
changed thinking and practice in global supply chains in most industries around the world. 
In 1992, for instance, it would have been highly unlikely for a company to take responsibility for 
human rights impacts on any workers it did not employ directly. Today it is commonplace for 
high-profile brands to take increasing responsibility for such actors. 
</p>
<p><b>Convening and mobilization 
</b></p>
<p>250. MSIs have succeeded in establishing the space and the precedent for stakeholders across 
sectors - in business, government, and civil society - to discuss and take action on problems in 
which they are all implicated. This reflects a notion of shared responsibility more appropriate 
than unilateral action to the complex nature of human rights issues. Participants stressed that 
MSIs&#8217; multi-stakeholder nature was more than just a process - it was a critical part of their 
impact on the ground. 
</p>
<p><b>Leadership quality 
</b></p>
<p>251. Through the process of engagement, MSIs have contributed to developing a class of 
leadership companies in a wide range of sectors. At the individual level, MSIs have helped to 
create and give outlet to a generation of boundary spanners working with one foot inside their 
organizations and one foot outside, translating across stakeholders and working to gain the 
traction internally to make change. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Opportunities and challenges ahead 
</b></p>
<p>252. Despite these achievements, consultation participants felt that the most important measure 
of success was on-the-ground change in people&#8217;s daily lives, and that here MSIs have thus far 
fallen short. Is it a question of implementation? Or, as one participant suggested, does it reflect 
&#8220;a basic inevitability about our mission&#8221;? MSIs have been set up to deliver public goods. Can 
they ever do that as effectively or as legitimately as the public agencies which exist to perform 
that role? </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
page 56 
 
</p>
<p>253. One speaker expressed the opinion that today&#8217;s MSIs are facing a mainstreaming<b> </b> period in 
their historical development, with two important implications. First, they must develop 
sustainable revenue models appropriate to their long-term goals. Second, they must move from 
largely tactical to strategic approaches. Today&#8217;s MSIs must think about the &#8220;end game&#8221; and 
engage in dynamic innovation and continuous self-reinvention to ensure they are fit for purpose. 
</p>
<p>254. Two of the most important strategic questions and challenges identified throughout the 
consultation were critical mass and the relationship of largely voluntary MSIs to the sphere of 
regulation. 
</p>
<p><b>Critical mass 
</b></p>
<p>255. Do MSIs really shift markets or only small niche areas within markets? There are very few 
MSIs that have even approached critical mass. Those that have generally work in industries 
where production is concentrated in a relatively small number of countries and/or companies, 
dominated by premium or high-profile brands with valuable reputations to protect. There are 
three categories of new players most MSIs must urgently seek to include if they are to achieve 
the kind of scale required to change entire systems or markets:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Emerging market companies (and countries) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Value brands 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Small and medium enterprises 
</p>
<p>256. Serious questions were voiced as to whether the kinds of levers MSIs traditionally use - 
such as public campaigns, ethical consumption, and elaborate civic engagement mechanisms - 
will work for these categories of players. Several participants suggested that the pressure for 
more &#8220;commodified&#8221; approaches was likely to increase, and would be reinforced by the 
introduction of ISO26,000, a &#8220;guidance&#8221; on social responsibility. One lever that was proposed 
was making MSI participation a condition of industry association membership, as ICTI has done 
in the toy industry. 
</p>
<p><b>Relationship to regulation 
</b></p>
<p>257. Critics often portray MSIs and voluntary standards generally as providing alternatives to or 
even means of escaping binding regulation. For most MSIs, however, the regulatory interface is 
much more complex. Some seek eventual public policy integration as a way of achieving scale, 
bringing in smaller firms, producers of commodities and other unbranded products, and 
companies and Governments from emerging markets which do not have other incentives to join. 
For others, the whole point is to get Governments to implement regulation they already have on 
the books. 
</p>
<p>258. Participants predicted that MSIs would need to focus more explicitly on their relationships 
to regulation in the future, for a variety of reasons. First, many leadership companies actually 
prefer regulatory solutions in some areas, where &#8220;level playing fields&#8221; are business-critical. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 
 page 57 
 
</p>
<p>Second, MSIs are proving to be interesting platforms for joint policy advocacy. And third, to the 
extent that MSIs begin to shift entire markets, they are more likely to come under scrutiny from 
regulators at the national and international levels on competition and trade policy grounds. 
</p>
<p>259. While participants agreed that different MSIs would necessarily have different &#8220;end 
games&#8221;, they also felt that MSIs share an opportunity to use their experience to feed into smart 
regulation in the areas in which they work. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>260. There are no easy answers or ready-made solutions to the challenges MSIs face in the 
current mainstreaming phase of their historical development. Yet participants felt that there were 
four strategic themes worth exploring further, as MSIs move forward toward systemic impact, 
sustainability, and scale: <b>going beyond monitoring, increasing local ownership, exploring 
strategic and operational integration with one another,</b> and <b>paying greater attention to 
actual drivers of operational effectiveness.</b>
