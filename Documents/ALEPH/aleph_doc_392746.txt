Unless  otherwise  indicated,  all  ﬁnancial  information  is  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in  Canada.  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  gross  reserves  or  gross  production  are  reserves  or  production
attributable to Husky’s interest prior to deduction of royalties; net reserves or net production are reserves or production
net of such royalties. Gross or net production reported refers to sales volume, unless otherwise indicated. Natural gas
volumes are converted to a boe basis using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one bbl of oil and natural gas liquids.
Unless  otherwise  indicated,  oil  and  gas  commodity  prices  are  quoted  after  the  effect  of  hedging  gains  and  losses.
Natural  gas  volumes  are  stated  at  the  ofﬁcial  temperature  and  pressure  basis  of  the  area  in  which  the  reserves  are
located. The calculation of barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and thousands of cubic feet equivalent (mcfge) are based on a
conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil.
Boes or mcfges may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A Boe conversion ratio of six mcf to one bbl is
based  on  an  energy  equivalency  conversion  method  primarily  applicable  at  the  burner  tip  and  does  not  represent  a
value equivalency at the wellhead.

DISCLOSURE OF EXEMPTION UNDER NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 51-101
Husky  believes  that  comparability  of  its  disclosures  with  those  required  in  its  major  capital  market,  the  United
States, is important to many of the investors and prospective investors in its securities. Accordingly, we applied for and
were granted an exemption by the Canadian securities regulators under the provisions of National Instrument 51-101
‘‘Standards  of  Disclosures  for  Oil  and  Gas  Activities’’  (‘‘NI  51-101’’).  The  exemption,  under  Section  8.4  of  the
Companion  Policy  to  NI  51-101,  permits  us  to  substitute  disclosures  required  by  and  consistent  with  those  of  the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (‘‘SEC’’)  and  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (‘‘FASB’’)  in  the
United States in place of much of the disclosure expected by NI 51-101. In accordance with the exemption, proved oil
and gas reserves data and certain other disclosures with respect to our oil and gas activities in this Annual Information
Form are presented in accordance with the following requirements:
) The FASB Statement No. 69 ‘‘Disclosure about Oil and Gas Producing Activities — an amendment of FASB
Statements No.’s 19, 25, 33 and 39’’ (‘‘FAS 69’’);
) FASB Current Text Section Oi5, ‘‘Oil and Gas Producing Activities’’ paragraph .103, .106, .107, .108, .112,
.160 through .167 and .174 through .184 and .401 through .408;
) SEC Industry Guide 2;
) SEC Item 102 of regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.102);
) SEC Item 302(b) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.302(b)); and
) The deﬁnitions and disclosures required by SEC Regulation S-X (CFR 210.4-10).
Proved  oil  and  gas  reserves  information  and  other  disclosures  about  oil  and  gas  activities  in  this  Annual
Information  Form  following  SEC  requirements  may  differ  from  corresponding  information  otherwise  required  by
NI 51-101. Proved reserves disclosed in this Annual Information Form are in accordance with the SEC deﬁnitions.
NI 51-101 speciﬁes that proved reserves be determined in accordance with the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation
Handbook (‘‘COGEH’’) deﬁnitions. There were no material differences between the oil and gas reserves determined
using  the  SEC  deﬁnitions  and  the  COGEH  deﬁnitions.  In  addition,  NI  51-101  requires  the  inclusion  of  probable
reserves and their associated future net revenue. The SEC does not normally permit the disclosure of probable reserves
in documents ﬁled with them.
The  SEC  requires  the  evaluation  of  oil  and  gas  reserves  to  be  based  on  prices,  costs,  ﬁscal  regimes  and  other
economic  and  operating  conditions  in  effect  at  the  time  the  evaluation  is  made  (‘‘constant  prices’’).  NI  51-101  also
requires the evaluation of oil and gas reserves on this basis but also requires an evaluation of oil and gas reserves to be
based on a forecast of economic conditions. In establishing the constant prices for bitumen NI 51-101 provides for a
different  interpretation  of  the  phrase  ‘‘price  will  be  the  posted  price  of  oil  and  the  spot  price  of  gas,  after  historical
adjustments for transportation, gravity and other factors’’. On January 20, 2005 the Canadian Securities Administrators
issued Staff Notice 51-315 ‘‘Guidance Regarding the Determination of Constant Prices for Bitumen Reserves under
National  Instrument  51-101  ‘‘Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Oil  and  Gas  Activities’’.  This  guidance  stipulates  that  for
establishing  the  constant  prices  for  bitumen  companies  should  use  the  posted  price  for  WTI  and  apply  the  average
annual  adjustment  for  transportation,  gravity  and  other  factors  that  create  the  difference  in  price  between  WTI  and
bitumen.  This  method  was  developed  primarily  in  response  to  the  ﬂuctuations  in  bitumen  prices  that,  for  various
reasons,  tend  to  experience  the  lowest  prices  at  the  end  of  the  calendar  year.  Under  the  FASB/SEC  rules  the
determination of constant price for bitumen does not permit the use of annual average differentials between WTI and
bitumen. These rules require the differentials prevailing on the last day of the period to be used to calculate the constant
price. As a result on December 31, 2004 the price for bitumen as established under the FASB/SEC formula was lower
than  the  price  established  under  NI  51-101.  There  is  no  difference  in  determining  the  constant  prices  for  crude  oil
classiﬁed as heavy oil, 10 to 20 degrees API, under NI 51-101 and FASB/SEC although heavy oil experiences the same
pricing patterns as bitumen.
NI  51-101  prescribes  a  relatively  comprehensive  set  of  disclosures  in  respect  of  oil  and  gas  reserves  and  other
disclosures about oil and gas activities. In comparison, the SEC prescribes a minimum set of disclosures and advises
not  to  approach  the  SEC  rules  and  regulations  as  merely  a  blank  form  but  encourages  registrants  to  provide  such
additional information that is necessary to further an investor’s understanding of the registrant’s business.

Husky  believes  that  its  reserves  evaluators  are  qualiﬁed  and  that  it  has  a  well  established  reserves  evaluation
process that is at least as rigorous as would be the case were we to rely upon independent reserves evaluators. Husky
has adopted written evaluation practices and procedures using the COGE Handbook modiﬁed to the extent necessary to
reﬂect the deﬁnitions and standards under U.S. disclosure requirements.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF HUSKY
Three Year History
In  January  2002,  the  Terra  Nova  development  project  commenced  production.  This  project  was  the  ﬁrst  Grand
Banks  ﬁeld  to  be  developed  with  a  ﬂoating  production,  storage  and  ofﬂoading  system.  We  have  a  12.51  percent
working interest in the Terra Nova oil ﬁeld.
In June 2002, Husky issued U.S. $400 million of 6.25% senior notes due June 15, 2012. The notes were sold at a
discount  price  of  99.545%  per  note  to  yield  6.312%.  The  notes  were  issued  under  a  U.S.  $1  billion  base  shelf
prospectus dated June 6, 2002. The proceeds were used to repay existing bank indebtedness and for general corporate
purposes.
On July 7, 2002, the Wenchang oil ﬁelds, 13-1 and 13-2, produced ﬁrst oil. These oil ﬁelds produce light crude oil
similar to the benchmark Minas blend from two production platforms into a ﬂoating production, storage and ofﬂoading
vessel stationed between the two ﬁelds. We have a 40 percent interest in the Wenchang oil ﬁelds.
In September 2002, Husky signed contracts with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (‘‘CNOOC’’) for
two exploration blocks in the South China Sea. The 23/15 block comprises 1,327 square kilometres and the 23/20 block
comprises  1,543  square  kilometres.  The  contracts  require  one  well  to  be  drilled  on  each  block  within  three  years.
CNOOC has the right to participate up to a 51 percent interest in any subsequent development.
In  November  2002,  we  announced  a  signiﬁcant  discovery  of  natural  gas  at  Shackleton,  Saskatchewan.  The
Company announced that development of the Shackleton area could add 250 bcf to proved reserves within two to three
years. Husky held more than 400 sections of land comprising 300,000 acres in this area in 2002.
In December 2002, Husky signed a contract with CNOOC for the 40/30 exploration block in the South China Sea.
The  block  comprises  approximately  6,704  square  kilometres  and  the  contract  requires  one  well  to  be  drilled  within
three years. CNOOC has the right to participate up to a 51 percent interest in any subsequent development.
In December 2002, Husky swapped, with its co-venturer, its working interest in the mining portion of its Kearl oil
sands property for its co-venturer’s interest in the in-situ portion of the property. As a result Husky now holds 100%
working interest in 57,600 acres of lands with in-situ potential. Husky’s property has been named ‘‘Sunrise.’’
Effective October 1, 2003, Husky purchased all of the outstanding common shares of Marathon Canada Limited
(‘‘Marathon’’) and the Western Canadian assets of Marathon International Petroleum Canada, Ltd. The total purchase
price  was  U.S.$588  million.  In  a  separate  concurrent  transaction  Husky  sold  certain  of  the  Marathon  properties  to
another  unrelated  company  for  total  proceeds  of  U.S.$320  million.  The  properties  retained  by  Husky  are  located
throughout western Alberta and north-eastern British Columbia. The acquisition added approximately 39.8 mmboe of
gross  proved  reserves,  of  which  75%  was  natural  gas,  and  729,000  acres  of  undeveloped  lands  in  Alberta,  British
Columbia and the Northwest Territories.
In November 2003, Husky announced that it had signed a contract with CNOOC for the 04/35 exploration block
in the East China Sea. The block comprises 4,835 square kilometres and requires one well to be drilled within the ﬁrst
three  years  of  the  contract.  CNOOC  has  the  right  to  participate  up  to  a  51  percent  interest  in  any  subsequent
development.
In November 2003, we established a securitization program to sell, on a revolving basis, up to $250 million of its
accounts receivable to a third party. The agreement includes a program fee based on Canadian commercial paper rates.
On June 18, 2004 Husky issued U.S. $300 million of 6.15 percent notes due June 15, 2019. The notes were priced
to yield 6.194 percent and are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time subject to a make-whole provision.
The  notes  are  unsecured  and  unsubordinated  and  rank  equally  with  all  its  other  unsecured  and  unsubordinated
indebtedness.
In August 2004 Husky ﬁled a base shelf prospectus that permits issue of up to U.S. $1 billion of debt securities or
the equivalent in other currencies during the 25 months that the prospectus is in effect.
Effective July 15, 2004, Husky acquired Temple Exploration Inc. for a cash purchase of $101.5 million plus the
assumption  of  $13.5  million  working  capital  deﬁcit.  The  acquisition  added  21.1  bcf  of  natural  gas  and  1.4  million
barrels of natural gas liquids to proved reserves as well as undeveloped land.
5
On August 16, 2004 we signed a production sharing agreement with the CNOOC for the 3,900 square kilometre
29/26 block in the South China Sea. The agreement requires us to drill one exploration well with the option to drill two
additional  exploration  wells  before  2011.  CNOOC  has  the  right  to  participate  in  subsequent  development  up  to
51 percent.
On  October  26,  2004  we  announced  an  agreement  to  acquire  our  co-venturer’s  interest  in  the  Madura  Strait
production  sharing  agreement  in  Indonesia.  Husky  now  holds  a  100  percent  interest  in  the  2,794  square  kilometre
exploration block, which contains two discoveries with commercial quantities of recoverable natural gas and natural
gas liquids.
In November 2004, Husky acquired three exploration licenses in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin offshore Newfoundland
and Labrador. We acquired a 50 percent working interest in 225,100 acres, a 100 percent working interest in 128,800
acres  and  a  100  percent  working  interest  in  208,200  acres.  All  three  parcels  are  near  Husky’s  White  Rose  oil  ﬁeld
currently under development.
Business Environment Trends
There are a number of trends that are developing, which may have both long and short-term effects on the oil and
gas industry in Canada. Conventional production of crude oil in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (‘‘WCSB’’)
has been in decline since 2000 and will, according to industry forecasts(1), continue to decline. Since 2000 increased
crude oil production from the WCSB has come from mining and in-situ production of bitumen and heavy crude oils.
Non-conventional production of crude oil is forecast(1) to increase overall crude oil production from the WCSB beyond
current  production  levels.  Natural  gas  discoveries  in  the  WCSB  have,  in  the  past  few  years,  been  made  in  smaller
reservoirs.  Natural  gas  exploration  efforts  in  the  WCSB  are  focused  on  the  traditionally  less  accessible  areas  in  the
overthrust belt along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, in the Northwest Territories, offshore the east coast of
Canada, smaller shallow gas deposits and coal bed methane.
The trend of volatile commodity prices continues and it is expected will continue. Natural gas prices are sensitive
to  regional  supply/demand  imbalances,  regional  industrial  activity  levels,  weather  patterns  and  access  to  cheaper
sources of energy. Oil prices are clearly dependent on the world economy and stable supply. As a result of numerous
supply  disruptions  and  increased  demand  from  China  and  India  oil  prices  have  remained  higher  than  OPEC’s
U.S. $22.00-$28.00 per bbl price band for more than a year. On January 30, 2005 OPEC announced it was temporarily
suspending its price band subject to further consideration.
DESCRIPTION OF HUSKY’S BUSINESS
General
Husky is a publicly held integrated energy and energy related company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. Our
operations  include  the  exploration  for  and  development  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  properties,  as  well  as  the
production, purchase, transportation, storage and marketing of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, sulphur and
petroleum coke, and the upgrading and reﬁning of crude oil and marketing of reﬁned petroleum products, including
gasoline, diesel, alternative fuels and asphalt products.
Upstream Operations
Husky’s portfolio of assets includes properties that produce light (30⬚ API and lighter), medium (between 20⬚ and
30⬚ API) and heavy (below 20⬚ and above 10⬚ API) gravity crude oil, NGL, natural gas and sulphur. As operator of the
majority  of  its  properties  Husky  exercises  a  high  degree  of  control  in  its  upstream  operations.  We  have  production,
gathering and processing facilities throughout the WCSB. In the Lloydminster heavy oil prone area Husky has a well
established position with concentrated landholdings, production, gathering and processing facilities, as well as heavy
crude oil pipeline, upgrading and reﬁning facilities.
At December 31, 2004, we were the operator of properties which accounted for approximately 87 percent of our
total gross production in Western Canada. Our undeveloped landholdings in the WCSB totalled 6.7 million net acres or
54 percent of total net land holdings at December 31, 2004.

In the foothills deep basin areas in Alberta, we operate the Ram River gas plant and have interests in properties
that supply this plant including: Blackstone, Ricinus, Limestone, Clearwater, Benjamin, Brown Creek and Stolberg. We
also  have  an  interest  in  the  Caroline  gas  plant  and  ﬁeld.  Further  north  we  have  interests  in  the  Valhalla  and  Wapiti
crude oil and natural gas ﬁelds near Grand Prairie and properties in the Galloway, Ansell and Edson area. In north-
eastern British Columbia, we hold natural gas interests in the Sikanni and Federal area as well as Boundary Lake.
In the plains region of north-west Alberta, we operate the Rainbow Lake Plant, miscible ﬂoods and properties in
surrounding areas. We have interests in the Peace River Arch, Boyer, Sloat Creek, Marten Hills, Cherpeta and Simons
Lake areas. In the east central region of Alberta, we have property holdings east of Calgary and around Red Deer and
Edmonton including major properties at Hussar and Provost.
In  southern  Alberta  and  Saskatchewan  we  have  extensive  property  holdings  around  Taber,  Brooks,  Jenner  and
Sufﬁeld in southern Alberta and throughout south-west Saskatchewan at Shackleton/Lacadena, Cantaur, Fosterton and
Carnduff.
We have extensive experience in development, production, transportation and upgrading of heavy crude oil. We
also have experience in enhanced recovery of crude oil and horizontal drilling, as well as in natural gas exploration in
the deep basin, foothills and along the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, also known as the overthrust
belt.
On the east coast of Canada we hold a 12.51 percent working interest in the Terra Nova oil ﬁeld, which began
producing light crude oil in January 2002, and a 72.5 percent working interest in the White Rose oil ﬁeld, which was
sanctioned by the co-venturers in March 2002 and is currently under development. First oil from the White Rose oil
ﬁeld  is  currently  expected  by  the  end  of  2005  or  early  2006.  We  also  hold  interests  in  several  exploration  and
signiﬁcant discovery licenses in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin and the South Whale Basin.
We  hold  a  40  percent  working  interest  in  the  Wenchang  oil  ﬁelds  located  offshore  in  the  South  China  Sea.
Production at the Wenchang oil ﬁelds began in July 2002. We also hold interests in ﬁve exploration blocks in the South
China Sea with an aggregate areal extent of approximately 17,800 square kilometres and one exploration block in the
East China Sea of approximately 4,800 square kilometres.
Husky also holds an interest in a natural gas and liquids production sharing contract located in the Madura strait
offshore Java, Indonesia.
Midstream Operations
Husky’s midstream operations include upgrading of heavy crude oil feedstock into synthetic crude oil, pipeline
transportation  and  processing  of  heavy  crude  oil,  storage  of  crude  oil,  diluent  and  natural  gas,  and  cogeneration  of
electrical and thermal energy, and marketing of Husky’s and third party produced crude oil, natural gas, natural gas
liquids, sulphur and petroleum coke.
Reﬁned Products
Husky’s reﬁned products operations include reﬁning of heavy and light crude oil, marketing of reﬁned petroleum
products, including asphalt and alternate fuels, and processing of grain primarily for ethanol production. Husky sells
and  distributes  transportation  fuels  including  ethanol  blended  fuels  through  independently  operated  Husky  and
Mohawk branded petroleum outlets, including service stations, truck stops and bulk distribution facilities located from
the  west  coast  of  Canada  to  the  eastern  border  of  Ontario,  some  of  which  include  24  hour  restaurants,  convenience
stores, service bays, car washes, fast food sales, bank machines and propane sales.
Social and Environmental Policy
Husky’s  environmental  policy  requires  regular  environmental  audits  to  be  conducted  at  its  sites  and  facilities.
Husky  has  established  procedures  designed  to  anticipate  and  minimize  adverse  effects  of  its  operations  on  the
environment  and  for  continued  compliance  with  environmental  legislation  and  minimize  future  and  current  costs.
Husky’s policies apply equally to employees, subsidiaries and contractors.

Risk Factors
The following factors should be considered in evaluating Husky:
Adequacy of crude oil and natural gas prices
Husky’s  results  of  operations  and  ﬁnancial  condition  are  dependent  on  the  prices  received  for  its  crude  oil  and
natural gas production.
Prices for crude oil are based on world supply and demand. Supply and demand can be affected by a number of
factors including, but not limited to, actions taken by the OPEC and their adherence to agreed production quotas, non-
OPEC crude oil supply, social conditions in oil producing countries, the occurrence of natural disasters, general and
speciﬁc economic conditions, prevailing weather patterns and the availability of alternate sources of energy.
Husky’s natural gas production is located entirely in Western Canada and is, therefore, subject to North American
market forces. North American natural gas supply and demand is affected by a number of factors including, but not
limited  to,  the  amount  of  natural  gas  available  to  speciﬁc  market  areas  either  from  the  well  head  or  from  storage
facilities,  prevailing  weather  patterns,  the  price  of  crude  oil,  the  U.S.  and  Canadian  economies,  the  occurrence  of
natural disasters and pipeline restrictions.
Demand for Husky’s other products and services and the cost of required inputs
Husky’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition are dependent on the price of reﬁnery feedstock, the price of
energy,  the  demand  for  reﬁned  petroleum  products  and  electrical  power  and  the  ability  of  Husky  to  recover  the
increased  cost  of  these  inputs  from  the  customer.  Husky  is  also  dependent  on  the  demand  for  Husky’s  pipeline  and
processing capacity.
Husky’s ability to replace reserves
Husky’s future cash ﬂow and cost of capital are dependent on its ability to replace its proved oil and gas reserves
in  a  cost  effective  manner.  Without  economic  reserve  additions  through  exploration  and  development  or  acquisition
Husky’s production and, therefore, cash ﬂow will decline. Without adequate proved reserves Husky’s ability to fund
development and other capital expenditures with external sources of funds is diminished.
Competition
The energy industry is highly competitive. Husky competes with others to acquire additional prospective lands, to
retain  drilling  capacity  and  ﬁeld  operating  and  construction  services,  to  attract  and  retain  experienced  skilled
management and oil and gas professionals, to obtain sufﬁcient pipeline and other transportation capacity and to gain
access to and retain adequate markets for Husky’s products and services. Husky’s competitors comprise all types of
energy companies, some of which have greater resources.
Environmental risks
All  phases  of  the  oil  and  natural  gas  business  are  subject  to  environmental  regulation  pursuant  to  a  variety  of
federal,  provincial  and  municipal  laws  and  regulations,  as  well  as  international  conventions  (collectively,
‘‘environmental legislation’’).
Environmental legislation imposes, among other things, restrictions, liabilities, and obligations in connection with
the  generation,  handling,  storage,  transportation,  treatment  and  disposal  of  hazardous  substances  and  waste  and  in
connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances to the environment. Environmental legislation also
requires  that  wells,  facilities  and  other  properties  associated  with  Husky’s  operations  be  operated,  maintained,
abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, certain types of operations,
including  exploration  and  development  projects  and  signiﬁcant  changes  to  certain  existing  projects,  may  require  the
submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Compliance with environmental legislation can require
signiﬁcant expenditures and failure to comply with environmental legislation may result in the imposition of ﬁnes and
penalties  and  liability  for  clean-up  costs  and  damages.  Husky  cannot  be  certain  that  the  costs  of  complying  with
environmental legislation in the future will not have a material adverse effect on Husky’s ﬁnancial condition and results
of operations.
Husky  anticipates  that  changes  in  environmental  legislation  may  require,  among  other  things,  reductions  in
emissions from its operations and result in increased capital expenditures. Further changes in environmental legislation
8
could  occur,  which  may  result  in  stricter  standards  and  enforcement,  larger  ﬁnes  and  liability,  and  increased  capital
expenditures and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on Husky’s ﬁnancial condition and results
of operations.
In 1994, the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change came into force and three years later led
to  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  which  requires  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  On  December  16,  2002,  Canada
ratiﬁed  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  This  initiative  may  require  Husky  to  signiﬁcantly  reduce  emissions  at  its  operations  of
green  house  gases  such  as  carbon  dioxide,  which  may  increase  capital  expenditures.  Details  regarding  the
implementation of the Kyoto Protocol remain unclear.
Uncertainty of oil and gas proved reserves estimates
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, including many
factors  beyond  Husky’s  control.  The  reserves  information  included  in  and  incorporated  by  reference  in  this  Annual
Information Form are Husky’s estimates. In general, estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves
and the estimated future net cash ﬂow therefrom are based on a number of variables in effect as of date on which the
reserves estimates were determined, such as geological and engineering estimates which have inherent uncertainties,
the actual effects of regulation by governmental agencies and the actual future commodity prices and operating costs,
all  of  which  may  vary  considerably  from  those  in  effect  at  the  date  the  reserves  were  determined.  The  estimated
quantities  of  reserves  expected  to  be  recovered  are  uncertain  and  the  classiﬁcation  of  reserves  as  proved  is  only  an
attempt  to  deﬁne  the  degree  of  certainty  involved.  For  these  reasons,  estimates  of  economically  recoverable  oil  and
natural gas attributable to a particular group of properties, the classiﬁcation of such reserves as proved and the resultant
future net cash ﬂow therefrom, prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times, may vary
substantially. Husky’s actual production, revenues, taxes and development, abandonment, and operating expenditures
with respect to its estimated oil and natural gas reserves may vary from such estimates, and such variances could be
material.
Estimates with respect to reserves that may be developed and produced in the future (proved developed reserves)
are  often  based  on  volumetric  calculations  and  upon  analogy  to  similar  types  of  reservoirs,  rather  than  upon  actual
production history. Estimates based on these methods generally are less reliable than those based on actual production
history.  Subsequent  evaluation  of  the  same  reserves  based  upon  production  history  may  result  in  variations  in  the
estimated reserves, which may be material.

Note:
(1) Netbacks reﬂect the results of operations for leases classiﬁed as oil or natural gas. Co-products, such as natural gas produced at an oil property
or natural gas liquids produced at a natural gas property, have been converted to equivalent units of oil or natural gas depending on the lease
product classiﬁcation.

The number of gross wells is the total number of wells in which Husky owns a working interest. The number of net wells is the sum of the
fractional interests owned in the gross wells. Producing wells were producing or capable of producing at December 31.
2004 includes 482 gross, 411 net oil wells and 538 gross, 337 net natural gas wells and 2003 includes 271 gross, 241 net oil wells and 424
gross, 207 net natural gas wells which were completed in two or more formations and from which the production is not commingled. For the
purposes of this table, multiple completions are counted as single wells. Where one of the completions in a given well is an oil completion, the
well is classiﬁed as an oil well.

Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information
Husky’s  oil  and  gas  reserves  as  of  December  31,  2004  are  based  on  constant  prices  and  costs  as  prepared
internally  by  Husky’s  engineers.  Husky  uses  a  formalized  process  for  determining,  approving  and  booking  reserves.
This  process  provides  for  all  reserves  evaluation  to  be  done  on  a  consistent  basis  using  established  deﬁnitions  and
guidelines. Approval of any signiﬁcant reserve additions and changes requires review by an internal panel of qualiﬁed
technical experts.
Audit of Oil and Gas Reserves
McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd., an independent ﬁrm of oil and gas reserves evaluation engineers, was
engaged  to  conduct  an  audit  of  Husky’s  crude  oil,  natural  gas  and  natural  gas  products  reserves.  McDaniel  &
Associates  Consultants  Ltd.  issued  an  audit  opinion  stating  that  Husky’s  internally  generated  proved  and  probable
reserves  and  net  present  values  are,  in  aggregate,  reasonable,  and  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted oil and gas engineering and evaluation practices in the United States and as set out in the COGEH.
Oil and Gas Reserves Data
The following table presents in summary Husky’s proved developed reserves, proved undeveloped reserves and
associated  future  net  cash  ﬂows  as  at  December  31,  2004.  Future  revenues,  based  on  constant  prices  and  costs,  are
presented net of royalties. Estimated future net revenues based on constant prices and costs assume continuation of year
end economic conditions including market demand and government policy, which are subject to uncertainty and may
differ materially in the future. It should not be assumed that the discounted value of estimated future net reserves is
representative of the fair market value of the reserves.

Notes:
(1) Husky  applied  for  and  was  granted  an  exemption  from  National  Instrument  51-101  ‘‘Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Oil  and  Gas  Activities’’  to
provide  oil  and  gas  reserves  disclosures  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  guidelines  and  the  U.S.  Financial
Accounting Standards Board disclosure standards. The information disclosed may differ from information prepared in accordance with National
Instrument 51-101. Husky’s internally generated oil and gas reserves data was audited by an independent firm of consulting engineers.
(2) Gross reserves are Husky’s lessor royalty, overriding royalty and working interest share of reserves, before deduction of royalties. Net reserves
are gross reserves, less royalties.
These reserve categories have the same meanings as those set out in SEC Regulation S-X.

The discounted future net cash ﬂows at December 31, 2004 were based on the year-end spot NYMEX natural gas price of U.S. $6.02/mmbtu
and on a spot WTI crude oil price of U.S. $43.36/bbl.
Estimated  future  capital  expenditures  required  to  gain  access  to  proved  undeveloped  reserves  as  at  December  31,  2004  and  2003  were  as

(6) On December 31, 2004, the date our oil and gas reserves were evaluated, the calculated price of Lloydminster heavy crude oil was $12.27 per
barrel. In accordance with SEC regulation, reserves that were not economic at that price were required to be subtracted as a negative revision
from proved reserves until prices increase sufﬁciently to return those reserves to economic status. For further discussion refer to Management’s
Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The probable reserves presented have been prepared, using constant prices and costs, in accordance with NI 51-101.
Probable  bitumen  reserves  were  based  on  constant  prices  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  Canadian  Securities  Administrators  Staff
Notice 51-315 ‘‘Guidance Regarding the Determination of Constant Prices for Bitumen Reserves under National Instrument 51-101 Standards
of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (the ‘‘Staff Notice’’). Bitumen reserves at December 31, 2004 remain classiﬁed as probable reserves
because the pricing formula in the Staff Notice results in an economically viable price as at that date whereas 37 mmbbls of heavy oil reserves
were subtracted from probable reserves due to low December 31, 2004 heavy oil prices under the constant pricing calculation applicable to
heavy  oil,  which  differed  from  the  bitumen  calculation.  See  ‘‘Disclosure  of  Exemption  under  National  Instrument  51-101’’  for  further
discussion.
Bitumen probable reserves are included under the caption Western Canada.
The  SEC  generally  permits  oil  and  gas  registrants  to  disclose  only  reserves  that  meet  the  standards  for  proved  reserves.  Due  to  the  higher
uncertainty associated with probable reserves, disclosure or reference to probable reserves does not meet the standards for the inclusion in a
document  ﬁled  with  the  SEC.  The  disclosure  of  probable  reserves  is  included  herein  in  accordance  with  certain  undertakings  made  in  an
exemption order granted to Husky pursuant to Part 8 of the Companion Policy to NI 51-101.

Disclosure about Oil and Gas Producing Activities — Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69
The following disclosures have been prepared in accordance with FASB Statement No. 69 ‘‘Disclosures about Oil
and Gas Producing Activities’’ (‘‘FAS 69’’):
Oil and Gas Reserves
Proved  oil  and  gas  reserves  are  the  estimated  quantities  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas  and  natural  gas  liquids  which
geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells
with existing equipment and operating methods.
Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a
signiﬁcant expenditure is required.
Canadian provincial royalties are determined based on a graduated percentage scale, which varies with prices and
production volumes. Canadian reserves, as presented on a net basis, assume prices and royalty rates in existence at the
time the estimates were made, and our estimate of future production volumes. Future ﬂuctuations in prices, production
rates,  or  changes  in  political  or  regulatory  environments  could  cause  our  share  of  future  production  from  Canadian
reserves to be materially different from that presented.
Subsequent to December 31, 2004, no major discovery or other favourable or adverse event is believed to have
caused a material change in the estimates of proved or proved developed reserves as of that date.

The costs in this schedule exclude corporate overhead, interest expense and other operating costs, which are not directly related to producing
activities.
(2) Under U.S. GAAP, the depreciation, depletion and amortization for Canadian producing activities for 2004 amounted to $981 million (2003 —
$772  million;  2002 — $727  million).  Asset  retirement  obligation  accretion  under  U.S.  GAAP  for  2002  is  nil.  Income  taxes  for  Canadian
producing activities under U.S. GAAP for 2004 amounted to $364 million (2003 — $523 million; 2002 — $393 million).

Notes:
(1) Net reserves are the Company’s lessor royalty, overriding royalty and working interest share of the gross remaining reserves, after deduction of
any crown, freehold and overriding royalties. Such royalties are subject to change by legislation or regulation and can also vary depending on
production rates, selling prices and timing of initial production.

Reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and related substances anticipated from geological and engineering data to be
recoverable from known accumulations from a given date forward, by known technology, under existing operating conditions and prices in
effect at year end.
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
demonstrate  with  reasonable  certainty  to  be  recoverable  in  future  years  from  known  reservoirs  under  existing  economic  and  operating
conditions.
Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a signiﬁcant
expenditure is required.
27
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves
The following information has been developed utilizing procedures prescribed by FAS 69 and based on crude oil
and  natural  gas  reserve  and  production  volumes  estimated  by  our  engineering  staff.  It  may  be  useful  for  certain
comparison purposes, but should not be solely relied upon in evaluating Husky or its performance. Further, information
contained in the following table should not be considered as representative of realistic assessments of future cash ﬂows,
nor  should  the  standardized  measure  of  discounted  future  net  cash  ﬂows  be  viewed  as  representative  of  the  current
value of Husky’s reserves.
The  future  cash  ﬂows  presented  below  are  based  on  sales  prices,  cost  rates,  and  statutory  income  tax  rates  in
existence  as  of  the  date  of  the  projections.  It  is  expected  that  material  revisions  to  some  estimates  of  crude  oil  and
natural gas reserves may occur in the future, development and production of the reserves may occur in periods other
than those assumed, and actual prices realized and costs incurred may vary signiﬁcantly from those used.
Management does not rely upon the following information in making investment and operating decisions. Such
decisions  are  based  upon  a  wide  range  of  factors,  including  estimates  of  probable  as  well  as  proved  reserves,  and
varying price and cost assumptions considered more representative of a range of possible economic conditions that may
be anticipated.
The computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash ﬂows relating to proved oil and gas
reserves  at  December  31,  2004  was  based  on  the  NYMEX  year-end  natural  gas  spot  price  of  U.S.  $6.02/mmbtu
(2003 — U.S. $5.96/mmbtu; 2002 — U.S. $4.60/mmbtu) and on crude oil prices computed with reference to the year-
end WTI price of U.S. $43.36/bbl (2003 — U.S. $32.5/bbl; 2002 — U.S. $31.21/bbl). The price of WTI in Canadian
dollars  was  lower  December  31,  2003  than  at  December  31,  2002  as  a  result  of  the  Cdn./U.S.  dollar  exchange  rate,
which was $1.29 at December 31, 2003 compared with $1.58 at December 31, 2002.

INDEPENDENT ENGINEER’S AUDIT OPINION
January 17, 2005
Husky Energy Inc.
707 – 8th Avenue S.W.
Calgary, Alberta
T2P 3G7
Gentlemen:
Pursuant to Husky’s request we have conducted an audit of the reserves estimates and the respective present worth
value of these reserves of Husky Energy Inc., as at December 31, 2004. The Company’s detailed reserves information
was provided to us for this audit. Our responsibility is to express an independent opinion on the reserves and respective
present worth value estimates, in aggregate, based on our audit tests and procedures.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted standards as described in the Canadian
Oil  and  Gas  Evaluation  Handbook  (COGEH)  and  auditing  standards  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of
America. Those standards require that we review and assess the policies, procedures, documentation and guidelines of
the Company with respect to the estimation, review and approval of Husky’s reserves information. An audit includes
examining,  on  a  test  basis,  to  conﬁrm  that  there  is  adherence  on  the  part  of  Husky’s  internal  reserve  evaluators  and
other employees to the reserves management and administration policies and procedures established by the Company.
An  audit  also  includes  conducting  reserves  evaluation  on  sufﬁcient  number  of  Company  properties  as  considered
necessary to express an opinion.
Based on the results of our audit, it is our opinion that Husky’s internally generated proved and probable reserves
and net present values based on forecast and constant price assumptions are, in aggregate, reasonable and have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted oil and gas engineering and evaluation practices in the United States
and as set out in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS ON RESERVES DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION
Management  of  Husky  Energy  Inc.  (the  ‘‘Company’’)  are  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  disclosure  of
information with respect to the Company’s oil and gas activities in accordance with securities regulatory requirements.
This information includes oil and gas reserves data, which consist of the following:
(1)
(2)
proved oil and gas reserve quantities estimated as at December 31, 2004 using constant prices and costs; and
the related standardized measure of discounted future net cash ﬂows.
Our oil and gas reserves evaluation process involves applying generally accepted procedures for the estimation of
oil and gas reserves data for the purposes of complying with the legal requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (‘‘SEC’’) and the applicable provisions of the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  69  (collectively,  the  ‘‘Oil  and  Gas  Reserves  Data  Process’’).  Our  Manager  of
Reservoir Engineering and Vice President, Exploration & Production Services, who are employees of the Company,
have evaluated the Company’s oil and gas reserves data and certiﬁed that the Reserves Data Process has been followed.
The Report on Reserves Data of the Manager of Reservoir Engineering and Vice President, Exploration & Production
Services will be ﬁled with securities regulatory authorities concurrently with this report.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has:
(a)
reviewed the Company’s procedures for providing information to the internal and external qualiﬁed oil and
gas reserves evaluators;
(b) met  with  the  internal  and,  if  applicable,  external  qualiﬁed  oil  and  gas  reserves  evaluator(s)  to  determine
whether any restrictions placed by management affect the ability of the internal qualiﬁed reserves evaluator
to report without reservation; and
(c)
reviewed the reserves data with management and the internal qualiﬁed oil and gas reserves evaluators.
The  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  has  reviewed  the  Company’s  procedures  for  assembling  and
reporting other information associated with oil and gas activities and has reviewed that information with management.
The Board of Directors has, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, approved:
(a)
(b)
the  content  and  ﬁling  with  securities  regulatory  authorities  of  the  reserves  data  and  other  oil  and  gas
information;
the  ﬁling  of  the  Report  on  Reserves  Data  of  the  Manager  of  Reservoir  Engineering  and  Vice  President,
Exploration & Production Services; and
(c)
the content and ﬁling of this report.
Husky  sought  and  was  granted  by  the  Canadian  Securities  Administrators  an  exemption  from  the  requirement
under  National  Instrument  51-101  ‘‘Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Oil  and  Gas  Disclosure’’  to  involve  independent
qualiﬁed oil and gas reserves evaluators or auditors. Notwithstanding this exemption, we involve independent qualiﬁed
reserve auditors as part of our corporate governance practices. Their involvement helps assure that our internal oil and
gas reserves estimates are materially correct.
In  our  view,  the  reliability  of  the  internally  generated  oil  and  gas  reserves  data  is  not  materially  different  than
would be afforded by our involving independent qualiﬁed reserves evaluators to evaluate and review the reserves data.
A  portion  of  our  oil  and  gas  reserves  data  is  international  in  nature.  Husky  is  an  SEC  registrant  and  therefore  our
reserves data is developed in accordance with standards set out in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook as
modiﬁed  or  replaced  by  the  applicable  U.S.  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  standards  and  the  legal
requirements  of  the  SEC.  Our  procedures,  records  and  controls  relating  to  the  accumulation  of  source  data  and
preparation  of  reserves  data  by  our  internal  reserves  evaluation  staff  have  been  established,  reﬁned  and  documented
over many years. Our internal reserves evaluation staff includes 129 individuals, including support staff, of whom 46
individuals  are  qualiﬁed  reserves  evaluators  as  deﬁned  in  the  Canadian  Oil  and  Gas  Evaluation  Handbook,  with  an
average of 10 years of relevant experience in evaluating reserves.
Our  internal  reserves  evaluation  management  personnel  includes  23  individuals  with  an  average  of  12  years  of
relevant experience in evaluating oil and gas and managing the evaluation process.
33
Reserves data are estimates only, and are not exact quantities. Because the reserves data are based on judgements
regarding future events, actual results will vary and the variations may be material.

Description of Major Properties and Facilities
Husky’s portfolio of assets includes properties that produce light (30⬚ API and lighter), medium (between 20⬚ and
30⬚ API) and heavy (below 20⬚ and above 10⬚ API) gravity crude oil, NGL, natural gas and sulphur.
Lloydminster Heavy Oil and Gas
Husky’s heavy oil assets are concentrated in a large producing area covering more than 14,800 square kilometres
in  the  Lloydminster  area  in  the  Canadian  provinces  of  Saskatchewan  and  Alberta.  Approximately  85  percent  of
Husky’s  proved  reserves  in  the  region  are  contained  in  the  heavy  crude  oil  producing  ﬁelds  of  Pikes  Peak,  Edam,
Tangleﬂags,  Celtic,  Bolney,  Westhazel,  Big  Gully,  Hillmond,  Mervin,  Marwayne,  Lashburn,  Baldwinton  and  Rush
Lake,  and  in  the  medium  gravity  crude  oil  producing  ﬁelds  of  Wildmere  and  Wainwright.  These  ﬁelds  contain
accumulations  of  heavy  crude  oil  at  relatively  shallow  depths.  We  maintain  a  land  position  of  approximately
1.6 million net acres in the Lloydminster area, of which approximately three-quarters is undeveloped.
We  currently  produce  from  oil  and  gas  wells  ranging  in  depth  from  450  to  650  metres  and  hold  a  100  percent
working interest in the majority of these wells. We produce heavy oil from the Lloydminster area using a variety of
techniques, including standard primary production methods, as well as steam injection, horizontal well technology and
steam  assisted  gravity  drainage  (‘‘SAGD’’).  We  have  increased  primary  production  from  the  area  through  cold
production techniques which utilize progressive cavity pumps capable of simultaneous production of sand and heavy
oil  from  unconsolidated  formations.  Our  gross  heavy  and  medium  crude  oil  production  from  the  area  totalled  99.7
mbbls/day in 2004. Of the total production, 77.3 mbbls/day was primary production of heavy crude oil, 18.8 mbbls/day
was  production  from  our  thermal  operations  at  Pikes  Peak  (cyclic  steam),  Bolney/Celtic  (SAGD)  and  the  Lashburn
pilot (SAGD), which was started in 2004 and 3.7 mbbls/day was from the medium gravity waterﬂooded ﬁelds in the
Wainwright and Wildmere areas. We believe that the future growth from this area will be driven by primary heavy oil
production and new thermal projects.
In  the  Lloydminster  area  we  own  and  operate  16  oil  treating  facilities,  all  of  which  are  tied  into  our  heavy  oil
pipeline systems. These pipeline systems transport heavy crude oil from the ﬁeld locations to our Lloydminster asphalt
reﬁnery, to the Husky Lloydminster Upgrader and to the Enbridge Pipeline and Express Pipeline systems at Hardisty,
Alberta. During 2004, we completed construction of a facility at Landrose, Saskatchewan with an output capacity of
11.3 mbbls/day.
We  are  focused  on  increasing  our  heavy  oil  production  and  believe  that  our  undeveloped  land  position  in  the
Lloydminster  area,  coupled  with  the  application  of  improved  technologies,  a  reduced  cost  structure  and  increased
upgrading capacity, will provide strong growth opportunities for heavy oil production.
We  also  produce  natural  gas  from  numerous  small  shallow  natural  gas  pools  in  the  Lloydminster  area
(approximately 76 bcf of proved reserves). Our total gross natural gas production from the area during 2004 was 57.9
mmcf/day.

Lloydminster Area
Rainbow Lake Area
Northwest Alberta Plains
Rainbow Lake, located approximately 700 kilometres north-west of Edmonton, Alberta, is the site of our largest
light oil production operation in Western Canada. Husky operates a number of crude oil pools in the Rainbow basin,
with an average working interest of 54 percent. Our production in this area is derived from more than 50 oil and gas
pools extending over 1,300 square kilometres.
We use secondary and tertiary oil recovery methods extensively in the Rainbow Lake area. These methods include
injecting water, natural gas and NGL into the oil reservoirs to enhance crude oil recovery. The use of tertiary recovery
programs, such as the miscible ﬂood used at Rainbow Lake, has increased the estimated amount of recoverable crude
oil-in-place from 50 to 70 percent of the original crude oil-in-place in certain pools. As a consequence of implementing
these natural gas and NGL re-injection programs, historically only small volumes of gas and NGL have been marketed
from the Rainbow Lake area prior to 2002. In 2003, we initiated the recovery of natural gas from several pools. NGL
recovery  is  forecast  to  begin  in  the  2008-2010  timeframe  and  is  expected  to  generate  revenues  as  the  crude  oil
production  from  the  pools  is  completed.  We  use  horizontal  drilling  techniques,  including  the  re-entry  of  existing
wellbores, to maintain the level of crude oil production and to increase recovery rates. We plan to continue exploration
efforts to supplement our development initiatives in the Rainbow Lake area. Husky’s gross production from this area
averaged 7.2 mbbls/day of light crude oil and NGL and 33.0 mmcf/day of natural gas during 2004.
We  hold  a  50  percent  interest  in,  and  operate,  the  Rainbow  Lake  processing  plant.  The  processing  design  rate
capacity  of  the  plant  is  69  mbbls/day  of  crude  oil  and  water  and  230  mmcf/day  of  raw  gas.  The  extraction  design
capacity is 17 mbbls/day of NGL.
We hold an interest in two signiﬁcant non-operated properties in the Rainbow area. They include the Ekwan/Sierra
property  in  north-eastern  British  Columbia  and  the  Bistcho/Cameron  Hills  property  straddling  the  Alberta  and
Northwest Territories border. Our gross production from these properties currently averages 11.4 mmcf/day of natural
gas and 118 bbls/day of liquid hydrocarbons. We also hold a working interest in the Encana Sierra gas plant and the
36
Paramount Bistcho gas plant. We are active in both these areas with development and exploration drilling. In these two
areas we hold in excess of 200,000 acres of undeveloped land.
Peace River Arch Area
The Peace River Arch area of northern Alberta, which includes the Slave Lake, Sawn Lake, Red Earth, Lubicon,
Nipisi, Utikuma and other properties, has been a major light oil producing area located approximately 370 kilometres
north-west of Edmonton. We operate and hold an average 80 percent working interest in several properties in this area.
Over  the  last  three  years,  we  have  maintained  net  production  from  properties  in  this  area,  at  approximately
4.1 mbbls/day of crude oil, through acquisitions, step-out drilling and waterﬂood optimization. The average working
interest in these lands is 80 percent. Infrastructure includes a 100 percent working interest in a 30 mmcf/day sour gas
plant and three oil batteries. Husky plans to continue development drilling and waterﬂood optimization for both crude
oil and natural gas targets in this area.
Boyer Area
The Boyer area of Alberta is approximately 600 kilometres north-west of Edmonton, Alberta. We are the operator
and hold close to 100 percent working interest in our properties. The area holds shallow Bluesky gas reservoirs that are
characterized as low deliverability and low decline that are being developed with a drilling density of three wells per
section. We intend to continue to develop this area by drilling undeveloped sections, inﬁll drilling, land acquisitions
and step out exploration. Gross production from this area in 2004 averaged 33.0 mmcf/day of natural gas.
Sloat Creek Area
The  Sloat  Creek  or  Chinchaga  area  of  Alberta  is  located  close  to  the  British  Columbia  border  approximately
570  kilometres  north-west  of  Edmonton,  Alberta.  We  are  the  operator  and  hold  an  approximate  95  percent  working
interest  in  our  properties.  Natural  gas  is  produced  from  the  Bluesky,  DeBolt,  Elkton  and  Shunda  zones  that  lie  an
average of approximately 1,030 metres deep and the Slave Point zone at an average depth of 1,800 metres. We intend
to continue to develop this area with inﬁll, step-out and exploratory drilling so that existing pools can be optimized and
new pools can be placed on production.
We own a 30 mmcf/day high pressure booster compression plant that feeds a third party operated sour gas plant
and are 50 percent owner in a 12 mmcf/day low pressure booster that feeds a 40 percent owned sweet gas processing
facility operated by a third party. Gross production from this area averaged 6.6 mmcf/day of natural gas in 2004.
Marten Hills/Muskwa Area
The  Marten  Hills  and  Muskwa  areas  of  Alberta  are  located  212  kilometres  north-west  of  Edmonton,  Alberta.
Natural gas is produced from the Clearwater, Colony, McMurray and Wabiskaw zones that lie at an average depth of
600 metres. We operate our properties in this area and intend to continue to develop this area with inﬁll, step-out and
exploratory drilling so that existing pools can be optimized and new pools can be placed on production.
We own a 100 percent interest in a series of nine sales gas compressor stations (compressors at sales points) and a
number of ﬁeld booster stations, a 95 percent interest in a compressor station at Rock Island, a 37.5 percent interest in a
third  party  operated  facility  at  Peerless  and  a  3  percent  interest  in  the  third  party  operated  Marten  Hills  unit.  Gross
production from this area averaged 34.9 mmcf/day of natural gas in 2004.
Cherpeta and Saleski Areas
The Cherpeta area of Alberta is located 230 kilometres north of Edmonton, Alberta and the Saleski area is located
approximately  140  kilometres  further  north  from  Cherpeta.  Natural  gas  is  produced  at  Cherpeta  from  the  Nisku,
Clearwater, Colony, McMurray and Wabiskaw zones that lie at an average depth of 600 metres. The Grosmont zone
that lies between 450 and 500 metres characterizes the Saleski area. We operate our properties in this area and intend to
continue to develop this area with inﬁll, step-out and exploratory drilling so that existing pools can be optimized and
new pools can be placed on production.
We hold working interests ranging from 60 to 95 percent in the Cherpeta area and 49 percent in the Saleski area
and  operate  a  series  of  sales  compressor  stations,  gas  plants  and  sales  pipeline.  Gross  production  from  these  areas
averaged 35.6 mmcf/day of natural gas in 2004.
37
Simons Lake Area
The  Simons  Lake  area  of  Alberta  is  located  386  kilometres  north-west  of  Edmonton,  Alberta.  Natural  gas  is
produced from the Bluesky, DeBolt, Elkton and Shunda zones that lie at an average depth of 600 metres.
We  hold  100  percent  working  interest  in  a  10  mmcf/day  sour  gas  processing  facility  and  34  percent  working
interest  in  a  high  pressure  booster  station  operated  by  a  third  party  that  feeds  a  separate  third  party  owned  sour  gas
processing facility. Gross production from this area averaged 3.7 mmcf/day of natural gas in 2004.
Ram River Area
Northeast British Columbia and Alberta Foothills
The Ram River area is located in west central Alberta and includes the large Blackstone, Ricinus and Clearwater/
Limestone natural gas ﬁelds.
The  Blackstone  ﬁeld  is  the  most  proliﬁc  of  these  ﬁelds  and  contains  four  high  deliverability  natural  gas  wells,
capable  of  combined  raw  gas  production  of  80  mmcf/day.  We  hold  a  34  percent  interest  in  two  unitized  wells,  a
24  percent  and  a  50  percent  interest,  respectively,  in  two  non-unit  wells,  and  act  as  the  contract  operator  of  the
Blackstone wells. Production from these wells is processed at the Ram River gas plant.
We  hold  an  average  72  percent  interest  in,  and  are  the  operator  of,  the  Ram  River  sour  gas  plant  and  related
processing facilities. The Ram River plant has the capacity to process 622 mmcf/day of sour gas, resulting in sales gas
capacity of 525 mmcf/day. The plant also has the capacity to produce in excess of 2.8 mlt/day of sulphur from raw gas.
During 2004, the plant operated at approximately 86 percent of its design rate capacity. The Ram River plant processes
in excess of 10 percent of our total gross natural gas production, which includes an average of 50 mmcf/day of our
gross production from the Blackstone, Brown Creek, Cordel and Stolberg ﬁelds and an average of 18.5 mmcf/day of
our gross production from Ricinus and Clearwater/Limestone and Benjamin ﬁelds, in addition to processing third-party
volumes.  In  addition,  gross  production  from  the  Ferrier  area,  which  is  processed  at  another  gas  plant,  averaged
4.4  mmcf/day  of  natural  gas,  bringing  our  total  gross  production  of  natural  gas  from  the  Ram  River  area  to  71
mmcf/day in 2004.
Our sour gas pipeline network supports the Ram River plant. We operate a network of 845 kilometres of sour gas
pipelines in the Ram River area and hold a 30 percent interest in 684 kilometres of this pipeline system. The sour gas
processed at the Ram River plant is produced from 18 sour gas ﬁelds located as far as 145 kilometres from the Ram
River plant.
We believe that the Ram River plant and the extensive infrastructure of gathering pipelines, transmission systems
and  rail  lines,  which  support  the  plant,  represents  a  strategic  base  for  the  natural  gas  exploration  and  development
planned by us in this part of the foothills region. In addition, this region is an active exploration and production area for
other producers and provides additional opportunities for generating revenue by processing third party natural gas.
Kaybob Area
The Kaybob area consists of land located in the Fox Creek area of Alberta. The Kaybob area consists of four main
areas.  The  Kaybob  South  Beaverhill  Lake  Unit  1  (35.6  percent  working  interest),  Kaybob  South  Trassic  Unit  1
(40.5  percent  working  interest),  Kaybob  South  Trassic  Unit  2  (26.8  percent  working  interest),  and  non-unit  lands
(various working interests from gross overriding royalty to 100 percent working interest).
The majority of the gas is gathered and processed through the Kaybob South Amalgamated Gas Plants 1 and 2.
We have a 17.8 percent working interest in the sour portion and a 20.4 percent working interest in the sweet gas portion
of the plant. We also have various working interests in sweet gas gathering and compression facilities in the area. Our
gross production from the area was 635 bbls/day of oil, 400 bbls/day of NGL and 13 mmcf/day of natural gas during
2004.
Boundary Lake Area
We hold a 50 percent working interest in the Boundary Lake Gas Unit and a 34 percent and 19 percent interest in
the Boundary Lake oil unit 1 and 2, respectively, in north-east British Columbia. Our natural gas production from this
area is derived from ﬁve Belloy sour gas pools, and is processed at the nearby Boundary Lake processing plant. Our
gross  production  from  this  area  was  12.0  mmcf/day  of  natural  gas  and  1.7  mbbls/day  crude  oil  and  NGL  from  the
Boundary Lake units during 2004.
38
Valhalla and Wapiti Area
We hold a 30 percent interest in three Valhalla oil units, a 100 percent interest in the Valhalla non-unit waterﬂood
wells and a 100 percent interest in the Wapiti property. Production is primarily from the Doe Creek and Cardium zones
and  consists  of  light  crude  oil,  NGL  and  natural  gas.  Our  gross  production  from  these  properties  averaged
3.7 mbbls/day of crude oil and NGL and 5.0 mmcf/day of natural gas in 2004.
Kakwa Area
We  hold  an  average  60  percent  working  interest  in  oil  and  gas  processing  facilities  and  associated  oil  and  gas
gathering  systems  in  the  Kakwa  area.  Our  gross  production  from  this  area  was  9.5  mmcf/day  of  natural  gas,
425 bbls/day NGL and 385 bbls/day of oil in 2004. The 2004 acquisition of Temple Exploration Inc. provided us with
an average 50 percent interest in properties with gross production of 5.2 mmcf/day and 160 bbls/day of NGL in the
vicinity of our Kakwa plant.
Caroline Area
We  hold  an  11  percent  working  interest  in  the  32,000  acre  Caroline  natural  gas  ﬁeld  located  approximately
97 kilometres north-west of Calgary. The ﬁeld has a high proportion of NGL and as a result the economics of this ﬁeld
are enhanced.
We also hold an 11 percent interest in the Caroline sour gas processing facility. The plant is presently running at a
license limit of 113 percent of design capacity and is processing approximately 124 mmcf/day of total plant sales gas
and  39  mbbls/day  of  NGL.  The  plant  and  liquid  acceleration  gas  recycle  plant  were  at  50  percent  capacity  in  2004
which resulted in Husky gross production of 3.8 mbbls/day NGL and 12.2 mmcf/day natural gas in 2004.
Edson Area
We  hold  an  average  85  percent  working  interest  in  two  gas  processing  facilities  and  associated  gas  gathering
systems in the Edson area. We operate these properties that had average gross production of 34.0 mmcf/day of natural
gas and 1.6 mbbls/day of NGL in 2004.
Sikanni Area
We hold interests in properties in the Sikanni and Federal areas of north-east British Columbia, which averaged
gross production of 13.5 mmcf/day of natural gas from four wells in 2004. The production ﬂows through Husky owned
gathering systems for processing at third party plants at Sikanni and McMahon.
Graham Area
We hold a 40 percent working interest in lands in the Graham area of north-eastern British Columbia. Our gross
production from this area averaged 9.7 mmcf/day gross natural gas sales in 2004. Production from the property is from
one Halfway and seven Baldonnel pools. We also hold an interest in two 1,500 horsepower compressor stations and the
non-operated Cypress gas plant. Plant capacity is 45 mmcf/day and the plant is currently operating at full capacity. We
hold a 33.2 percent interest in the gas treating unit, 28.2 percent interest in the amine unit and 28 percent interest in the
sulphur unit.
Athabasca Area
East Central Alberta
The Athabasca area extends approximately 175 kilometres north of Edmonton and from the Alberta-Saskatchewan
border in the east to the Alberta foothills in the west. The area target is predominantly shallow gas, ranging from 455 to
910 metres, in the multi-zone Palozoic Mannville. The main producing areas are Athabasca, Craigend and Cold Lake.
We operate 31 facilities with a pipeline system and an average working interest of 90 percent in the producing wells.
We intend to continue to develop this area with inﬁll, stepout and exploratory wells to optimize recovery and develop
new  pools  in  order  to  keep  the  facilities  operating  at  capacity.  Our  gross  production  from  this  area  averaged
54.1 mmcf/day of natural gas and 606 bbls/day of crude oil in 2004.
Red Deer and Hussar Area
The  core  of  the  Red  Deer  and  Hussar  area  is  between  Calgary,  Drumheller  and  Sylvan  Lake.  We  operate  18
facilities  with  gas  gathering  systems  in  this  area.  Our  gross  production  from  this  area  averaged  55.2  mmcf/day  of
39
natural gas and crude oil and NGL of 2.7 mbbls/day in 2004. We intend to continue to develop the natural gas potential
of  this  area  with  inﬁll,  stepout  and  exploratory  wells  to  optimize  gas  recovery  and  develop  new  pools  in  order  to
operate  the  facilities  at  capacity.  In  2003  Husky  participated  in  a  coal  bed  methane  pilot  project.  In  2004,  we
commenced  commercial  operations  based  on  the  successful  results  of  the  pilot  project.  This  project  was  producing
8.0 mmcf/day from 60 wells by the end of 2004. In 2005 we expect to drill in excess of 250 development wells with
our co-venturer.
Provost Area
The  centre  of  the  Provost  area  is  approximately  240  kilometres  south-east  of  Edmonton.  It  is  predominantly  a
medium crude oil area that averaged gross production of 17.5 mbbls/day of crude oil and 16.8 mmcf/day of natural gas
in 2004. We intend to selectively drill lower risk oil locations and focus on managing operating costs and improving oil
recovery, as well as increasing our focus on natural gas exploration and development. In 2005, we intend to continue to
develop several of our 2003 and 2004 natural gas discoveries. There is signiﬁcant competition in the area for land as
well as infrastructure. We have a large land position and maintain close to a 100 percent working interest in most of our
facilities.
Southern Alberta and Southern Saskatchewan
As  of  December  31,  2004,  we  held  225,000  net  developed  acres  and  850,000  undeveloped  acres  in  Southern
Saskatchewan and 279,000 net developed acres and 189,000 net undeveloped acres in Southern Alberta. We also have
a small landholding in Manitoba.
Southern Saskatchewan Area
We are a prominent operator in southern Saskatchewan primarily producing medium gravity crude oil, with some
natural  gas  and  light  crude  oil.  Gross  production  from  this  area  averaged  17.3  mbbls/day  of  crude  oil  and
62.0 mmcf/day of natural gas during 2004.
We operate 31 oil batteries and six gas facilities in the Southern Saskatchewan area. The oil pools in this area are
exploited using pressure maintenance and waterﬂood recovery operations.
At the Shackleton/Lacadena Milk River shallow gas project, 92 wells were drilled and two new gas facilities were
built in 2004. The project was producing at a rate of 48 mmcf/day at December 31, 2004 from a total of 253 wells. In
2005, we plan to drill between 65 and 100 additional stepout and inﬁll wells.
Southern Alberta Area
Taber, Brooks and Jenner/Sufﬁeld are our three core areas in southern Alberta. We operate 28 oil facilities and
three natural gas facilities with an average working interest of 95 percent. Oil production is mainly medium gravity
crude with the majority of reserves being supported by waterﬂoods or active aquifers. Natural gas production is from a
mixture of deep and shallow formations. At Taber, we operate an alkaline-polymer ﬂood to increase recovery from the
Cretaceous  Mannville  reservoir.  Our  gross  production  from  this  area  averaged  11.2  mbbls/day  of  crude  oil  and
32.4 mmcf/day of natural gas during 2004.
At  Queenstown,  we  intend  to  complete  over  100  wells  in  2005  that  were  drilled  in  late  2004.  We  plan  to  drill
another 50 wells in this area in 2005.

Athabasca, Cold Lake and Peace River
Oil Sands
Husky currently holds interests in 433,610 acres in the bitumen prone areas of Athabasca, Cold Lake and Peace
River. Recent improvements in ﬁscal regimes for these types of projects, together with lower costs from technological
advances have enhanced their commercial viability.
In addition to interests in the 353,930 net acres in the Cold Lake and Athabasca regions in north-eastern Alberta,
Husky holds an interest in 79,680 net acres in the Peace River region of northern Alberta.
Tucker
In May of 2004 we received approval from the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board to develop the Tucker insitu
oilsands  project.  Tucker  is  located  30  kilometres  northwest  of  Cold  Lake,  Alberta.  The  Tucker  project  will  utilize
SAGD technology and will have a design rate capacity of 30 mbbls/day. Construction commenced in late 2004 and we
expect to commission the facility in late 2006 with production to commence three to six months thereafter.
Sunrise
The Sunrise insitu oil sands project is located in the Athabasca region of Alberta. Stratigraphic delineation drilling
over  the  last  three  years  has  conﬁrmed  a  large  recoverable  resource  base.  Additional  stratigraphic  test  wells  will  be
drilled in 2005. In the third quarter of 2004 a commercial project application was submitted to the Alberta Energy and
Utilities Board and Alberta Environment. Current plans envision four 50 mbbls/day phases. Front end engineering is
expected to be conducted in 2005.
Caribou
Our Caribou oil sands lands are located in the Cold Lake Air Weapons Range and comprise 35,840 acres. Pilot
testing was conducted in the early 1990s with encouraging results. Further stratigraphic drilling is planned for 2005.
Saleski
Our largest bitumen deposit is located approximately 120 kilometres west of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Currently,
there is no bitumen production in this area. In 2005 we will begin reviewing the geological and reservoir characteristics
of this property.

Notes:
(1)
Included in the gross and net amounts are an additional 6,400 acres of petroleum and natural gas rights held as protection acreage for gas over
bitumen issues. In 2003, the Alberta regulatory authority issued General Bulletin GB 2003-28 that required natural gas wells within certain
bitumen  prone  areas  to  be  shut-in.  The  production  of  natural  gas  where  natural  gas  reservoirs  were  believed  to  be  in  pressure  contact  with
bitumen reserves was deemed to present an unacceptable risk to future in-situ bitumen production. Sunrise was formerly named Kearl.
(2) Husky also has the exclusive right to acquire an additional 65,280 acres in the Caribou area.

Offshore East Coast — Canada
Husky’s offshore East Coast exploration and development program is focused in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin on the
Grand Banks offshore the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, which contains the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White
Rose oil ﬁelds. We hold ownership interests in the Terra Nova and White Rose oil ﬁelds as well as in a number of
smaller ﬁelds in the central part of the basin. We presently hold working interests ranging from 5.33 to 90 percent in 15
Signiﬁcant Discovery License (‘‘SDL’’) areas in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin. We are also the operator of nine exploration
licenses (‘‘EL’’) on the Grand Banks and two in the South Whale Basin. In 2004, we acquired 3 ELs. Licenses 1089
and 1090 cover 354,000 square acres between the White Rose SDLs and our EL over the Northern Jeanne d’Arc Basin.
We operate both 1089 and 1090 licenses, holding a 100% interest in EL1090 and a 50% interest in EL1089. Husky also
holds  a  100%  interest  in  EL1091,  which  ﬂanks  the  eastern  margin  of  the  White  Rose  ﬁeld.  We  believe  that  our
geotechnical expertise, drilling experience and extensive database with respect to offshore the East Coast of Canada
provide a strong foundation for future exploration and development. We also believe that there is exploration potential
in  the  area,  and  that  our  position  off  the  East  Coast  of  Canada  will  provide  growth  opportunities  for  light  crude  oil
production in the medium to long-term.
We  will  continue  technical  evaluation  of  our  East  Coast  exploration  acreage.  In  2005,  we  plan  to  acquire  3D
seismic over several license areas in the Northern Jeanne d’Arc Basin. Depending on drilling rig availability, we also
plan to drill one exploration type stratigraphic test well on the EL1059 in the South Whale Basin in 2005.
Terra Nova Oil Field
The  Terra  Nova  oil  ﬁeld  is  located  approximately  350  kilometres  south-east  of  St.  John’s,  Newfoundland  and
Labrador, 35 kilometres south-east of the Hibernia oil ﬁeld, in 91 to 100 metres of water. The Terra Nova oil ﬁeld is
divided into three distinct areas, known as the Graben, the East Flank and the Far East. Our current pooled interest in
the  Terra  Nova  ﬁeld  is  12.51%.  This  interest  is  subject  to  change,  pending  re-determination  once  the  ﬁeld  has  been
further  delineated.  Production  at  Terra  Nova  commenced  in  January  2002.  Our  gross  production  from  Terra  Nova
averaged approximately 10.5 mbbls/day in the fourth quarter of 2004. Husky’s gross share of production from Terra
Nova was 5.0 mmbbls in 2004.
As at December 31, 2004, there were ten development wells drilled in the Graben area, six producing wells and
four injection wells. In the East Flank area there were ten development wells including six production wells and four
injection wells. Drilling operations are expected to continue based on a 36 well depletion plan for the Graben and East
Flank areas. Subject to regulatory approval, the operator plans to commence production from a portion of the Far East
area in 2005 through the use of extended reach wells drilled from the East Flank sub sea template. Drilling additional
delineation wells in the Far East area is a high priority for us and we continue to promote locations to be considered as
part of the 2005 drilling program. As at December 31, 2004, we had booked 15.6 mmbbls of gross light crude oil in the
proved  developed  category  and  8.0  mmbbls  of  proved  undeveloped.  These  reserves  are  estimated  to  be  capable  of
being produced using primary and secondary (waterﬂood and gasﬂood) production techniques.
White Rose Oil Field
The White Rose oil ﬁeld, which is operated by us, is located 354 kilometres off the coast of Newfoundland and
Labrador approximately 48 kilometres east of the Hibernia oil ﬁeld on the eastern section of the Jeanne d’Arc basin.
Husky’s interest in the White Rose oil ﬁeld is 72.5%.
Early  in  2004,  the  SeaRose  FPSO  (ﬂoating  production  storage  and  ofﬂoading  vessel)  sailed  into  Marystown,
Newfoundland  and  Labrador  following  a  naming  ceremony  and  14,000  nautical  mile  journey  from  South  Korea.  At
Marystown construction of the topsides modules continued. On July 31, 2004 the White Rose project passed a critical
juncture  in  its  development  when  the  ﬁnal  topsides  module  was  lifted  from  quayside  at  the  fabrication  facility  in
Marystown, onboard the FPSO. A total of 17 modules (a combined weight of approximately 12,000 metric tons) were
successfully installed onto the hull. The remainder of the topsides hookup and commissioning work is being carried out
in preparation for sailaway during the third quarter of 2005. At that time, the SeaRose FPSO will depart Marystown for
the White Rose ﬁeld and begin preparations for start of production later in 2005 or early in 2006.
At the White Rose ﬁeld, the FPSO mooring system, including the riser buoy, was successfully installed. Upon the
arrival of the SeaRose FPSO, the riser buoy will be pulled into the turret, providing the anchor point for the FPSO.
Development  drilling  activity  at  the  ﬁeld  is  on  schedule  with  six  wells  drilled  as  at  the  end  of  2004,  including  one
production well, one gas injection well and four water injection wells. All well results were as predicted, or better. The
44
ﬁrst production well was tested, with ﬂow rates of 25-35 mbbls/day, the ﬁrst gas injection well ﬂowed at 60 mmcf/day
and the ﬁrst water injection well tested at an injection rate of 47 mbbls/day.
In  2004,  we  commenced  studies  to  evaluate  the  viability  of  producing  and  transporting  natural  gas  from  White
Rose, and solicited expressions of interest from contractors and engineering ﬁrms to assess the key technical, economic
and regulatory issues critical to a safe and reliable natural gas development on the Grand Banks, as well as the capital
and operating costs of such a development. The solicitation will result in three pre-front end engineering and design
studies.
East Coast
Central and Northern Jeanne d’Arc Basin
45
Our  international  exploration  and  development  program  is  focused  on  Southeast  Asia.  In  China,  we  have  a
40 percent interest in one producing oil ﬁeld and interests in six exploration blocks. The bulk of these interests are in
the  South  China  Sea  where  Husky  recently  added  the  deep-water  block  29-26,  to  our  South  China  Sea  interests.  In
Indonesia, we have a 100 percent interest in the Madura block.
International
South China Sea
Wenchang
The Wenchang oil ﬁeld is located in the western Pearl River Mouth Basin, approximately 300 kilometres south of
Hong Kong and 135 kilometres east of Hainan Island. We hold a 40 percent working interest in the oil ﬁelds, which
commenced  production  in  July  2002.  The  Wenchang  13-1  and  13-2  oil  ﬁelds  are  producing  from  21  wells  in  100
metres of water into a ﬂoating production, storage and ofﬂoading vessel stationed between ﬁxed platforms located in
the ﬁelds. The blended crude oil from the two ﬁelds averages approximately 35⬚ API, similar to the benchmark Minas
blend. At December 31, 2004, our proved reserves at Wenchang were 19.4 mmbbls of crude oil. Our gross production
averaged 19.7 mbbls/day during 2004.
Block 39/05
We executed a production sharing contract with China National Offshore Oil Corporation (‘‘CNOOC’’) for the
5,700  square  kilometres  39-05  Exploration  Block  surrounding  the  Wenchang  ﬁelds  with  a  commencement  date  of
October 1, 2001. CNOOC has the right to participate in development of any discoveries up to a 51 percent working
interest.  In  January  2003,  the  Qionghai  18-1-3  exploration  type  stratigraphic  well  on  the  block  was  plugged  and
abandoned without testing and in February 2003, the Wenchang 8-1-1 exploration type stratigraphic well was plugged
and abandoned without testing. In 2004, we relinquished 25 percent of Block 39-05. Husky is evaluating the geological
information for the remainder of this block and expects to begin exploration work in late 2005 or early 2006.
Blocks 23/15 and 23/20
We  executed  production  sharing  contracts  with  CNOOC  for  the  23-15  and  23-20  exploration  blocks  with  a
commencement date of December 1, 2002. Both contract areas are located in the South China Sea north of Hainan,
within 80 kilometres of the Weizhan oil ﬁelds. The 23-15 block is 1,327 square kilometres and the 23-20 block is 1,543
square kilometres. The work program requires Husky to drill a single exploration well on each block within three years.
CNOOC has the right to participate in development of any discoveries up to a 51 percent working interest. In 2003, we
completed a 1,000 square kilometre 3-D seismic survey shot over a portion of block 23-15. We have completed our
technical evaluation and expect to fulﬁl our Phase I drilling obligations on both blocks in 2005.
Block 29/26
We executed a production sharing contract with CNOOC for the 29-26 exploration block with a commencement
date of October 1, 2004. The block is located in the South China Sea approximately 300 kilometres south east of Hong
Kong and 65 kilometres south east of the Panyu gas discovery. The block covers an area of 3,965 square kilometres.
The  production  sharing  contract  requires  the  drilling  of  one  exploration  well  within  three  years  and  has  a  minimum
work commitment of U.S. $8 million. CNOOC has the right to participate in development of any discoveries up to a
51%  working  interest.  We  are  currently  conducting  a  geological  evaluation  of  the  block  and  are  working  toward
drilling an exploration well.
Block 40/30
We executed a production sharing contract with CNOOC for the 40-30 exploration block with a commencement
date  of  February  1,  2003.  The  block  is  located  in  the  South  China  Sea  approximately  100  kilometres  south  of  the
Wenchang  13-1  and  13-2  oil  ﬁelds.  The  block  covers  an  area  of  6,704  square  kilometres.  The  production  sharing
contract  requires  the  drilling  of  one  exploration  well  within  three  years  and  has  a  minimum  work  commitment  of
U.S. $10 million. CNOOC has the right to participate in development of any discoveries up to a 51 percent working
interest.  We  fulﬁlled  our  Phase  I  obligations  of  the  petroleum  contract  with  the  drilling  of  ChangChang  (‘‘CC’’)
12-1-1. The CC 12-1-1 is the deepest-water well in the South China Sea to date. The CC12-1-1 well was plugged and
abandoned without testing. We expect to complete the geological re-evaluation of the block with information gained
from CC12-1-1 well.

East China Sea
Block 04/35
We executed a production sharing contract with CNOOC for the 04-35 exploration block with a commencement
date of December 1, 2003. The block is located in the East China Sea approximately 350 kilometres east of the city of
Shanghai  and  covers  an  area  of  4,835  square  kilometres.  The  production  sharing  contract  requires  the  drilling  of  a
single exploration well in the ﬁrst exploration phase to a depth of 2,500 metres within three years and a minimum work
commitment  of  U.S.  $3  million.  Technical  evaluations  of  the  hydrocarbon  potential  are  complete  and  we  expect  to
fulﬁll  our  ﬁrst  phase  commitments  early  in  2006.  CNOOC  has  the  right  to  participate  in  development  of  any
discoveries up to a 51 percent working interest.
China
Madura Strait, Indonesia
We have a 100 percent interest in a production sharing contract (‘‘PSC’’), which provides for various cost and
production  sharing  arrangements,  relating  to  a  2,794  square  kilometre  block  in  the  Madura  Strait  offshore  Java,
Indonesia. Ten exploration and appraisal wells have been drilled in the block, resulting in discoveries of two natural gas
ﬁelds.  The  Indonesian  state  oil  company  granted  commercial  status  and  approved  a  plan  of  development  for  one  of
47
these ﬁelds in order to supply natural gas to a proposed independent power plant near Pasuruan, East Java. Construction
of the power plant did not proceed due to economic issues that occurred in Indonesia shortly after the natural gas sales
contract  was  signed.  In  2003  the  natural  gas  sales  contract  was  cancelled  with  the  approval  of  the  Indonesian
authorities.  In  January  2003,  we  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  begin  discussions  intended  to  ﬁnalize  a
new natural gas sales contract for the Madura production. In 2005, we expect to complete negotiation of the gas sales
contract, and submit a revised Plan of Development to the Indonesian regulatory authority for approval.
Shatirah, Libya
Husky has an interest in a small crude oil production operation in the Shatirah ﬁeld, onshore Libya.
Distribution of Oil and Gas Production
Crude Oil and NGL
Husky  provides  heavy  crude  oil  feedstock  to  its  upgrader  and  its  asphalt  reﬁnery,  which  are  located  at
Lloydminster.  The  combined  dry  crude  feedstock  requirements  of  the  upgrader  and  asphalt  reﬁnery  are  equal  to
approximately  75  percent  of  Husky’s  heavy  crude  oil  production  from  the  Lloydminster  area.  Husky  also  markets
heavy crude oil production directly to reﬁners located in the mid-west and eastern United States and Canada. Husky
markets its light and synthetic crude oil production to third party reﬁners in Canada, the United States and Asia. Natural
gas liquids are sold to local petrochemical end users, retail and wholesale distributors and to reﬁners in North America.
Husky markets third party volumes of light crude oil, heavy crude oil and NGL in addition to its own production.

Midstream Operations
Overview
The midstream operations include:
) Upgrading — the upgrading of heavy crude oil feedstock into synthetic crude oil;
)
Infrastructure — pipeline transportation and processing of heavy crude oil, storage of crude oil, diluent and
natural gas, extraction of NGL from natural gas, cogeneration of electrical and thermal energy; and
) Marketing  —  the  purchase  and  marketing  of  Husky’s  and  other  producers’  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  NGL,
sulphur, petroleum coke and electrical power.
Upgrading Operations
Husky owns and operates the Husky Lloydminster Upgrader, which is a heavy oil upgrading facility located in
Lloydminster, Saskatchewan.
The Husky Lloydminster Upgrader is designed to process blended heavy crude oil feedstock into high quality, low
sulphur synthetic crude oil. Synthetic crude oil is used as feedstock for the reﬁning of premium transportation fuels in
Canada  and  the  United  States.  In  addition,  the  Husky  Lloydminster  Upgrader  recovers  the  diluent,  which  facilitates
pipeline transportation of heavy crude oil, and returns it to ﬁeld to be reused.
The  Husky  Lloydminster  Upgrader  provides  heavy  crude  oil  access  to  a  new  market,  which  we  believe  has
facilitated, and will continue to stimulate heavy oil production in the area. The market for heavy crude oil previously
was  either  as  feedstock  for  asphalt  production  or  it  was  sold  as  blended  heavy  crude  oil  for  feedstock  for  speciﬁc
reﬁneries designed to process or upgrade heavier crude oils. The Husky Lloydminster Upgrader was commissioned in
1992  with  an  original  design  capacity  of  46  mbbls/day  of  synthetic  crude  oil.  Actual  production  has  ranged
considerably  higher  than  the  original  design  rate  capacity  as  a  result  of  throughput  modiﬁcations  and  improved
reliability.  The  upgrader’s  current  rated  capacity  exceeds  61  mbbls/day  of  synthetic  crude  oil.  Production  at  the
upgrader  averaged  55.2  mbbls/day  of  synthetic  crude  oil  and  9.4  mbbls/day  of  diluent  in  2004  compared  with  61.6
mbbls/day of synthetic crude oil and 10.9 mbbls/day of diluent in 2003. Throughput at the upgrader in 2004 was lower
than 2003 due to unplanned outages for repairs during 2004. In addition to synthetic crude oil and diluent, the Husky
Lloydminster Upgrader also produced, as by-products of its upgrading operations, approximately 311 lt/day of sulphur
and  396  lt/day  of  petroleum  coke  during  2004.  These  products  are  sold  in  local  and  international  markets.  The
proﬁtability  of  our  upgrading  operations  is  primarily  dependent  upon  the  differential  between  the  price  of  synthetic
crude oil and the price of heavy crude oil.
The upgrader is currently undergoing a number of debottleneck projects. These projects, upon completion in late
2006, are expected to increase upgrading capacity to 82 mbbls/day of synthetic crude oil and diluent.

Infrastructure and Marketing
Heavy Oil Pipeline Systems and Processing Facilities
Husky has been involved in the gathering, transporting and storage of heavy crude oil in the Lloydminster area
since  the  early  1960s.  Our  crude  oil  pipeline  systems  include  approximately  2,050  kilometres  of  pipeline  and  are
capable  of  transporting  in  excess  of  575  mbbls/day  of  blended  heavy  crude  oil,  diluent  and  synthetic  crude  oil.  The
pipeline  systems  transport  blended  heavy  crude  oil  to  Lloydminster,  accessing  markets  through  the  Husky
Lloydminster Upgrader and our asphalt reﬁnery in Lloydminster. Blended heavy crude oil from the ﬁeld and synthetic
crude oil from the upgrading operations are moved south to Hardisty, Alberta to a connection of the Enbridge Pipeline
system and the Express Pipeline system. The crude oil is transported to eastern and southern markets on these pipelines.
Our crude oil pipeline systems also have feeder pipeline interconnections with the Cold Lake Partnership Pipeline, the
Enbridge Athabasca Pipeline and the Talisman Chauvin Pipeline.
The following table shows the average daily pipeline throughput for the periods indicated:

In recent years Husky has expanded and expects to further expand its heavy crude pipeline systems to capitalize
on anticipated increases in heavy oil production from the Lloydminster and Cold Lake areas.
We consider the expansion and optimization of our pipeline systems in the Lloydminster area to be necessary to
further our own development objectives in the area. As a result of recent expansion of mainline pipeline systems in the
area, competition for throughput volumes has increased.
We  operate  16  heavy  crude  oil  processing  facilities  located  throughout  the  Lloydminster  area.  These  facilities
process Husky’s and other producers’ raw heavy crude oil from the ﬁeld by removing sand, water and other impurities
to produce clean dry heavy crude oil. The heavy crude oil is then blended with a diluent to meet pipeline speciﬁcations
for transportation.

Heavy Oil Pipeline Systems
Cogeneration
Husky  has  a  50  percent  interest  in  a  215  MW  natural  gas  ﬁred  cogeneration  facility  at  the  site  of  the  Husky
Lloydminster Upgrader. The plant was commissioned in December 1999. Electricity produced at the facility is being
sold to Saskatchewan Power Corporation under a 25 year power purchase agreement effective in 1999. Thermal energy
(steam) is sold to the Husky Lloydminster Upgrader.
Husky has a 50 percent interest in a 90 MW natural gas ﬁred cogeneration facility adjacent to Husky’s Rainbow
Lake  processing  plant.  The  cogeneration  plant  produces  electricity  for  the  Alberta  Power  Pool  and  thermal  energy
(steam)  for  the  Rainbow  Lake  processing  plant.  It  provides  power  directly  to  the  Alberta  Power  Pool  under  an
agreement  with  the  Alberta  Transmission  Administrator  to  provide  additional  electricity  generating  capacity  and
system stability for north-western Alberta. The power plant has the capability of being expanded to approximately 110
MW in total. Husky is the operator of the facility.
51
Natural Gas Storage Facilities
Husky  has  been  operating  a  natural  gas  storage  facility  at  Hussar,  Alberta  since  April  2000.  The  facility  has  a
working  storage  capacity  of  17  bcf  of  natural  gas.  Husky  is  continuing  to  evaluate  additional  storage  opportunities
within Western Canada.
Commodity Marketing
Husky is a marketer of both its own and third party production of crude oil, synthetic crude oil, NGL, natural gas
and sulphur. We also market petroleum coke, a by-product from the Lloydminster upgrader. We supply feedstock to
our upgrader and asphalt reﬁnery from our own and third party heavy oil production sourced from the Lloydminster
and Cold Lake areas. We also sell blended heavy crude oil directly to reﬁners based in the United States and Canada.
Our extensive infrastructure in the Lloydminster area supports its heavy crude oil reﬁning and marketing operations.
We market light and medium crude oil and NGL sourced from our own production and third party production.
Light crude oil is acquired for processing by third party reﬁners at Edmonton, Alberta and by our reﬁnery at Prince
George, British Columbia. We market the synthetic crude oil produced at our upgrader in Lloydminster to reﬁners in
Canada and the United States.
We market natural gas sourced from our own production and third party production. We are currently committed
to gas sales contracts with third parties, which in aggregate do not exceed amounts forecast to be deliverable from our
reserves. Our contracts are with customers located in eastern Canada/north-eastern United States (28 percent), mid-west
United  States  (23  percent),  Western  Canada  (46  percent)  and  west  coast  United  States  (3  percent).  The  natural  gas
volumes  sales  contracted  are  primarily  at  market  prices  (90  percent).  The  terms  of  the  contracts  remaining  at
December 31, 2004 are up to one year (72 percent), one year to ﬁve years (20 percent) and over ﬁve years (8 percent).
Husky has acquired rights to ﬁrm pipeline capacity to transport the natural gas to most of these markets.
We have developed our commodity marketing operations to include the acquisition of third party volumes in order
to increase volumes and enhance the value of our midstream assets. We plan to expand our marketing operations by
continuing to increase marketing activities. We believe that this increase will generate synergies with the marketing of
our own production volumes and the optimization of our assets.
Reﬁned Products
Overview
Husky’s reﬁned products operations include reﬁning and retail, commercial and wholesale marketing of reﬁned
petroleum products. Our retail network provides a platform for substantial non-fuel related businesses.
Light oil reﬁned products are produced at our reﬁnery at Prince George, British Columbia and are also acquired
from third party reﬁners and marketed through Husky and Mohawk branded retail and commercial petroleum outlets
and  through  direct  marketing  to  third  party  dealers  and  end  users.  Asphalt  and  residual  products  are  produced  at
Husky’s  asphalt  reﬁnery  at  Lloydminster  and  are  marketed  directly  or  through  Husky’s  8  emulsion  plants,  four  of
which are also asphalt terminals located throughout Western Canada.
Branded Petroleum Product Outlets and Commercial Distribution
Distribution
As of December 31, 2004, there were 531 independently operated Husky and Mohawk branded petroleum product

Our strategy in respect of our petroleum product outlets includes continuing to increase proﬁts and sales through
the  strategic  location  of  new  outlets,  the  enhancement  of  ancillary  non-fuel  income  streams,  the  modernization,
automation and upgrading of existing petroleum product outlets, expanding customer loyalty programs and the sale of
non-core locations. We also plan to continue to enter into strategic alliances with third parties to sell various consumer
products at Husky and Mohawk branded petroleum outlets in order to generate revenue and increase demand for other
products and services provided at those outlets. We are pursuing acquisitions and joint venture opportunities to further
enhance our existing distribution network.
Supply
Prince  George  Reﬁnery. Husky  owns  and  operates  a  reﬁnery  at  Prince  George,  British  Columbia,  which  has
capacity to reﬁne more than 10,000 bbls/day of light crude oil into a full range of reﬁned petroleum products. The crude
oil feedstock for the Prince George reﬁnery is produced primarily in north-eastern British Columbia by other producers
and delivered to our reﬁnery by pipeline. We are pursuing acquisitions and trading opportunities to further enhance our
existing reﬁning capacity. We are currently upgrading the reﬁnery to meet new Federal regulations governing sulphur
content in fuel.
Other  Supply  Arrangements.
In  addition  to  the  reﬁned  petroleum  products  supplied  by  the  Prince  George
reﬁnery,  Husky  has  established  processing  arrangements  with  major  reﬁners.  Processing  arrangements  allow  us  to
participate in industry reﬁning margins. Primarily Husky crude oil production and some third party purchased crude oil
is delivered to major reﬁners, who process the crude oil into reﬁned products, which are then marketed by us through
our retail networks and to our wholesale customers. During 2004, these reﬁners processed an average of approximately
35.9 mbbls/day of crude oil for us, yielding approximately 33.6 mbbls/day of reﬁned petroleum products. During 2004,
we  also  purchased  approximately  9.1  mbbls/day  of  reﬁned  petroleum  products  from  reﬁners  and  acquired
approximately 5.9 mbbls/day of reﬁned petroleum products pursuant to exchange agreements with third party reﬁners.
Ethanol Plants. Husky owns an ethanol plant at Minnedosa, Manitoba that produces nine million litres per year
of fuel ethanol and one million litres per year of industrial alcohol. We are planning to expand our current capacity to
130 million litres per year of ethanol production at the Minnedosa plant. Ethanol is produced primarily from wheat and
other  grains.  It  is  an  oxygenate,  which  when  added  to  gasoline,  promotes  fuel  combustion,  raises  octane  levels  and
inhibits water from freezing in fuel lines. The ethanol blended gasoline (Mother Nature’s Fuel) has received federal
government  recognition  for  its  low  combustion  emissions.  We  are  currently  constructing  another  ethanol  plant  at
Lloydminster Saskatchewan that will have the capacity to produce 130 million litres per year. Ethanol-blended gasoline
is  now  available  at  all  Husky  and  Mohawk  retail  outlets.  We  also  supply  E85  (85  percent  ethanol  content  blended
gasoline) to some Federal Government ﬂeet vehicles across Western Canada.
Asphalt Products
We  have  been  in  the  paving  and  specialty  asphalt  business  for  over  50  years.  We  supply  asphalt  products  to
customers across Western Canada and the north-western and midwestern United States. We have a signiﬁcant market
share for paving asphalt, emulsiﬁed asphalt and asphalt products sold in Western Canada. Most of the asphalt sold is
used  for  paving  and  other  industrial  purposes.  Our  Pounder  Emulsions  division  manufactures  modiﬁed  and
conventional  road  application  emulsion  products.  Additional  non-asphalt  based  road  maintenance  products  are
marketed and distributed through the Western Road Management division of Husky. Demand for higher quality asphalt
products has allowed us to increase sales into the United States and Eastern Canada, with products occasionally being
shipped as far away as Texas, Florida and New Brunswick. In 2004, 51 percent of our asphalt production was exported
55
to the United States. We plan to continue our efforts to improve our asphalt business by increasing modiﬁed asphalt
production  capacity  to  produce  better  products  at  a  lower  cost.  We  are  also  studying  the  feasibility  of  expanding
production and distribution capacity.
Husky’s  asphalt  distribution  network  consists  of  four  emulsion/asphalt  terminals  located  at  Kamloops,  British
Columbia; Lethbridge, Alberta; Yorkton, Saskatchewan; and Winnipeg, Manitoba and four emulsion plants located at
Edmonton,  Alberta;  Watson  Lake,  Yukon;  Lloydminster  and  Saskatoon,  Saskatchewan.  Husky  also  utilizes  an
independently operated terminal at Langley, British Columbia.
All  of  our  asphalt  requirements  are  supplied  by  our  Lloydminster,  Alberta  asphalt  reﬁnery.  The  reﬁnery  was
commissioned  in  1983,  replacing  a  Husky  facility  that  had  been  operating  since  1947.  The  reﬁnery  was  designed
speciﬁcally  to  produce  asphalt  from  heavy  crude  oil  at  a  rate  of  25  mbbls/day.  The  crude  oil  feedstock  for  the
Lloydminster reﬁnery is supplied through Husky’s pipeline systems from the supply of heavy crude oil in the region,
including Husky’s heavy crude oil.
The following table shows our average daily sales volumes of products produced at the Lloydminster reﬁnery, for
the years indicated:

Reﬁnery  throughput  averaged  25.4  mbbls/day  of  blended  heavy  crude  oil  feedstock  during  2004.  Due  to  the
seasonal  demand  for  asphalt  products  the  reﬁnery  historically  has  operated  at  full  capacity  only  during  the  normal
paving  season  in  Canada  and  the  northern  United  States.  We  have  implemented  various  plans  to  increase  reﬁnery
throughput during the other months of the year, such as producing low sulphur diesel, entering into custom processing
arrangements and developing other U.S. and international markets for asphalt products.

Credit  ratings  are  intended  to  provide  investors  with  an  independent  measure  of  credit  quality  of  any  issue  of
securities.  The  credit  ratings  accorded  to  Husky’s  securities  by  the  rating  agencies  are  not  recommendations  to
purchase, hold or sell the securities inasmuch as such ratings do not comment as to market price or suitability for a
particular investor. Any rating may not remain in effect for any given period of time or may be revised or withdrawn
entirely by a rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances so warrant.
Moody’s
Moody’s  credit  rating  system  ranges  from  Aaa  (highest)  to  C  (lowest).  Debt  securities  rated  within  the  Baa
category are considered medium grade debts; they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments
and principal security appears to be adequate at the time of the rating however they are subject to potential adverse
57
circumstances over time. As a result these debt securities possess some speculative characteristics. The addition of a 1,
2  or  3  modiﬁer  indicates  an  additional  relative  standing  within  the  general  rating  classiﬁcation.  The  addition  of  the
modiﬁer 1 indicates the debt is positioned in the top one third of the general rating classiﬁcation, 2 indicates the mid
one third and 3 indicates the bottom one third.
Standard and Poor’s
Standard and Poor’s credit rating system ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). Debt securities rated within
the BBB category are considered to possess adequate protection parameters. However, they could potentially change
subject  to  adverse  economic  conditions  or  other  circumstances  that  may  result  in  reduced  capacity  of  the  debtor  to
continue  to  meet  principal  and  interest  payments.  As  a  result  these  debt  securities  possess  some  speculative
characteristics. The addition of the modiﬁer + or – indicates the debt is positioned above (+) or below (–) the mid range
of the general category.
Dominion Bond Rating Service
Dominion Bond rating Service’s credit rating system ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). Debt securities
rated within the BBB category are considered to be of adequate credit quality. Protection of interest and principal is
considered acceptable, but the debtor is susceptible to adverse changes in ﬁnancial and economic conditions, or there
may be other adverse conditions present which reduce the strength of the debtor and its rated debt. The addition of the
high or low modiﬁer denotes that the rating is either above or below the mid range or the general rating category.
Fitch
Fitch’s  credit  rating  system  ranges  from  AAA  (highest)  to  D  (lowest).  Debt  securities  rated  within  the  BBB
category indicate that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk. The capacity for timely payment of ﬁnancial
commitments is considered adequate, but adverse changes in circumstances or in economic conditions are more likely
to impair this capacity. The addition of the modiﬁer + or – indicates the debt is positioned above (+) or below (–) the
mid range of the general category. The A category denotes that the debtor’s capacity with regard to the rated debt is
strong rather than adequate.

Certain ofﬁcers and directors of Husky are also ofﬁcers and/or directors of other companies engaged in the oil and

best  interests  of  Husky  and,  in  respect  of  the  Business  Corporations  Act  (Alberta),  Husky’s  governing  statute,  that

set  of  ﬁnancial  statements  that  present  a  breadth  and  level  of  complexity  of  accounting  issues  that  are  generally
comparable to the breadth and complexity of the issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by the Company’s
ﬁnancial statements.
The  education  and  experience  of  each  Audit  Committee  member  that  is  relevant  to  the  performance  of  his
responsibilities as an Audit Committee member is as follows.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The  Company  is  involved  in  various  claims  and  litigation  arising  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  While  the
outcome of these matters is uncertain and there can be no assurance that such matters will resolved in the Company’s
favour,  the  Company  does  not  currently  believe  that  the  outcome  of  adverse  decisions  in  any  pending  or  threatened
proceedings related to these or other matters or amount which may be required to pay by reason thereof would have a
material adverse impact on its ﬁnancial position, results of operations or liquidity.

normal spacing.
Liqueﬁed petroleum gas
Liqueﬁed propanes and butanes, separately or in mixtures.
Miscible Flood
An  enhanced  recovery  method  which  requires  that  three  ﬂuids  exist  in  the  reservoir:  the  mobile  oil  to  be

landowner’s royalty reserved to the lessor in an oil and gas lease.
68
Primary recovery
The oil and gas recovered by any method that may be employed to produce the oil or gas through a single well
bore; the ﬂuid enters the well bore by the action of native reservoir energy or gravity.
Production Sharing Contract
A contract for the development of resources under which the contractor’s costs (investment) are recoverable each
year out of the production but there is a maximum amount of production which can be applied to the cost recovery in
any year. This annual allocation of production is referred to as cost oil, the remainder is referred to as proﬁt oil and is
divided in accordance with the contract between the contractor and the host government.
Raw gas
Gas  as  produced  from  a  well  before  the  separation  therefrom  of  liqueﬁable  hydrocarbons  or  other  substances
contained therein.
Recoverable oil-in-place
The total original oil-in-place which can be expected to be recovered. This quantity is dependent upon recovery
efﬁciency and the economics of operation.
Secondary recovery
Oil  or  gas  recovered  by  injecting  water  or  gas  into  the  reservoir  to  force  additional  oil  to  the  producing  wells.
Usually, but not necessarily, this is done after the primary recovery phase has passed.
Seismic (survey)
A method by which the physical attributes in the outer rock shell of the earth are determined by measuring, with a
seismograph, the rate of transmission of shock waves through the various rock formations. The rate at which the waves
are transmitted varies with the medium through which they pass.

explore for, and the exclusive right to drill and test for, petroleum; the exclusive right to develop the applicable area in
order  to  produce  petroleum;  and,  subject  to  satisfying  the  requirements  for  issuance  of  a  production  licence  and
compliance with other provisions of the relevant legislation, the exclusive right to obtain a production licence.
Sour gas
Natural gas contaminated with chemical impurities, notably hydrogen sulphide or other sulphur compounds. Such
compounds must be removed before the gas can be used for commercial or domestic purposes.
Speciﬁc Gravity
The  ratio  between  the  weight  of  equal  volumes  of  water  and  another  liquid  measured  at  standard  temperature,
weight the weight of water as assigned a value of one (1). However , the speciﬁc gravity of oil is normally expressed in
degrees of API gravity as follows:
141.5
Speciﬁc gravity @ F60 degrees
– 131.5
Degrees API =
Spot Price
The  price  for  a  one-time  open  market  transaction  for  immediate  delivery  of  a  speciﬁc  quantity  of  product  at  a
speciﬁc location where the commodity is purchased ‘‘on the spot’’ at current market rates.
69
Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage
A recovery method used to produce heavy crude oil and bitumen in-situ. Steam is injected via a horizontal well
along  a  producing  formation.  The  temperature  in  the  formation  increases  and  lowers  the  viscosity  of  the  crude  oil
allowing it to fall to a horizontal production well beneath the steam injection well.
Step-out Well
A well drilled adjacent to a proven well but located in an unproven area; a well drilled in an effort to ascertain the
extent and boundaries of a producing formation.
Stratigraphic test well
A  drilling  effort,  geologically  directed,  to  obtain  information  pertaining  to  a  speciﬁc  geologic  condition.  Such
wells customarily are drilled without the intention of being completed for hydrocarbon production. This classiﬁcation
also  includes  tests  identiﬁed  as  core  tests  and  all  types  of  expendable  holes  related  to  hydrocarbon  exploration.
Stratigraphic test wells are classiﬁed as (i) ‘‘exploratory-type’’, if not drilled in a proved area, or (ii) ‘‘development-
type’’, if drilled in a proved area.
Synthetic oil
A mixture of hydrocarbons derived by upgrading heavy crude oils, including bitumen, by through a process that
reduces the carbon content and increases the hydrogen content.
Tertiary recovery
The recovery of oil and gas by using exotic or complex recovery schemes involving steam, chemicals, gases or
heat. Usually, but not necessarily, this is done after the secondary recovery phase has passed.
Three-D Seismic (survey)
Three dimensional seismic imaging which uses a grid of numerous cable rather than a few lines stretched in one
line.
Turnaround
Perform maintenance at a plant or facility which requires the plant or facility to be shut down for the duration.
Undeveloped area
An  area  in  which  it  has  not  been  established  by  drilling  operations  whether  oil  and/or  gas  may  be  found  in
commercial quantities.
Waterﬂood
One method of secondary recovery in which water is injected into an oil reservoir for the purpose of forcing oil
out of the reservoir and into the bore of a producing well.
Well Abandonment Costs
Costs of abandoning a well (net of any salvage value) and of disconnecting the well from the surface gathering
system.
Working interest
An interest in the net revenues of an oil and gas property which is proportionate to the share of exploration and
development costs borne until such costs have been recovered, and which entitles the holder to participate in a share of
net revenue thereafter.
SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain  statements  in  this  Annual  Information  Form  are  forward-looking  statements  within  the  meaning  of  the
United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company is
hereby providing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to
70
differ  materially  from  those  projected  in  forward-looking  statements  made  in  this  Annual  Information  Form.  Any
statements  that  express,  or  involve  discussions  as  to,  expectations,  beliefs,  plans,  objectives,  assumptions  or  future
events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as ‘‘will likely result,’’ ‘‘are
expected to,’’ ‘‘will continue,’’ ‘‘is anticipated,’’ ‘‘estimated,’’ ‘‘intends,’’ ‘‘plans,’’ ‘‘projection’’ and ‘‘outlook’’) are
not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties which could
cause  actual  results  or  outcomes  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in  the  forward  looking  statements.
Accordingly, any such statements are qualiﬁed in their entirety by reference to, and are accompanied by, the factors
discussed  throughout  this  Annual  Information  Form.  Among  the  key  factors  that  have  a  direct  bearing  on  the
Company’s  results  of  operation  are  the  nature  of  the  Company’s  involvement  in  the  business  of  exploration,
development  and  production  of  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves  and  the  ﬂuctuation  of  the  exchange  rate  between  the
Canadian  dollar  and  the  United  States  dollar.  These  and  other  factors  are  discussed  herein  under  ‘‘Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’, incorporated by reference in this Annual
Information Form and available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Because actual results or outcomes could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements
of the Company made by or on behalf of the Company, investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-
looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made,
and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or statements to reﬂect events or
circumstances  after  the  date  on  which  such  statement  is  made  or  to  reﬂect  the  occurrence  of  unanticipated  events,
except  as  required  by  applicable  securities  laws.  New  factors  emerge  from  time  to  time,  and  it  is  not  possible  for
management to predict all of such factors and to assess in advance the impact of each such factor on the Company’s
business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements.

securities  regulatory  requirements.  The  members  of  the  Committee  will  be  elected  annually  at  the  organizational
meeting of the full Board on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee to the Co-Chairmen and
will be listed in the annual report to shareholders. One of the members of the Committee will be elected Committee
Chair by the Board.
Responsibility
The  Committee  is  a  part  of  the  Board.  Its  primary  function  is  to  assist  the  Board  in  fulﬁlling  its  oversight
responsibilities with respect to:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
the quarterly and annual ﬁnancial statements and quarterly and annual MD&A be provided to shareholders
and the appropriate regulatory agencies;
earnings press releases before the Company publicly discloses this information;
the system of internal controls that management has established;
the internal and external audit process;
the appointment of qualiﬁed reserves evaluators or auditors; and
(vi)
the ﬁling of statements and reports with respect to the Company’s oil and gas reserves.
In addition, the Committee provides an avenue for communication between the Board and each of internal audit,
the  external  auditors,  ﬁnancial  management,  external  qualiﬁed  reserves  evaluators  or  auditors  and  internal  qualiﬁed
reserves  evaluators.  The  Committee  should  have  a  clear  understanding  with  the  external  auditors  and  the  external
reserve evaluators or auditors that an open and transparent relationship must be maintained with the Committee.
The Committee will make regular reports to the Board concerning its activities.
While  the  Audit  Committee  has  the  responsibilities  and  powers  set  forth  in  this  Charter,  the  role  of  the  Audit
committee is oversight. The members of the Committee are not full time employees of the Company and may or may
not be accountants or auditors by profession or experts in the ﬁelds of accounting or auditing and, in any event, do not
serve  in  such  capacity.  Consequently,  it  is  not  the  duty  of  the  Audit  Committee  to  plan  or  conduct  audits  or  to
determine  that  the  Company’s  ﬁnancial  statements  are  complete  and  accurate  and  are  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted accounting principles. This is the responsibility of management and the external auditors and, as to reserves,
the external reserve evaluators or auditors. Management and the external auditors shall also have the responsibility to
conduct  investigations  and  to  assure  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations  and  the  Company’s  business  conduct
guidelines.
Authority
Subject  to  the  prior  approval  of  the  Board,  the  Committee  is  granted  the  authority  to  investigate  any  matter  or
activity involving ﬁnancial accounting and ﬁnancial reporting, the internal controls of the Company and the reporting
of the Company’s reserves and oil and gas activities.
The Committee has the authority to engage independent counsel and other advisors as it determines necessary to
carry out its duties and to set and pay the compensation for any advisors employed by the Committee.
72
In  recognition  of  the  fact  that  the  independent  auditors  are  ultimately  accountable  to  the  Committee,  the
Committee  shall  have  the  authority  and  responsibility  to  nominate  for  shareholder  approval,  evaluate  and,  where
appropriate, replace the independent auditors and shall approve all audit engagement fees and terms and all non-audit
engagements  with  the  independent  auditors.  The  Committee  shall  consult  with  management  and  the  internal  audit
group but shall not delegate these responsibilities.
Meetings
The  Committee  is  to  meet  at  least  four  times  annually  and  as  many  additional  times  as  the  Committee  deems
necessary. Committee members will strive to be present at all meetings either in person or by telephone. As necessary
or  desirable,  but  in  any  case  at  least  quarterly,  the  Committee  shall  meet  with  members  of  management  and
representatives of the external auditors and internal audit in separate executive sessions to discuss any matters that the
Committee or any of these groups believes should be discussed privately. Likewise, as necessary or desirable, but in
any  case  at  least  annually,  the  Committee  shall  meet  the  management  and  representatives  of  the  external  reserve
evaluators  or  auditors  and  internal  reserves  evaluators  in  separate  executive  sessions  to  discuss  matters  that  the
Committee  or  any  of  these  groups  believes  should  be  discussed  privately.  In  respect  of  the  Committee’s  oversight
regarding reserves, the Committee engages the services of an independent reserves consultant.

on changes during the year in accounting principles and their application.
) Signiﬁcant changes to the audit plan, if any, and any serious disputes or difﬁculties with management
encountered  during  the  audit.  Inquire  about  the  cooperation  received  by  the  external  auditors  during
their audit, including access to all requested records, data and information.
)
Inquire of the external auditors whether there have been any material disagreements with management,
which,  if  not  satisfactorily  resolved,  would  have  caused  them  to  issue  a  non-standard  report  on  the
Company’s ﬁnancial statements.
13. Discuss  with  the  external  auditors,  without  management  being  present,  (a)  the  quality  of  the  Company’s
ﬁnancial  and  accounting  personnel,  and  (b)  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  the  Company’s  ﬁnancial
statements. Also, elicit the comments of management regarding the responsiveness of the external auditors
to the Company’s needs.
14. Meet with management, to discuss any relevant signiﬁcant recommendations that the external auditors may
have,  particularly  those  characterized  as  ‘material’  or  ‘serious’.  Typically,  such  recommendations  will  be
presented  by  the  external  auditors  in  the  form  of  a  Letter  of  Comments  and  Recommendations  to  the
Committee.  The  Committee  should  review  responses  of  management  to  the  Letter  of  Comments  and
Recommendations from the external auditors and receive follow-up reports on action taken concerning the
aforementioned recommendations.
15. Have  the  sole  authority  to  review  in  advance,  and  grant  any  appropriate  pre-approvals,  of  all  non-audit
services to be provided by the independent auditors and, in connection therewith, to approve all fees and
other  terms  of  engagement.  The  Committee  shall  also  review  and  approve  disclosures  required  to  be
included  in  periodic  reports  ﬁled  with  Canadian  securities  regulators  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission with respect to non-audit services performed by external auditors.
16. Be satisﬁed that adequate procedures are in place for the review of the Company’s disclosure of ﬁnancial
information  extracted  or  derived  from  the  Company’s  ﬁnancial  statements,  and  periodically  assess  the
adequacy of those procedures.
17.
