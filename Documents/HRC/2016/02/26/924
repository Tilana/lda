<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>,

<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> relevant international human rights treaties, in particular the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>all relevant General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions 
</p>

</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any 
</p>
<p>of the distinctions stipulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
</p>
<p>without unreasonable restrictions, to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or 
</p>
<p>through freely chosen representatives, and to have access, on general terms of equality, to 
</p>
<p>public service in his or her country, as well as to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic 
</p>
<p>elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors, and reaffirming also that the 
</p>
<p>will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that no distinctions are permitted among citizens in the enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs on the grounds of race, colour, sex, 
</p>

<p>language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or 
</p>
<p>other status, or on the basis of disability, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the critical importance of equal and effective participation in political 
</p>

</p>
<p>and advancing gender equality, as well as for the realization of all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the active participation of women, on equal terms with men, at all 
</p>
<p>levels of decision-making, is essential to the achievement of equality, inclusive economic 
</p>
<p>growth and sustainable development, peace and democracy, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the rights of everyone to freedom of expression, to peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and to freedom of association are among the essential conditions for equal 
</p>
<p>participation in political and public affairs and must be promoted and protected, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also </i>the need for further work on the full and effective implementation 
</p>
<p>of the right to participate in public affairs in the context of article 25 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> the need to intensify efforts to eliminate barriers in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice and to actively facilitate full and effective participation in political and public 
</p>
<p>affairs, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>

</p>
<p>mechanisms on identifying and addressing obstacles to the full implementation of the right 
</p>

</p>
<p>participation and steps to overcome those challenges, prepared by the Office of the United

</p>
<p>in political and public affairs, including, inter alia, reviewing and repealing measures that

</p>
<p>guiding this implementation, and to present it to the Council at its thirtieth session for 
</p>
<p>further consideration.
