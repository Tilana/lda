Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains
forward-looking statements
within the meaning of federal
securities laws regarding MPLX
LP (“MPLX”), Marathon
Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”),
and MarkWest Energy Partners,
L.P. (“MWE”). These forward-
looking statements relate to,
among other things,
expectations, estimates and
projections concerning the
business and operations of
MPC, MPLX and MWE. You
can identify forward-looking
statements by words such as
“anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” "objective," “expect,”
“forecast,” "plan," “project,”
"potential," “could,” “may,”
“should,” “would,” “will” or other
similar expressions that convey
the uncertainty of future events
or outcomes. Such forward-
looking statements are not
guarantees of future
performance and are subject to
risks, uncertainties and other
factors, some of which are
beyond the companies’ control
and are difficult to predict.
Factors that could cause
MPLX's or MWE’s actual results
to differ materially from those in
the forward-looking statements
include: their ability to complete
the proposed merger of MPLX
and MWE on anticipated terms
and timetable; the ability to
obtain approval of the
transaction by the unitholders
of MWE and satisfy other
conditions to the closing of the
transaction contemplated by
the merger agreement; the
ability to obtain governmental
approvals of the MPLX/MWE
transaction based on the
proposed terms and schedule,
and any conditions imposed on
the combined company in
connection with consummation
of the MPLX/MWE transaction;
the risk that the costs savings
and any other synergies from
the MPLX/MWE transaction
may not be fully realized or may
take longer to realize than
expected; disruption from the
MPLX/MWE transaction making
it more difficult to maintain
relationships with customers,
employees or suppliers; risks
relating to any unforeseen
liabilities of MWE or MPLX, as
applicable; the adequacy of
their respective capital
resources and liquidity,
including, but not limited to,
availability of sufficient cash
flow to pay distributions and
execute their respective
business plans; the timing and
extent of changes in commodity
prices and demand for crude
oil, refined products, feedstocks
or other hydrocarbon-based
products; volatility in and/or
degradation of market and
industry conditions; completion
of pipeline capacity by
competitors; disruptions due to
equipment interruption or
failure, including electrical
shortages and power grid
failures; the suspension,
reduction or termination of
MPC's obligations under
MPLX’s commercial
agreements; each company’s
ability to successfully implement
its growth plan, whether
through organic growth or
acquisitions; modifications to
earnings and distribution
growth objectives; federal and
state environmental, economic,
health and safety, energy and
other policies and regulations;
changes to MPLX’s capital
budget; other risk factors
inherent to their industry; and
the factors set forth under the
heading "Risk Factors" in
MPLX's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended Dec.
31, 2014, filed with the
Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC); and the
factors set forth under the
heading "Risk Factors" in
MWE's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended Dec.
31, 2014, filed with the SEC.
Factors that could cause MPC’s
actual results to differ materially
from those in the forward-
looking statements include:
risks described above relating
to the MPLX/MWE proposed
merger; changes to the
expected construction costs
and timing of pipeline projects;
volatility in and/or degradation
of market and industry
conditions; the availability and
pricing of crude oil and other
feedstocks; slower growth in
domestic and Canadian crude
supply; an easing or lifting of
the U.S. crude oil export ban;
completion of pipeline capacity
to areas outside the U.S.
Midwest; consumer demand for
refined products; transportation
logistics; the reliability of
processing units and other
equipment; MPC’s ability to
successfully implement growth
opportunities; modifications to
MPLX earnings and distribution
growth objectives; federal and
state environmental, economic,
health and safety, energy and
other policies and regulations;
MPC’s ability to successfully
integrate the acquired Hess
retail operations and achieve
the strategic and other
expected objectives relating to
the acquisition; changes to
MPC’s capital budget; other risk
factors inherent to MPC’s
industry; and the factors set
forth under the heading "Risk
Factors" in MPC's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended Dec. 31, 2014, filed
with SEC. In addition, the
forward-looking statements
included herein could be
affected by general domestic
and international economic and
political conditions.
Unpredictable or unknown
