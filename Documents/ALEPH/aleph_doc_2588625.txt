Rio de Janeiro, August 3, 2016 — Vale S.A. (Vale) hereby announces that its wholly owned subsidiary Vale Overseas

from the offering to pay part of the redemption price of the 6.250% notes due 2017, issued by Vale Overseas and
guaranteed by Vale S.A., which mature in January 2017.
The notes will be unsecured obligations of Vale Overseas and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Vale. The
