</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 4/1, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to submit 
to the Council an annual report on the implementation of that resolution. The Human Rights 
Council referred to activities in a range of fields relevant to the promotion and protection of 
human rights, focusing particularly on the activities of United Nations treaty bodies; the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council, with mandates focusing on one or more economic, 
social and cultural rights and also with other thematic mandates; and the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Concerning OHCHR, the present report 
contains some illustrative examples of the activities undertaken in implementing the strategic 
vision set out in the High Commissioner&#8217;s Strategic Management Plan for the period 2008-2009 
and further detailed in the corresponding Plan of Action. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES OF TREATY BODIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>2. As at 1 December 2008, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights had been ratified or acceded to by 159 States,<b>1</b> an increase of 2 States parties during the 
reporting period. 
</p>
<p>3. During its two sessions held in 2008, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights examined the status of implementation of the Covenant in nine States parties, on the basis 
of reports submitted by them, as well as a document submitted by the United Nations Interim 
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) on the implementation of the Covenant in Kosovo 
since 1999. A constructive dialogue was held with a delegation from each of those States parties, 
as well as from UNMIK. The States parties examined were Angola, Benin, Bolivia, France, 
India, Kenya, Nicaragua, the Philippines and Sweden. 
</p>
<p>4. At its forty-first session, held from 3 to 21 November 2008, the Committee adopted 
reporting guidelines on treaty-specific documents to be submitted by States parties under 
articles 16 and 17 of the Covenant (E/C.12/2008/2). These guidelines replace the Committee&#8217;s 
revised reporting guidelines (E/C.12/1991/1) and take into account the harmonized guidelines on 
reporting under the international human rights treaties (HRI/GEN/2/Rev.5), as well as the 
Committee&#8217;s evolving practice in relation to the application of the Covenant, as reflected in its 
concluding observations, general comments and statements. 
</p>
<p>5. Also at its forty-first session, on 17 November 2008, the Committee held a half-day 
general discussion on &#8220;Non-discrimination and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights&#8221;, during which experts from specialized agencies, academic institutions, 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and OHCHR provided input for the preparation of a 
general comment on article 2, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. On 1 May 2008, members of the Committee participated in an informal consultation on the 
impact of international trade agreements on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights 
with World Trade Organization (WTO) ambassadors, NGO representatives, as well as with 
OHCHR and WTO staff members, to further discuss potential areas of interaction between trade 
and human rights. On 10 November 2008, members of the Committee participated in an informal 
consultation on trade and human rights to discuss the possibility of drafting a set of questions 
which might serve as a reference in the Committee&#8217;s dialogue with States parties, with a view to 
assessing the extent to which trade and trade-related policies affect the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>7. On 16 May 2008, at its fortieth session, the Committee adopted a statement on the world 
food crisis (E/C.12/2008/1), in which it urged States parties to address the structural causes of 
the crisis, notably by promoting sustainable agriculture, investing in small-scale agriculture, 
revising the WTO trade regime to ensure that trade rules promote rather than undermine the right 
to adequate food, as well as by undertaking ex ante impact assessments of financial, trade and 
development policies. 
</p>
<p>8. The joint expert group on the monitoring of the right to education, which comprises 
two members of the Committee and two members of the Committee on Conventions and 
Recommendations of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), held its eighth and ninth meetings on 6 May and 25 November 2008, respectively. 
The joint expert group discussed, inter alia, the inclusive dimensions of the right to education 
and made recommendations to ensure universal access to education without discrimination or 
exclusion. It presented its recommendations to the 48th International Conference on Education, 
held on 26 November 2008 in Geneva, emphasizing the legal obligation and political 
responsibility of States to give effect to the inclusive dimensions of the right to education. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>9. In 2008, the Committee on the Rights of the Child continued to address the issue of 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights of all children in the course of its work. 
</p><p>10. The annual day of general discussion of the Committee, held on 19 September 2008 during 
its forty-ninth session, was devoted to articles 28 and 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child dealing with the right to education, focusing upon the education of children in emergency 
situations. The Committee benefited from a large number of participants from States parties, 
international organizations and NGOs, as well as individuals. The discussion identified, among 
key issues, the fact that quality education was a human right that children do not forfeit when 
struck by emergency situations; that education must form an integral part of every humanitarian 
response and must be provided from the outset of relief measures; and that minimum standards 
must be respected. The discussion also highlighted the need to take preventive action in order to 
ensure the right to education in emergency situations whenever possible. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Committee on Migrant Workers 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Committee on Migrant Workers continued to address the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights of all migrant workers and members of their families in 2008. At its 
eighth and ninth sessions in 2008, the Committee considered reports submitted by Bolivia, the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic and El Salvador. When considering reports of States parties, and in 
particular in its concluding observations, the Committee recommended that States parties take 
the necessary measures, including legislative amendments, to ensure that migrant workers and 
members of their families can enjoy economic, social and cultural rights and notably the right to 
form and join trade unions. Further, the Committee expressed concern about the situation of 
children of migrant families, and recommended that States parties carry out comprehensive 
studies regarding their situation in order to develop adequate strategies to ensure their protection 
and the full enjoyment of their rights, including the right to education and other economic, social 
and cultural rights. In its review of States parties&#8217; reports, the Committee also called upon States 
parties to ensure the equal treatment of migrant workers, particularly migrant women, in 
agriculture and domestic employment. To this purpose, the Committee urged for an effective 
monitoring of the employment conditions of migrant workers in agriculture and domestic 
employment. The issue of seasonal workers&#8217; enjoyment of the right to the same treatment as 
national workers, particularly with respect to remuneration and conditions of work, was also 
highlighted. In this regard, the Committee asked States parties to ensure systematic monitoring, 
by the relevant authorities, of compliance with international standards. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES OF SPECIAL PROCEDURES 
</b></p>
<p>12. During the reporting period, the Human Rights Council decided to extend the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living by its resolution 6/27. At its seventh session, the Human Rights 
Council appointed Raquel Rolnik to succeed to Miloon Kothari who served as Special 
Rapporteur since 2000. After discussions with a number of States, civil society representatives 
and other actors interested in the mandate, the new Special Rapporteur presented her first report 
(A/63/275) to the sixty-third session of the General Assembly, which gives her views on further 
directions of the mandate. In particular, the Special Rapporteur identified the following issues as 
priorities, in addition to those developed by the previous mandate holder: the relation between 
the organization of mega-events and housing policies, the right to adequate housing in 
post-conflict and post-disaster reconstruction, the effects of climate change on the right to 
adequate housing, migration and housing and issues of social inclusiveness. The Special 
Rapporteur also discussed common projects to be developed in the coming years with other 
mandate holders. From 3 to 6 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur attended and participated 
as a keynote speaker to the 4th World Urban Forum in Nanjing, China. 
</p><p>13. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, 
Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, undertook a country visit to Guatemala. He participated in various 
conferences and seminars, notably in relation to the topic of his 2008 annual report, devoted to 
the right to education in emergency situations. In this context, he also attended the day of general 
discussion of the Committee on the Rights of the Child dedicated to this issue. He further 
attended the International Conference on Education, hosted by UNESCO and the International 
Bureau of Education, as well as the Forum on Minority Issues organized by the independent 
expert on minority issues and OHCHR. The Special Rapporteur also held various consultations 
with several actors to gather relevant information for his 2009 annual report, which will focus on 
the right to education of persons in detention. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. The former Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, Paul Hunt, undertook a mission to 
GlaxoSmithKlyne (GSK), a pharmaceutical company in London. The new Special Rapporteur, 
Anand Grover, succeeded Paul Hunt on 1 August 2008. In August 2008, he participated in the 
AIDS International Conference held in Mexico City. In October, he presented a report to the 
General Assembly (A/63/263) prepared by his predecessor. The report discusses the importance 
of effective, transparent, accessible and independent accountability mechanisms in relation to the 
highest attainable standard of health. The annex to the report contains the Human Rights 
Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies in relation to Access to Medicines, which are the 
outcome of wide-ranging discussions and consultations spanning over five years and consider 
issues such as transparency, management, accountability, patents, licensing and pricing in the 
context of access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>15. Since he took office on 1 May 2008, the current Special Rapporteur on the right to food, 
Olivier de Schutter, devoted much attention to the global food crisis. In particular, he examined 
the extent to which the responses adopted at the international and national levels have integrated 
the right to food. He also encouraged States to call for a special session of the Human Rights 
Council on the food crisis, which took place on 7 May 2008. The Special Rapporteur presented a 
report on the food crisis at the September 2008 session of the Human Rights Council, where he 
was mandated to monitor the implementation of responses to the crisis at the national level and 
report back on this in September 2009. The Special Rapporteur also participated in the 
High-Level Conference on World Food Security: The Challenges of Climate Change and 
Bioenergy, organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on 3-5 June 2008. The 
Special Rapporteur also convened a multi-stakeholder consultation on 15-16 December 2008 to 
discuss how the initiatives taken to support the agricultural sector in Africa could create an 
enabling environment to respect, protect and fulfil the right to food. 
</p>
<p>16. The mandate of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme 
poverty was handed over from Arjun Sengupta to Magdalena Sepulveda in May 2008. In 
October 2008, the independent expert presented her first report to the General Assembly 
(A/63/274), detailing her programme of work. From 10 to 15 November 2008, the independent 
expert visited Ecuador where she gathered information about the situation of people living in 
extreme poverty and the main social policies in place. She also started developing her first 
thematic report, which will focus on cash transfer programmes, by compiling available 
information and sharing a questionnaire on these programmes to Member States. 
</p>
<p>17. In March 2008, the former independent expert on the effects of economic reform policies 
and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, Bernards Mudho, presented to the 
Human Rights Council draft general guidelines to be followed when pursuing economic reform 
and debt relief programmes in developing countries. The Human Rights Council, by 
resolution 7/4, reformulated the mandate of the independent expert to focus on the effects of 
foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment 
of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights. In the same resolution, it 
requested the mandate holder to continue consultations on the draft general guidelines. The new 
independent expert, Cephas Lumina, who took up his functions on 1 May 2008, undertook 
missions to Brussels, Paris, London and Washington to discuss the relationship between foreign 
debt and human rights with key international institutions, and to seek further comments on the 
draft guidelines. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Margaret Sekaggya, in 
her first report to the General Assembly (A/63/288), laid down her vision and defined her 
priorities with respect to the implementation of her mandate. She identified human rights 
defenders working on economic, social and cultural rights as a category of defenders most 
exposed to attack and violations, &#8220;who need specific and enhanced protection, as well as targeted 
and deliberate efforts to make the environment in which they operate a safer, more enabling and 
more accepting one&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>19. Following his 2007 report (A/HRC/6/17), which focused on economic, social and cultural 
rights in the context of countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, 
Martin Scheinin, continued to monitor issues related to all human rights in the counter-terrorism 
context, including recent policy developments and capacity-building efforts in relation to 
economic, social and cultural rights. He also participated in an expert seminar on the impact of 
terrorism and counter-terrorism measures on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights organized on 5-7 November 2008 by the United Nations Counter-Terrorism 
Implementation Task Force&#8217;s Working Group on Protecting Human Rights while Countering 
Terrorism. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy, 
addressed the links between access to justice and economic, social and cultural rights in his 
annual report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/8/4). Referring to the historical disparity 
between economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights, he stressed the crucial 
importance of access to justice and remedies in relation to the enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b>III. ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER 
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>21. The High Commissioner&#8217;s Plan of Action and the Strategic Management Plan 
for 2008-2009 selected as a priority the strengthening of OHCHR thematic expertise in 
economic, social and cultural rights, notably at the country level. 
</p>
<p>22. In 2008, the Office continued to work for the promotion and protection of economic, social 
and cultural rights through a wide range of activities at the country, regional and headquarters 
levels. Its work on economic, social and cultural rights was in particular guided by the following 
priorities identified in the 2005 Plan of Action and reiterated in the 2008-2009 Management 
Plan: greater country engagement to ensure that international human rights standards are 
implemented on the ground, enhanced leadership role for the High Commissioner, closer 
partnerships with civil society and United Nations agencies, and greater synergy with the 
United Nations human rights bodies. 
</p>
<p>23. The sections below illustrate some of the activities implemented by the Office in the field 
of economic, social and cultural rights through the lens of these priorities. These do not aim at 
offering an exhaustive overview of the Office&#8217;s work on economic, social and cultural rights, but 
rather at providing some examples of the approaches taken and some key interventions at 
country, regional and headquarters levels. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Greater country engagement 
</b></p>
<p>24. In 2008, OHCHR continued to strengthen its country engagement efforts through 
monitoring activities, research on specific issues, technical cooperation and assistance, 
collaboration with various stakeholders, as well as increased deployment of human rights staff to 
countries, regional offices and peace missions. 
</p>
<p>25. Entry points for greater country engagement on economic, social and cultural rights 
included work on poverty and poverty reduction, the fight against impunity, transitional justice, 
legal protection, as well as non-discrimination and equality. A focus on specific groups, 
including the poor, women, children, internally displaced persons and refugees, migrants, 
indigenous peoples or minorities also allowed developing specific activities and projects related 
to economic, social and cultural rights. In addition, work on economic, social and cultural rights 
was also integrated into regular monitoring activities, as well as dialogue with various 
stakeholders. In the course of 2008, the Office also endeavoured to integrate the protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights into its approach to the five challenges to the enjoyment of 
human rights identified in the 2008-2009 Strategic Management Plan, namely combating 
impunity, poverty and global inequities, discrimination, armed conflicts and violence, and 
democratic deficits and weak institutions. 
</p>
<p>26. In their approach to economic, social and cultural rights, several field presences 
highlighted the interdependence and indivisibility of the enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights and civil and political rights. The field presence in Timor-Leste stressed the 
importance of economic, social and cultural rights for the reconstruction process, as well as for 
ensuring the rule of law and an independent and effective judiciary. In Cambodia, OHCHR 
addressed the importance of civil and political rights, notably access to justice, as well as 
freedom of assembly and expression in the context of forced evictions. 
</p>
<p>27. In 2008, several field presences prioritized the promotion and protection of economic, 
social and cultural rights, while others expressed interest in scaling up their work in this field. To 
support field presences in this endeavour, OHCHR developed a training module for field staff on 
economic, social and cultural rights. A first training workshop on economic, social and cultural 
rights was held in Liberia in October 2008 for the Human Rights and Protection Section of the 
United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). In 2008, headquarters also provided support to 
several field presences to develop specific projects or programmes on economic, social and 
cultural rights. For instance, headquarters worked with the Regional Office for Central Asia on 
the right to adequate housing. Similarly, headquarters worked with the Human Rights Section of 
the United Nations Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) on identifying possible entry points for the 
design and implementation of a strategy on economic, social and cultural rights, particularly in 
relation to the ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the rights to water, food, and education, as well as a human rights-based approach to 
environmental degradation and the impact of natural disasters. 
</p>
<p>28. Activities carried out in relation to economic, social and cultural rights in the field included 
monitoring, research on specific issues, legal protection and legal reform, support to the 
development and implementation of national policies and programmes, capacity-building and 
awareness-raising. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>29. Several field presences monitored<b> </b>cases of violations of economic, social and cultural 
rights. The field presences in Cambodia, Central Asia, Mexico, Nepal, Sudan and Timor-Leste 
monitored the enjoyment of the right to food, adequate housing, education, health and work. The 
Human Rights and Transitional Justice Section of the United Nations Integrated Mission in 
Timor-Leste (UNMIT) designed a monitoring tool to review the enjoyment of the right to food 
throughout the country, including the distribution of rice subsidies in various districts. On the 
basis of OHCHR monitoring, the Government of Timor-Leste changed the distribution system 
for subsidized rice so as to reach the most vulnerable groups which were left out of the 
distribution scheme. The OHCHR Regional Office in Central Asia has been monitoring the 
enjoyment of the right to adequate housing in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, with a 
focus on forced evictions and homelessness. In the Sudan, the human rights component of the 
United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) continued to monitor and report on forced relocation 
and evictions related to the construction of two large-scale hydropower dams in the northern Nile 
valley. OHCHR in Mexico has been monitoring cases of violations of the right to health, the 
right to education and the right to work. As part of its ongoing work on the right to adequate 
housing, OHCHR in Cambodia has been monitoring and investigating cases of threats and 
attacks against community members and civil society actors in relation to land-related activism, 
as well as trials of individuals advocating on issues related to forced evictions and land. In 
Nepal, OHCHR monitored cases of caste-based discrimination against particular groups such as 
the Haliyas and Kamaiyas, including forced evictions and lack of access to safe drinking water, 
notably from the perspective of access to justice. 
30. Research and assessments related to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights 
were conducted in various countries. In Timor-Leste, the UNMIT Human Rights and 
Transitional Justice Section launched a report on the right to food in December 2008. The report 
revised the existing legal framework for the protection of the right to food, along with challenges 
to its realization, notably in relation to the availability and accessibility of food. The OHCHR 
Office in Uganda has been carrying out research on housing, land and property restitution in 
northern Uganda, looking at the existing legal framework related to restitution, as well as aspects 
of the restitution process in post-conflict northern Uganda. 
</p>
<p>31. Human rights field presences have also supported processes of legal protection and reform 
of legislation related to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. In the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Human Rights Adviser provided assistance to the Ministry 
of Labour and Social Policy in the drafting of a comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation 
covering notably economic, social and cultural rights. OHCHR-Colombia revised the law 
modifying the right to strike and the draft law aimed at including the right to water in the 
Constitution. In addition, the Office also followed up on a number of judicial decisions which 
impact on the enjoyment of the rights to work, health and social security. In Uganda, OHCHR 
has been providing comments to the Land Amendment Bill in light of international human rights 
obligations related to the right to adequate housing. The Uganda Office has also been 
contributing to revising national legislation on mental health from the perspective of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. OHCHR Office in Mexico participated in 
the elaboration of a proposal for a constitutional reform on human rights, with a specific chapter 
on economic, social and cultural rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>32. Field presences have helped with the development and implementation of national public 
policies relevant to economic, social and cultural rights. UNMIS-Human Rights organized a 
two-day workshop on the human rights-based approach to budgeting for 40 parliamentarians in 
Khartoum from 8-9 November 2008. Since parliamentarians had already received two general 
trainings on this issue in 2006 and 2007, the workshop - at the request of Parliament&#8217;s Human 
Rights Committee - focused on the rights to health and education. Participants were sensitized to 
their responsibilities vis-&#224;-vis the realization of economic, social and cultural rights by ensuring 
the adequate allocation of funds in the budget. After analysing the 2008 budget, parliamentarians 
pledged for a higher allocation of funds to education and health and also for a fair and adequate 
distribution of funds within these segments of the budget. In Colombia, OHCHR provided advice 
to the Minister on Education on the National Plan for Education in Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>33. Many human rights field presences continued to provide support for capacity-building in 
the area of economic, social and cultural rights, notably through training workshops. Participants 
in the workshops included government officials, local authorities, parliamentarians, national 
human rights institutions, non-governmental and community-based organizations, 
United Nations staff, representatives of the private sector and the media, human rights defenders, 
legal and health professionals, academia, trade unions and students. In Colombia, OHCHR 
implemented a programme aimed at incorporating the rights to health, water, work and education 
in municipal development plans, advising local authorities and civil society organizations in 
20 municipalities and 2 districts of Bogota. The Office in Nepal conducted workshops for 
government officials, the National Commission on Human Rights and civil society organizations 
addressing discrimination and the protection of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as 
on indicators and the monitoring of economic, social and cultural rights. These workshops 
focused on human rights indicators, human rights-based approaches to development, and the 
right to food. The Office in Guatemala continued to train and build capacity of government 
officials, the justice sector, and non-governmental organizations on the promotion and protection 
of economic, social and cultural rights. The field presence in Kyrgyzstan conducted a one-day 
seminar on human rights and the right to health for State authorities, United Nations agencies 
and civil society organizations. In Ecuador, OHCHR organized with WHO a training session for 
journalists on the right to health. The Human Rights Unit of the United Nations Assistance 
Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has been supporting, together with UNHCR, UNIFEM and 
UNICEF, the economic and social rights project of the Afghan Independent Human Rights 
Commission. In Kyrgyzstan, the Regional Office for Central Asia held a workshop for the 
Ombudsman on the handling of complaints, with a specific focus on complaints related to the 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. The United Nations Subregional Centre for 
Human Rights and Democracy in Central Africa integrated the protection of economic, social 
and cultural rights in all its training activities for journalists and parliamentarians. 
</p><p>34. Field presences have also worked to raise awareness of economic, social and cultural rights 
among various stakeholders. In the framework of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, OHCHR in Mexico organized a film festival addressing 
economic, social and cultural rights issues. OHCHR in Nepal developed a questions and answers 
on economic, social and cultural rights in Nepali, aimed at responding to frequently asked 
questions related to the enjoyment of these rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Enhanced human rights leadership 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Strategic Management Plan for 2008-2009 emphasizes the leading role of the 
High Commissioner in identifying and analysing human rights problems and proposing solutions 
to close implementation gaps. To fulfil this role, the Office has taken on board, as priority areas, 
the work on economic, social and cultural rights, with a focus on legal protection and advocacy. 
</p>
<p>36. The sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the one-year 
advocacy campaign launched by the Secretary-General on 10 December 2007 to commemorate 
this important milestone has been the occasion for OHCHR to reiterate the universality, 
interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights, and the equal importance of economic, 
social and cultural rights with civil and political rights. As part of the commemoration of the 
sixtieth anniversary, OHCHR called on all partners to pay special attention to the civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social rights of persons deprived of their liberty in prisons and other 
places of detention, especially during the week of 6-12 October 2008 designated as &#8220;Dignity and 
Justice for Detainees Week&#8221;. This initiative was intended to stress the importance of economic, 
social and cultural rights for detainees, notably in the context of detention of women and girls, 
children, disabled persons and migrants. In particular, OHCHR underlined that Governments are 
obliged to adopt appropriate measures to ensure that all detainees are able to enjoy their rights to 
health, food, water and education. 
</p>
<p>37. In the course of the year, OHCHR also undertook several other initiatives in the field of 
economic, social and cultural rights, notably in relation to the global food security crisis, 
counter-terrorism, the human impact of climate change, the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs), women&#8217;s human rights, as well as HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>38. In the context of the global food security crisis, the High Commissioner advocated for the 
integration of human rights into the responses to the crisis. The High Commissioner made a 
statement at the seventh special session of the Human Rights Council and at the FAO 
High-Level Conference on World Food Security: The Challenges of Climate Change and 
Bioenergy, in June 2008. In these statements, the High Commissioner highlighted the negative 
impact of the world food crisis on the enjoyment of the right to food and the importance of 
integrating the realization of the right to food in the global response to the crisis. OHCHR also 
supported the development of a system-wide response to the food crisis, with a view to 
integrating a human rights-based approach, and in particular the right to food. While OHCHR is 
not a part of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis convened by the 
Secretary-General, the Office has actively contributed, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the right to food, to the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) developed by the Task 
Force. Likewise, OHCHR, jointly with UNICEF, convened an expert consultation on a human 
rights-based approach to the food crisis in New York in August 2008. 
</p>
<p>39. As a leading member of the Working Group on &#8220;Protecting human rights while countering 
terrorism&#8221; of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism  Implementation Task Force, OHCHR 
organized an expert group meeting on the impact of terrorism and counter-terrorism measures on 
the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights on 5-7 November 2008. The expert 
meeting aimed at discussing the impacts of terrorism and counter-terrorism measures in the field</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of economic, social and cultural rights. It also endeavoured to analyse how the denial of 
economic, social and cultural rights may contribute towards creating an &#8220;enabling environment&#8221; 
for terrorism. 
</p>
<p>40. OHCHR continued to analyse the human rights dimensions of climate change. Pursuant to 
Human Rights Council resolution 7/23, OHCHR prepared an analytical study on the relationship 
between human rights and climate change, taking into account the views of States, relevant 
intergovernmental organizations and other stakeholders. As part of the consultation process, 
OHCHR hosted an open-ended consultation meeting on the relationship between climate change 
and human rights on 22 October 2008 in Geneva. The meeting offered a unique opportunity for a 
wide range of stakeholders, including States, intergovernmental organizations, national human 
rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to discuss key aspects of the climate 
change human rights nexus. The report will be considered by the Council at its tenth session in 
March 2009. Together with a summary of the Council&#8217;s debate, the study will be made available 
to the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
Copenhagen in 2009. As the OHCHR study shows, climate change will have major implications 
for the effective enjoyment of a range of human rights and, in particular, economic, social and 
cultural rights related to health, food, water and housing. 
</p>
<p>41. In order to help articulate a human rights approach to the MDGs, OHCHR published in 
June 2008 &#8220;Claiming the MDGs: A human rights approach&#8221;. This publication analyses the 
relationship between several economic, social and cultural rights - such as the rights to 
education, health, food or adequate housing - and the MDGs. It highlights how a human rights 
approach can address the risks related to MDG-based development efforts, as well as enhance 
the potential of MDGs to serve as a vehicle for the promotion and protection of human rights. As 
a follow-up to this publication, OHCHR organized two regional meetings, one in Africa (in 
Johannesburg) and one in Asia (in Bangkok), to discuss key implementation challenges for 
MDGs from a human rights perspective, with a focus on the right to adequate food, health and 
water. The outcomes of these meetings will constitute a basis for identifying strategic entry 
points for OHCHR and partners to engage in follow-up actions, notably at the country level, to 
support and strengthen MDG-based national development strategies from a human rights 
perspective. 
</p>
<p>42. OHCHR continued to pay special attention to the issue of women and economic, social 
and cultural rights. In her report to the Economic and Social Council (E/2007/82), the 
High Commissioner focused on how the principles of equality between men and women and 
non-discrimination against women are paramount to the promotion and implementation of 
economic, social and cultural rights. The report clarified the scope of States parties&#8217; obligations 
to eliminate discrimination and ensure equality between men and women in relation to 
economic, social and cultural rights. It also addressed the relevance of women&#8217;s economic, social 
and cultural rights in the context of post-conflict reconstruction and democratization programmes 
and policies. In June 2008, the Office also supported the holding by the Human Rights Council 
of a thematic discussion on maternal mortality, which included the participation of the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to health. OHCHR also submitted a briefing on international human 
rights law and reproductive rights to the Supreme Court of Justice in Mexico, highlighting 
international jurisprudence from United Nations treaty bodies and regional human rights bodies</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>as a guide to interpretation. Other activities included the launch, in December 2008, of an expert 
paper on women&#8217;s economic, social and cultural rights in post-conflict, highlighting the impact 
of women&#8217;s non-enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights on access to justice, as well as 
on the reconstruction and reparation processes. 
</p>
<p>43. Economic, social and cultural rights are inextricably linked with the spread of HIV and its 
impact on individuals and communities around the world, where a lack of respect for all human 
rights fuels the spread and exacerbates the impact of the disease. At the same time, HIV 
undermines progress in the realization of human rights. This link is apparent in the 
disproportionate incidence and spread of the disease among marginalized groups, women, 
children and young adults, as well as in access to medication, as highlighted in the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s report (A/HRC/7/30), which was presented to the seventh session of the 
Human Rights Council in March 2008. In 2008, OHCHR also facilitated training workshops for 
United Nations staff on a human rights-based approach to programming on HIV, addressing 
these linkages. The Office is also a member of the International Task Team on HIV-related 
Travel Restrictions which, together with membership from civil society, Governments, 
United Nations partners and persons living with HIV, developed recommendations on steps to 
eliminate travel bans on the entry, stay and residence of persons living with HIV in some 
countries. Technical advice was also provided on the integration of human rights into 
HIV-specific laws, especially in countries that are in the process of enacting such legislation. 
</p>
<p>44. Throughout the year, OHCHR also participated in several meetings related to the 
promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights. In doing so, the Office 
had the opportunity to raise awareness about and advocate for economic, social and cultural 
rights with a wide range of stakeholders including health practitioners, business leaders, 
architects, urban planners and development practitioners. For instance, at the World Medical 
Association General Assembly, the Deputy High Commissioner delivered a keynote speech on 
the right to health, highlighting the main obligations deriving from the right and the important 
role that health practitioners play in ensuring the effective implementation of this right. On the 
occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
High Commissioner delivered a speech on public health and human rights before the New York 
Academy of Science and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in New York. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Closer partnership with civil society and United Nations agencies 
</b></p>
<p>45. Throughout 2008, OHCHR strengthened partnerships with United Nations agencies and 
programmes and civil society in relation to economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>46. OHCHR continued to closely collaborate with various United Nations agencies working on 
issues related to the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights, including 
FAO, the World Health Organization (WHO), UN-Habitat, the Joint United Nations Programme 
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and UNESCO. As a result of this close collaboration, OHCHR 
produced several documents for wide dissemination in collaboration with other agencies. With 
WHO, OHCHR published Fact Sheet 31 on the right to health. Other relevant publications 
prepared in 2008 and due for dissemination in early 2009 are a &#8220;Frequently Asked Questions on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&#8221;, as well as fact sheets on the right to adequate housing, 
co-published with UN-Habitat, and on the right to food, co-published with FAO. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>47. In connection with its long-standing cooperation with UN-Habitat, the Office participated 
and contributed to the 4th World Urban Forum in November 2008 on Harmonious Cities. In this 
context, the Deputy High Commissioner underlined the importance of the right to adequate 
housing and the protection against forced evictions in urban planning processes. The Office also 
stressed the need to address discrimination against women, notably in laws and policies, to 
ensure sustainable urbanization. In 2008, OHCHR also collaborated with the CEO Water 
Mandate of the United Nations Global Compact to raise awareness about the right to water and 
advocate for the integration of the right to water in this initiative. 
</p>
<p>48. Collaborative efforts were made to address economic, social and cultural rights issues 
through working groups, task forces and United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs), particularly 
at the country level. Several field presences have also continued to build the capacity of other 
United Nations agencies and UNCTs on human rights-based approaches to development, poverty 
reduction or specific issues including water management, environmental protection, food or 
health. For example, the OHCHR Regional Office in Latin America conducted several trainings 
with a strong focus on economic, social and cultural rights for UNCTs in Brazil, Ecuador, 
Panama and Uruguay. In Nicaragua, the Human Rights Adviser to the UNCT collaborated with 
other United Nations agencies and the Nicaraguan Association of Municipalities to train 
government officials and community leaders from 54 municipalities on a rights-based approach 
to nutritional and food security issues. The Office also issued a joint statement with the World 
Food Programme to welcome the Nepal Supreme Court&#8217;s decision on the right to food. 
</p>
<p>49. The OHCHR Regional Office in Bangkok co-organized with the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) on 23-24 June 2008 a Sub-Regional Meeting on Disability Legislation: 
Decent Work for Persons with Disabilities in Asia. The purpose of the meeting was to examine 
the main legal issues in disability discrimination law within the framework of the Convention, 
with particular emphasis on the right to work and decent work. Representatives from eight 
countries, together with lawyers, judges, representatives of disabled persons&#8217; organizations and 
workers&#8217; and employers&#8217; associations, attended the event. 
</p>
<p>50. OHCHR in Cambodia collaborated with UN-Habitat to develop a UNCT position on 
forced evictions and involuntary resettlement based on Cambodian law and international 
standards related to the right to adequate housing and forced evictions. OHCHR also 
collaborated with United Nations agencies in Cambodia to conduct assessments of relocation 
sites and evaluate, in coordination with UNAIDS, the special needs of families living with 
HIV/AIDS. In Kyrgyzstan, OHCHR mobilized support within the UNCT to assist homeless 
persons during the winter period. The United Nations Subregional Centre for Human Rights and 
Democracy in Central Africa carried out a field mission with UNICEF and ILO to the east of 
Cameroon with a focus on the rights to education and health of indigenous children. 
</p>
<p>51. During the year, OHCHR continued to collaborate with national human rights institutions 
(NHRIs). On 16 April 2008, OHCHR organized a parallel event on the role of NHRIs in poverty 
reduction, on the sidelines of the 20th Annual Meeting of the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (ICC). 
This event stimulated discussion around NHRI involvement in national development processes, 
with a particular focus on poverty reduction strategies as well as the challenges and opportunities</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>encountered in these processes by NHRIs. On 19 May 2008, OHCHR, together with the 
Iberoamerican Federation of Ombudsman and the University of Alcal&#225; organized a seminar on 
the role of national human rights institutions in the protection of economic, social and cultural 
rights. 
</p>
<p>52. Human rights field presences also collaborated with other national partners, such as civil 
society, academic institutions and professional groups in the monitoring and protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights. For example, human rights field presences continued to 
strengthen the capacity of civil society organizations through trainings on the monitoring of 
economic, social and cultural rights (Timor-Leste), facilitating a consultation process among 
representatives of indigenous peoples on the right to education for minorities (Colombia), the 
diffusion of a manual on monitoring economic, social and cultural rights (Timor-Leste), the 
development of a network of organizations at the local and national levels to promote economic, 
social and cultural rights and in particular the right to food and housing (Nepal), or the 
organization of workshops on States parties&#8217; obligations related to economic, social and cultural 
rights (Mexico). 
</p>
<p>53. OHCHR also participated in the ESCR-Net Strategies meeting in Nairobi 
with 200 delegates from social movements as well as national and international civil society 
organizations from over 50 countries and all regions. The focus of the meeting was &#8220;Challenging 
poverty and inequality through human rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  More synergy with United Nations human rights bodies 
</b></p>
<p>54. OHCHR continued to provide substantive and organizational support to the open-ended 
Working Group on an Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights and related intersessional consultations. At its fifth session, held from 
4-8 February and 31 March-4 April 2008, the Working Group agreed to transmit the draft 
optional protocol to the Human Rights Council for consideration, thus completing its mandate<i>. 
</i>The Human Rights Council adopted the Optional Protocol at its eighth session in June 2008 and 
transmitted the text to the General Assembly which, on 10 December 2008, adopted this new 
human rights instrument by consensus<i>. </i>OHCHR also supported the African Regional 
Consultation Meeting on the Optional Protocol, held in Cairo, 9-10 January 2008, and hosted by 
the Government of Egypt. The meeting followed on from similar regional consultation meetings 
held in Latin America (Mexico, 30-31 May 2006) and Europe (Finland, 27-28 July 2006) and 
examined experiences at national and regional levels relevant to a future optional protocol. 
</p>
<p>55. United Nations human rights field presences actively supported the mandates of the special 
procedures relevant to economic, social and cultural rights established by the Human Rights 
Council. For instance, the Human Rights Adviser in Ecuador prepared and supported the mission 
of the independent expert on extreme poverty and human rights and identified the priority topics 
related to the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights deserving the 
independent expert&#8217;s attention. In Mexico, the Office organized a dialogue between 
non-governmental organizations, academics and the Special Rapporteur on the right to health. It 
also assisted victims of violations of the rights to health, adequate housing and work to send 
communications to relevant special procedures of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. In Colombia, OHCHR facilitated a consultation process among representatives of 
indigenous communities on the right to education of minorities as input to the inaugural session 
of the United Nations Forum on Minorities that took place in Geneva on 15-16 December 2008. 
</p>
<p>57. Field presences also provided support to the United Nations treaty bodies. In Cambodia, 
the Office supported the Government&#8217;s preparation and translation of a State party report to the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR). OHCHR-Cambodia also 
supported - notably through trainings and advice - civil society organizations to submit 
contributions to CESCR, and further provided CESCR with a comprehensive oral and written 
briefing at the Committee&#8217;s pre-sessional working group meeting in November 2008. In the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, OHCHR supported the Government, civil society and 
the UNCT in a coordinated joint follow-up on recent concluding observations issued by various 
treaty bodies, including CESCR. UNMIS-Human Rights, in cooperation with the Sudanese 
Government&#8217;s Advisory Council for Human Rights, organized a four-day workshop in Khartoum 
in June 2008 on reporting under the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
other human rights treaties. The participants included members of the Advisory Council for 
Human Rights, various ministries, including the Ministry of Legal Affairs and Constitutional 
Development of South Sudan, the Southern Sudan Human Rights Commission, and 
non-governmental organizations involved in promoting human rights. One of the 
recommendations emanating from the workshop was to set up an inter-ministerial body to 
contribute to the drafting process of the report to CESCR. 
</p>
<p>58. OHCHR also prepared a report on indicators for promoting and monitoring the 
implementation of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights (HRI/MC/2008/3) for the inter-Committee Meeting of the treaty bodies in June 2008. The report 
outlines the adopted conceptual and methodological framework for identifying contextually 
relevant quantitative and other appropriate indicators to promote and monitor the implementation 
of all human rights. The report also describes the configuration of structural, process and 
outcome indicators and lists illustrative indicators on selected human rights, including the right 
to adequate food, the right to health, the right to adequate housing, the right to education, the 
right to work and the right to social security. The framework was developed by OHCHR in 
consultation with a panel of experts, including members of the treaty bodies, special rapporteurs, 
United Nations organizations and civil society organizations, and has been validated through 
workshops and consultations with national stakeholders, namely national human rights 
institutions, government bodies responsible for States parties reporting, national statistical 
agencies, UNCTs and non-governmental organizations. As a follow-up to similar subregional 
workshops organized by OHCHR in Asia and Africa in 2007, a Latin American workshop on 
human rights indicators was organized in Colombia on 25-26 November. National workshops 
and consultations in support of initiatives on indicators for human rights assessments at country 
level were also held in Nepal, Mexico and Colombia. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The adoption of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights by the General Assembly on 10 December 2008 marks a very 
significant development for the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural</b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>rights. The adoption of the Optional Protocol carries important repercussions on national 
jurisdictions and will help strengthen the legal protection of economic, social and cultural 
rights worldwide. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>2008 also marks an ongoing commitment by OHCHR to increase and further 
strengthen its work in the field of economic, social and cultural rights at the country, 
regional and international levels. In the context of the year-long campaign for the 
sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, OHCHR has reiterated 
the equal status of economic, social and cultural rights and the need to protect these rights 
in the context of the global food crisis, the fight against terrorism or in relation to climate 
change. The importance of economic, social and cultural rights for achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals, as well as the relevance of economic, social and cultural 
rights for achieving gender equality and addressing discrimination in relation to HIV/AIDS 
were also highlighted. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Treaty bodies have strengthened their work on economic, social and cultural rights 
through the periodic reporting process, the elaboration of general comments and 
statements and the holding of general days of discussion. Special procedures with thematic 
mandates covering economic, social and cultural rights have continued monitoring the 
implementation and respect for these rights around the world. Additionally, other special 
procedures have also continued to pay close attention and devoted reports, visits and 
communications to economic, social and cultural rights and their interlinkage with civil 
and political rights. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>OHCHR continued to expand its thematic expertise in economic, social and cultural 
rights at the country and regional levels, in line with the 2008-2009 Strategic Management 
Plan. Activities carried out have included monitoring violations of economic, social and 
cultural rights, research on specific issues, providing technical assistance to States to 
promote economic, social and cultural rights, including the drafting of legislation; 
strengthening the legal protection of economic, social and cultural rights; following up the 
recommendations of treaty bodies and special procedures; and building and strengthening 
partnerships with United Nations agencies. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>An increased and strengthened involvement on economic, social and cultural rights 
does not come without challenges. These notably include the operationalization of 
economic, social and cultural rights in the field; the mainstreaming of economic, social and 
cultural rights into regular field work and existing priorities; the perception that economic, 
social and cultural rights are not legally enforceable; and the lack of knowledge among 
OHCHR staff and other stakeholders about economic, social and cultural rights.</b>
