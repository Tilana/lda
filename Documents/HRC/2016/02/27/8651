</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This report contains the observations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples, James Anaya, on the 
situation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia. The report is based 
on exchanges of information with the Government, indigenous peoples and other interested 
parties, including during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Australia from 17 to 28 August 
2009. 
</p>
<p> Having suffered a history of oppression and racial discrimination, including acts of 
genocide, such as the removal of indigenous children from their homes, as well as the 
dispossession of their lands, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today endure 
severe disadvantage compared with non-indigenous Australians. 
</p>
<p> The Government of Australia is to be commended for its several initiatives and 
programmes of recent years to address the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander peoples. The Special Rapporteur particularly notes the expressions of commitment 
made by the Government with a view to reconciliation with indigenous peoples, including 
the &#8220;National Apology&#8221; of 2008, and its support for the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He is also pleased to note the important goal set of

<p>eliminating significant social and economic disadvantages faced by Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples in key areas, including early childhood, schooling, health, economic 
participation, healthy home, safe communities and governance and leadership, by the year 
2020 and the resources committed by the Government thereto. 
</p>
<p> Nevertheless, in his report, the Special Rapporteur observes that, overall, there is a 
need to incorporate into government programmes a more integrated approach to addressing 
indigenous disadvantage across the country, one that not just promotes social and economic 
well-being of indigenous peoples, but also advances their self-determination and 
strengthens their cultural bonds. The Government should seek to include in its initiatives 
the goal of advancing indigenous self-determination, in particular by encouraging 
indigenous self-governance at the local level, ensuring indigenous participation in the 
design, delivery and monitoring of programmes and promoting culturally appropriate 
programmes that incorporate or build on indigenous peoples&#8217; own initiatives. Additionally, 
further efforts are needed to secure indigenous peoples&#8217; rights over lands, resources and 
heritage sites and ensure that indigenous peoples living in remote areas can enjoy the same 
social and economic rights as other segments of the Australian population, without having 
to sacrifice important aspects of their cultures and ways of life. 
</p>
<p> Of particular concern is the Northern Territory Emergency Response, addressed in 
appendix B, which, in several aspects, limits the capacity of indigenous individuals and 
communities to control or participate in decisions affecting their own lives, doing so in a 
way that discriminates on the basis of race, thereby raising serious human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur offers a number of recommendations with the hope that they 
will help guide the Government of Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples 
and other interested parties to develop and implement laws, policies and programmes that 
conform to the international human rights standards related to indigenous peoples.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In this report, the Special Rapporteur examines the human rights situation of 
indigenous peoples in Australia, on the basis of research and information gathered, 
including during a visit to Australia from 17 to 28 August 2009 carried out with the 
cooperation of the Government and indigenous peoples of the country. During his visit to 
Australia, the Special Rapporteur met with a wide range of government officials at the 
federal and State levels and with numerous indigenous communities, organizations and 
their leaders in several locations across Australia. The complete details of the visit are 
included in appendix A. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his appreciation for 
the support of the Government and to the indigenous individuals and organizations that 
provided indispensible assistance in the planning and coordination of the visit.  
</p>
<p>2. By a note of 18 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 
Government a preliminary version of the present report and, on 16 February 2010, received 
comments from the Government. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government for 
its detailed comments, which have been taken into account in the preparation of the final 
version of this report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The indigenous peoples of Australia 
</b></p>
<p>3. The peoples indigenous to Australia, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples, have inhabited the territory of Australia for over 50,000 years. Their population is 
estimated to have been 750,000 at the start of British colonization in 1788, with about 250 
distinct languages and over 600 dialects spoken. The Torres Strait Islander peoples, 
traditionally occupying the many islands between the Australian continent and what is now 
Papua New Guinea, have culture, languages and social patterns distinct from the Aboriginal 
peoples of the continent.  
</p>
<p>4. Since British occupation, indigenous peoples have suffered oppressive treatment, 
including acts of genocide, dispossession of lands and social and cultural disintegration, 
and a history animated by racism that is well-documented in numerous sources. Today, the 
indigenous population is around 520,350 or 2.5 per cent of the total Australian population.1 
A majority of the indigenous population self-identifies as belonging to a specific clan, tribal 
or language group and many continue to reside within their traditional homelands.2  
</p>
<p>5. Having suffered a history of oppression and racial discrimination, Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander peoples now endure severe disadvantage compared with non-
indigenous Australians. There is a significant gap between indigenous and non-indigenous 
peoples across a range of indicators, all of which are well-documented by the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics, the Productivity Commission&#8217;s report, <i>Overcoming Indigenous 
Disadvantage</i>, and the social justice reports of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Social Justice Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights Commission (Social Justice 
Commissioner), and discussed further in part V. Despite this, during his time in Australia, 
the Special Rapporteur was impressed with demonstrations of strong and vibrant

<p>indigenous cultures and inspired by the strength, resilience and vision of indigenous 
communities determined to move towards a better future.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. The British Crown claimed possession of the east coast of Australia in 1770 and 
established a colony at Sydney Cove in 1788. Eventually, the entire continent came under 
British control through six independent colonies. The British did not conclude any treaties 
with the indigenous peoples of Australia and the indigenous peoples were not 
acknowledged to have any inherent rights or equal rights with British citizens.  
</p>
<p>7. The Commonwealth of Australia was founded on 1 January 1901 as a constitutional 
monarchy, imbued with a parliamentary system of government and a federal structure under 
which powers are distributed between a national Government (the Commonwealth) and the 
six States (the former colonies). Three territories, including the Northern Territory, have 
self-government arrangements subject to Commonwealth authority.  
</p><p>8. In the new Australia, the indigenous inhabitants of the country were denied any form 
of constitutional recognition or protection at the federal level and, indeed, were excluded 
from national census data by a provision of the Constitution of 1901. Specific laws and 
policies, not necessarily consistent across State boundaries, were introduced by the State 
parliaments to manage the indigenous people. These laws segregated indigenous people 
into &#8220;reserve&#8221; areas, prohibited cultural practices, regulated marriages and social contact, 
managed labour and controlled movement away from the reserves. 
</p>
<p>9. In 1967, a national referendum amended the Constitution to remove text that 
discriminated against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Thus, indigenous people were 
included in the national census and the Commonwealth Government gained the authority to 
legislate on matters related to indigenous people. In 1975, the Government enacted the 
Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act to make discrimination on the basis of race, 
colour, descent or national or ethnic origin illegal. This national law supplanted 
discriminatory laws and policies at the State level. 
</p>
<p>10. Until relatively recently, the Australian legal framework did not recognize rights of 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to land on the basis of traditional occupancy 
alone. Beginning in 1976, State and national land rights laws were passed but, while 
significantly benefiting some indigenous populations, these had limited application. In 
1992, the High Court of Australia, in the landmark case of <i>Mabo v. Queensland (No. 2) 
</i>(&#8220;<i>Mabo</i>&#8221;),3 determined that Australian common law could recognize indigenous peoples&#8217; 
customary title to land, thereby causing a re-examination of Australian laws and policies in 
this regard. The issue of indigenous rights to land and resources is discussed further in part 
IV.  
</p>
<p>11. An important recent milestone in the evolution of Australia&#8217;s policies towards 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was the motion of apology to Australia&#8217;s 
indigenous peoples (the National Apology), introduced by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and 
unanimously passed by the House of Representatives on 13 February 2008, in which the 
Australian Federal Parliament apologized for &#8220;the laws and policies of successive 
Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss&#8221; on 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The Parliament noted that &#8220;the time has now come 
for the nation to turn a new page in Australia&#8217;s history by righting the wrongs of the past 
and so moving forward with confidence to the future&#8221;.

</p>
<p>12. Also recently, the Government endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly on 13 September 2007. 
Reversing the earlier position of Australia on the Declaration, on 3 April 2009, the Minister 
responsible for indigenous affairs issued a public statement pledging Government support 
for the Declaration and expressing the commitment of the Government to redefining and 
improving Australia&#8217;s relationship with indigenous peoples. The Government&#8217;s support for 
the Declaration supplements the commitment of Australia to human rights in relation to 
various international instruments, including most of the core United Nations human rights 
treaties, which have been ratified by Australia.  
</p>
<p>13. The Government&#8217;s abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Commission in 2005 has been the subject of repeated concern expressed to the Special 
Rapporteur. Recently, the Government has taken important steps to support a new national 
representative body, the National Congress of Australia&#8217;s First Peoples, which is expected 
to be established and fully operational by January 2011. 
</p>
<p>14. Indigenous peoples have called for reforms to deliver constitutional recognition of 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, provide guarantees of non-discrimination and 
protect their rights in a charter of rights to be included in the Constitution or other 
legislation. The Government has, in principle, recognized the need for such reforms, 
although it has stressed the complexity of enacting them. Hence, advances in this regard 
have been slow or non-existent. However, the Government has reported that the National 
Congress of Australia&#8217;s First Peoples will play a key role in advancing constitutional 
recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. 
</p>
<p>15. The Government has in place a number of programmes and policy statements aimed 
at benefiting indigenous peoples, which it describes as being in accordance with its 
intention to &#8220;reset&#8221; the relationship with them. The Government&#8217;s major programmatic 
initiative toward indigenous peoples is in its &#8220;Closing the Gap&#8221; campaign, which is aimed 
at reducing the significant disadvantages faced by indigenous peoples in socio-economic 
spheres. It is not possible to detail each of the government programmes in this report, 
however, components of the Closing the Gap campaign and other programmes are 
discussed in parts V and VI.   
</p>
<p>16. Notwithstanding important advances, there are a number of problematic aspects of 
Australia&#8217;s legal and policy regime concerning indigenous peoples, which are discussed 
below. Especially troublesome is the suite of legislation and programmes known as the 
Northern Territory Emergency Response, to which the Special Rapporteur devotes special 
attention in appendix B of this report.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The stolen generations 
</b></p>
<p>17. One of the notorious aspects of the history of discriminatory treatment of Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander peoples was the forcible removal of the children of these peoples 
from their families and communities by government agencies and churches. The 1997 
report on the situation, <i>Bringing Them Home</i>, by the National Inquiry into Separation of 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children From their Families, found that at least 
100,000 indigenous children (between 10 and 30 per cent of the Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander populations) were removed between 1910 and 1970, and concluded that the 
forcible removal of children was an act of genocide. The detrimental intergenerational 
effects of the removal policies have been documented by various sources. For example, one 
study found that Aboriginal children whose primary caregivers had been forcibly separated 
from their natural families are over twice as likely to be at high risk of clinically significant </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>emotional or behavioural difficulties, conduct problems and hyperactivity and were 
approximately twice as likely to abuse alcohol and drugs as other children.4 
</p>
<p>18. By 2003, the Commonwealth Government had committed AUD 117 million to 
initiatives in response to the <i>Bringing Them Home </i>report. In recent years, the Government 
has taken renewed steps to provide redress for the victims of removal, who have become 
known as the Stolen Generations, beginning with the National Apology. In 2007&#8211;2009, the 
Government committed AUD 29.5 million to initiatives for Stolen Generations survivors. It 
has also announced that it will establish a healing foundation and invest an additional AUD 
26.6 million over the next four years, to address trauma and aid healing in Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander communities, with a strong focus on the needs of the Stolen 
Generations survivors. 
</p>
<p>19. The Commonwealth Government has said, however, that it will not provide 
monetary compensation for the victims where claims could be directed at State 
governments. Also, significant steps are still needed to implement the 54 recommendations 
of the <i>Bringing Them Home Report</i> and to move towards genuine healing and reparation.5 
The Government reports that it continues to work with Stolen Generations representatives 
in this regard. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the recommendation of the United 
Nations Human Rights Committee that Australia &#8220;should adopt a comprehensive national 
mechanism to ensure that adequate reparation, including compensation, is provided to the 
victims of the Stolen Generations policies.&#8221;6 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Lands and natural resources 
</b></p>
<p>20. Another crippling aspect of the history of racial discrimination suffered by 
indigenous peoples in Australia is their progressive loss of control over and access to 
traditional lands and natural resources. As stated in the preamble to the 1993 Native Title 
Act, indigenous peoples &#8220;have been progressively dispossessed of their lands. This 
dispossession occurred largely without compensation, and successive governments have 
failed to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait 
Islanders concerning the use of their lands. As a consequence, Aboriginal peoples and 
Torres Strait Islanders have become, as a group, the most disadvantaged in Australian 
society.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>21. Similar to indigenous peoples across the world, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples maintain a profound connection to their land that forms an essential part of their 
cultural and spiritual life and material well-being. As noted in the <i>Overcoming Indigenous 
Disadvantage</i> report, &#8220;land ownership may lead to greater autonomy and economic 
independence, increased commercial leverage and political influence. It can also deliver 
commercial benefits like increased income, employment and profits&#8221;.7 Further, as noted by 
the Social Justice Commissioner, securing indigenous land rights &#8220;is important for the 
advancement of reconciliation between Australia&#8217;s past and present, and between 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians&#8221;.8

</p>
<p>22. Beginning in the 1970s, the Commonwealth and State governments began to 
legislate to return lands to indigenous communities and allow claims to other lands, to 
varying degrees. In 1976 the federal Parliament passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, 
under which Aboriginal peoples in the Northern Territory could own land based on 
traditional connection. Under the law, more than 50 per cent of Northern Territory lands 
have been returned to the traditional owners. However, during his visit, the Special 
Rapporteur heard numerous concerns that amendments to the law, enacted in 2006, 
increased individualization of communally held indigenous lands and impaired traditional 
decision-making over indigenous lands, in addition to several other concerns.  
</p>
<p>23. Notable land rights legislation was also enacted at the State level, in New South 
Wales and South Australia. But an effort by the Commonwealth Government to establish 
national land rights legislation was withdrawn in 1985. As a result, the return of lands 
through legislative enactments has not been achieved throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>24. In 1992, the High Court handed down the landmark<i> Mabo</i> decision, which rejected 
the discriminatory doctrine of <i>terra nullius</i> (vacant land) and held that the common law of 
Australia recognizes continuing title held by indigenous peoples to their traditional lands in 
accordance with their traditional laws and customs. Although the High Court&#8217;s rejection of 
the doctrine of <i>terra nullius</i> was exemplary, the court also found that, by virtue of the 
sovereignty of the Crown, native title rights are extinguished by otherwise valid 
Government acts that are inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights, 
such as the grant of freehold or some leasehold estates.  
</p>
<p>25. The <i>Mabo</i> decision prompted Parliament to pass the Native Title Act of 1993, which 
sets out the processes for determining native title rights and dealings on native title lands. 
Despite these significant developments, laws and policies of subsequent Governments, as 
well as court decisions, have appeared to roll back the advancements associated with the 
<i>Mabo</i> decision, especially the controversial Native Title Amendments Act of 1998, which 
was the subject of criticism by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.9 
26. The Special Rapporteur received information during his visit that the current Native 
Title Act framework has serious limitations that impair its ability to protect the native title 
rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. According to the Government&#8217;s own 
evaluation, the native title process is complex and slow and in need of reform. Among the 
principal concerns is the onerous requirement that indigenous claimants show proof of 
continuous connection to the lands claimed, in accordance with their traditional laws and 
customs, since the time of British acquisition of sovereignty. This is viewed as an unjust 
requirement, particularly considering the history of policies of Governments that 
undermined indigenous peoples&#8217; connections to their lands. In addition, the native title 
process, including the mechanism for facilitating indigenous representation in the process, 
is under-supported according to informed observers.  
</p>
<p>27. With respect to mining and other natural resource exploitation on lands subject to 
native title claims, in several cases indigenous representative bodies or land councils have 
negotiated agreements that have provided benefits for indigenous traditional owners. Still, 
the Special Rapporteur heard concerns that indigenous rights are often inadvertently 
undermined because the terms of such agreements are kept secret, the traditional owners 
have limited time to negotiate, legal representation is often inadequate and Government 
involvement does not always align with indigenous interests. Also, concerns have been

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>raised that agreements have not been developed in ways that maximize benefits for the 
future generations of the indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges Government efforts to streamline the existing 
native title procedure and pursue related reforms, such as minimizing the adversarial 
approach of the native title system to allow for native title negotiations to be carried out in a 
more flexible manner, and stresses that continued efforts in this regard should be made. The 
Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight the recommendation of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination that Australia pursue &#8220;discussions with indigenous 
peoples with a view to discussing possible amendments to the Native Title Act and finding 
solutions acceptable to all&#8221;.10 The Special Rapporteur also notes the comprehensive 
recommendations for reform in the annual Native Title reports of the Australian Human 
Rights Commission, published since 1994. 
</p>
<p>29. The strengthening of legislative and administrative protections for indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights over lands and natural resources should involve aligning those protections 
with applicable international standards, in particular those articulated in the Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Of note is that the Declaration effectively rejects a strict 
requirement of continuous occupation or cultural connection from the time of European 
contact in order for indigenous peoples to maintain interests in lands, affirming simply that 
rights exist by virtue of &#8220;traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or use&#8221; (art. 
26). Also incompatible with the Declaration, as well as with other international instruments, 
is the extinguishment of indigenous rights in land by unilateral uncompensated acts. 
Contrary to the doctrine of extinguishment, the Declaration (art. 28) affirms that 
&#8220;indigenous peoples have the right to redress, by means that can include restitution or, 
when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable compensation, for the lands, territories and 
resources which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used, and which 
have been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior and 
informed consent&#8221;.11 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern reports 
received that compensation to indigenous peoples whose rights have been extinguished is 
extremely difficult to obtain under the current statutory scheme.12  
</p>
<p>30. On top of ensuring adequate recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; proprietary or other 
interests in lands and natural resources, care must be taken to ensure that those interests are 
not unduly affected by Government regulation. For example, the Special Rapporteur heard 
concerns that the Wild Rivers Act of 2005 of the state of Queensland limits indigenous 
communities&#8217; use of and decision-making control over their lands, especially with respect 
to economic development activities. Likewise, concern was expressed that the New South 
Wales National Parks and Wildlife Act of 1974 does not recognize the right of Aboriginal 
people to be consulted on decisions concerning heritage sites. Similarly, the Special 
Rapporteur received reports that the Western Australia Aboriginal Heritage Act of 1972 
grants a state entity the ultimate authority to make decisions concerning Aboriginal heritage 
sites.

<p>31. Subsequent parts of this report address a number of other concerns related to 
indigenous peoples&#8217; ability to effectively enjoy rights over traditional or acquired lands. 
These include the issue of access to public services by indigenous peoples in remote areas 
of traditional lands, discussed in paragraphs 66&#8211;70, and the arrangements in place or being

<p><b> V. Indigenous disadvantage and Government response 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The Closing the Gap campaign 
</b></p>
<p>32. As noted, secure rights to lands and resources are crucial to the cultural survival of 
indigenous peoples of Australia and their ability to develop economically and reduce the 
disadvantages they face as a result of a history of racial discrimination against them. Apart 
from addressing claims over lands and resources, the Government has taken significant 
steps aimed at addressing these disadvantages and improving the socio-economic 
conditions of indigenous peoples, through its &#8220;Closing the Gap&#8221; campaign. Created in 2008 
through an agreement of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), the Closing the 
Gap campaign provides a broad policy framework based on inter-government collaboration 
as well as identified targeted outcomes for reducing indigenous disadvantage across seven 
identified &#8220;platforms&#8221;: early childhood, schooling, health, economic participation, healthy 
home, safe communities, and governance and leadership.13  
</p>
<p><b> B. Health 
</b></p>
<p>33. In its National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health 
Outcomes of 2008, COAG affirmed that &#8220;indigenous Australians experience the worst 
health of any one identifiable cultural group in Australia&#8221; (p. 4) and identified an alarming 
17-year gap in indigenous life expectancy in comparison to non-indigenous sectors of 
Australian society. The Closing the Gap campaign aims to eliminate the disparity in life 
expectancy between indigenous and non-indigenous persons within a generation and halve 
the gap in mortality rates for indigenous children under 5 within a decade. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the commitment by the Government to establishing clear goals to 
overcome long-term and extreme indigenous disadvantage in health.  
</p>
<p>34. However, a lack of adequate cultural adaptation in the delivery of health services 
continues to represent a barrier to the effective enjoyment of the right to health for 
indigenous peoples. There is a reported dearth of indigenous physicians, nurses and other 
health-care workers such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation workers, sex offender 
counsellors and psychologists, as well as a continuing need to strengthen indigenous control 
over the design and delivery of health services<i>.</i> While there are several successful health-
care programmes by and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, in particular those 
provided by the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation 
(&#8220;NACCHO&#8221;), further efforts are needed to provide culturally appropriate health services 
(see paras. 62&#8211;65). Increasing support for such successful existing Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander-controlled programmes, and ensuring that new programmes do not duplicate 
or undermine these existing ones, are important steps towards this end.

</b></p>
<p><b> C. Education 
</b></p>
<p>35. As part of its commitment to closing the gap on indigenous disadvantage, COAG 
has established the following benchmarks in the area of education: within five years, 
provide all indigenous 4 year olds in remote indigenous communities with access to a good 
quality early childhood education; within a decade, halve the gap in reading, writing, and 
numeracy achievements among indigenous children; and by 2020 at least halve the gap for 
indigenous retention through grade 12.  
</p>
<p>36. In addition, the Special Rapporteur recognizes Government efforts to include a 
cross-cultural perspective in the national curriculum. Nevertheless, sources consulted by the 
Special Rapporteur identified problems with the curriculum currently used and the day-to-
day operations of schools across Australia that are attended by indigenous children, as well 
as a lack of adequately trained teachers for bilingual and culturally appropriate education 
and a lack of resources to sustain such programmes. There are very few examples of 
Aboriginal children being taught in their own languages. Of particular concern is the 
information the Special Rapporteur received from numerous sources that, as of January 
2009, the Northern Territory government requires that school activities be conducted in 
English for the first four hours of each school day. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the 
value of and need to improve literacy in the national language, but emphasizes that the 
Northern Territory government must make greater effort to respect cultural diversity and 
find a better approach to addressing the challenges of bilingual education. 
</p>
<p>37. The remote character of many indigenous communities is another major challenge 
for the provision of education, which is well-documented and analysed in the 2008 Social 
Justice Report.14 Providing schooling to children in remote areas by placing them in 
boarding schools away from their communities raises further complex considerations. The 
inadequacy of current educational opportunities has resulted in indigenous children in 
remote areas exhibiting low rates of attendance, achievement, and retention.15 Recognizing 
the complexities in delivering services, including education services, to remote areas, the 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government to give adequate focus and priority to this issue, 
as discussed in more detail in part VI (B). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Employment and income 
</b></p>
<p>38. COAG has identified the target of halving the gap in employment outcomes between 
indigenous and non-indigenous Australians within a decade. In furtherance of this goal, the 
National Partnership on Indigenous Economic Participation seeks to improve opportunities 
for indigenous people to engage in private and public sector jobs through a number of 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur commends this initiative. However, he is concerned that 
recent welfare reform efforts have had the effect of abruptly cutting off income and jobs 
upon which indigenous individuals have relied, leaving them with no adequate alternatives 
for income generation. For example, as a result of welfare reform initiatives, the Yarrabah 
community in Queensland reported losing AUD 7 million in assistance previously received 
under the Community Development Employment Projects programme, although according 
to the Government, this funding merely shifted to other employment service and job

<p>assistance programmes, such as Job Services Australia and the Indigenous Employment 
Programme, and has not been eliminated altogether. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur would also like to emphasize that increasing indigenous 
peoples&#8217; control over their lands and resources, self-determination and self-government is 
an essential component of advancing economic development and employment 
opportunities.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Housing 
</b></p>
<p>41. In 2006, the former Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the 
right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context 
visited Australia and noted that indigenous peoples face a &#8220;severe housing crisis, evidenced 
by the lack of affordable and culturally appropriate housing, the lack of appropriate support 
services, the significant levels of poverty and the underlying discrimination&#8221;.16 Such 
problems persist and contribute to overcrowded living conditions and homelessness in 
indigenous communities at rates exceeding those of the mainstream population.  
</p>
<p>42. Primarily through its National Partnership on Remote Indigenous Housing, the 
Closing the Gap campaign promises to address the key issues of overcrowding, 
homelessness, poor housing conditions and severe housing shortages. However, the new 
policy envisages the indigenous communities handing over control of their community 
lands to the Government for housing to be provided and managed. Long-term leases, 
arranged with indigenous landowners or traditional owners, are becoming a precondition 
for delivering housing and upgrade services. These leases grant the Government access to 
and control over the indigenous land for a term of at least 40 years. Tenancy management is 
to be undertaken by state and territory housing authorities, thus removing tenancy 
management from indigenous control. The Government argues that this leasing 
arrangement ensures clear ownership of fixed assets and therefore responsibility to maintain 
those assets for the benefit of residents. It further asserts that lease agreements are 
voluntary, although it will not provide housing without an agreement. 
</p>
<p>43. Almost everywhere, the Special Rapporteur heard concerns about the Government&#8217;s 
approach. Numerous indigenous people, especially community leaders, expressed that they 
felt pressured or even &#8220;bribed&#8221; into handing over ownership and control of their lands to the 
Government in exchange for much-needed housing services. The Special Rapporteur heard 
these concerns even in communities that have negotiated leases with the Government, such 
as in the Groote Eylandt communities of Angurugu, Umbakumba and Milyakburra. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur heard concerns that housing construction and upgrade 
services have, by and large, been delivered in a manner that bypasses locally run Aboriginal 
construction companies, missing the opportunity to provide jobs and training to indigenous 
peoples for the delivery of these services, although it is worth noting that under the 
National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing, 20 per cent of &#8220;local 
employment&#8221; is required for all new housing construction. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this leasing scheme, in conjunction with 
other initiatives such as the 2006 amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act (Northern 
Territory) 1976 (referenced in paragraph 22), promotes individual land tenure to the 
detriment of traditional indigenous communal land tenure and diminishes indigenous 
control over lands that traditionally have been held collectively. In this regard, the

</b></p>
<p>individualization of lands could implicate threats to indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural integrity 
and way of life, in addition to affronting their property rights. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Women, children and families 
</b></p>
<p>45. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children continue to suffer 
distressingly high rates of violence and poor living conditions. The Australian Bureau of 
Statistics found that 18.3 per cent of indigenous women experienced physical or threatened 
abuse in a 12-month period, compared with 7 per cent of non-indigenous women. Further, 
according to the <i>Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage</i> report, 41 out of every 1,000 
indigenous children were under care and protection orders, compared to 5.3 per 1,000 non-
indigenous children.17 Concern was expressed that some children under these care and 
protection orders are placed in environments outside of their communities and cultures. 
</p>
<p>46. Additionally, the findings of the 2007 report <i>Ampe Akelyernemane Meke Mekarle 
&#8220;Little Children are Sacred&#8221;</i>, issued by the Board of Inquiry into the Protection of 
Aboriginal Children from Sexual Abuse and commissioned by the government of the 
Northern Territory, and other studies, such as the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander Social Survey, indicate high incidence of child sexual abuse in Aboriginal 
communities. These reports provide the backdrop for many of the policy initiatives of the 
Government of Australia related to indigenous peoples, most notably the aggressive 
measures under the Northern Territory National Emergency Response (NTER) programme.  
47. While specifically oriented towards the eradication of child sexual abuse in the 
Northern Territory, the NTER in fact addresses a range of economic and social issues that 
confront the Northern Territory. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the importance of 
many parts of the NTER programme; however, he also notes with concern that many of its 
aspects are characterized by extreme measures that single out indigenous peoples and 
communities for separate treatment, a strategy that involved the Government&#8217;s decision in 
2007 to suspend the protections of the Racial Discrimination Act in relation to NTER 
provisions. The NTER measures that are of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur are 
addressed further in appendix B to this report. 
</p>
<p>48. A number of mainstream programmes are in place to address the key issues of 
protection and safety both in the Northern Territory and elsewhere. Notably, the Family 
Violence Prevention Legal Services programme provides community-controlled justice, 
advisory and referral centres for victims of family violence. In addition, the National 
Council to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children, established in 2008, 
operates at a national level to design and implement the National Plan to Reduce Violence 
Against Women and their Children. The Commonwealth Government also administers the 
Indigenous Parenting Support Service programme and the Indigenous Women&#8217;s 
programme. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for attaching urgency and 
priority to the issue of protecting vulnerable groups and abating violence against women 
and children. However, despite the NTER initiative and other Government responses, 
violence and other problems persist. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur heard 
reports of a lack of access by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, especially 
women in remote communities, to legal assistance. In addition, the Special Rapporteur 
heard expressions of concern that government authorities fail to engage in a real dialogue 
with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women to formulate practical and culturally

</p>
<p>appropriate strategies to protect women and children at risk. The Special Rapporteur also 
received information alleging that mainstream domestic violence and child protection 
models are inconsistent with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Administration of justice 
</b>50. There are alarmingly high levels of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander persons, including women and minors. According to figures reported by the 
Government, indigenous prisoners represent 24 per cent of the total prisoner population and 
the average rate of indigenous imprisonment is 13 times higher than the non-indigenous 
rate.18 Disturbingly, indigenous youth comprise 54 per cent of persons in juvenile detention 
and are 21 times more likely than non-indigenous juveniles to be detained.19 Other major 
concerns that were brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention are limited access to 
justice in remote areas and inadequate provision of culturally appropriate justice services, 
including translation services for criminal defendants. 
</p>
<p>51. A high rate of deaths in custody was another concern expressed to the Special 
Rapporteur, an issue that is explored in the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal 
Deaths in Custody, completed in 1991, and exemplified by the disturbing case in Western 
Australia of the death of Ian Ward while being transported in police custody. The 
Government affirms that it has taken steps to address the concerns raised in that report, 
although the Special Rapporteur notes information that many of the recommendations of 
the Royal Commission have still not been fully and adequately addressed. 
</p>
<p>52. Though criminal justice matters are primarily the responsibility of Australia&#8217;s state 
and territory governments, there have been some noteworthy efforts funded by the 
Commonwealth to provide legal services to indigenous peoples, including the Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and the delivery of indigenous-specific legal 
services in 116 permanent locations. Further, the Government is developing some new 
initiatives within the framework of the Closing the Gap campaign to reduce the 
overrepresentation of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in the criminal justice system. 
Clearly, though given the extremity of this situation, much work remains to be done. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Cross-cutting concerns regarding government programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the significant commitment of the 
Government to advancing the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and to 
shrink the comparative disadvantage that indigenous people suffer vis-&#224;-vis non-indigenous 
people across the range of socio-economic indicators. However, there is a need to 
incorporate into government programmes a more integrated approach to addressing 
indigenous disadvantage across the country, one that secures for indigenous peoples not just 
social and economic well-being, but in doing so also advances their self-determination and 
their rights to maintain their distinct cultural identities, languages and connections with 
their traditional lands.

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>54. The right to self-determination, which is affirmed for indigenous peoples in article 3 
of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, is a foundational right, without 
which indigenous peoples&#8217; other human rights, both collective and individual, cannot be 
fully enjoyed. Enhancing indigenous self-determination is also conducive to successful 
practical outcomes. As noted in the <i>Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage Report</i>, &#8220;when 
[indigenous people] make their own decisions about what approaches to take and what 
resources to develop, they consistently out-perform [non-indigenous] decision-makers&#8221;.20 
55. Although the Government recognizes the importance of collaboration with 
indigenous peoples, there is a continuing need to empower indigenous peoples to take 
control of their own affairs in all aspects of their lives. The Government should seek to 
decidedly include in its initiatives the goal of advancing indigenous self-determination, in 
particular by encouraging indigenous self-governance at the local level, ensuring 
indigenous participation in the design, delivery and monitoring of programmes, and 
developing culturally-appropriate programmes that incorporate and build on indigenous 
peoples&#8217; own initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Local self-governance 
</b></p>
<p>56. Of concern to the Special Rapporteur is the apparent increased centralization of 
governance institutions in several states and the Northern Territory, at the expense of local, 
indigenous-run governance institutions. Most notably, starting in July 2008, the Northern 
Territory government consolidated 73 community-based governance councils into 9 larger 
shire governments. Given that the transition to the shire system in the Northern Territory is 
fairly recent, its impacts are not yet completely known. However, the Special Rapporteur 
received information related to several concerns, including: a potential loss of 
representation and control at the local level; the employment of shire staff without 
knowledge of local issues; the channelling of formerly community-based programmes and 
services through shires; the location of shire offices in urban centres; and the 
implementation of an electoral system that may result in communities with low populations 
being either under or unrepresented in the shire political structures. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur was particularly disturbed by situations in which the 
Government has revoked self-governance powers of Aboriginal people when communities 
have displayed shortcomings in managing their own affairs. The clearest example of this 
practice is the NTER, discussed in appendix B to this report. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteur visited the Swan Valley Nyungah community in Perth, Western Australia, 
where, because of supposed rampant alcoholism and abusive behaviour, including among 
the community&#8217;s principal leadership, the state of Western Australia legislatively revoked 
the management authority of the community, and placed it with the Aboriginal Affairs 
Planning Authority, a state entity, and evicted the community from its location.21 According 
to reports received by the Special Rapporteur, some of the community&#8217;s women and 
children, astoundingly, are now homeless and living on the streets while their community 
remains under lock and key, although the Government insists that all women and children 
were moved into state government housing. While emphasizing the need to take measures 
to address the extreme social problems faced by the Swan Valley community, the Special 
Rapporteur considers that the expulsion of all community members from their homes and 
community and revoking the community&#8217;s decision-making authority, is a troubling and 
ineffective approach to resolving the concerns, and is at odds with international standards.

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4

<p><b>16</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>58. Another example of this trend of undermining indigenous decision-making and 
governance structures is found in the Government leasing scheme, as well as the 2006 
amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, discussed in paragraphs 22 and 44, which 
also remove management and oversight authority from indigenous leadership structures. 
The Government has stated that, in the past, traditional owners of indigenous land were 
rarely consulted in investment and administrative decisions, and that the Government 
leasing system is intended to address this failure by defining responsibilities and standards 
for housing maintenance, in consultation with traditional landowners and others. The 
Special Rapporteur acknowledges that this is a worthy objective, but believes that this 
objective is achievable without restricting the rights of the indigenous communities to 
decision-making about land tenure through a scheme by which they are pressed to lease 
their land to the Government for a minimum 40-year period. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur notes that replacing or undermining indigenous decision-
making structures feeds into a mistaken conception of indigenous peoples as responsible for 
their present disadvantaged state and unable to change. At the same time, the Special 
Rapporteur echoes the statements he heard from indigenous leaders about the need for 
indigenous peoples themselves to continue to strengthen their own organizational and local 
governance capacity, in order to meet the challenges faced by their communities and, in this 
connection, notes the importance of restoring or building strong and healthy relationships 
within families and communities. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Participation in the design, delivery and oversight of programmes 
</b></p>
<p>60. Also required is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples participate 
effectively in the design, delivery, and oversight of development programmes on an 
ongoing basis. As affirmed by the Declaration, &#8220;indigenous peoples have the right to 
determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development. In 
particular, indigenous peoples have the right to be actively involved in developing and 
determining health, housing and other economic and social programmes affecting them and, 
as far as possible, to administer such programmes through their own institutions&#8221; (art. 23). 
</p><p>61. Clearly, an important overarching aspect of the Closing the Gap campaign is the 
Government&#8217;s expressed commitment to redefine its relationship with indigenous peoples 
through close collaboration and partnership within a context of mutual respect and 
understanding. However, despite this, it is hard to ignore the fact that indigenous peoples 
have not been included as a party to any of the national inter-governmental partnership 
agreements developed under the Closing the Gap initiative and no national consultations 
took place in relation to the development of these agreements. However, the Government 
notes that certain partnership provisions, specifically under the Remote Service Delivery 
National Partnership Agreement, discussed in paragraph 67, are designed to boost 
indigenous engagement and participation in programme activities. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The need to support and build on indigenous-controlled initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>62. Developing programmes that are effective and culturally-appropriate requires 
innovation and flexibility, and is not free from challenges of all kinds. As a preliminary 
matter, it requires consultation with the affected indigenous groups about community needs 
and programme design, as well as openness to varied models. In particular, it is essential to 
provide continued support to programmes, especially those designed by indigenous people 
themselves that have already demonstrated achievements. The Special Rapporteur observed 
numerous successful indigenous-controlled programmes already in place to address issues 
of alcoholism, domestic violence, health, education and other areas of concern, in ways that 
are culturally appropriate and adapted to local needs. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>63. For example, in the health sector, the National Aboriginal Community Controlled 
Health Organization (NACCHO) represents over 140 Aboriginal health services across the 
country. A central objective of the organization is to deliver holistic and culturally 
appropriate health and health-related services to the Aboriginal community. NACCHO and 
its partners have achieved many noteworthy successes. The vast majority of NACCHO 
funding is through the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, although its 
operations require supplemental funds which come from non-governmental sources. 
</p>
<p>64. In another example, the Mount Theo programme was created in 1993 to address 
chronic petroleum-sniffing in Yuendumu, Northern Territory. It is comprised of culturally-
based youth programmes, including its core programme where at-risk youth are sent to the 
Mt. Theo Outstation, located 160 km from Yuendumu, where they are cared for by 
community elders and provided cultural healing and empowerment, for at least one month. 
The programme has achieved significant success, and Yuendumu is now, according to 
community leaders, a community that is free of petroleum-sniffing. The <i>Little Children are 
Sacred</i> report (p. 146) commended the Mt. Theo programme and identified it as a potential 
model to address other problems facing indigenous communities, including the problem of 
child sexual abuse. 
</p>
<p>65. The <i>Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage</i> report, the annual Social Justice reports 
and other sources document numerous other examples of indigenous good practices in a 
variety of areas. Supporting and promoting precisely these types of programmes furthers 
the rights of indigenous peoples with regards to self-determination, consultation and 
participation, and cultural integrity, while at the same time serving as a practical strategy 
for addressing indigenous disadvantage. The Special Rapporteur encourages the 
Government to pursue such an approach across its various programme areas. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Remote service delivery and homelands 
</b></p>
<p>66. Twenty-four per cent of indigenous Australians live in remote and very remote 
Australia compared to 2 per cent of non-indigenous Australians.22 While there are 
complexities involved in delivering services such as health, schooling, employment and 
housing to remote areas, special efforts are required to ensure that indigenous peoples 
living in these areas, including homelands (also called outstations), can enjoy the same 
social and economic rights as other segments of the Australian population, without having 
to sacrifice important aspects of their cultures and ways of life.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>67. COAG has entered into the Remote Service Delivery National Partnership 
Agreement to ensure that indigenous people living in selected remote communities receive 
services. The national partnership has identified 26 priority locations in remote areas with 
concentrated indigenous populations across several states to be expanded to additional 
locations in the future, which were identified according to a set of &#8220;practical criteria&#8221; 
including significant concentration of population; anticipated demographic trends and 
pressures; and the potential for economic development and employment. In addition, the 
Northern Territory&#8217;s <i>A Working Future &#8211; A New Deal for the Remote Territory</i>, released on 
20 May 2009, outlines its proposal to develop 20 &#8220;Territory Growth Towns&#8221; as services 
centres for surrounding homelands.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. This &#8220;hub approach&#8221; to service delivery has caused concern among many indigenous 
people, who fear that communities that do not fall within one of these key priority or

<p><b>18</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>growth areas, in particular sparsely-populated homeland communities, will be forced to 
move to larger communities to receive basic services. In fact, the Northern Territory 
government states that it &#8220;will not financially support the establishment of new outstations 
and homelands&#8221; and that &#8220;government services to outstations/homelands will in most cases 
involve a form of remote delivery, based from the closest or most accessible hub town&#8221;.23 
This policy further provides that residents of homelands are expected to contribute 
financially to the installation of basic services, such as water, electricity and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>69. For its part, the Commonwealth Government has communicated to the Special 
Rapporteur that it does not intend to abandon homelands or to relocate residents, that it is 
committed to maintaining current levels of funding for the maintenance of occupied 
outstations and for key government services and that it has committed AUD 60 million over 
three years to fund essential services to homelands. Nevertheless, members of homeland 
communities visited by the Special Rapporteur and other sources indicated weakening 
support from the Commonwealth Government for the homelands in practice. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur observed the profound connection that many Aboriginal 
people in Australia have to their homelands, many of which began to be repopulated in the 
1970s when elders took their people back to ancestral lands from larger communities run by 
missions, and the importance of these lands to the lives and culture of Australia&#8217;s 
Aboriginal people. Further, homelands are widely understood to have lower levels of social 
problems, such as domestic violence and substance abuse, than more populated 
communities. According to reports, the health of indigenous people living on homelands is 
significantly better than of those living in larger communities, with the death rate among 
indigenous peoples living in homelands being 40 to 50 per cent lower than the Northern 
Territory average for indigenous adults.24 Homelands are also used effectively as part of 
substance abuse and other programmes for at-risk Aboriginal youth living in more 
populated or urban centres, such as the Mt. Theo programme discussed above.<b>

<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b><i>  Overarching conclusions 
</i></p>
<p>71. <b>The Government of Australia is to be commended for the advancements made 
in addressing the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples over 
recent years and for enacting reforms to redress historical negative policies and 
actions. The Special Rapporteur particularly notes the many instances of commitment 
made by the Government to reconcile with indigenous peoples, including the National 
Apology of 2008, and its support for the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. He is also pleased to note the important goal set to eliminate significant social 
and economic disadvantages faced by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples by the year 2020 and the resources committed thereto by the Government. 
The Special Rapporteur welcomes the numerous policies, programmes and studies in 
place to address indigenous issues, many of which he was unable to detail in the 
present report, as well as the significant funding the Government has dedicated for 
the purpose.

<p>GE.10-13887 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Despite the Government&#8217;s attention to indigenous issues, there is a continued 
need to develop new initiatives and reform existing ones, in consultation and in real 
partnership with indigenous peoples, to conform to international standards requiring 
genuine respect for cultural integrity and self-determination. Ownership and control 
of their lands and territories continues to be denied to many indigenous communities 
in Australia. Indigenous institutions and community governance structures also are 
subject to high levels of control by the State, and are often devoid of genuine 
opportunity to generate social, cultural and economic development. Accusations of 
past shortcomings of indigenous self-governance unfairly assign blame to indigenous 
peoples and at the same time ignore Government failures in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned about ongoing effects of historical 
patterns of racism within Australian society and that their negative consequences 
continue to severely undermine the dignity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples and individuals. Additional efforts, beyond the recent laudable efforts of the 
Government to advance reconciliation and reset the relationship with indigenous 
peoples is needed to address negative perceptions within society and to generate 
greater confidence and self-respect amongst the indigenous population, to create a 
healthy environment conducive to the enjoyment of rights and freedoms. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Legal and policy framework 
</i>74. <b>The Commonwealth and state governments should review all legislation, 
policies, and programmes that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, in light 
of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Government should pursue constitutional or other effective legal 
recognition and protection of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
peoples in a manner providing long-term security for these rights. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>In consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the 
Government should look to ratify the International Labour Organization Convention 
concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, 1989 (No. 169). 
</b>77. <b>The Commonwealth Government should ensure that state, territory and local 
governments are aware of their obligations to promote and protect the human rights 
of indigenous peoples. The Government should promote a consistent approach to 
these rights across all levels of government authority. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur considers the position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander Social Justice Commissioner within the Australian Human Rights 
Commission to be an exceptional model for advancing the recognition and protection 
of rights of indigenous peoples. The Commissioner&#8217;s reports should be given greater 
attention in government administration to promote a higher level of accountability 
and sensitivity to human rights commitments. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>All efforts should be made to increase the number of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
representatives in legislative, executive, and judicial institutions at all levels. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s support in establishing a national 
indigenous representative body and emphasizes the importance of indigenous 
participation in the ongoing design, development and functioning of this mechanism. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Council of Australian Governments should look to integrate the proposed 
national representative indigenous body into its structure for decision-making and 
design of strategic initiatives, for the purpose of coordinating policies and strategies 
relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>81. <b>The Commonwealth and state governments should, in cooperation with the 
indigenous peoples concerned, enhance efforts to strengthen Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander peoples&#8217; own governance structures, and increase the capacity of 
indigenous leadership at all levels. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Any government decision that has the effect of limiting or removing indigenous 
decision-making authority should be reconsidered and evaluated in light of 
Australia&#8217;s human rights obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Government should collaborate with the Australian Human Rights 
Commission to ensure that adequate remedies, including compensation, are provided 
as a matter of urgency to the Stolen Generation victims. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Lands, territories and resources 
</i></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the efforts of the Commonwealth and state 
governments in recent decades to advance the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander peoples to their lands, territories and resources. Continued efforts should be 
made to uphold the rights of indigenous peoples over their lands and resources and 
guarantee for these peoples a sustainable basis for economic, social and cultural 
development. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Commonwealth and state governments should ensure that all laws and 
administrative practices related to lands and natural resources align with 
international standards concerning indigenous rights to lands, territories and 
resources. To this end, the Government should establish a mechanism to undertake a 
comprehensive review at the national level of all such laws and related institutions and 
procedures, giving due attention to the relevant reports of the Australian Human 
Rights Commission and the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Legislative and administrative mechanisms that allow for the extraction of 
natural resources from indigenous territories should conform to relevant 
international standards, including those requiring adequate consultations with the 
affected indigenous communities, mitigation measures, compensation and benefit-
sharing. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Government should increase the availability and effectiveness of technical 
and financial resources to support indigenous representation and participation in the 
procedures to identify and protect indigenous peoples&#8217; native title. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Commonwealth and state governments should revise existing legislation 
that vests ultimate decision-making authority over Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander heritage sites or objects in government entities, to ensure indigenous 
participation in decision-making and full respect for indigenous rights in relation to 
cultural heritage. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur welcomes information 
from the Government that it has proposed national reforms to improve indigenous 
participation in decision-making over traditional sites and objects. 
</b>89. <b>The Queensland state government should review and revise as necessary the 
Wild Rivers Act of 2005 to ensure its conformity with international standards 
concerning the rights of the traditional owners to control and manage their lands, 
territories and resources. The review of the legislation should engage the traditional 
owners to achieve an agreed arrangement. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Commonwealth Government and state governments should embrace a 
long-term vision for social and economic development of homeland communities, 
especially bearing in mind the practical, social and cultural benefits that the </b></p>

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>homelands provide to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, as well as to the 
society at large. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Overcoming indigenous disadvantage 
</i></p>
<p>91. <b>The Government should be commended for efforts to address the socio-
economic disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. As part of 
this process, the Government should seek to include in its initiatives the goal of 
advancing indigenous self-determination, in particular by encouraging indigenous 
self-governance at the local level, ensuring indigenous participation in the design, 
delivery and monitoring of programmes and developing culturally appropriate 
programmes that incorporate or build on indigenous peoples&#8217; own initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p>92<b>. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples should be fully consulted 
about all initiatives being developed to overcome indigenous disadvantage, including 
the national partnership agreements, at the earliest stages of the design of those 
initiatives. In particular, adequate options and alternatives for socio-economic 
development and violence prevention programmes should be developed in partnership 
with affected indigenous communities. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Relevant government agencies should facilitate greater decision-making power 
by indigenous peoples over the design and delivery of government services in their 
communities. The Government should support, both logistically and financially, 
indigenous programmes already in place that have demonstrated success and should 
also support the development of new indigenous service-delivery programmes. In this 
regard, the Government should look to establish a national focal point for skills 
training for the purpose of increasing the capacity of indigenous individuals and 
communities to be self-sufficient and to manage their own affairs, including their 
social and economic development. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Health 
</i></p>
<p>94. <b>While the Government has taken important steps to improve indigenous health, 
it should strengthen efforts to ensure that indigenous Australians have equal access to 
primary health care and that the basic health needs of indigenous communities are 
met, especially in remote areas. Every effort should be made to enhance indigenous 
peoples&#8217; participation in the formation of health policy and delivery of services. The 
Government should ensure and strengthen support for health-care initiatives by 
indigenous communities and organizations as a matter of priority. All medical 
professionals should be provided with comprehensive, culturally appropriate medical 
training, and health services in the language of the community should always be 
available. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Education 
</i></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the efforts of the Government to close the 
gap of indigenous disadvantage in the area of education. However, indigenous systems 
of teaching, cross-cultural curricula and bilingual programming should be further 
incorporated into the education of indigenous children and youth. In addition, 
indigenous communities and their authorities should have greater participation in 
educational programming. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Equal educational opportunities should be provided in remote areas, including 
Aboriginal homelands, in accordance with the recommendations contained in the 2008 
Social Justice Report. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>97. <b>The Northern Territory government should reform its policy that school 
activities be conducted in English only for the first four hours of each school day and 
provide bilingual and culturally appropriate education to Aboriginal children. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Employment and income 
</i></p>
<p>98. <b>In recent years, the Government has taken noteworthy steps to promote 
economic development and employment opportunities for indigenous peoples. As part 
of this process, the Government should work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islanders and their organizations to determine goals and priorities for economic 
development and should build the capacity of indigenous peoples to take control over 
their own economic development.</b> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>The Government should ensure that adequate and, at a minimum, equivalent 
funding and employment opportunities are in place before reforming or abolishing 
existing welfare and social security programmes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander communities. Any reforms to welfare and social security programmes should 
be carried out in consultation with indigenous peoples and their organizations. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Housing 
</i></p>
<p>100. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s long-term funding 
commitments on housing and essential infrastructure. However, Government 
initiatives to address the housing needs of indigenous peoples should avoid imposing 
or promoting housing arrangements that would undermine indigenous peoples&#8217; 
control over their lands. Housing programmes for the benefit of indigenous 
communities, especially within indigenous territories, should be administered by 
indigenous community-controlled institutions. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Women, children, and families 
</i>101. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for attaching urgency and 
priority to the issue of protecting vulnerable groups and abating violence against 
women and children. However, efforts should be made to intensify consultations with 
indigenous women at the community level to amplify and adapt services and solutions 
to violence and other problems in their own communities. Special emphasis should be 
placed on providing access to culturally appropriate, community-based legal and 
support services to victims of domestic violence in remote areas. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Administration of justice 
</i>102. <b>The Government should take immediate and concrete steps to address the fact 
that there are a disproportionate number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, 
especially juveniles and women in custody. 
</b>103. <b>The Government should take further action, in addition to action already 
taken, to ensure the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal 
Deaths in Custody are being fully implemented. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Additional funds should be immediately provided to community-controlled 
legal services to achieve, at a minimum, parity with mainstream legal aid services. In 
particular, culturally appropriate legal services should be available to all Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander peoples, including those living in remote areas, and 
interpreters should be guaranteed in criminal proceedings and, where necessary, for a 
fair hearing in civil matters. </b></p>

incorporate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander customary law and other juridical 
systems, including community dispute resolution mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Northern Territory Emergency Response 
</i></p>
<p>106. <b>The legislative and administrative measures that relate to the Northern 
Territory Emergency Response should be revised so that those measures are in 
conformity with Australia&#8217;s international human rights obligations, and the Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges the initiatives of the Government in this regard. Specific 
observations and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur concerning the 
initiative are contained in appendix B to this report.

<p>107. <b>Indigenous peoples should endeavour to strengthen their capacities to control

levels, and should make every effort to address any issues of social dysfunction within 
their communities, including with respect to women and children. </b></p>

<p>GE.10-13887  (E)    240610 
</p>
<p><b>Appendix B 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations on the Northern Territory Emergency 
Response in Australia 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report presents the observations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, James Anaya, on the 
Northern Territory Emergency Response (&#8220;NTER&#8221;) programme in Australia, in advance of 
reforms to the NTER that are anticipated in 2010. These observations follow an exchange 
of information and communications with the Government of Australia, indigenous peoples, 
and other stakeholders, including during the visit of the Special Rapporteur to Australia 
between 17 and 28 August 2009, during which he visited, with the cooperation of the 
Government, numerous Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, including Alice 
Springs (as well as the Alice Springs town camps), the Bagot community in Darwin, 
Yuendumu, Yirrkala, Angurugu, Gamgam, and Raymangirr. The observations included in 
parts I&#8211;V of the report were submitted initially to the Government by a note of 2 December 
</p><p>2009. These parts of the report appear here with only minor changes that do not alter 
substantively the observations previously submitted to the Government. Part VI of the 
report includes a summary of the Government&#8217;s comments on the observations previously 
submitted, comments the Special Rapporteur received on 16 February 2010; and part VII 
provides final observations by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>2. The NTER is a suite of legislation and related Government initiatives implemented 
in 2007, which are aimed at addressing conditions faced by indigenous peoples in the 
Northern Territory, but that contain several problematic aspects from an indigenous human 
rights standpoint. Although many of the concerns related to the NTER are being addressed 
in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s main report on the situation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander peoples in Australia &#8212; including with respect to self-determination, self-
governance, participation in the design, delivery and oversight of programmes, and cultural 
match &#8212; the Special Rapporteur would like to devote special attention to the matter of the 
NTER, given its extraordinary nature and its deep implications for a range of fundamental 
human rights, especially the right to non-discrimination, and for what it may represent for 
the direction of indigenous-State relations in Australia. 
</p>
<p>3. The Government of Australia is correct to endeavour to ensure the security of 
Aboriginal women and children as a matter of urgency and priority, and to improve the 
well-being of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Affirmative measures by the 
Government to address the extreme disadvantage faced by indigenous peoples and issues of 
safety for children and women are not only justified, but they are in fact required under 
Australia&#8217;s international human rights obligations, including under the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. The NTER programme, however, in several key aspects limits the capacity 
of indigenous individuals and communities to control or participate in decisions affecting 
their own lives, property and cultural development, and it does so in a way that in effect 
discriminates on the basis of race, thereby raising serious human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p>4. It is the opinion of the Special Rapporteur that, as currently configured and carried 
out, provisions of the NTER are incompatible with Australia&#8217;s human rights obligations. 
The present document sets forth the reasoning behind this assessment. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur also takes note of the analysis contained in the 2007 Social Justice </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>Report by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. The 
Special Rapporteur understands that the NTER is currently undergoing a process of reform, 
and he hopes that the following observations are helpful in revising NTER measures to 
diminish or remove their discriminatory aspects and adequately take into account the rights 
of indigenous peoples to self-determination and cultural integrity, in order to bring this 
Government initiative in line with Australia&#8217;s international obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>5. In 2006 the Northern Territory government established the Board of Inquiry into the 
Protection of Aboriginal Children from Sexual Abuse, following a number of media reports 
on the subject. The work of the board resulted in the report, <i>Ampe Akelyernemane Meke 
Mekarle &#8211; &#8220;Little Children are Sacred&#8221;</i>, which drew national attention to the problems of 
child abuse in the Northern Territory and made numerous specific recommendations for 
addressing these issues, in relation to Government leadership; family and children&#8217;s 
services; health crisis intervention; police; prosecutions and victim support; bail; offender 
rehabilitation; prevention services; health care as prevention of abuse; family support 
services; education; alcohol and substance abuse; community justice; employment; 
housing; pornography; gambling; and cross-cultural practices. 
</p>
<p>6. Six days after the report was issued, on 21 June 2007, the Commonwealth 
Government announced that there would be a &#8220;national emergency intervention&#8221; into 
Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. On 17 August 2007, the Senate 
approved a package of legislation, which was composed of the Northern Territory National 
Emergency Response Act 2007 (&#8220;NTER Act&#8221;); the Social Security and Indigenous Affairs 
and Other Legislation Amendment (Northern Territory National Emergency Response and 
Other Measures) Act 2007; and the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs 
and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2007. Reportedly, the proposed legislation was 
introduced by the Government in the House of Representatives on 6 August 2007, 47 days 
after the announcement of the Government&#8217;s emergency plan and less than 24 hours after 
drafts of the proposed legislation were shared with opposition parties and relevant 
stakeholders. No consultations with indigenous peoples in the Northern Territory were 
carried out prior to the adoption of the NTER. 
</p>
<p>7. While specifically oriented towards the eradication of child sexual abuse in a 
number of indigenous communities and town camps within the Northern Territory, the 
NTER in fact addresses a diverse cross section of economic and social issues that confront 
the Northern Territory, including: law and order; family support; welfare reform and 
employment; child and family health; education; housing and land reform; and coordination 
for service delivery. The Northern Territory Emergency Response Taskforce was 
instrumental in the design of the NTER, and the Department of Families, Housing, 
Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has been the primary government agency 
responsible for its implementation. 
</p>
<p>8. Since its adoption, the NTER measures have sparked widespread criticism both 
domestically and internationally. Concerns were brought to the attention of the Government 
of Australia by the previous Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, Professor Rodolfo Stavenhagen. On 10 
October 2007, Professor Stavenhagen sent a communication to the Government, together 
with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and 
the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance. In the letter, the Special Rapporteurs commended the Australian 
Government on the national emergency response to the &#8220;critical situation&#8221; and its expressed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>commitment to tackle the issue of sexual abuse of indigenous children in the Northern 
Territory as a matter of urgency and priority. 
</p>
<p>9. At the same time however, the Special Rapporteurs expressed concern about the 
numerous reports received alleging potential or actual contradiction between the new 
legislation and international human rights standards that are binding upon Australia. In 
particular, they expressed concern that the NTER measures &#8220;include restrictions on the 
exercise of individual rights of the members of Aboriginal communities, including for 
alcohol consumption or use of pornographic materials, as well as a number of limitations to 
vested communal rights. It was alleged that these measures would arbitrarily limit the 
exercise of their individual rights on an equal basis with other sectors of the national 
population, thus amounting to discrimination prohibited under international and domestic 
law/legislation&#8221;.1 
</p>
<p>10. In a letter of 22 November 2007 responding to the Special Rapporteurs, the 
Australian Government stated that it considered that the measures of the NTER are 
necessary to ensure that indigenous people in the Northern Territory, and in particular 
indigenous women and children in relevant communities, are able to enjoy their social and 
political rights on equal footing with other Australians. The Government added that the 
NTER includes both exceptional and necessary measures to enable all, particularly women 
and children, to live their lives free of violence and to enjoy the same rights to 
development, education, health, property, social security and culture that are enjoyed by 
other Australians. In this regard, the Government noted that many of the provisions are time 
limited and designed to stabilize communities so that longer-term action can be taken. 
</p>
<p>11. United Nations treaty monitoring bodies have also expressed concern over the 
NTER. The Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights have expressed concern that NTER measures are inconsistent with 
Australia&#8217;s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, respectively, in 
particular with respect to the right to non-discrimination.2 Specifically, the Human Rights 
Committee recommended that Australia &#8220;redesign NTER measures in direct consultation 
with the indigenous peoples concerned, in order to ensure that they are consistent with the 
1995 Racial Discrimination Act and the [International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights]&#8221;.3 Further, the NTER is currently being examined under the urgent action and early 
warning procedure of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>12. During his visit to Australia in August 2009, the Special Rapporteur heard 
complaints about the NTER through multiple oral statements by numerous indigenous 
individuals and leaders, not just in the Northern Territory but in all the places he visited in 
Australia. He also received written petitions against the NTER signed by hundreds of 
indigenous individuals. Several other indigenous individuals with whom the Special 
Rapporteur met did speak in favour of the NTER in general and the need for Government 
action to address the problems it targets.

<p><b> III. Incompatibility with international human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Racially discriminatory treatment of indigenous individuals and 
communities 
</b></p>
<p>13. No doubt the NTER represents a substantial commitment of human and financial 
resources on the part of the Government to overcome immediate problems and improve the 
conditions of indigenous peoples, with particular attention to the needs of indigenous 
women and children. The NTER, however, has an overtly interventionist architecture, with 
measures that undermine indigenous self-determination, limit control over property, inhibit 
cultural integrity and restrict individual autonomy. These measures include the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Under Section 31 of the NTER Act, the Government compulsorily acquired five-
year leases to the lands of over 64 communities, in order to provide access to the 
Government over these areas to improve housing. The leases give the 
Commonwealth exclusive possession and quiet enjoyment of the land while the 
lease is in force.4 Such five-year leases came into effect at the entry of force of the 
NTER, without consultation or consent by the relevant Aboriginal associations. 
Further, these leases were acquired without any compensation to the indigenous 
owners. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Under Section 47, the NTER Act allows the Government to take control of 
Aboriginal town camps, which are held under leases in perpetuity by Aboriginal 
associations under the Special Purposes Act and the Crown Lands Act of the 
Northern Territory. The Commonwealth has the option of vesting in itself all rights, 
titles and interests in town camps merely by giving notice, with a similar 
consequence as the compulsory five-year leases. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Section 51 suspends the &#8220;future act&#8221; provisions of the Native Title Act over areas 
held under leases granted under sections 31 and 47, and in some other 
circumstances. The future acts provisions allow indigenous communities to 
negotiate arrangements with third parties, including natural resource extraction 
companies, while native title claims are pending. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Part 5 of the NTER Act vests broad powers in the Minister for Families, Housing, 
Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to intervene in the operation of 
representative Aboriginal community councils and associations, including with 
respect to service delivery and management of funds. Section 67 grants the Minister 
broad discretion to decide when to intervene in service delivery, including if &#8220;a 
service is not being provided in the area to the satisfaction of the Minister&#8221;. Further, 
the Minister can unilaterally determine how Commonwealth funding is to be used, 
managed or secured, within declared &#8220;business management areas&#8221;; and any area 
within the Northern Territory may be declared a business management area by the 
Minister, through a legislative instrument. The Government placed in many 
indigenous communities in the Northern Territory its own &#8220;Government Business 
Managers&#8221; to oversee and coordinate the delivery of services. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The NTER introduces a regime of compulsory income management that involves 
severe limitations on the use of social security benefits received by indigenous 
individuals. Fifty per cent of individuals&#8217; income support and 100 per cent of 
advances and lump sum payments made to them are diverted to an &#8220;income

<p>management account&#8221;. The quarantined funds can only be spent in specially licensed 
stores on &#8220;priority needs&#8221;, such as food, clothing, and household items, using a 
bright green &#8220;BasicsCard&#8221; that clearly identifies its holder as someone subject to 
income management. This regime applies to all those living in prescribed areas 
inhabited by indigenous peoples, regardless of whether or not they have 
responsibilities over children or have been shown to have problems managing 
income in the past. By contrast, outside of the prescribed areas, income quarantining 
applies only on a case-by-case basis in demonstrated situations of neglect, abuse, or 
inadequate school attendance. Further, the NTER terminated the Community 
Development Employment Project (&#8220;CDEP&#8221;), under which the Commonwealth 
provided funding to employers to hire Aboriginal peoples who otherwise would 
have received unemployment support. Since termination of the CDEP, payments are 
now classified as unemployment payments, and are therefore subject to compulsory 
income management.5 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The NTER imposes bans on alcohol consumption and pornographic materials within 
Aboriginal communities in prescribed areas (with limited exceptions to the alcohol 
ban), and in connection with the pornography ban requires policing of the use of 
publicly funded computers. Mandatory signs are prominently placed at the entrances 
to the communities, announcing the alcohol and pornography bans (&#8220;it is an offence 
to bring, possess, consume, supply, sell or control liquor in a prescribed area without 
a liquor permit or license&#8221; and &#8220;it is an offense to bring, possess, supply, sell and 
transport certain prohibited material in a prescribed area&#8221;) and outlining serious 
fines, up to AUD 74,800 and/or 18 months in jail for failure to abide by the 
restrictions.6 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Part 6 of the NTER Act limits the consideration of indigenous customary law or the 
cultural practice of an offender in criminal proceedings for all alleged offences (not 
just those involving domestic or sexual violence), in bail applications and 
sentencing. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Australian Crime Commission is accorded special powers, approved for use by 
the National Indigenous Violence and Child Abuse Intelligence Taskforce, to 
enhance its ability to collect information on alleged crime affecting indigenous 
communities. These include secrecy and witness confidentiality provisions, and 
special access to individuals&#8217; records. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur cannot avoid observing that, on their face, these measures 
involve racial discrimination. Under the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination (&#8220;Convention to Eliminate Discrimination&#8221;), to which 
Australia is a party, &#8220;the term &#8216;racial discrimination&#8217; shall mean any distinction, exclusion, 
restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which 
has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, 
on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, 
social, cultural or any other field of public life&#8221; (art. 1.1). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 The Special Rapporteur heard reports that the termination of the CDEP has had both negative effects 
</p>
<p>on Aboriginal employees who are left to seek work into the formal labour market without adequate 
alternative employment options or training, and on employers, who have lost funds with which to hire 
Aboriginal employees thereby, abruptly reducing their potential workforce. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
 These maximum fines are, with respect to alcohol restrictions: AUD 1,100 for the first office, $2,200 
</p>
<p>for the second or subsequent offences, and $74,800 and/or 18 months in jail for supplying/intending 
to supply over 1,350 ml quantity of pure alcohol in liquor to a third person; and with respect to the 
prohibited materials restrictions, $5,500 for &#8220;level 1 material and&#8221; $11,000 for &#8220;level 2 material&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>15. First, the above measures of the NTER, like the NTER overall, distinguish on the 
basis of race, because they are intended to and in fact do apply specifically to indigenous 
individuals and communities in the Northern Territory and not to others. The NTER 
measures specifically target indigenous people or apply to people and land within 
&#8220;prescribed areas&#8221; which, pursuant to section 4 (2) of the NTER Act, are specified 
&#8220;Aboriginal land&#8221; and other designated areas that are populated almost entirely by 
indigenous people. These areas cover some 600,000 square kilometres and encompass more 
than 500 Aboriginal communities and over 70 per cent of Aboriginal people within the 
Northern Territory (approximately 45,500 Aboriginal men, women, and children).7 
</p><p>16. Second, the differential treatment of indigenous peoples in the Northern Territory 
involves impairment of the enjoyment of various human rights, including rights of 
collective self-determination, individual autonomy in regard to family and other matters, 
privacy, due process, land tenure and property, and cultural integrity. These rights are 
recognized, inter alia, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 
(especially arts. 1, 14, 17, 27) and in the United Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples (especially arts. 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 15, 18, 19, 20, 23, 26, 32). The Declaration places 
special emphasis on the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination and self-
government (arts. 3, 4), to be actively involved in the design and implementation of 
development initiatives in their communities (art. 23), to control the disposition of their 
lands and territories (arts. 26, 32), and to be consulted for &#8220;legislative or administrative 
decisions that may affect them&#8221; (art. 19). Significantly, by all accounts, the NTER was 
initiated without any consultation with the affected indigenous communities. Additionally, 
especially in its income management regime, the NTER imposes discriminatory treatment 
of indigenous peoples in relation to their right to social security, which is protected by the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) (art. 9). 
17. As a party to both the ICCPR and the ICESCR, Australia must respect the human 
rights protected by these treaties, in addition to being bound to the provisions of the 
Convention to Eliminate Discrimination; and, having declared its support for the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it should also adhere to the principles of 
that instrument.  
</p>
<p>18. Under the Convention to Eliminate Discrimination (art. 2.1), and various other 
human rights instruments, including the ICCPR (art. 2.1) and the ICESCR (art. 3), States 
are obligated to avoid and prevent discriminatory treatment on the basis of race that impairs 
the enjoyment of human rights. The proscription against racial discrimination is a norm of 
the highest order in the international human rights system. Even when some human rights 
are subject to derogation because of exigent circumstances, such derogation must be on a 
non-discriminatory basis. Under article 4 (1) of the ICCPR, &#8220;[i]n time of public emergency 
which threatens the life of the nation&#8221; a State party may derogate certain rights of the 
Covenant &#8220;to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation&#8221; and only 
&#8220;provided that such measures ... <i>do not involve discrimination</i> solely on the ground of race, 
colour, sex, language, religion or social origin&#8221;.8 Similarly, the Declaration states in article 
46 that &#8220;[a]ny such limitations [on the rights contained therein] shall be non-discriminatory 
and strictly necessary solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the 
rights and freedoms of others and for meeting the just and most compelling requirements of 
a democratic society&#8221;.

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>31 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Special measures 
</b></p>
<p>19. Provisions of the NTER legislation identify the operative parts of the NTER 
programme as &#8220;special measures&#8221; for the purposes of the Commonwealth Racial 
Discrimination Act of 1975. With this &#8220;special measures&#8221; designation, related provisions of 
the NTER legislation suspend the prohibition of discrimination of the Racial Discrimination 
Act and of the racial discrimination laws of the Northern Territory. 
</p>
<p>20. Notwithstanding the effect of this legislative arrangement on the domestic norms 
dealing with discrimination, the NTER measures must be evaluated autonomously in regard 
to Australia&#8217;s international obligations, particularly under the Convention to Eliminate 
Discrimination. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the discriminatory aspects of the 
NTER discussed above have not been shown to qualify as &#8220;special measures&#8221; that may be 
deemed not to constitute racial discrimination for the purposes of the Convention. Article 1 
(4) of the Convention to Eliminate Discrimination provides, &#8220;Special measures taken for 
the sole purpose of securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or 
individuals requiring such protection &#8230; shall not be deemed racial discrimination.&#8221;9 
</p>
<p>21. As already stressed, special measures in some form are indeed required to address 
the disadvantages faced by indigenous peoples in Australia and to address the challenges 
that are particular to indigenous women and children. But it would be quite extraordinary to 
find consistent with the objectives of the Convention, that special measures may consist of 
differential treatment that limits or infringes the rights of a disadvantaged group in order to 
assist the group or certain of its members. Ordinarily, special measures are accomplished 
through preferential treatment of disadvantaged groups, as suggested by the language of the 
Convention, and not by the impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights.  
</p><p>22. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has advised that, 
&#8220;Special measures should be appropriate to the situation to be remedied, be legitimate, 
necessary in a democratic society, respect the principles of fairness and proportionality, and 
be temporary ... States should ensure that special measures are designed and implemented 
on the basis of prior consultation with affected communities and the active participation of 
such communities.&#8221;10 
</p>
<p>23. Being racially discriminatory on their face, the rights-impairing aspects of the NTER 
measures should be presumed to be illegitimate. That presumption might possibly be 
overcome only if there is a strong showing that the measures are proportional and necessary 
in regard to a valid objective, and that adequate consultations have been undertaken. As 
pointed out above, no such consultations preceded enactment of the NTER programme; 
and, apart from that, the discriminatory measures cannot be viewed in the considered 
opinion of the Special Rapporteur, as proportional or necessary to the stated objectives of 
the NTER, valid as those objectives are. 
</p><p>24. Indigenous people with whom the Special Rapporteur met in various communities in 
the Northern Territory, including numerous women expressed anguish over not just the 
immediate impacts of various aspects of the NTER, but also about a deepening sense of 
indignity and stigmatization that is brought about by the entire scheme. In addition, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
 Further, article 2 (2) requires States &#8220;when the circumstances so warrant&#8221; to take &#8220;special and 
</p>
<p>concrete measures to ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups or 
individuals belonging to them, for the purpose of guaranteeing&#8221; the full enjoyment of their human 
rights.

 Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, general recommendation No. 32: The 
</p>
<p>meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (2009), paras. 16, 18. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>according to the information received by the Special Rapporteur, the NTER measures have 
had the effect of generating or heightening racist attitudes among the public and the media 
against Aboriginal people. Concern has been expressed especially about the stigmatizing 
effects of the large signs at the entrance to prescribed areas announcing the alcohol and 
pornography bans, and of the special government-issued BasicsCard that is mandatory for 
purchasing essential household items.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur finds credible assertions that, in general, the design of the 
NTER provisions animates perceptions of indigenous peoples as being somehow 
responsible for their present disadvantaged state. The special government-appointed 
independent board established to evaluate the NTER, the NTER Review Board, noted that 
&#8220;there is a strong sense of injustice that Aboriginal people and their culture have been seen 
as exclusively responsible for problems within their communities that have arisen from 
decades of cumulative neglect by governments in failing to provide the most basic 
standards of health, housing, education and ancillary services enjoyed by the wider 
Australian community&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p>26. After considered evaluation of the totality of circumstances, and with the objectives 
of the relevant international human rights instruments in mind, the Special Rapporteur is 
not convinced that the particular aspects of the NTER that limit or impair rights are justified 
by and proportional to the legitimate aims of the NTER. When government measures not 
only apply differential treatment to indigenous peoples, but also limit or condition their 
enjoyment of human rights and cast a stigmatizing shadow upon them, the most exacting 
inquiry must apply. To find the rights-limiting, discriminatory measures of the NTER to be 
justified would require a careful assessment that they are strictly necessary to the 
achievement of the legitimate NTER objectives, that those objectives somehow override the 
rights and freedoms being limited, and that there is an absence of suitable alternatives. 
</p>
<p>27. At this stage, after more than two years of the NTER being operative, such an 
assessment would have to be based, at a minimum, on clear evidence that the NTER is in 
fact yielding results in terms of its stated objectives and that the rights-limiting aspects of 
the programme are in fact necessary contributing factors to those results. To date, the 
evidence in this respect is at best ambiguous.12 The Government has reported certain 
improvements in access to food and in safety for indigenous women and children, on the 
basis of consultations with indigenous individuals subsequent to the adoption of the NTER 
measures.13 However, even assuming such improvements, there is no evidence that the 
rights-impairing discriminatory aspects of the NTER have been necessary. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that there must be better alternatives to the 
current NTER scheme that could incorporate a holistic approach to advancing the security 
and well-being of indigenous women and children along with the well-being and rights of 
all indigenous individuals and of the communities that they constitute. Several indigenous 
women with whom the Special Rapporteur met pleaded for such a holistic approach while 
explaining that their rights as indigenous women are inextricably bound to their capacity to

 For example, in its report monitoring NTER activities for the period January 2009 to June 2009, the 
</p>
<p>Government identified data showing significant increases during that period in reported incidents of 
alcohol-related and domestic violence, and of child abuse, although it could be that these increases are 
at least in part due to an increase in reporting to the police of such incidences. FaHCSIA, <i>Closing the

</b></p>
<p>make choices for themselves and to the self-determination and cultural integrity of their 
communities. In this regard, the NTER Review Board aptly observed: 
</p>
<p> Not surprisingly, there was a convergence among official commentaries and 
submissions to the Board around the fundamental principle of international human 
rights law that different classes of rights cannot be traded off against each other ... . 
</p>
<p> It is important to note that criticisms over the exclusion of the [Racial 
Discrimination Act] do not simply reflect an &#8220;academic&#8221; debate. Throughout the 
Board&#8217;s community visits and consultations with various organizations and 
representatives, it was made abundantly clear that people in Aboriginal communities 
felt humiliated and shamed by the imposition of measures that marked them out as 
less worthy of legislative protections afforded other Australians ... . 
</p>
<p> The fact that different sets of human rights are not to be traded off against 
one another is particularly critical in the context of addressing specific concerns in 
Aboriginal communities. The indivisibility and interdependence of human rights in 
this context means that addressing issues of violence and abuse ... cannot be done by 
enacting racially discriminatory measures. Indeed, the critical point to be made here 
is that addressing the safety and well-being of children, women and families requires 
the strengthening of human rights frameworks. Such strengthening cannot occur in 
the context where different categories of rights are considered to be inherently 
inconsistent &#8211; which is not the case.14 
</p>
<p>29. While overall the NTER is surrounded by controversy, many of the programme&#8217;s 
components are undoubtedly legitimate and important efforts to address indigenous 
disadvantage. Most notably, the NTER has brought an influx of funds and new initiatives to 
improve the conditions of indigenous peoples, including women and children in key areas 
such as housing, health, education, employment and police protection. However, the 
Special Rapporteur is of the conviction that these efforts can move forward without the 
racially discriminatory aspects of the NTER and that, indeed, they can best succeed without 
them and by ensuring as the NTER Review Board has counselled, that the broader human 
rights framework is strengthened for Aboriginal peoples in the Northern Territory. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Anticipated reform 
</b></p>
<p>30. Amidst a number of criticisms of the NTER, the Government committed to a 
process of review of the programme after a year of its operation. The NTER Review Board 
issued its report to the Government on 12 October 2008, making a number of 
recommendations in each of the programme areas of the NTER, as well as three 
overarching recommendations: (1) that &#8220;[t]he Australian and Northern Territory 
Governments recognize as a matter of urgent national significance the continuing need to 
address the unacceptably high level of disadvantage and social dislocation being 
experienced by Aboriginal Australians living in remote communities throughout the 
Northern Territory&#8221;; (2) that &#8220;[i]n addressing these needs both governments acknowledge 
the requirement to reset their relationship with Aboriginal people based on genuine 
consultation, engagement and partnership&#8221;; and (3) that &#8220;Government actions affecting the 
Aboriginal communities respect Australia&#8217;s human rights obligations and conform with the 
Racial Discrimination Act 1975&#8221;.15

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>31. In its response to the report of the NTER Review Board, the Government accepted 
each of these recommendations, as well as a number of the Review Board&#8217;s 
recommendations that are specific to the various programme areas,16 and outlined its vision 
for the NTER in its May 2009 <i>Future Directions for the Northern Territory Emergency 
Response Discussion Paper</i> (&#8220;<i>Discussion Paper</i>&#8221;). In its <i>Discussion Paper</i> the Government 
committed to introducing into Parliament in 2009 the necessary legislation for the 
reinstatement of the Racial Discrimination Act. It also reported its intention to redesign 
some of the NTER measures through appropriate legislative and administrative reforms, 
following a consultation process that would be independently monitored and facilitated by 
interpreters. The Government recognized that many of NTER&#8217;s efforts have fallen short of 
expectations because of a lack of community involvement and participation in the design 
and implementation of the NTER, and it expressed its intention to remedy this issue by 
working more closely with and listening to community members and leaders. 
</p>
<p>32. From June through August 2009 the Government proceeded with a wide-ranging 
process of consultation with indigenous communities and individuals in the Northern 
Territory with a view to enacting reforms to the NTER, and later that year it issued the 
results of these consultations.17 The Special Rapporteur received reports alleging that the 
consultations did not adequately accommodate indigenous peoples&#8217; own leadership 
structures or decision-making procedures, that there often was an absence of interpreters or 
adequate explanation of NTER measures, and that the consultations were at times geared to 
specific predetermined outcomes.18 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur stresses that 
consultations with indigenous peoples should be carried out in accordance with their own 
representative institutions and mechanisms of decision-making.  
</p>
<p>33. On the other hand, the Special Rapporteur is cognisant of the difficulties inherent in 
a consultation process of this magnitude. He also is aware of the assessment of some 
government officials and observers that indigenous peoples&#8217; own leadership and decision-
making structures are in some ways dysfunctional, because of the very disadvantage they 
face, and that those structures do not allow for the voices of the most disadvantaged, in 
particular women, children and the elderly to be heard. Such an assessment, however, 
should be closely scrutinized. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes that indigenous 
women played prominent and often leading roles in all of the multiple meetings he had at 
indigenous communities in various locations in the Northern Territory.  
</p>
<p>34. In any case, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the extensive consultations 
engaged in by the Government represent a significant effort to understand and address the 
concerns of the indigenous communities that the NTER measures are intended to benefit. 
At the same time, it is apparent from the Government&#8217;s own report of the results of these 
consultations that there is an absence of evidence of broad or even substantial acceptance 
by indigenous communities of the rights-impairing aspects of the NTER measures. While 
indicating that many indigenous individuals who were consulted on an individual basis or 
in open community meetings support the NTER measures, the Government&#8217;s report reveals 
a general pattern of criticism, emanating from workshops with indigenous leaders and

<p>representative organizations, of the NTER measures in their current form in regard to 
income management, leasing and alcohol restrictions.19 
</p>
<p>35. In November 2009, the Government introduced into Parliament draft legislation to 
reinstate application of the Racial Discrimination Act and the anti-discriminations laws of 
the Northern Territory, and to reform essential aspects of the NTER. In doing so the 
Government indicated its openness to constructive feedback from all stakeholders on the 
specifics of the proposed reforms. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this development and 
encourages the ultimate adoption of reforms to the NTER that fully comport with 
Australia&#8217;s international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>36. <b>The Government should continue its commitment to address problems faced by 
Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, in particular concerning the well-being 
of Aboriginal women and children. However, any measures should involve a holistic 
approach, which recognizes the interdependent character of human rights, and must 
be devised and carried out with due regard of the rights of indigenous peoples to self-
determination and to be free from racial discrimination and indignity.  
</b></p>
<p>37. <b>Aspects of the NTER as currently configured are racially discriminatory and 
incompatible with Australia&#8217;s international human rights obligations. These include 
aspects related to compulsory income management, compulsory acquisition of 
Aboriginal land, the assertion of extensive powers by the Commonwealth Government 
over Aboriginal communities, and alcohol and pornography restrictions in prescribed 
areas, as well as the other provisions of the NTER listed in paragraph 13, supra. 
</b></p>
<p>38. <b>The Government and Parliament should reinstate the Racial Discrimination 
Act, as the Government has committed to do, and should enact appropriate reforms to 
the NTER in light of all of Australia&#8217;s international human rights obligations. 
Further, such reforms should be developed on the basis of full and adequate 
consultations with the affected indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>Any discriminatory measures or limitations to the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples that remain part of the NTER 
programme must be narrowly tailored, proportional, and strictly necessary to achieve 
the legitimate objectives being pursued.</b>  
40. <b>Additionally, such limitations on rights should exist only on the basis of the 
free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned. Where this is 
not possible because of exigent circumstances, due regard should be given to the full 
range of applicable human rights norms. In any case, any measure that accords 
differential treatment to indigenous peoples or that limits their human rights and 
fundamental freedoms should fulfil the requirements of &#8220;special measures&#8221; under 
applicable human rights standards, including the Convention to Eliminate 
Discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>Efforts should be made to reach agreements in accordance with the 
organizational patterns and leadership structures of the diverse indigenous 
</b></p>
<p>

<p>

 It is noteworthy that the Government report on the consultations states that the information contained 
</p>
<p>therein &#8220;should be read as a summary of the information recorded during the consultations. It should 
not be considered to be representative of all the opinions of those affected by the NTER measures&#8221;.

</p>
<p><b> VI. Comments of the Government on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
observations 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur submitted the foregoing observations to the Government by 
a note of 2 December 2009, and on 16 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur received 
from the Government its comments on the observations. These comments are summarized 
here. 
</p>
<p>43. In its comments, the Government explains that the NTER should be considered 
within its larger policy on indigenous affairs, which includes a package of initiatives to 
&#8220;close the gap&#8221; between indigenous and non-indigenous living standards in Australia. The 
Government acknowledges that &#8220;the suspension of the [Racial Discrimination Act], 
combined with a lack of consultation at the outset of the NTER, left Aboriginal people 
feeling hurt, betrayed and less worthy than other Australians&#8221;. The Government states that 
its actions were not intended to promote a perception that Aboriginal people are to be 
blamed for the circumstances which they currently face, and that it recognizes the need for 
indigenous and non-indigenous Australians to work together in trust and good faith to 
advance human rights and close the gap in &#8220;real life outcomes&#8221;. The Government further 
affirms that in order for NTER measures to be effective it is essential that they be 
implemented in consultation with indigenous persons.  
</p>
<p>44. In this regard, the Government refers to its consultations with indigenous people 
about the future direction of the NTER, and it provides the Special Rapporteur with a 
summary of the consultation process and its proposed reforms of the NTER which it 
describes as resulting from the consultations. Overall, according to the Government, it has 
accepted and acted on the overarching recommendations of the independent NTER Review 
Board (see para. 30, supra), including introducing legislation to reinstate the Racial 
Discrimination Act in relation to the NTER and to make necessary changes to the NTER 
measures. 
</p>
<p><i>  The consultation process 
</i></p>
<p>45. The Government reports that the consultations between June and August 2009 
involved all 73 communities in which the NTER is in place, as well as several other 
Northern Territory indigenous communities and town camps. The consultations are 
described as having been designed and delivered so as not only to engage with indigenous 
people through their own community and regional leadership structures, but also to access 
other groups that the Government considered more likely to provide feedback through 
smaller and more informal settings. The Government especially notes the role of 
interpreters in the consultations in order to reach indigenous individuals for whom English 
is not their first language, and also notes the efforts it made to reach as many people as 
possible and adapt the consultations to the particular conditions of the communities, 
including remote communities. The Government describes the four-tiered approach it 
developed and employed, which involved consultations with individuals and families (tier 
1); whole-of-community meetings (tier 2); workshops in NTER communities (tier 3); and 
workshops with major stakeholder organizations (tier 4). 
46. The Government&#8217;s <i>Discussion Paper</i> (referenced in para. 31, supra), it says, was a 
starting point for consultations, but other views, ideas and proposals were put forward and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>considered during the engagement process, which the Government states is reflected by the 
fact that some of the measures subsequently introduced to reform the NTER depart from 
the proposals contained in the <i>Discussion Paper</i>, based on the views expressed during the 
consultations. 
</p>
<p>47. The Government refers to the monitoring of the consultations by the independent 
Cultural and Indigenous Research Centre Australia, which reported on the openness and 
integrity of the process while outlining a number of criticisms.20 In response to the 
criticisms, the Government points out the magnitude and complexity of the exercise, and 
affirms that it made every effort to give as many people as possible affected by the NTER 
the opportunity to be heard.   
</p>
<p><i>  Proposed revisions to the NTER following on the consultation process 
</i>48. According to the Government, the views expressed through the consultations were a 
significant factor in developing the reforms to the NTER that are contained in the 
legislation it introduced into the Australian Parliament on 25 November 2009. Moreover, 
the Government indicates that it has complied with the requirement of &#8220;free, prior and 
informed consent&#8221; of article 19 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, which it interprets in light of article 46 of the Declaration, by 
consulting extensively and in good faith with indigenous persons in order to develop the 
proposed NTER reforms. 
</p>
<p>49. The Government provided the Special Rapporteur with information on the reform 
legislation, which proposes a number of changes to the NTER.21 The Government 
summarizes the proposed changes as follows: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; All new and redesigned NTER measures to be implemented from July 2010 are 
designed to conform with the RDA [Racial Discrimination Act]. The legislation 
provides for the current suspension of the RDA in relation to the NTER to be lifted 
from 31 December 2010, allowing time for the passage of legislation through both 
Houses of the Australian Parliament, and the necessary time for the redesigned 
measures to be put in place and for an effective transition from existing to new 
arrangements. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Between 1 July 2010 and 31 December 2010, a new, targeted scheme of income 
management will be rolled out across the Northern Territory &#8212; in urban, regional 
and remote areas &#8212; as a first step in a future national roll-out of income 
management to disadvantaged regions. The targeted categories are not based on 
race. The scheme will be targeted at: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Disengaged youth who are not working or studying 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Long-term recipients of unemployment benefits and parenting payments 
</p>
<p>&#8226; People assessed by Centrelink as requiring income management for reasons 
including vulnerability to financial crisis, domestic violence or economic 
abuse 
</p>
<p>&#8226; People referred for income management by child protection authorities 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20
 See <i>CIRCA Report</i>, supra. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21
 In particular, the Government provided the Special Rapporteur with its <i>Policy Statement:</i> <i>Landmark 
</i></p>
<p><i>Reform to the Welfare System, Reinstatement of the Racial Discrimination Act and Strengthening of 
the Northern Territory Emergency Response</i>, which sets out in some detail the content of the reforms. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>38</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The categories provide an objective basis for targeting the benefits of income 
management that is independent of race, and as a result, is intended to be non-
discriminatory. The RDA will apply in relation to the new scheme of income 
management from the commencement of implementation in July 2010. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Following collection and evaluation of evidence from the [Northern Territory] in 
2011, the scheme will be extended to other disadvantaged regions of Australia 
beyond the [Northern Territory]. This new scheme is part of the Government&#8217;s 
significant welfare reform agenda. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Alcohol restrictions will be continued, but the restrictions will be varied to meet the 
individual needs of specific communities based on careful analysis of evidence 
about each community&#8217;s circumstances, and implemented in consultation with the 
community. Existing alcohol restrictions will remain in place in a particular area 
until an assessment of alcohol-related harm and other matters and appropriate 
consultations have taken place. The Government will also work with the Northern 
Territory Government and indigenous communities to look at ways to make the 
alcohol and prohibited materials and road signs more acceptable to local people. The 
provisions giving [Northern Territory] police the power to enter a private residence 
in a prescribed area as if it were a public place will be repealed and will only be 
available in a particular area through a ministerial declaration in response to a 
request from a community resident and after community consultation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In light of the strength of community views expressed during the consultations 
against the availability of sexually explicit and very violent material, the current 
pornography restrictions will remain in place. However, communities could ask to 
have the restrictions lifted in their community. Decisions on these requests would 
consider evidence about the prevalence of sexually explicit and very violent material 
in the community, the well-being of people in the community and the views of those 
in the community. The advice of the relevant law enforcement authority will also be 
sought. The Government will work with the Northern Territory Government and 
individual communities to look at ways to make the road signs more acceptable to 
local people. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The purpose and operation of the five-year leases will be clarified by: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Making it clearer that the objectives of the five-year leases are to enable 
special measures to be taken to improve the delivery of services in 
indigenous communities in the [Northern Territory] and promote economic 
and social development in those communities 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Defining the permitted use of leases as being directly related to achieving 
those objectives 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Clarifying that exploration and mining are not permitted uses of the five-year 
leases 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Requiring the five-year leases to be administered with regard for Aboriginal 
culture 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Facilitating the Government&#8217;s commitment to move to voluntary leases by 
requiring the Government to negotiate the terms and conditions of voluntary 
leases in good faith where requested 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Developing clear guidelines to better explain the land use approval process to 
ensure the transparent allocation of lots 
</p>
<p>Separately, the Government is compensating landowners for the acquisition 
of these leases </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The Australian Crime Commission&#8217;s (ACC) special law enforcement powers will be 
amended to make it clear that these powers are in relation to serious violence or 
child abuse committed <i>against</i> an indigenous person, which is a change from the 
existing provision which applies to serious violence or child abuse by or against, or 
involving, an indigenous person. 
</p>
<p>50. In addition to providing the foregoing summary of the proposed reforms, the 
Government addressed the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s concerns about current provisions of the 
NTER that limit consideration of customary law and cultural practices in criminal 
proceedings (see para. 13, supra). The Government stated that, while the NTER limits the 
contexts in which customary law and cultural practice may be considered by the legal 
system, it is not intended to exclude them entirely as factors that may be taken into account 
in bail and sentencing decisions. According to the Government, legislative amendments 
prevent customary law and cultural practice being taken into account only as a reason for 
mitigating or aggravating the seriousness of criminal behaviour. 
</p>
<p><i>  Evidence of results of the NTER with specific reference to income management 
</i>51. The Government argues that the NTER has in fact yielded intended results, asserting 
generally that results can be discerned from the feedback provided during consultations and 
in other research and evidence. Beyond this general assertion, the Government provides a 
summary of information taken from Government and other sources to show the practical 
benefits of the income management regime of the NTER.  
</p>
<p>52. As told by the Government, these sources reveal data showing that people subject to 
income management are buying more and healthier food, resulting in greater nutritional 
well-being, especially for children. Additionally, surveys referenced by the Government 
indicate that initial mistrust and confusion about income management has abated over time, 
and that women and caregivers in particular were found to speak most positively about 
aspects of income management.  
</p>
<p><i>  Reference to international instruments 
</i>53. In regard to rights identified by the Special Rapporteur in relation to several 
international instruments (at para. 16, supra), the Government states that it does not accept 
that the NTER infringed all of the rights mentioned. In particular, the Government rejects 
that the NTER constituted arbitrary interference with the family under article 17 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; that it denied the right of indigenous 
people under article 27 of the Covenant to enjoy their own culture, profess and practise 
their own religion, or use their own language; or that the NTER infringed the right to 
equality before the courts under article 14 of the Covenant.  
</p>
<p>54. Furthermore, the Government affirms that, since declaring its support for the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it has acted consistently with the 
Declaration by consulting extensively with indigenous peoples on the future direction of the 
NTER. Also in regard to the Declaration, the Government states that it is unclear about how 
many of the articles cited by the Special Rapporteur can be construed to be violated by the 
NTER, mentioning in particular article 7 of the Declaration which is aimed at protecting the 
life and security of indigenous people.  
</p>
<p>55. The Government refers to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation in paragraph 40 
about special measures in connection with the Convention to Eliminate Discrimination and 
states, &#8220;differential treatment of particular groups can be undertaken consistent with the 
principle of &#8216;legitimate differential treatment&#8217; under international law and, if so, is not 
discriminatory under international law&#8221;. According to the Government, &#8220;Such treatment 
need not conform to the requirements of a &#8216;special measure&#8217; in order to be legitimate.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>40</b> GE.10-13887 
</p>
<p>56. Finally, the Government affirms that it is doing a great deal to address the 
disadvantages faced by indigenous Australians, through the NTER as well as through its 
broader policy agenda on indigenous affairs. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Final observations 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the comments of the Government on his 
observations, and is grateful for the spirit of constructive dialogue in which they are 
offered. The Special Rapporteur considers it useful to make some final observations in light 
of these comments. 
</p>
<p>58. As an initial matter, the Special Rapporteur observes that in its response the 
Government does not specifically express disagreement with the conclusion that the NTER 
as currently configured is racially discriminatory and incompatible with Australia&#8217;s 
international human rights obligations under the Convention to Eliminate Discrimination 
and other international instruments. The Government&#8217;s recognition of the flawed character 
of the NTER and the need to bring it in line with Australia&#8217;s human rights obligations is an 
important predicate to its initiatives to reform the NTER.  
</p>
<p>59. The Government rejects, however, that there has been denial of all of the rights 
identified by the Special Rapporteur and found in the several international human rights 
instruments he mentions. It is noteworthy that the Government avoids asserting that none of 
the rights identified has been infringed and only specifically raises questions as to a few of 
those rights. 
</p>
<p>60. Without directly engaging the Government in its focus on particular rights and 
provisions of international instruments mentioned, and on whether or not each and every 
one has been violated, the Special Rapporteur stresses that the Government&#8217;s position does 
not undermine his overarching conclusion that the NTER is in several aspects racially 
discriminatory and hence incompatible with Australia&#8217;s human rights obligations. The 
Government&#8217;s focus on particular rights appears to depend on an assessment that 
erroneously separates the question of impairment of rights from the racial discrimination 
involved. It is well established that not every Government measure that impairs or limits a 
human right referenced in an international instrument is a violation of that instrument 
incurring for the State international responsibility, if the measure is justifiable and non-
discriminatory. However, measures that impair or limit rights and do so in a racially 
differentiated manner prima facie violate the standard of non-discrimination that is implicit 
in all human rights norms and that is explicit, inter alia, in the Convention to Eliminate 
Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>61. It is not difficult to see how the full enjoyment of the various human rights 
mentioned in paragraph 16, supra, is undermined by the NTER measures; and, as shown by 
the Special Rapporteur, supra, paragraph 15, such impairment rests on a distinction based 
on race. This is so even if in a strict sense each of the cited provisions of the other 
international instruments, standing alone, is not violated. To hold that the non-
discrimination norm is only infringed when other human rights norms are violated would be 
to render the non-discrimination norm a redundancy. 
</p>
<p>62. It is not surprising, thus, that in the end the Government in its response to the 
Special Rapporteur does not explicitly contest that aspects of the NTER discriminate on the 
basis of race. Nor does it specifically refute the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusion that these 
aspects fail to qualify as permissible &#8220;special measures&#8221; under the Convention to Eliminate 
Discrimination. The Government does argue that &#8220;legitimate differential treatment&#8221; for 
particular groups may be permissible under international law in accordance with standards 
different from those to justify &#8220;special measures&#8221;. It is remarkable, however, that this </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13887 <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>argument is offered only summarily, without any explanation of what the different 
standards are or how they might apply to justify the NTER. In any case, the Special 
Rapporteur is of the considered view that the NTER&#8217;s racially discriminatory aspects could 
no more qualify as &#8220;legitimate differential treatment&#8221; than they could as &#8220;special 
measures&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur stresses that any Government measures that discriminate on 
the basis of race must, in order to comply with Australia&#8217;s human rights obligations, 
survive the highest scrutiny and be found to be proportional and necessary to advance valid 
objectives. As noted above, after having been in place for well more than two years, the 
discriminatory measures of the NTER cannot be found necessary to the legitimate 
objectives they are intended to serve, if the discriminatory treatment is not shown to 
actually be achieving the intended results.  
</p>
<p>64. In response to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assertion that the evidence of such success is 
ambiguous at best, the Government only provides specific information to show some 
success in the income management regime. No evidence of success by the other NTER 
measures is offered. Of course the Special Rapporteur welcomes any improvement in the 
living conditions of indigenous peoples, especially the most vulnerable among them, 
although he is aware that the Government&#8217;s interpretation of the data in this regard is 
disputed. Yet, even accepting the Government&#8217;s account of such improvements as a result 
of income management, one can only speculate how the compulsory aspects of the income 
management regime that discriminate on the basis of race have been necessary elements 
leading to the improvement. The question is not simply whether the NTER measures are 
yielding results; but whether the discriminatory, rights-impairing aspects of the measures 
are themselves proportional and necessary to the results. The Special Rapporteur reaffirms 
his assessment that the evidence in this regard is ambiguous at best. 
</p>
<p>65. In any event, the Special Rapporteur commends the Government for taking the 
initiative to engage in wide-ranging consultation with affected indigenous people and to 
reform the NTER. Without specifically opining on the content of the reforms the 
Government has proposed, the Special Rapporteur notes that he is aware that the reforms 
are being vigorously debated by stakeholders and challenged by some as insufficient. The 
Special Rapporteur is also aware, as noted in paragraph 32, supra, of significant criticisms 
against the very consultative process that the Government contends meets the standard of 
free, prior and informed consent. Thus, open to question is the extent to which the 
Government&#8217;s proposed NTER reforms can indeed be said to count on broad support 
among the affected indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>66. In conclusion, the Special Rapporteur reaffirms the recommendations provided in 
paragraphs 36&#8211;41, while reiterating the need to fully purge the NTER of its racially 
discriminatory character and conform it to relevant international standards, through a 
process genuinely driven by the voices of the affected indigenous people.
