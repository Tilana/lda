Interim Financial Report 31 December 2015
Directors’ report 
The Directors present their interim financial report, together with the consolidated financial statements of ZYL 
Limited and its controlled entities (ZYL, the “Company”, “Consolidated Entity” or the “Group”), for the half-
year ended 31 December 2015. 
 
1.  DIRECTORS 
 
The names of directors who held office during or since the end of the half-year:
•  Mr Shaun Hardcastle, who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 23 February 2015.
•  Ms Oonagh Malone, who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director and Company Secretary on 23
February 2015.
•  Mr Richard Pearce, who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 23 February 2015.
2.  COMPANY SECRETARY 
 
The Company Secretary is Ms Oonagh Malone, who was appointed 23 February 2015. 
 
3.  PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES 
 
ZYL Limited (subject to Deed of Company Arrangement) (ZYL, the “Company” or “parent entity”) is currently 
in administration, subject to a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) signed on 19 February 2015. The DOCA 
is intended to satisfy creditors’ debts through the disposal of interests in the Kangwane Central Anthracite 
Project  and  other  assets,  while  retaining  the  interest  in  the  Kangwane  South  Anthracite  Project.  Before 
entering into the DOCA, ZYL was actively attempting to progress its Anthracite projects in South Africa. 
 
4.  REVIEW OF OPERATIONS  
Incomplete Financial Information 
Due to turnover of previous staff and officers, and the parent entity being subject to external administration, 
complete accounting records have not been able to be located. For the year ended 30 June 2013 and since, 
this  has  led  to  insufficient  information  being  available  to  support  several  material  contracts  as  well  as 
transactions and balances of subsidiaries.
The Directors are of the opinion that it is not possible to state that the financial statements and notes are in 
accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, due to the lack of records and certainty in 
connection with material transactions, for both the year ended 30 June 2013 and since then.
It is noted by the Directors that the intended sale of the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project to satisfy the 
creditors’ and administrator’s debts, along with the continued existence of the Kangwane South Anthracite 
Project, means that while historical records are affected by incomplete financial information, the absence of 
these records is not expected to significantly detract from the Company’s ability to maintain proper books and 
records for the period from 23 February 2015 for Australian entities, when current directors were appointed. 
Therefore, the absence of records due to turnover of previous staff and officers, unavailable documents of 
foreign  subsidiaries  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to  external  administration,  primarily  affects  the 
historical  records  of  the  economic  entity  rather  than  its  ability  to  continue  its  retained  business  and 
operations.

Summary of Results
The  Group’s  net  loss  for  the  period  attributable  to members of  the  Company  for  the  half year  ended  31 
December 2015 was $378,890 (2014: $296,901).
At 31 December 2015, the Group had a net asset deficit of $2,655,313 (30 June 2015: $1,921,571) and the 
Company had 612,747,560 (30 June 2015: 612,747,560) shares on issue.
Kangwane Central Project
On 4 February 2013, ZYL entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with its partners in the 
Kangwane  Central  Anthracite  Project.  The  MOU  sought  to  restructure  the  original  transaction  that  was 
executed and announced on 13 December 2010 between Siyanda Resources (Pty) Ltd (“Siyanda”), Double 
Ring Resources (Pty) Ltd (“Double Ring”) and Opes Capital (Pty) Ltd (collectively the “Partners”).
The finalisation of the MOU was subject to the fulfilment of a number of conditions precedent by 30 April 
2013. The conditions precedent were not fulfilled and the MOU consequently lapsed and as such the original 
transaction remained binding.
Kangwane South Project
The Kangwane South Project is located in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa, approximately 150km 
from the coast to the Matola Terminal at Maputo Port in Mozambique and approximately 25 kilometres to 
the south of the Company’s Kangwane Central Project. 
 
Extension of bridging facility with Prestige Glory
On 8 April 2014, ZYL announced that it had executed a third deed of extension and forbearance with Prestige 
Glory whereby Prestige Glory (PGL) agreed to extend the termination date of the bridging facility to 30 June 
2014 and advance ZYL a further $300,000. Before this date, PGL had provided $2,000,000, to ZYL under the 
bridging facility, with this deed agreeing provision of a further $150,000 immediately and $150,000 on 31 May 
2014.  The $2,000,000 bridging facility loan has not been repaid and is past due. 
 
Appointment of voluntary administrator
On 8 January 2015, ZYL’s then board of director comprised of Mr Yuzheng Xie and Mr Stephen Woods resolved 
to appoint Jack James of Palisade Business Consulting as voluntary administrator to the Company. 
 
Resolution to enter Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA)
On 13 February 2015 at the second meeting of creditors, ZYL’s creditors resolved that the Company execute a 
Deed of Company Arrangement and that Jack James be appointed Administrator of the DOCA. The Company 
executed the DOCA with Konkera Corporate on 19 February 2015. The end date of the DOCA was extended to 
19 February 2016 on 15 July 2015.

Notes to the financial statements
Interim Financial Report 31 December 2015
1 
 
(a)
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The interim financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, applicable Accounting Standards including AASB 
134  “Interim  Financial  Reporting”,  Australian  Accounting  Interpretations  and  other  authoritative 
pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards.
The interim financial report covers ZYL Limited (“the Company”) and controlled entities (“the Group”). 
The Company is limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia.
The  interim  financial  report  has  been  prepared  on  an  accruals  basis  and  is  based  on  historical  cost 
modified by the revaluation of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial liabilities for 
which the fair value basis of accounting has been applied. All amounts are presented in Australian Dollars.
The interim report does not include full disclosures of the type normally included in an annual financial 
report.
The  interim  financial  report,  including  comparatives,  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  annual 
Financial Report of ZYL Limited for the year ended 30 June 2015 and any public announcements made by 
ZYL Limited during the half year in accordance with the continuous disclosure obligations arising under 
the Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules and Corporations Act 2001.
Significant Accounting Policies 
The significant accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in the preparation of the half-
year financial report are consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Company’s annual financial 
report for the financial year ended 30 June 2015 and have been consistently applied by the entities in 
the Consolidated Entity. These accounting policies are consistent with Australian Accounting Standards 
and with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Incomplete Financial Information
(b) 
Due  to  turnover  of  previous  staff  and  officers,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to  external 
administration, complete accounting records have not been able to be located. For the year ended 30 
June 2013 and since, this has led to insufficient information being available to support several material 
contracts as well as transactions and balances of foreign subsidiaries.
The Directors are of the opinion that it is not possible to state that the financial statements and notes 
are in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, due to the lack of records and 
certainty in connection with material transactions, for both the year ended 30 June 2013 and since then.
It is noted by the Directors that the intended sale of the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project to satisfy 
the creditors’ and administrator’s debts, along with the continued existence of the Kangwane South 
Anthracite Project, means that while historical records are affected by incomplete financial information, 
the  absence  of  these  records  is  not  expected  to  significantly  detract  from  the  Company’s  ability  to 
maintain proper books and records for the period from 23 February 2015 for Australian entities when
ZYL Limited page 11
Interim Financial Report 31 December 2015
Notes to the financial statements (continued)

(c)
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
current directors were appointed. Therefore, the absence of records due to turnover of previous staff 
and  officers,  unavailable  documents  of  foreign  subsidiaries  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to 
external administration, primarily affects the historical records of the economic entity rather than its 
ability to continue its retained business and operations.
Going Concern
The financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of 
normal business activities and the realisation of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
The Group has incurred a loss for the period of $378,890 (2014: $296,901) and net cash outflows from 
operating  activities  of  $54,766  (2014:  $3,164).  The  losses  are  mainly  due  to  interest  expenses  and 
administrative costs. In the 2013 financial report, projects were impaired down to values expected to be 
received following the administration of the Company. 
 
The Group had cash assets of $6,045 at 31 December 2015 (30 June 2015: $37,050). These conditions 
indicate a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
 
The directors believe that it is appropriate preparing the financial information on a going concern basis 
for the following reasons:
The Directors expect the Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) will result in the extinguishment 
of all secured and unsecured liabilities. Under the DOCA, it is proposed that: 
•
the Kangwane Central Project will be disposed of to satisfy the secured creditor and, with other 
available funds, satisfy identifiable unsecured creditors; 
the 70% interest in the Kangwane South project will be retained by the Company;
• 
•  all prior employment and service contracts will be terminated; and 
•
the issued capital will be consolidated on the basis of 1 share for every 100 shares held;
-
-
-
The Group expects to variously realise or continue developing its assets following completion of 
the DOCA; and 
 
The Group expects to recapitalise following completion the DOCA with sufficient funds to continue 
as a going concern. The DOCA requires a capital raising of at least $1,250,000 before completion, 
however, to satisfy ASX’s conditions for reinstatement, the capital raising will be for an amount of 
$2,000,000.  Following the capital raising, the DOCA requires: 
•  payment  of  fees  to  the  Trustee,  Administrator  and  the  Proponent  totalling  approximately
$200,000; 
the Company to reimburse the proponent for all costs in relation to the ASX relisting and 
capital raising; and  
post consolidation shares representing 27.6% of the Company’s issued share capital as at the 
completion of the issues will be issued to the Proponent and a compliance manager 
appointed by the Proponent (or their nominees).
ZYL Limited page 12
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
Interim Financial Report 31 December 2015
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
It is for these reasons that the Directors consider the Group to be a going concern. Notwithstanding the 
material uncertainties of future events inherent in the above, the Directors consider it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial information on a going concern basis and hence no adjustments have been made 
to the financial information relating to the recoverability and classification of the asset carrying amounts 
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the entity does not continue as 
a going concern.

MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION EXPENDITURE
The balance carried forward represents projects in the exploration and evaluation phase. Ultimate recoupment 
of  exploration  expenditure  carried  forward  is  dependent  on  successful  development  and  commercial 
exploitation, or  alternatively,  sale of  respective  areas.  Other  than  the  Kangwane  South  Anthracite Project, 
capitalised exploration expenditure has been fully impaired based on expected recovery. The interest in the 
Kangwane South Anthracite Project has been impaired down to the estimated value that would be reasonably 
expected to be realised following the potential completion of the Deed of Company Arrangement.

The termination date of the above secured loan from Prestige Glory Limited was extended 
from 30 September 2013 to 30 June 2014 and the loan is secured by a fixed and floating 
charge over the assets of the Company. The movements in the balances of both Prestige 
Glory loans were due to unpaid accrued interest. Both loans have remained unpaid to the 
date of this report. 
The movement in the unsecured loan from Finevest Investment FZE is due to the accrual of 
interest on the loan. 
During the year ended 30 June 2015, the Group obtained new unsecured loans totalling 
$64,000 with the following terms:

Unpaid  director  fees  of  $17,024  were  owed  to  each  of  Mr  Hardcastle,  Ms  Malone  and  Mr  Pearce  at  31

ZYL Limited page 17
In accordance with a resolution of the Directors of ZYL Limited and its controlled entities, we state that: 
 
1)
In the opinion of the Directors, subject to the qualification set out in paragraph 2 below:
the financial statements and supplementary notes, set out on pages 7 to 17, are in accordance with 
the Corporations Act 2001, including:
(i)
(ii)
giving a true and fair view of the financial position of ZYL Limited  and its controlled entities as 
at 31 December 2015 and of its performance, as represented by the results of its operations 
and its cash flows, for the period ended on that date; and
complying  with  Accounting  Standards  AASB  134:  Interim  Financial  Reporting  and  the 
Corporation Regulations 2001; and
b)  as  indicated  in  Note  1(c),  subject  to  the  recapitalisation  of  the  Company  there  are  reasonable 
grounds to believe that ZYL Limited and its controlled entities will be able to pay its debts as and 
when they become due and payable.
2)  Due  to  turnover  of  previous  staff  and  officers,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to  external 
administration, complete accounting records have not been able to be located. For the year ended 30 
June 2013 and since, this has led to insufficient information being available to support several material 
contracts as well as transactions and balances of foreign subsidiaries.
a)
Directors’ declaration
Interim Financial Report 31 December 2015
The Directors are of the opinion that it is not possible to state that the audited financial statements and 
notes are in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, due to the lack of records 
and certainty in connection with material transactions, for both the year ended 30 June 2013 and since 
then.
It is noted by the Directors that the intended sale of the Kangwane Central Anthracite Project to satisfy 
the  creditors’  and  administrator’s  debts,  along  with  the  continued  existence  of  the  Kangwane  South 
Anthracite Project, means that while historical records are affected by incomplete financial information, 
the  absence  of  these  records  is  not  expected  to  significantly  detract  from  the  Company’s  ability  to 
maintain proper books and records for the period from 23 February 2015 for Australian entities when 
current directors were appointed. Therefore, the absence of records due to turnover of previous staff 
and  officers,  unavailable  documents  of  foreign  subsidiaries,  and  the  parent  entity  being  subject  to 
external administration, primarily affects the historical records of the economic entity rather than its 
ability to continue its retained business and operations.
The Directors have been given the declarations required by section 295A of the Corporations Act 2001, 
which is also subject to the qualification in paragraph 2 above.
Signed in accordance with a resolution of the Directors:
Mr Shaun Hardcastle 
Non-Executive Director
