CVRD to pay dividend to shareholders from October 31
Press Release
Rio de Janeiro, October 14, 2005 — Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) informs that it
approved today the payment of the second installment of the 2005 minimum dividend to
shareholders, US$500 million, as well as the proposed additional dividend of US$300 million.
The total payment of US$800 million, equivalent to US$0.69 per outstanding share, will be made
to CVRD shareholders from October 31, 2005.
The minimum dividend for the year 2005 was announced on January 31, 2005
establishing the amount of US$1 billion to be distributed in two equal installments during
the year. The first installment, in the form of interest on shareholders equity, was paid
commencing on April 29.
1.  Minimum dividend:
The payment of the second installment, in the amount of US$500 million, will be paid
from October 31, as follows:
•
R$782,000,000.00 (seven hundred eighty-two million Brazilian reais) in the form of
interest on shareholders equity, equivalent to R$0.67 per common or preferred share
outstanding. This value corresponds to US$0.30 per common or preferred share
outstanding.
•
R$349,350,000.00 (three hundred and forty-nine million, three hundred and fifty
thousand Brazilian reais) in the form of dividends, equivalent to R$0.30 per common
or preferred share outstanding. This amount corresponds to US$0.13 per common or
preferred share outstanding.
2.  Additional dividend:
An additional dividend for this year, proposed on September 23, 2005 in the amount of
US$300 million, equivalent to R$678,810,000.00 (six hundred and seventy-eight million,
eight hundred and ten thousand Brazilian reais), will also be paid on October 31, in the
form of dividends. This amount corresponds to R$0.58 per common or preferred shares
outstanding, which equals to US$0.26 per common or preferred share outstanding.
The values were obtained from the conversion of the US dollar (USD) amount, using the
USD/BRL exchange rate bid value (Ptax — option 5) informed by the Central Bank of Brazil on
October 13, 2005, of R$2.2627 per US dollar.
On the distribution of interest on shareholders equity, income tax will be levied and retained at
source at valid rates, and there will be no withholding income tax on the distribution of dividends.
Therefore, on October 31, 2005, an amount of R$1,810,160,000.00 (one billion, eight hundred
and ten million, one hundred and sixty thousand Brazilian reais) will be distributed to CVRD
shareholders, corresponding to R$1.57 (one real and fifty-seven cents) per common or preferred
share outstanding.
