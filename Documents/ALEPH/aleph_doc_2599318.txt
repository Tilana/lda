DIRECTORS’ REPORT (continued)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
5.  REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (cont)
Environment, Health and Safety  (cont)
Upstream activities including seismic surveys, well site surveys and drilling operations require a variety of regulatory
approvals  as  detailed  in  the  applicable  regulatory  regime,  including  environment  plans,  safety  cases  and  the
preparation  of  plans  to  manage  the  undertaking  of  the  activities  and  the  contractors  engaged  in  undertaking  the
activities.
Any proposed development activities on Tassie Shoal are subject to environment conditions specified in the Offshore
Petroleum  and  Greenhouse  Gas  Storage  Act  (2006),  associated  Regulations  and  Directions,  as  well  as  the
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act (1999).
AUSTRALIAN OPERATIONS
During the year, the company conducted a strategic review of its exploration portfolio that identified and prioritised
the projects that MEO considers have the most potential to deliver significant shareholder value.  This resulted in a
number of changes to MEO’s exploration portfolio during the year.
WA-488-P (MEO 100%)
MEO was awarded 100% interest in WA-488-P, located in the Bonaparte Basin, in May 2013.  The permit is located
between the producing Blackktip gas field and the undeveloped Turtle and Barnett oil fields and contains the giant
Beehive prospect.  Beehive was identified as a follow-up to the 2011 Ungani-1 oil discovery in the adjacent Canning
Basin and represents a new play type in the Bonaparte Basin.
Beehive  is  considered  prospective  for  oil  at  the  upper  Carboniferous  aged  carbonate  target  and  is  considered
analogous to the giant Tengiz oil field in the Caspian Sea.
During the year,  MEO regained  100% interest in  WA-488-P  after  reaching  a  commercial  settlement  to allow Rex
Bonaparte Gulf Pty Ltd (“Rex BG”), who had held a 30% interest in WA-488-P, to withdraw from its farm-in into the
permit.  MEO received US$53,500 as cash compensation in recognition of the costs incurred by the company in the
process of negotiating the original transaction to bring Rex BG into WA-488-P earlier in 2015 and its subsequent exit.
In December 2015 the regulator approved a 12 month extension to Permit Year 2 to enable MEO to undertake 2D
seismic reprocessing and inversion studies over the Beehive prospect.  As a result of the work program changes, the
potential drilling of the prospect has also been deferred until late 2017.  Results from the seismic reprocessing are
showing a significant enhancement to data quality with higher quality definition of key aspects of the prospect.
A renewed farmout/partial sale process commenced during the third quarter of 2016.

5.  REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (cont)
AC/P50 & AC/P51 (both MEO 100%*)
AC/P50 and AC/P51 are located in the proven Vulcan sub-basin, immediately to the east of the producing Montara oil
field.  The area has historically been challenged by structural complexity and poor seismic image quality.
After the close of the financial year (5 July 2016), MEO executed an agreement with Rouge Rock Pty Ltd (“Rouge
Rock”) which grants Rouge Rock an option to acquire a 45% interest in the AC/P50 and AC/P51 Exploration Permits
(“Permits”).  In  exchange for the grant of the option, Rouge Rock will undertake and fund the remaining primary
statutory  work  program  for  each  permit  consisting  of  seismic  reprocessing  and  other  technical  activities
(“Reprocessing Work”).  The Reprocessing Work must  be completed in  stages no later than as required by timing
stated in the primary statutory work program which  currently ends on  18 May 2018 for  both  Permits.  Subject to
completing the Reprocessing Work, Rouge Rock may exercise its option by providing notice to MEO prior 18 May
2018, at which point it will acquire a 45% interest in the Permits.
Both permits are also subject to an option to acquire a 5% interest in each permit currently held by Far Cape Energy
Pte Ltd (“Far Cape”).  Far Cape is the successor to RedRock Pte Ltd who was granted this option in 2010 at the time
MEO acquired AC/P50 and AC/P51.  Under this option agreement, MEO will carry Far Cape’s participating interest
in the first well should MEO elect to drill a well in either of the permits.
* As at 30 June 2016, subject to a 5% option granted to Far Cape Energy Pte Ltd.

AC/P53
During  the  year,  MEO’s  assessment  of  the  AC/P53  exploration  permit,  located  in  the  Vulcan  sub-basin,  did  not
identify  any  commercially  attractive  prospect,  and  consistent  with  its  strategy  of  high  grading  its  exploration
portfolio, MEO surrendered the permit.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (continued)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
5.  REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (cont)
WA-454-P
During the year, MEO reached agreement to assign its 50% interest in the WA-454-P exploration permit, located in
the Bonaparte Basin, to Origin Energy Resources Limited.  The assignment follows consideration by the Company of
its strategic focus and allocation of capital to its asset portfolio.  The agreement includes provisions to effectively
back-date the assignment to December 2015 as consideration for MEO’s 50% interest, allowing MEO to avoid all
expenditure associated with  WA-454-P in 2016 and 2017, when an  exploration  well  is obligated to be drilled and
substantial expenditure incurred.
NT/P68 – Heron Area
During the year MEO assessed that the Heron discovery was too small to be a potential gas supply source for the
Tassie Shoal projects and consistent with its strategy of high grading its exploration portfolio, MEO withdrew from
the NT/P68 permit.
WA-360-P and WA-361-P
During the year, MEO’s assessment of the WA-360-P and WA-361-P permits, both located in the Carnarvon Basin,
concluded that the remaining exploration prospectivity in these permits was too high risk relative to MEO’s other
assets and consistent with its strategy of high grading its exploration portfolio, MEO discontinued its involvement in
the exploration permits.
Tassie Shoal Gas Processing Projects
MEO has Australian  Government environmental approvals to construct, install and operate two stand-alone world
scale 1.75 Mta methanol plants collectively referred to as the Tassie Shoal Methanol Project (TSMP) and a single 3
Mta LNG plant known as the Tassie Shoal LNG Project (TSLNG) on Tassie Shoal, an area of shallow water in the
Australian waters of the Timor Sea approximately 275 km north-west of Darwin, Northern Territory.  Environmental
Approvals are valid until 2052.
Tassie Shoal Methanol Project (TSMP, MEO 100%)
MEO proposes the staged construction of two large natural gas reforming and methanol production plants, each with
an  annual  production  capacity  of  1.75  million  tonnes  on  its  own  concrete  gravity structure  (CGS).    Each  TSMP
requires  ~200  –  220  Million  Standard  Cubic  Feet  per  day (MSCFD)  of raw gas,  preferably with  up  to 25%  CO2,
resulting in a potential total requirement of up to 440 MSCFD and ~4 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) of gas over an initial
25 year period.
During the year MEO maintained dialogue with industry and regulatory stakeholders regarding the Projects.  As the
regional  gas  supply  market  consolidates  over  the  medium  term  and  industry  participants  rationalise  their  global
exploration  portfolio,  there  is  the  potential  for  suitable  discovered  undeveloped  gas  to  become  available  for  the
Projects.  MEO continues to work with prospective partners to secure gas for its proposed projects.
Tassie Shoal LNG Project (TSLNG, MEO 100%)
The TSLNG requires approximately 3 Tcf of low CO2 gas to operate for 20 years.  Gas supply for the LNG plant
could come from one or more of the neighbouring undeveloped gas fields confronting economic challenges imposed
by long distances from land, high domestic construction costs and/or high FLNG development costs.  The Greater
Sunrise resource represents the most obvious source of gas for the LNG project.  Any LNG project proposed for gas
in the region of Tassie Shoal has the potential to utilise the TSLNG development path as an alternative to FLNG or
piping gas to an onshore LNG facility.  Due to its proximity to the resource and modularised construction, TSLNG
has a significant cost advantage when compared to both floating LNG (FLNG) and onshore Australia development
paths.
In August 2016, the company was advised that the environmental approvals for TSLNG were extended to 2052, and,
the limit of 3% CO2 feed gas was removed with the project now able to receive gas of varying qualities.

Cuba
Block 9 (MEO 100%**)
The Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for Block 9, onshore Cuba, was executed on 3 September 2015.  The Block 9
PSC area is in a proven hydrocarbon system with multiple discoveries within close proximity, including the multi-
billion barrel Varadero oil field.  It also contains the Motembo field - the first oil field discovered in Cuba.  As an
early mover  into Cuba,  MEO  is  now one of the few  western  companies with  a  footprint  in  the expanding  Cuban
hydrocarbon sector.
During  the year  MEO received  a  considerable  quantity of  historical  technical  data  for  Block  9  and  commenced  a
detailed assessment of the prospectivity of the Block.  In addition, MEO commenced reprocessing a selection of 2D
seismic data in Block 9.
Subsequent to year  end (5 July 2016), MEO announced the first of three identified oil plays on Block 9 has been
assessed to contain 8.183 billion barrels of Oil-in-Place, with a Prospective (Recoverable) Resource of 395 million
barrels (Best Estimate, 100% basis)**# of potentially high quality light oil.  Further work on the other, shallower oil
plays, which also have significant oil potential, is continuing.

New Zealand
PEP51153 (MEO 30%)
In April 2014, MEO farmed into a 30% Participating Interest in  PEP51153 onshore New Zealand in the Taranaki
Basin.    The  permit  contains  the  Puka  oil  discovery  in  the  Mount  Messenger  sands.    The  Puka-1  and  Puka-2
exploration  wells were producing oil under  a long term production  test from this formation, but were temporarily
shut-in  in  January  2015  due  to  unresolved  mechanical  problems  with  the  Puka-1  well  and  the  low  oil  price
environment.
PEP51153 also contains the Pukatea (formerly Shannon) prospect, identified on 3D seismic data at a deeper Tikorangi
level  below  the  Puka  oil  field.    Pukatea  is  updip  of  where  Douglas-1  penetrated  the  Tikorangi,  encountering  oil
shows, and is analogous to the nearby producing Waihapa oil field.
During the year, TAG Oil, a Canadian listed, Australasian focused oil and gas production and exploration company,
with  extensive  operations  and  production  infrastructure  in  the  Taranaki  Basin,  acquired  a  70%  interest  and
Operatorship of the permit.  TAG Oil holds a 100% interest in the nearby producing Cheal Oil Field, which sits in the
same Mt Messenger formation.
The Joint Venture is progressing its assessment of the prospectivity of PEP51153 and in the fourth quarter 2016 will
consider whether to proceed with drilling a high impact exploration well.

Results For The Year
The net loss of the Group for the financial year, after provision for income tax, was $10,406,105 (2015: net loss after
tax  of  $10,042,223).    The  loss  for  the  year  was  mainly  due  to  a  write-off  of  exploration  expenditure  totalling
$10,774,401 and administration costs of $1,980,008 partly offset by re-classification to the Profit and Loss Account
of a foreign currency gain previously recorded in Reserves following closure of a foreign operation ($2,264,862).
The  successful  drilling  and  commercialisation  of  any  commercial  oil  and  gas  discoveries  in  offshore  Australian
exploration  permits and  onshore overseas acreage and/or  the development/sale of the Group’s methanol  and  LNG
Projects  could  ultimately  lead  to  the  establishment  of  a  profitable  business.    While  the  Group  is  in  the
exploration/appraisal  stage  of  drilling  for  hydrocarbons  in  offshore  Australian  exploration  permits  and  overseas
acreage and in the project development phase, funding will be provided by equity capital raised from the issue of new
shares and/or farm out or joint development arrangements with other companies.
Review Of Financial Condition
At balance date the Group held cash and cash equivalents of $4,135,989 (2015: $5,785,454).  During the year  the
Group  decreased  the  cash  balance  by $1,679,570  (before  foreign  exchange  fluctuations)  with  funds  used  to  meet
exploration cash outflows of $1,577,994 and net corporate costs of $1,592,445 partly offset by a share placement of
$1,372,992 (net of costs) and interest received of $117,877.
Share Issues
During the year the Company raised a total of $1,407,166, before transaction costs of $34,174, from the placement of
140,716,573 shares at $0.01 per share from a Share Placement to Leni Gas Cuba Limited.
Corporate
During the year MEO undertook a renewal of the Board, with the appointment of Mr Andrew Purcell and Mr Michael
Sandy as non-executive directors on 30 July 2015 and the retirement of Mr Greg Short and Mr Stephen Hopley in
November 2015.
MEO’s  future  prospects  are  centred  on  continuing  to  secure  quality  exploration,  development  and  producing
opportunities and seeking to maximise the value to shareholders of its current portfolio including the Tassie Shoals
projects and/or undertaking a corporate transaction.
Adequacy of funding will,  for  the immediate future, remain a key focus for  the Group and its Shareholders.  The
Group will look to raise additional funding either through farm-in/sale and/or capital injection to advance its projects.
In the event that the Group cannot meet its share of work program commitments, permits may need to be surrendered.
On 29 February 2016 the Company announced it had executed a Private Placement Agreement with  London listed
Leni Gas Cuba Limited raising $1,407,166, with funds to be used to advance MEO’s exploration program in Block 9
onshore Cuba.  Under the placement agreement, MEO issued 140,716,573 shares to Leni Gas Cuba at A$0.01 per
share.  The placement of shares to Leni Gas Cuba falls within MEO’s placement capacity and Leni Gas Cuba is now
MEO’s single largest shareholder with a 15.8% interest in the Company.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
Total equity decreased to $5,603,741 from $16,715,234, a decrease of $11,111,493.  The movement was mainly due
to the net loss of $10,406,105.
7.  LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS
During  FY2017,  MEO  will  continue  with  farmout/partial  sale  opportunities  and  pursue  attractive  new  venture
opportunities.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE DATE
On 18 August 2016 MEO announced it had raised approximately $1.69 million through a placement of approximately
46.9  million  shares  at  $0.036  per  share  to  qualified  institutional  and  sophisticated  investors  (“Placement”).    The
company also provided the opportunity for eligible shareholders to acquire new shares at the same discounted share
price as under the Placement of $0.036 per share via a non-underwritten share purchase plan (“SPP”).  The SPP closes
on  16  September  2016.    Funds  from  the  share  placement  and  SPP  will  be  used  to  accelerate  MEO’s  onshore
exploration activities on Block 9 in Cuba, including the preparation of a drilling program for up to two wells in Block
9 and for additional working capital purposes.
Other than  the above, there has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this
report any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the directors of the
Company, to affect significantly the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or state of affairs of the
Group, in future financial years.
9.  BUSINESS STRATEGY AND PROSPECTS
MEO’s business strategy is to create shareholder value by successful exploration, development and production of oil
and  gas.    Key  elements  of  this  strategy  include  securing  a  portfolio  of  attractive  upstream  oil  and  gas  growth
opportunities and seek to underpin this growth portfolio with a moderate production base.
Future Prospects
MEO’s  future  prospects  are  centred  on  continuing  to  secure  quality  exploration,  development  and  producing
opportunities and seeking to maximise the value to shareholders of its current portfolio including the Tassie Shoals
projects.
Business Risks
Oil and gas exploration and appraisal involves significant risk.  The future profitability of MEO and the value of
MEO’s shares are directly related to the results of exploration  and appraisal activities.   There are inherent risks in
these activities.  No assurances can be given that funds spent on exploration and appraisal will result in discoveries
that  will  be  commercially  viable.    Future  exploration  and  appraisal  activities,  including  drilling  and  seismic
acquisition, may result in changes in current prospectivity perceptions of individual prospects, leads and permits.  It
may even lead to a relinquishment of the permit, or a portion of the permit.
Oil and gas drilling activities are subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond MEO’s control.   Drilling
activities may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of weather conditions, mechanical difficulties, availability
of the necessary technical equipment and appropriately skilled and experienced technicians.  Drilling may result in
wells that, whilst encountering oil and gas, may not achieve commercially viable results.
Industry  operating  risks  include  fire,  explosions,  blow  outs,  pipe  failures,  abnormally  pressured  formations  and
environmental hazards such as accidental spills or leakage of petroleum liquids, gas leaks, ruptures, or discharge of
toxic gases.  The occurrence of any of these risks could result in substantial losses to MEO due to injury or loss of
life; damage to or destruction of property, natural resources, or equipment; pollution or other environmental damage;
clean-up responsibilities; regulatory investigation and penalties or suspension of operations.  Damages occurring to
third parties as a result of such risks may give rise to claims against MEO.
Permits in which MEO has an interest are subject to compulsory work or expenditure obligations for each permit year
which must be met in order to keep the permit in good standing.  It is possible for these commitments to be varied by
deferment and combination with later year requirements on application of the holders but any such variation is at the
discretion of the relevant Minister administering the relevant legislation and regulatory authorities in Australia and
foreign jurisdictions.  If no variation is approved by the relevant Minister then a failure to meet compulsory obligation
could lead to forfeiture of the permit.

9.  BUSINESS STRATEGY AND PROSPECTS (cont)
MEO,  in  order  to  meet  future  ongoing  work  programs,  may consider  raising  additional  capital.    There  can  be  no
assurance that sufficient funding will be available to MEO on favourable terms or at all.  If MEO is unable to raise
necessary finance, there may be a reduction in planned exploration expenditure which could have a material adverse
effect on MEO's business, financial condition and operations.  Any additional equity financing may dilute existing
shareholdings.
MEO  is  also  exposed  to  a  range  of  market,  financial,  cultural  and  governance  risks.    The  Company  has  risk
management and internal control systems to manage material business risks which include insurance coverage over
major  operational  activities  and  regular  review  of  material  business  risks  by  the  Audit  &  Risk  Management
Committee.
10.  SHARE OPTIONS AND SHARE PERFORMANCE RIGHTS
Options and Share Performance Rights granted to directors and executives of the Company
During  the  financial  year,  and  after  receiving  shareholder  approval,  the  company  granted  5,333,333  Exercisable

the Performance Rights.
In February 2016, revised remuneration arrangements were announced for  senior  staff as part of the cost reduction
initiatives.  Senior staff members have voluntarily agreed to a 20% reduction in the cash component of their annual
remuneration packages in exchange for Exercisable Performance Rights.  20,940,032 Exercisable Performance Rights
were granted, of which 10,550,131 Rights were granted to Key Management Personnel.  There is no price payable on

In addition to the formally constituted Board of Directors meetings set out above, Directors held a number of informal

2015 until the Annual General Meeting held in November 2015.
14.  AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
On  18  June  2015,  the  Board  granted  approval  under  section  324DAA  of  the  Corporation  Act  2001  and  the
Corporations  Legislation Amendment  (Audit  Enhancement)  Act  2012  for  Mr  Matthew  Honey  to  continue,  as  lead
auditor, to play a significant role in the audit of the Company for one additional financial year, being the financial
year ending 30 June 2016.
The reasons why the Board approved the extension include:
- Mr Honey, the Lead Audit Partner, has a detailed understanding of the Group’s business and strategies, its systems
and controls.
- The Audit & Risk Committee was satisfied with the quality of EY and Mr Honey’s work as auditor.
-  At  the  time  of  the  proposed  audit  partner  rotation,  the  Group  was  pursuing  a  number  of  concurrent  strategies,
including the proposed merger with Neon Energy Limited and entry into the Cuba Block 9 area of interest, and the
Board were of the view that the Group would be well served by continuity of the audit partner through this process.
- The existing independence and service metrics in place with EY and Mr Honey are sufficient to ensure that auditor
independence would not be diminished in any way by such an extension.
-  Mr  Honey  will  continue  to  abide  by  the  independence  guidance  provided  in  APES  110  ‘Code  of  Ethics  for
Professional  Accountants’  as  issued  by  the  Accounting  Professional  and  Ethical  Standards  Board  and  EY’s  own
independence requirements.
The directors have received the independence declaration from the auditor, Ernst & Young, set out on page 14.

14.  AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES (cont)
Non Audit Services
The following non-audit services were provided by the entity’s auditor, Ernst & Young.  The Directors are satisfied
that the provision of non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed
by  the Corporations  Act  2001.    The  nature  and  scope  of  each  non-audit  service  provided  means  that  auditor
independence was not compromised.  Tax services ($4,471) were provided by Ernst & Young during the year.
Notes regarding Contingent and Prospective resource estimates
1. The  estimated  quantities  of  petroleum  that  may  potentially  be  recovered  by  the  application  of  a  future
development project(s) relate to undiscovered accumulations.  These estimates have both an associated risk of
discovery and a risk of development.  Further exploration appraisal and evaluation is required to determine the
existence of a significant quantity of potentially moveable hydrocarbons.
2. The assessments are based on, and fairly represent, information and supporting documentation prepared by Mr
Peter Stickland, MEO’s Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, who is an employee of the company and
has  more  than  25  years  of  relevant  experience.    Mr.  Stickland  is  a  member  of  the  European  Association  of
Geoscientists and Engineers and the Petroleum Exploration Society of Australia.  Mr Stickland consents to the
publication of the resource assessments contained herein.
3. Total Liquids = oil + condensate
4. 6 Bcf gas equals 1 MMboe; 1 MMbbl condensate equals 1 MMboe
5. MEO share can be derived by  pro-rating the  resource  ranges described in the tables above by its percentage

Remuneration and nomination committee
The  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  is  responsible  for
determining and reviewing compensation arrangements for the directors, including the Managing Director and Chief
Executive Officer and making recommendations to the Board.
It is important that the Board maintains independence from management when making decisions affecting executive
remuneration,  particularly  in  respect  of  the  Managing  Director  and  Chief  Executive  Officer.    Accordingly,  the
Company’s  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  is  comprised  solely  of  non-executive  directors  and  has  an
independent chair.  The Committee can have access to external advisors on a ‘case by case’ basis.

2. Remuneration Strategy and Board oversight of remuneration (cont)
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of remuneration
on  a periodic basis by reference to relevant employment market conditions with  the overall objective of ensuring
maximum  stakeholder  benefit  from  the  retention  of  high  quality directors  and  the  Managing  Director  and  Chief
Executive Officer.
Further details regarding the role, responsibilities and composition of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee
are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on the company’s website.
Remuneration approval process
The  Board  approves  the  remuneration  arrangements  of  the  Managing  Director  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and
awards under short term and long term incentive arrangements following recommendations from the Remuneration
and Nomination Committee.  The Board also sets the remuneration of non-executive directors which is within the
aggregate amount approved by shareholders.
The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer approves the annual extension of consultants’ contracts and their
consulting fees  and  will make recommendations  to the  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  for  granting  of
awards to executives and contractors under the short term and long term incentive arrangements.
Remuneration consultants and external advisors
The Corporations Act sets out a detailed regime in relation to the engagement of external remuneration consultants to
ensure  that  remuneration  consultants  are  free  from  undue  influence  by  any  member  of  the  KMP  to  whom  a
‘remuneration  recommendation’  relates,  and  requires  that  certain  information  be  disclosed  in  the  Remuneration
Report where a remuneration recommendation has been provided.  During the reporting period, the Company did not
receive a ‘remuneration recommendation’ in relation to the quantum or elements of the remuneration packages of the
Company’s KMP within the meaning of the Corporations Act.
Remuneration strategy
The performance of the Company depends upon the quality of its directors and executives.  To prosper, the Company
must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled directors and executives.
To this end, the Company embodies the following principles in its remuneration framework:
• Offer competitive remuneration benchmarked against the external market to attract high calibre executives;
• Where appropriate, provide executive rewards linked to shareholder value; and
• Encourage non-executive directors to hold shares in the Company.
Remuneration structure
In  accordance  with  best  practice  corporate  governance,  the  structure  of  non-executive  director  remuneration  and
executive  remuneration  is  separate  and  distinct.    Further  details  regarding  the  structure  of  non-executive  director
remuneration and executive remuneration (including the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer) are set out
in sections 3 and 4.

Changes in Remuneration – 2015 - 2016
Following  the  significant  changes  in  the  size  of  the  organisation  during  FY2015  in  response  to  the  company’s
financial position, the Board implemented further remuneration changes during FY2016 as follows:-
(i)
(ii)
In  November  2015,  after  receiving  shareholder  approval,  the  company  granted  5,333,333  Exercisable
Performance  Rights  to  the  Managing  Director  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Mr  Peter  Stickland  under  the
Company’s  Long  Term  incentive  Plan  in  return  for  reducing  the  cash  component  of  Mr  Stickland’s  annual
remuneration from $400,000 to $320,000 per annum for the period 1 December 2015 to 30 November 2016.
In February 2016, the company revised the remuneration arrangements for senior staff.  Senior staff members
voluntarily agreed to a 20% reduction in the cash component of their annual remuneration packages in exchange
for Exercisable Performance Rights.  20,940,032 Exercisable Performance Rights were granted to senior staff, of
which 10,550,131 Rights were granted to Key Management Personnel.
(iii) Following a review of fees paid/payable to the Chairman of peer companies, effective 1st December 2015, the
annual  fee  payable  to  the  Chairman  was  increased  from  $50,000  (inclusive  of  superannuation)  to  $75,000
(inclusive of superannuation).
As a result of the above changes, remuneration to Key Management Personnel decreased by 37% or $650,325 from
$1,738,059  in  FY2015  (excluding  the  impact  of  termination  payments  in  FY2015  of $643,390) to  $1,087,734  in
FY2016.
3.  Non-executive director remuneration arrangements
Remuneration policy and structure
The Board seeks to set remuneration  at a level  which  provides the Company with  the ability to attract and retain
directors of high calibre, at a cost which is acceptable to shareholders.
The amount of aggregate remuneration approved by shareholders and the fee structure is reviewed annually by the
Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  against  fees  paid  to non-executive  directors  of comparable  companies.
The  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  receives  independent  market  data  when  undertaking  this  annual
review process.
The  Chairman,  Mr  Andrew  Purcell  and  non-executive  director,  Mr  Michael  Sandy  have  been  engaged  by  the
Company under consulting contracts.  Under such agreements current at the date of this report, there are no annual,
long service leave, other termination entitlements or retirement benefits.
The Constitution and ASX Listing Rules specify that the aggregate remuneration of non-executive directors shall be
determined from time to time by members in a general meeting.  An amount not exceeding the amount determined is
then  divided  between  the  directors  as  agreed.    At  the  Annual  General  Meeting  held  on  18  November  2010
shareholders approved an increase in the aggregate annual remuneration to $500,000 per  year, with effect  from the
financial year commencing 1 July 2010.

3.  Non-executive director remuneration arrangements (cont)
Non-executive directors are encouraged by the Board to hold shares in the Company.  Shares are purchased on market
at the prevailing market share price.
During FY2016, 2.7 million options previously granted under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTI) to ex-
non-executive  directors  lapsed.    There  are  currently  no  options  or  performance  rights  granted  to  non-executive
directors.  Directors may consider the granting of options or performance rights in the future, subject to shareholder
approval at a General Meeting.
During the year, no additional remuneration was paid to Directors for service on Board committees.
In addition, Directors are entitled to be paid all travelling and other expenses they incur in attending to the Company’s
affairs, including attending and returning from general meetings of the Company or meetings of the Directors or of
Committees of the Directors.
The remuneration of non-executive directors for the year ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015 is detailed in Table 1
and Table 2 of this report.
4.  Executive remuneration arrangements
The Company aims to reward executives with a level and mix of remuneration commensurate with their position and
responsibilities within the Company and so as to:
•
•
•
ensure total remuneration is competitive by market standards;
reward executives for exceptional individual performance; and
align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
Remuneration mix
The Company’s executive remuneration  is structured as a mix of fixed annual remuneration and  variable ‘at risk’
remuneration.  The mix of these components varies for different management levels.

Variable Remuneration – Short Term Incentives
MEO does not have a formal Short Term Incentive Program, however the Company does, when applicable, recognise
exceptional individual performances in any financial year through the award of a cash bonus.  There were no short
term incentives awarded in the financial year.
Variable Remuneration – Long Term Incentives
MEO  considers  the  retention  of  high  calibre  staff  as  essential  to  the  growth  of  the  Company.    Therefore  as  an
incentive to recruit high calibre individuals to MEO or retain high calibre staff the Board will grant LTI Securities
(which may be in the form of share options and/or performance rights) under the Company’s Long Term Incentive
Plan (LTI Plan).
Overview of the LTI Plan
The  LTI  Plan  was  adopted  by  the  Board  on  13  September  2011.    Under  the  Plan,  the  Board  may  invite  Eligible
Executives (being an employee of the MEO Group (including a director employed in an executive capacity) or any
other  person  who  is  declared  by  the  Board  to  be  eligible  to  receive  a  grant  of  LTI  Securities  under  the  Plan)  to
participate in a grant of LTI Securities, which may comprise of performance rights and/or options.  Offers will be
made on the terms set out in the Plan and on any additional terms as the Board determines.
Options  and/or  performance  rights  granted  under  the  Plan  will  only  vest,  and  in  the  case  of  options,  become
exercisable,  where  any performance  condition  and  any other  relevant  conditions  advised  to  the  participant  by the
Board have been satisfied.
On vesting of a performance right or following the exercise of an option (as the case may be), the Board will allocate
the number of shares in respect of which the performance right have vested, or the options have been exercised.  Any
shares issued under the Plan will rank equally in all respects with other shares on issue at that time (except as regards
any rights attaching to such shares by reference to a record date prior to the date of their issue).
In  the  event  of  a  takeover,  a  scheme  of  arrangement,  other  reconstruction  or  amalgamation  of  the  Company,  a
winding up of the Company or other event which is likely to result in a change of control of the Company, the Board
may, in its absolute discretion, determine that all or a specified number of a participant’s unvested performance rights
and/or  options vest, having regard to all relevant circumstances,  including  whether  performance is in  line with  any
applicable performance condition over the period from the date of grant to the relevant event, and the portion of any

In accordance with the terms of the Plan, prior to the allocation of shares to a participant upon vesting of performance
rights or exercise of options (as the case may be), the Board may make any adjustments it considers appropriate to the
terms of a performance right and/or option granted to a participant in order to minimise or eliminate any material
advantage  or  disadvantage  to  a  participant  resulting  from  a  corporate  action  or  capital  reconstruction.    Without
limiting the foregoing, if:
shares are issued pro rata to the Company’s shareholders generally by way of a bonus issue (other than an
issue in  lieu  of dividends or  by way of a  dividend reimbursement) involving  capitalisation  of reserves  of
distributable profits;
shares are issued pro rata to the Company’s shareholders generally by way of a rights issue; or
any  reorganisation  (including  consolidated,  subdivision,  reduction  or  return)  of  the  issued  capital  of  the
Company is effected,
(cid:127)
(cid:127) 
(cid:127)
(cid:127) 
(cid:127)
then the Board may, in its discretion, adjust:
(cid:127) 
(cid:127)
the number of performance rights or options to which each participant is entitled;
the number of shares to which each participant is entitled upon vesting of performance rights or exercise of
options;
any amount payable on vesting of the performance rights or exercise of options; or
where appropriate, a combination of the above, in the manner determined by the Board, having regard to the
ASX Listing Rules and the general principle set out above.  Where additional performance rights or options
are  granted  to  a  participant,  such  performance  rights  or  options  will  be  subject  to  the  same  terms  and
conditions  as  the  original  performance  rights  or  options  granted  to  the  participant  (including  any
performance conditions) unless the Board determines otherwise.
Grants made during FY2016
During  the  financial  year,  after  receiving  shareholder  approval,  the  company  granted  5,333,333  Exercisable
Performance Rights to the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Peter Stickland under the Company’s
Long Term incentive Plan.  The vesting date for the Exercisable Performance Rights is 30 November 2016 and expiry

continuous service ending 29 November 2016.  There is no price payable on exercising the Exercisable Performance
Rights.
On 4 February 2016, the company implemented revised remuneration arrangements with its senior staff as part of the
Company’s  ongoing  cost  reduction  initiatives.    Senior  staff  voluntarily  agreed  to  a  20%  reduction  in  the  cash
component  of  their  annual  remuneration  packages  in  exchange  for  Exercisable  Performance  Rights.    20,940,032
Exercisable Performance Rights were granted including 10,550,131 to key management personnel.  The vesting date
for the Exercisable Performance Rights is 31 January 2017 and expiry date on 31 January 2019.  The Exercisable
Performance Rights vest and become exercisable after 12 months continuous service ending 31 January 2017.  There

Consultants
The  Managing  Director  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  approves  the  terms  and  conditions  of  consultant’s  contracts
including fees, taking into account market conditions for the services that are provided.  Consultant contracts do not
include any guaranteed fee increases.
Hedging of equity awards
The  Company prohibits executives  from  entering  into  arrangements  to  protect  the  value  of invested  share  options.
The  prohibition  includes  entering  into  contracts  to  hedge  their  exposure  to  options  awarded  as  part  of  their
remuneration package.

Executive contractual arrangements
The remuneration arrangements and other  terms of employment  for  Key Management  Personnel are formalised  in
employment agreements.  The material terms of the KMP employment agreements are set out below.
(cid:127)  Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Remuneration
On 1 December 2015, the Company entered into an executive agreement with Mr Peter Stickland.  Mr Stickland had
previously signed a one-year fixed term contract on 19th December 2014.  The new executive agreement contains the
following major key terms:-
- Remuneration:  Total  Fixed  Remuneration  is  set at  $400,000  (including compulsory superannuation)  which  is
reviewed on an annual basis.  As approved by shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting, 20% of the Total
Fixed Remuneration (i.e. $80,000) was granted as Exercisable Performance Rights, thus reducing the cash component
of annual remuneration from $400,000 to $320,000 per annum for the period 1 December 2015 to 30 November 2016.
- Term: From 1 December 2015 until either the Company or Mr Stickland terminates the Agreement
- Notice: The Company and Mr Stickland may terminate the Agreement at any time by giving 3 Months’ notice in
writing.
-  Payments on Termination: If the Executive’s employment is terminated by reason of Fundamental Change or by
the Company for other reasons, the Company must pay the Executive a lump sum amount (Separation Amount) up to
the Total Fixed Remuneration for the 6 months immediately preceding the Termination Date.
(cid:127)  Other Executives
All executives have standard employment contracts.  Each executive is employed until such time as the Company or
the executive terminate by giving notice.   The Company may terminate the executive’s  employment agreement by
providing written notice (ranging from 4 weeks’ notice to 3 months’ notice) or providing payment in lieu of the notice
period  (based  on  the  fixed  component  of the  executive’s  remuneration).    The  executive  may terminate  by giving
notice under the employment contract, ranging from 4 weeks’ notice to 2 months’ notice.  On termination of notice by
the Company or the executive, any options that have vested or that will vest during the notice period will be released.
Options that have not vested will be forfeited.  The Company may terminate the contract at any time without notice if
serious misconduct has occurred.  Where termination with cause occurs the executive is only entitled to that portion
of remuneration that is fixed, and only up to the date of termination.  On termination with cause any unvested options
will immediately be forfeited.

The remuneration of MEO executives and contractors is not formally linked to financial performance measures of the
Company.  However, as explained on pages 18 and 19, executives are strongly incentivised to maximise shareholder
wealth because of the fact that the exercise price of the options granted to executives, should they vest, is higher than
the market price on the grant date.  In accordance the Section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 the following table
summarises MEO’s performance over a five year period:

(c)    Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 30 June
2016.  Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
investee  and  has  the  ability  to  affect  those  returns  through  its  power  over  the  investee.    Specifically,  the  Group
controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
• Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the
investee)
• Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and
• The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
When  the  Group  has  less  than  a  majority  of  the  voting  or  similar  rights  of  an  investee,  the  Group  considers  all
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
• The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee
• Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
• The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont)
(c)    Basis of consolidation (cont)
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes
to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control
over  the  subsidiary  and  ceases  when  the  Group  loses  control  of  the  subsidiary.    Assets,  liabilities,  income  and
expenses  of a  subsidiary acquired  or  disposed  of during  the  year  are  included  in  the  statement  of comprehensive
income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the
parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a
deficit  balance.    When  necessary,  adjustments  are  made  to  the  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  to  bring  their
accounting  policies  into  line  with  the  Group’s  accounting  policies.    All  intra-group  assets  and  liabilities,  equity,
income,  expenses and cash  flows relating to transactions between  members of the Group are eliminated in  full on
consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
• De-recognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary
• De-recognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests
• De-recognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity
• Recognises the fair value of the consideration received
• Recognises the fair value of any investment retained
• Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
• Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings,
as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities
(d)    Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The  carrying  amounts  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities  are  often  determined  based  on  judgements,  estimates  and
assumptions of future events.  The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period are:
Share-based payment transactions
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity
instruments at the date at which they are granted.  The fair value of share options is determined using a binomial
option pricing model, and using the assumptions detailed in note 19.
Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation  costs are accumulated separately for  each  area of interest  and carried forward provided
that one of the following conditions is met:
•
•
such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development or sale; or
exploration activities have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the
existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in relation to
the area are continuing.
Significant judgement is required in  determining whether it is likely that future economic benefits will be derived
from  the  capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure.    In  the  judgement  of the  Directors,  at  30  June  2016
exploration activities in each area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of
the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves.  Active and significant operations in relation to each
area  of interest are continuing  and nothing has come to the attention  of the Directors to indicate future economic
benefits  will  not  be  achieved.    The  Directors  are  continually  monitoring  the  areas  of  interest  and  are  exploring
alternatives for funding the development of areas of interest when economically recoverable reserves are confirmed.
If new information becomes available that suggests the recovery of expenditure is unlikely, the amounts capitalised
will need to be reassessed at that time.

(d)   Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (cont)
Going concern
The  Group  is  involved  in  the  exploration  and  evaluation  of  oil  and  gas  tenements.    Further  expenditure  will  be
required on these tenements to ascertain whether they contain economically recoverable reserves.
As at 30 June 2016 the Group had cash reserves of $4,135,989.  The cash reserves are expected to meet the Group’s
planned exploration activities for the 12 months from the date of this report. To meet its funding requirements the
Group will rely on taking appropriate steps, including:
(cid:127)
(cid:127)
(cid:127)
(cid:127)
Meeting its additional obligations by either farm-out or partial sale of the Group’s exploration interests;
Raising capital by one of a combination of the following: placement of shares, pro-rata issue to shareholders,
the exercise of outstanding share options, and/or further issue of shares to the public;
In some circumstances, subject to negotiation and approval, minimum work requirements may be varied or
suspended, and/or permits may be surrendered or cancelled; or
Other avenues that may be available to the Group.
The financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the continuity of normal business
activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.  No adjustments
have  been  made relating  to  the  recoverability and  reclassification  of  recorded  asset  amounts  and  classification  of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Group not continue as a going concern, particularly the write-down of
capitalised exploration expenditure should the exploration permits be ultimately surrendered or cancelled.
Having carefully assessed the potential uncertainties relating to the Group’s ability to effectively fund exploration
activities and operating expenditures, the Directors believe that the Group will continue to operate as a going concern
for  the foreseeable future.  Therefore,  the Directors consider  it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on  a
going concern basis.
(e)      Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner which is materially consistent with the internal reporting provided to the
chief operating decision maker.  The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
(f)      Foreign currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is also the parent company’s
functional  currency.    Each  entity  in  the  Group  determines  its  own  functional  currency  and  items  included  in  the
financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Transactions in  foreign  currencies are initially recorded  in  the functional  currency by applying  the exchange rates
ruling at the date of the transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated
at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance date.  All exchange differences in the consolidated report are taken to
profit or loss.
(iii) Group companies
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of foreign  operations are translated into Australian dollars at the rate of
exchange  prevailing  at  the  reporting  date.    The  exchange  differences  arising  on  translation  for  consolidation  are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

(g)    Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand and
short-term  deposits that  are readily convertible to a  known  amount  of cash  and  used  for  meeting  short  term  cash
needs.
For  the  purpose  of  the  consolidated  statement  of  cash  flows,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  and  cash
equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
(h)  Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its risks associated with
foreign currency fluctuations.  Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date
on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to fair value.  Certain derivatives do
not qualify for hedge accounting and changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss in other
revenues and expenses.  Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their
fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from the changes in the fair value of derivatives, except those that qualify as cash flow
hedges are taken directly to profit or loss for the year.
The  fair  values  of  forward  currency  contracts  are  calculated  by  reference  to  current  forward  exchange  rates  for
contracts with similar maturity profiles.
(i)
Investment and other financial assets
Investments and financial assets in the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are
categorised  as  either  financial  assets  at  fair  value through  profit  and  loss,  loans  and receivables,  held-to-maturity
investments,  or  available-for-sale  financial  assets.    The  classification  depends  on  the  purpose  for  which  the
investments were acquired or originated.  Designation is re-evaluated at each reporting date, but there are restrictions
on reclassifying to other categories.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of assets not at fair
value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Available-for-sale (AFS) financial investments
AFS financial investments include equity investments and debt securities.  Equity investments classified as AFS are
those that are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss.  Debt securities
in this category are those that are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time and that may be sold in response
to needs for liquidity or in response to changes in the market conditions.
After initial measurement, AFS financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealised gains or
losses recognised as Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and credited in the AFS reserve until the investment is de-
recognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in other operating income, or the investment is
determined to be impaired, when the cumulative loss is reclassified from the AFS reserve to the statement of profit or
loss.
The  Group  evaluates  whether  the  ability  and  intention  to  sell  its  AFS  financial  assets  in  the  near  term  is  still
appropriate.  When, in rare circumstances, the Group is unable to trade these financial assets due to inactive markets,
the Group may elect to reclassify these financial assets if management has the ability and intention to hold the assets
for the foreseeable future or until maturity.

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont)
(i)
Investment and other financial assets (cont)
(i) Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses,  at each reporting  date, whether there is objective evidence that a  financial asset  or a group of
financial assets is impaired.  An impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial recognition
of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the
group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.  Evidence of impairment may include indications that the
debtors  or  a  group  of  debtors  is  experiencing  significant  financial  difficulty,  default  or  delinquency in  interest  or
principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and observable
data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or
economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
(j)
Plant and equipment
Plant  and  equipment  is  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  any  impairment  losses.  Depreciation  is
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from 3 to 15 years.
Impairment
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For  an asset  that does not generate largely independent cash inflows,  the recoverable amount is determined for  the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its
estimated recoverable amount.  The asset is written down to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of plant and equipment is the greater of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.  In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
An item of plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to
arise from the continued use of the asset.  Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the
difference between  the net  disposal  proceeds  and the carrying amount  of the item)  is included in  the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income in the period the item is derecognised.
(k)  Methanol and LNG project costs
Research and feasibility costs are expensed as incurred.  Development expenditure incurred on a  project  is carried
forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be
carried  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  amortisation  and  accumulated  impairment  losses.    Any  expenditure  carried
forward is amortised over the period of expected future revenue from the related project.
The carrying value of development costs is reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is not yet in use, or more
frequently when an indicator of impairment arises during the reporting year indicating that the carrying value may not
be recoverable.
(l)
Exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is carried at cost.  If indication of impairment arises, the recoverable amount
is estimated and an impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying
amount.

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont)
(l)
Exploration and evaluation costs (cont)
Exploration  and  evaluation  costs  are  accumulated  separately  for  each  current  area  of  interest  and  carried  forward
provided that one of the following conditions is met:
•
•
such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development or sale; or
exploration activities have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the
existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in relation to
the area are continuing.
Impairment of exploration and evaluation costs
To the extent that capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is determined not to be recoverable in the future,
profits/(losses) and net assets will be varied in the period in which this determination is made.
Farm-outs
The Group will account for farm-out arrangements as follows:
•
•
The Group will not record any expenditure made by the farminee on its behalf;
The Group will not recognise a gain or loss on the farm-out arrangement but rather will redesignate any costs
previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained; and
• Any cash consideration to be received will be credited against costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole
interest with any excess to be accounted for by the Group as gain on disposal.
(m)    Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment
losses.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an
indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.  The amortisation period and method for an intangible asset with
a finite useful life is reviewed at least annually.  Changes in the expected useful life are accounted for by changing the
amortisation period or method, which is a change in an accounting estimate.  Amortisation expense is recognised in
profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
(n)  Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market.  They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after
the balance date which are classified as non-current assets.  Loans and receivables are included in receivables in the
consolidated statement of financial position.
Recognition and derecognition
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group commits to
purchase or sell the asset.
Subsequent measurement
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Impairment
The  Group  assesses  at  each  balance  date  whether  there  is  objective  evidence  that  a  financial  asset  or  group  of
financial assets is impaired.

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont)
(o)
Interests in joint arrangements
Joint operations
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to
assets, and obligations for the liabilities of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractual agreed sharing of
control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent
of the parties sharing control.
The Group accounts for its share of the joint operation assets, and liabilities it has incurred, its share of any liabilities
jointly incurred with other ventures, income from the sale or use of its share of the joint operation’s output, together
with its share of the expenses incurred by the joint operation, and any expenses it incurs in relation to its interest in
the joint operation.
(p)    Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and
requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use a specific asset or assets
and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Leases under which the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified
as operating leases.  Operating lease payments are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(q)  Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the
Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obliged to make future
payments in respect of the purchase of the goods and services.
(r)      Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event,
and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the
reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.  The expense
relating  to  any  provision  is  presented  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  comprehensive  income  net  of  any
reimbursement.
Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
present obligation at the balance date.  If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.  The increase in the provision resulting from
the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.
Employee leave benefits
Short term benefits
Liabilities for wage and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and certain annual leave entitlements expected to
be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in provisions in respect of employees’ service up to
the reporting date.  They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.  Liabilities
for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.

NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont)
(r)      Provisions (cont)
Long term benefits
The liability for long service leave and certain annual benefits are recognised in the provision for employee benefits
and  measured  as  the  present  value  of  expected  future  payments  to  be  made  in  respect  of  services  provided  by
employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method.  Consideration is given to expected future
wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of service.  Expected future payments are
discounted  using  market  yields  at  the  reporting  date  in  high  quality  corporate  bonds  with  terms  to  maturity and
currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
(s)    Share-based payment transactions
The Group provides benefits to employees (including directors) of, and consultants to, the Group in the form of share-
based  payment  transactions,  whereby  services  are rendered  in  exchange  for  shares  or  rights  over  shares  (‘equity-
settled transactions’).  The Board adopted the Long Term Incentive Plan on 13 September 2011.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The  fair  value  of  options  and  performance  rights  with  market  based  performance  criteria  is  determined  using  a
binomial option pricing model.  The fair value of performance plan rights with non-market performance criteria is
determined by reference to the Company’s share price at date of grant.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period
in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the recipient becomes fully entitled to
the award (‘vesting date’).
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects (i)
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors,
based on the best available information at balance date, will ultimately vest.  No adjustment is made for the likelihood
of market conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in determination of fair value at grant
date.    The  charge  or  credit  for  the  period  represents  the  movement  in  cumulative  expense  recognised  as  at  the
beginning and end of the period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon
a market condition.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had
not been modified.  In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of
the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense
not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.  However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled
award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new award are treated
as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The  dilutive  effect,  if  any,  of  outstanding  options  is  reflected  as  additional  share  dilution  in  the  computation  of
earnings per share.
(t)    Contributed equity
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

(u)    Revenue
Revenue is recognised  to the extent  that  it  is probable that  the economic benefits  will  flow to the Group and  the
revenue can be reliably measured.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.
(v)
Income tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered
from or  paid to the taxation authorities.  The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are
enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred  income tax  is provided  on  all  temporary differences at  balance date between  the tax  bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
•
•
where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor
taxable profit or loss; or
when the taxable temporary difference is associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates or interests in
joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable
that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible
temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be used, except:
•
•
where  the  deferred  income  tax  asset  relating  to  the  deductible  temporary difference  arises  from  the  initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
when  the  deductible  temporary  differences  is  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  or
interests in joint ventures, in which case a deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is probable
that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary differences can be applied.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset
to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it
is has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance date.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right of set off exists to set off
current tax assets against current liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxable authority.
Income  taxes  relating  to  items  recognised  directly in  equity  are  recognised  in  equity and  not  in  the  consolidated
statement of comprehensive income.

Tax consolidation legislation
MEO Australia Limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries have implemented the tax consolidation legislation as of 1
July 2004.
The head entity, MEO Australia Limited and the controlled entities in the tax consolidated group continue to account
for their own current and deferred tax amounts.  The Group has applied the group allocation approach in determining
the appropriate amount of current tax and deferred taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group.
In  addition  to  its  own  current  and  deferred  tax  amounts,  MEO  Australia  Limited  also  recognises  the  current  tax
liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from
controlled entities in the tax consolidated group.
Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts
receivable from or payable to other entities in the group.
Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement are
recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from) wholly owned tax consolidated entities.
(w)    Goods and services tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of GST, except receivables and payables which are stated with GST
included.  Where GST incurred on a purchase of goods or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, the
GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or
payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis and the GST component of
cash  flows  arising  from  investing  and  financing  activities,  which  is recoverable from,  or  payable to,  the taxation
authority is classified as operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation
authority.
(x)    Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit/(loss) attributable to members divided by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as net profit/(loss) attributable to members divided by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Parent entity financial information
The financial information for the parent entity, MEO Australia Limited, disclosed in note 22 has been prepared on the

Tax losses
At balance date, the Group has estimated unused gross tax losses of $158.4 million (2015: $159.2 million) that are
available to offset against future taxable profits subject to continuing to meet relevant statutory tests.  To the extent
that it does not offset a net deferred tax liability, a deferred tax asset has not been recognised in the accounts for these
unused losses because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available to use against such losses.
NOTE 6  EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic earnings/(loss) per share amounts are calculated by dividing net loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity
holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted  earnings/(loss)  per  share  amounts  are  calculated  by  dividing  the  net  loss  attributable  to  ordinary  equity
holders  of  the  parent  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares  outstanding  during  the  year  plus  the
weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares  that  would  be  issued  on  the  conversion  of  all  the  dilutive  potential
ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The following data was used in the calculations of basic and diluted loss per share:

Significant judgement is required in  determining whether it is likely that future economic benefits will be derived
from  capitalised  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure.    In  the  judgement  of  the  Directors,  at  30  June  2016
exploration  activities in  each  area of interest,  where costs  are carried forward, have not  yet reached a  stage which
permits  a  reasonable  assessment  of  the  existence  or  otherwise  of  economically recoverable  reserves.    Active  and
significant operations in relation to each area of interest are continuing and nothing has come to the attention of the
Directors to indicate future economic benefits will not be achieved.  The Directors are continually monitoring the
areas of interest and are exploring alternatives for funding the development of areas of interest when economically
recoverable reserves are confirmed.
The exploration  write-off  for  the financial  year  is  $3,151,435,  which  is  mainly due to the write-off  of $2,236,280
relating to WA-454-P and the write-off of $679,381 relating to WA-488-P.
In addition, a write-down of $7,622,966 relating to AC/P50 and AC/P51 was recognised during the financial year.
The write-down is as a result of the execution of the agreement with Rouge Rock which grants Rouge Rock an option
to acquire a 45% interest in each permit in exchange for  funding the remaining primary statutory work program for
each permit.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation costs at 30 June 2016 are $1,764,514 (June 2015: $10,856,110) which relate to
the following:-

(a)
Terms and Condition of Ordinary Shares
Ordinary shares entitle their holder to receive dividends as declared.  In the event of winding up the Company,
ordinary  shares  entitle  their  holder  to  participate  in  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  all  surplus  assets  in
proportion to the number of and amounts paid up or which should have been paid up on shares held.  Each
ordinary share entitles the holder to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting of the Company.
Ordinary shares issued during the year and since the end of the year, from date of issue rank equally with the
ordinary shares on issue.
(b)
Share Options and Performance Rights
At  30  June  2016,  4,200,000  share  options  and  26,273,365  share  performance  rights  granted  to  directors,
executives and consultants were outstanding.  The options and share performance rights are granted pursuant to
the Senior Executives and Officers Option Plan, details of which are set out in note 19.
(c)
Capital Management
Capital is defined as equity. When managing capital, management’s objective is to ensure the entity continues
as a going concern as well as to maintain optimal returns to shareholders and benefits of other stakeholders.
All methods of returning funds to shareholders outside of dividend payments or raising funds are considered
within the context of the Company’s objectives.
The  Group  will  seek  to  raise  further  capital,  if  required,  as  and  when  necessary  to  meet  its  projected
operations.  The decision of how the Group will raise future capital will depend on market conditions existing
at that time.  It is the Group’s plan that this capital will be raised by any one or a combination of the following:
placement of shares, pro-rata issue to shareholders, the exercise of outstanding options, and/or a further issue
of  shares  to  the  public.  Should  these  methods  not  be  considered  to  be  viable,  or  in  the  best  interests  of
shareholders, then it would be the Company’s intention  to meet its obligations by either  partial sale of the
Company’s interests or farmout, the latter course of action being part of the Company’s overall strategy.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 16  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and short term deposits, the main purpose of which is to
finance the Group’s operations.  The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables
and  trade  payables  which  arise  directly  from  its  operations.    The  main  risks  arising  from  the  Group’s  financial
instruments  are  credit  risk,  interest  rate  risk,  exchange  rate  risk  and  liquidity  risk.    The  Board  of  Directors  has
reviewed each of those risks and has determined that they are not significant in terms of the Group’s current activities.
The Group also enters into derivative financial instruments, principally forward currency contracts.  The purpose is to
manage the currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.  Speculative trading in derivatives is not permitted.
There are no derivatives outstanding at 30 June 2016 (2015: $nil).
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of
measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset,
financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties.  Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing
basis with the results being that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group,  which  comprise cash  and cash  equivalents and trade and
other  receivables.    The  Group's  exposure  to  credit  risk  arises  from  potential  default  of  the  counter  party,  with  a
maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.  No collateral is held as security.  Exposure at
balance date is the carrying value as disclosed in each applicable note.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s cash and cash
equivalents  with  a  floating  interest  rate.    Short  term  deposits  are  made  for  varying  periods  depending  on  the
immediate cash requirements of the group, and earn interest at the respective short term deposit rates.
Taking into account the current cash balance, a +/- 1.0% movement from the year-end Australian interest rates will
not have a material impact on the profit or loss and cash balances of the group.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s exposure to exchange rate risk relates primarily to trade payables and cash denominated in US dollars.
Where a payable is significant, US dollars are purchased on incurring the liability or commitment.  The Group also
manages its currency risk through the active management of its exposures which may include entering into various
forward currency contracts throughout the year.
The Group’s exposure to its unhedged financial assets and liabilities is as follows:

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 16  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (cont)
The following sensitivity analysis is based on the foreign currency risk exposure in existence at the balance date, with
all other variables remaining constant:
Consolidated
Net Profit
10% strengthening in AUD/USD rate (for
2016 from 0.7522 to 0.8274 and for 2015
from 0.7680 to 0.8448) with all other
variables held constant
10% weakening in AUD/USD rate (for 2016
from 0.7522 to 0.6770 and 2015 from
0.7680 to 0.6912) with all other variables
held constant
2016
$
2015
$
(117,608)
(106,791)
143,743
130,522
A sensitivity of 10% has been selected as this is considered reasonable given the current level of exchange rates and
the volatility observed both on a 5 year historical basis and market expectations for potential future movement.
There is no impact on equity other than the above net profit sensitivities on retained earnings/accumulated losses.
Liquidity Risk
The Group’s exposure to financial obligations relating to corporate administration and exploration expenditure, are
subject to budgeting and reporting controls, to ensure that such obligations do not exceed cash held and known cash
inflows for a period of at least 1 year.
Ultimate  responsibility  for  liquidity  risk  management  rests  with  the  Board  of  Directors,  which  has  built  in  an
appropriate liquidity risk framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and longer term funding and
liquidity  management  requirements.    The  Group  manages  liquidity  risk  by  maintaining  adequate  equity  funding
through the monitoring of future cash flow forecasts of its operations, which reflect management’s expectations of the
settlement of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has limited financial resources and will need to raise additional capital from time to time and such fund
raisings may be subject to factors beyond the control of the Company and its directors.  When MEO requires further
funding for its programs, then it is the Company’s intention that the additional funds will be raised by any one or a
combination of the following: placement of shares, pro-rata issue to shareholders, the exercise of outstanding options,
and/or a further issue of shares to the public. Should these methods not be considered to be viable, or in the best
interests of shareholders, then it would be the Company’s intention to meet its obligations by either partial sale of the
Company’s interests or farmout, the latter course of action being part of the Company’s overall strategy.
At  balance  date,  the  group  holds  $219,622  (2015:  $213,286)  of  financial  liabilities  consisting  of  trade  and  other
payables.  All financial liabilities have a contractual maturity of 30 days.   The fair values of the financial assets and
liabilities approximate the carrying values in the statement of financial position.

The Group has provided guarantees of $70,752 (2015: $70,752) at 30 June 2016 for lease of premises.
Exploration Commitments
In  order  to maintain rights  of tenure to petroleum  exploration  tenements,  the  Group has discretionary exploration
requirements  up  until  the  expiry  of  the  primary term  of the  tenements.    These  requirements,  which  are  subject  to
renegotiation,  are not provided for  in  the financial statements.   If the economic entity decides to relinquish  certain
tenements  and/or  does  not  meet  these  obligations,  assets  recognised  in  the  Statement  of  Financial  Position  may
require  review  in  order  to  determine  the  appropriateness  of  carrying  values.    The  commitments  for  exploration
expenditure of $20,014,286 include the minimum expenditure requirements that the Consolidated Entity is required to
meet in order to retain its present permit interests.  These obligations may be subject to renegotiation, may be farmed
out or may be relinquished.
The majority of MEO’s exploration  permits are located in the jurisdiction  of the Commonwealth  of Australia and
have  been  awarded  on  the  basis  of  an  exploration  work  program  bid,  although  there  is  an  increase  in  focus  on
international permits held in  Cuba and NZ.  The first three-years of a  work program are referred to as the primary
term.    The  work  program  is  guaranteed  and  cannot  be  reduced.    Later  years  (4,  5  and  6)  are  referred  to  as  the
secondary term and the work program for each year becomes guaranteed upon entry to that year.  Whilst failure to
complete a guaranteed work program does not result in a financial penalty, it is grounds for cancellation of the permit.
Further, the default may be considered by the Regulator in relation to future interactions with the defaulting party for
a period of 5 years.
-AC/P50 (MEO 100%)
AC/P50  was  renewed  for  a  further  5  year  term  commencing  19  May  2015  and  the  minimum  work  program
requirement during the 3 year Primary Term consists of:-
Year 1 (ending 18 May 2016) - geological and geophysical studies; Status – Work program completed
Year  2  (ending  18  May  2017)  -  seismic  data  reprocessing  and  Year  3  (ending  18  May  2018)  -  geological  and
geophysical studies.
As announced on 5 July 2016, MEO will be “free-carried” through the Year 2 and Year 3 work programs following
an agreement with Rouge Rock Pty Ltd which grants Rouge Rock an option to acquire a 45% interest in the Permit in
exchange for undertaking and funding the remaining work program.

- WA-488-P (MEO 100%)
In  2013,  MEO  was  awarded  WA-488-P  for  a  six  year  period  with  a  minimum  commitment  being  the  three  year
primary term ending 21 May 2016.  The Permit Year 1 work program (ending 21 May 2014) was 400km 2D seismic;
and has been satisfied.  During the financial year the Regulator approved a suspension of the Permit Year 2 work
program conditions by twelve months to 21 November  2016 with the work program  varied to include 150km 2D
broadband reprocessing and 2D  seismic inversion.   As  a result,  Permit  Year  3,  which  has a  work  program  of one
exploration well now commences 22 November 2016.
-PEP51153 (MEO 30% interest)
In June 2016, MEO advised that TAG Oil Ltd had acquired the 70% interest in, and became Operator for, onshore
exploration permit PEP51153, which was previously held by Kea Oil and Gas Limited.  The minimum work program
for PEP51153 has also been revised and approved by the New Zealand regulator as follows:
Period
No later than 23 March 2017
No later than 23 February 2018
Work Commitment
Acquire, process and interpret a minimum of 28.5km of
gravity data across the permit
Drill one well to a location and depth agreed between the
permit holder and the Chief Executive; OR
Surrender the permit
PEP51153 expires on 23 September 2018.
- Cuba Block 9 (MEO 100% interest)
In  September  2015,  MEO  executed  the  Cuba  Block  9  Production  Sharing  Contract  (PSC)  with  the  national  oil
company Cuba Petróleo Union (CUPET).
The exploration period of the Block 9 PSC is split into four sub-periods with withdrawal options at the end of each
sub-period.  The first sub-period, which is currently scheduled to conclude in March 2017, involves evaluating the
existing  exploration  data  in  the  block  and  reprocessing  selected  2D  seismic  data  before  determining  whether  to
proceed with a subsequent 24-month exploration sub-period that includes acquisition of new 2D seismic data.  MEO
is well advanced on meeting its obligations for the first sub-period.
There are no material commitments or contingencies other than as set out in this note.
Summary
Should MEO proceed with its share of exploration commitments, they are currently estimated to be $20,014,286 of
which $14,286 is estimated within one year and $20,000,000 is estimated after one year but not more than five years.

Independent auditor's report to the members of MEO Australia Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of MEO Australia Limited, which comprises the
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement
of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the
company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true
and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for
such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 2(a), the directors
also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that
the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and
fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's
internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
copy of which is included in the directors’ report
