<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth 
session from 21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Barbados was held at the ninth 
meeting on 25 January 2013. The delegation of Barbados was headed by Senator R. 
Orlando Marville. At its 13th meeting, held on 29 January 2013, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Barbados 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Barbados: Brazil, Libya and Spain. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Barbados: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/BRB/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/BRB/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/BRB/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
transmitted to Barbados through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of 
the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation noted that Barbados was a small island developing State with a good 
record of observing human rights and with a level of good governance that had served it 
well since its independence in 1966. It highlighted that the country&#8217;s population was 
approximately 270,000 persons. Its limited human resources had not prevented the pursuit 
of the public good, even if it conditioned the pace at which things were accomplished. 
</p>
<p>6. Barbados recognized that, as a small developing State, the effort to meet its 
reporting obligations to the various treaty bodies was substantial. It added that it placed 
great value on meeting these obligations but that the country should be judged on how it 
respected the rights of others in reality and by the commitment shown to respecting the 
rights of the poor, the disabled, the needy and those less able to represent themselves. 
</p>
<p>7. Barbados had a long tradition of democracy and respect for the rule of law. It was 
recalled that as early as 1651 its inhabitants sought to determine and safeguard the freedom, 
safety and well-being of the island through the adoption of the Charter of Barbados, a 
document which formed the basis of the United States Declaration of Rights. The 
Constitution adopted after the country&#8217;s independence enshrined the importance of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms and was guided by the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and other international and regional human rights instruments. </p>


<p>8. The promotion and protection of human rights remain a priority for Barbados and 
this was reflected in the outlay the country makes on education and social services which 
consumed approximately two thirds of the national budget. 
</p>
<p>9. The country was seeking to strengthen its governance structure and human rights 
framework and to this end established an Advisory Board on Governance in 2008. This 
committee was composed of outstanding Barbadian citizens and has been working 
assiduously on several pieces of legislation including amendments of the Ombudsman Act 
as well as drafting of Integrity, Defamation and Freedom of Information legislation. 
</p>
<p>10. Barbados was committed to the advancement of women and this is evidenced in its 
policy and practice. It was noted that, contrary to information provided by Amnesty 
International, Barbados did not have 3 out of 30 members of Parliament who were women. 
In fact, in the Lower House, elected by popular vote, there were 4 women out of 30 and in 
the Senate, whose members were selected, 7 out of 21. Barbados then provided additional 
details regarding participation of women in the public sector, including the judiciary, 
adding that female enrolment at the tertiary level continued to be high, with women 
outnumbering men by almost two to one. 
</p>
<p>11. With regard to the issue of persons with disabilities, Barbados observed that in 2012, 
the country had appointed its first female President of the Senate, who also happened to be 
visually impaired. The Senator&#8217;s academic achievements and appointment to this high 
</p>
<p>office attested to the Government&#8217;s commitment to providing opportunities for all citizens. 
</p>
<p>12. Barbados continued to implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and the Cabinet agreed to its ratification once all the legal requirements for 
doing so are in place. The National Disabilities Unit implemented programmes to promote 
the rights of person with disabilities. Barbados highlighted action taken in this regard, 
including steps to retrofit public buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities, as well 
as work undertaken with NGOs, and efforts by schools, universities and work places. 
</p>
<p>13. With regard to legislative action, Barbados indicated that it had undertaken a review 
of certain pre-independence legislation to determine whether these were in conflict with its 
treaty obligations. Barbados proposed to amend or enact new laws pertaining to mental 
health, sexual harassment, discrimination, domestic violence, child protection and the 
mandatory death sentence. This process would be continuous and the country would 
progressively incorporate international human rights obligations into domestic legislation. 
</p>
<p>14. Regarding HIV/AIDS, the Government continued to develop and carry out 
programmes aimed at eliminating the stigmatization of persons living with HIV/AIDS and 
spends large sums on public service advertisement and other important issues. The 
Government remained aware that stigma and discrimination hindered access to HIV 
preventive and care services. It has therefore decided to decentralize and integrate such 
services into the primary health care system. It has also developed a number of activities to 
promote attitudinal and behavioural change within society. Details regarding such action 
were then provided. 
</p>
<p>15. On the issue of trafficking in persons, Barbados highlighted that it had legislation 
that criminalized trafficking in persons, including children. It noted steps taken to 
implement the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially 
Women and Children (Palermo Protocol), including: the adoption in 2011 of the 
Transnational Organized Crime (Prevention and Control) Act and the establishment in 2012 
of a National Task Force for the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons. It also noted the 
launching of initiatives to raise public awareness and to train public officials and law 
enforcement personnel. </p>


<p>16. It was highlighted that the trafficking in children was also criminalized and that the 
Transnational Organized Crime (Prevention and Control) Act provided for a penalty of life 
imprisonment for persons convicted of trafficking a child. 
</p>
<p>17. Regarding the establishment of a national human rights institution, Barbados 
explained that it had taken steps to transform the scope of the Office of the Ombudsman to 
include responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights. Legislation to be 
brought before Parliament would provide for the Ombudsman to be appointed by the 
Governor General acting on recommendations of both houses of Parliament. This draft was 
currently before the Chief Parliamentary Counsel and discussions will be held during the 
year on the structure, responsibility and financial and human resources required. 
</p>
<p>18. With regard to human rights education, the delegation noted that several television 
promotions were aired daily on the Government-operated television station on human 
rights, the rights of children, sexual abuse and the Unite Against Violence Campaign. 
Additionally, discussions with the Commonwealth Secretariat were under way with regard 
to the development of a human rights public education programme. 
</p>
<p>19. On domestic violence, the Government was firmly committed to pursuing a policy 
of zero tolerance of all forms of violence against women. It was highlighted that the Bureau 
of Gender Affairs had established a committee to review the existing Domestic Violence 
(Prevention Orders) Act. The Bureau had also promoted public education through a number 
of public forums. It was added that the policy of the Police Force was to investigate all 
reports of domestic violence and that police officers continued to receive training on 
intervention and investigation of such cases. Additionally, the Police Force was working 
with the Bureau of Gender Affairs and other stakeholders to design a pilot data-collection 
instrument to improve data collection on the incidence of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>20. Regarding the death penalty, the Government noted that there did not appear to be a 
national consensus or bipartisan support for the abolition of capital punishment. However, 
it was underscored that there had been no executions since 1984. On the issue of the 
mandatory death penalty, legislation had been drafted to provide for its abolition and 
preparations are being finalized for submission of this draft legislation to Cabinet prior to 
introduction to Parliament. 
</p>
<p>21. Similarly, on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons (LGBT)  issues, there 
was no consensus on repealing the country&#8217;s laws on &#8220;buggery&#8221;. Though buggery is 
criminalized by the Sexual Offences Act, persons who engaged in same-sex relationships 
were not prosecuted, since without a complaint there could be no successful prosecution of 
such acts. Persons engaged in such relationships were unlikely to complain to the police 
and therefore, though the law on buggery was in the statutes books, gay persons were not 
prosecuted in Barbados for their sexual preferences. Prosecution could only occur if a 
minor was involved or a non-consenting adult. 
</p>
<p>22. Barbados took note of the position of the international community that there was an 
onus on the Government to show leadership on such issues. Nevertheless, it recalled that 
Barbados was a democracy and that, as such, the Government was hesitant to go against the 
wishes of its people. However, it was committed to ensuring that the rights of all persons 
were protected from harm. 
</p>
<p>23. On the issue of the protection of children, Barbados continued to strengthen efforts 
and the Government had enlisted the services of a consultant to examine the Family Law 
Act and all legislation that related to children with a view to ensuring that the law was in 
line with internationally accepted protocols and standards. The Government had also taken 
steps to institute a mandatory reporting requirement in all cases of child abuse. </p>


<p>24. With regard to corporal punishment, Barbados indicated that, with the assistance of 
UNICEF, it had implemented the Schools Positive Behaviour Management Programme 
(SPBMP) aimed at developing positive behaviour-management strategies, thereby 
eliminating the need to resort to corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>25. Barbados then explained that the Police Complaints Authority met every four to six 
weeks to interview complainants. 
</p>
<p>26. Barbados responded to information included in the UPR reports compiled on 
Barbados. It stated that the negative and generalized statements in these reports seem to 
suggest that the Barbados Police habitually violated the rights of citizens and residents of 
Barbados. Such statements unfairly impugned the integrity of the Police Force. It was 
stressed that police command remained committed to the principles of integrity and 
accountability of law enforcement personnel. The behaviour of officers was governed by 
the Instructional Manual, especially with relation to the use of force. Training on human 
rights issues and related matters were a part of the accreditation process for police officers. 
Every effort was made to provide officers with the requisite training and the police were 
committed to respecting constitutional guarantees of all people in Barbados. 
</p>
<p>27. Current policy, practice and legislation, precluded the police from being the sole 
adjudicator of the outcome of any investigation pertaining to the death of persons in police 
custody. Findings from such investigations were forwarded to the Office of the Director of 
Public Prosecutions or to the Coroner for an appropriate determination to be made. In all 
instances of death of unnatural or suspicious circumstances, an autopsy was conducted by a 
pathologist who was independent of the Office of the Commissioner of Police. 
</p>
<p>28. The relationship between the police and the public was systematically examined by 
the Government with a view to improving understanding and dialogue. Where there was 
evidence of police misconduct or where officers were found to have broken the law, they 
were subject to prosecution like any citizen. 
</p>
<p>29. Barbados was also extremely concerned at statements that purported that rape was 
commonplace in Barbados. The delegation stated that it did not believe such a statement to 
be borne out by the facts and referred to data issued by UNODC which belied information 
contained in the OHCHR report. It noted that between 2008 and 2012 the number of 
reported cases of rape had decreased. In fact, the number of reported cases of rape in 
Barbados per 100,000 was lower than the comparable average rates in Western Europe. 
</p>
<p>30. The delegation expressed concern about negative generalizations that emanated from 
the United Nations reports. It found the use of anecdotal material to come to unfounded 
and/or unsubstantiated conclusions extremely disconcerting as such reports could be 
viewed as authoritative statements. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to the claim that the law in Barbados did not permit Barbadian women 
to confer nationality on their children, the delegation stated that this was not the case, as the 
Constitution was amended in 2000 to allow both men and women to confer Barbadian 
nationality on their children. 
</p>
<p>32. On the issue of statelessness, Barbados explained that it had sought the intervention 
of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the only case in which a 
claim of statelessness had been made; the case was ongoing. 
</p>
<p>33. Though Barbados was not party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, it recognized its obligations with respect to refugee 
protection and its responsibility to carefully consider each asylum claim. As such, Barbados 
was committed to the principle of non-refoulement. In the few instances where a claim had  
been made, the matter was referred to UNHCR. </p>


<p>34. In conclusion, Barbados stated that as a small island developing State it continued to 
experience many challenges and these make it difficult to ratify new treaties at this time. As 
a matter of policy, new treaties would not be ratified unless the country was in a position to 
meet all of the obligations that attend thereto. Barbados continued to encounter capacity 
constraints and part of the problem related to the collation of data and disaggregation of 
statistics, though a number of initiatives had been taken in this regard. 
</p>
<p>35. The delegation also reported that work had been accomplished with regard to its 
obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and that these reports would 
hopefully be completed in the course of the year. Additionally, work was near completion 
with regard to 11 of the 22 ILO Conventions. Barbados indicated that it would welcome the 
assistance of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) in streamlining the treaty reporting process. 
</p>
<p>36. Barbados welcomed the appointment of a Human Rights Advisor in the country and 
considered that this would assist the Government in raising awareness on human rights 
issues and strengthening the national framework for the protection of human rights in the 
country. 
</p>
<p>37. Barbados then replied to the advanced questions it had received, noting that 
information had already been provided during its intervention regarding most of the issues 
raised. 
</p>
<p>38. On questions related to criminalization of same-sex activities, Barbados reiterated 
information previously provided highlighting the fact that there was no intervention of the 
law in relations between consenting adults. On the abolition of the death penalty, Barbados  
referred to information already provided and stated that the country&#8217;s record of not having 
</p>
<p>used the death penalty for almost 30 years made a very strong statement. 
</p>
<p>39. With regard to questions on the abolition of corporal punishment, Barbados recalled 
that there were programmes in schools to develop alternatives which appeared to be leading 
to a decrease in its use of corporal punishment or its use only as a last resort. Greater public 
acceptance seems to be needed for the Government to comfortably introduce this change 
into its legislation. 
</p>
<p>40. On measures adopted to prevent violence against women, Barbados referred to the 
detailed information it had already provided. As for plans to tackle child abuse, it was 
recalled that the Government has hired a legal consultant to examine existing legislation 
and to help to bring it in line with internationally accepted protocols. A child maintenance 
fund had also been established by the Government to provide needed assistance to single 
parents. As for child labour, this could not be a significant problem as education is 
compulsory and children should be in school up to the age of 16 years. However, a national 
child labour committee had been established and one of its functions would be to monitor 
child labour cases. 
</p>
<p>41. On the question about steps being adopted against aggressive and discriminatory 
policing, it was reiterated that the Police Force received training in customer service, public 
relations, human rights, community engagement, conflict resolution and officer safety. It 
was recalled that a Police Complaints Authority had been established and met regularly to 
consider complaints against the police. 
</p>
<p>42. Regarding questions on the establishment of a national human rights institution, 
Barbados explained that this was addressed through the further enhancement of the Office 
of the Ombudsman, which would provide that function. 
</p>
<p>43. On the question regarding what relevant legislation had been enacted during the 
period under review, Barbados referred, in addition to legislation already mentioned, to the </p>


<p>Community Legal Services Act and the Safety and Health at Work Act. It added that 
pending legislation includes amendments to the Mental Health Act and the Domestic 
Violence (Protection Orders) Act. 
</p>
<p>44. Barbados also reported that an additional positive development was the signing of 
ILO Convention No. 189 concerning decent work for domestic workers. UN-Women is 
currently working with the Government towards its ratification. 
</p>
<p>45. In conclusion, Barbados reiterated its commitment to the work of the Human Rights 
Council and of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>46. During the interactive dialogue, 44 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>47. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) noted that Barbados had the highest Human 
Development Index in the Caribbean and implemented programmes to tackle extreme 
poverty targeted at families. It noted policies to help the elderly by focusing on their 
financial security and physical and mental health. Additionally, it noted efforts aimed at 
empowering women, including gender equality training for public officials and public 
campaigns highlighting gender-based violence. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>48. Thailand appreciated Barbados&#8217; close collaboration with the United Nations and 
particularly with UN-Women and its commitment to gender equality and promoting the 
empowerment of women into the work and function of the Bureau for Gender Affairs. It 
encouraged the allocation of adequate resources to the Office of the Ombudsman. Noting 
the national strategy on HIV, Thailand urged the international community to lend the 
necessary assistance in this regard. It appreciated the commitment to implement 
Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Algeria noted the signing of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and measures to incorporate international standards into domestic legislation.  It 
highlighted developments since the last review, particularly the National Policy on Ageing 
and measures to alleviate poverty, guarantee gender equality and eliminate racial 
discrimination. While welcoming the national strategy to tackle HIV, it noted that HIV 
remained a major threat to the development of Barbados. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Argentina commended the National Strategic Plan for HIV Prevention and Control 
2008-2013 and the establishment and application of the Identification, Stabilisation, 
Enablement and Empowerment (ISEE) Bridge programme focusing on poverty reduction. 
Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Australia commended the protection of children&#8217;s rights, the expanded Office of the 
Ombudsman and the criminalization of human trafficking. It noted the State party&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to abolishing the death penalty. Acknowledging action on discrimination and 
violence against women, it remained concerned that current policies do not adequately 
legislate against this. It wished to receive further information on the Social Policy 
Framework as it became available. The lack of social data and crime statistics gave rise to 
concern. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Bangladesh expressed grave concern at the impact of global recession on Barbados, 
yet commended the efforts taken to promote and protect human rights. It was pleased to 
note the Government&#8217;s commitment and activities to curb all forms of violence, and the 
</p>
<p>emphasis placed on gender mainstreaming. It also welcomed interventions made at the 
legislative, programmatic and educational levels to this end. However, gender stereotypes </p>


<p>continued to challenge efforts to implement gender equality. Bangladesh made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Brazil commended efforts made to implement recommendation including legislative 
reforms addressing a number of the concerns raised in the previous UPR cycle and 
welcomed measures to combat gender-based violence and empower women, the adoption 
of the National Policy on Ageing and policies to eradicate poverty. Barbados was 
encouraged to take further action regarding gender equality and corporal punishment. 
Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Canada requested an update on the implementation of its 2008 recommendations on 
addressing discrimination against women and taking steps to enact legislation enshrining a 
specific right of non-discrimination on the basis of sex. It commended the work of the 
National Disabilities Unit, in particular its transportation, sign-language and accessibility 
programmes, its integrated summer camps and accessibility programmes. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Chile highlighted the National Policy on Ageing based on providing equality of 
opportunity and access, and progress bringing legislation into line with the aims of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The implementation of economic and social rights 
was reflected in policies to eradicate poverty. The moratorium on the death penalty was 
welcomed as a positive step. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. China appreciated the importance attached to eradicating poverty and efforts to 
protect children&#8217;s rights. It welcomed the zero-tolerance policy on violence against women, 
female empowerment and the promotion of gender equality. Positive results from measures 
to prevent HIV and tackle racial discrimination and trafficking in persons were 
commended. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>57. Costa Rica highlighted efforts to promote women&#8217;s rights and gender equality. It 
encouraged the further incorporation of the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child into law and practice and invited Barbados to continue working for child 
protection. It expressed alarm at the corporal punishment of minors and urged the 
implementation of measures to bring an end to the practice. It requested information on the 
status of the Employment Sexual Harassment Bill. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Cuba noted that Barbados had allocated 10 per cent of GDP to health expenditures 
in 2011 and 2012 and devoted significant resources to the national medication programme. 
Furthermore, a worker-protection policy had prevented job losses among public sector 
workers and incentive schemes had fostered a healthy economy in harmony with the 
environment. Cuba made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>59. Ecuador highlighted national policies to promote respect for human rights and, 
noting special protection afforded to the elderly, asked what specific measures had been 
adopted to promote their rights. It noted measures to raise both awareness and visibility of 
the rights of persons with disabilities. It appreciated efforts to promote gender equality and 
empower women. Ecuador made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>60. Estonia noted that, despite provisions on fundamental rights and freedoms reflecting 
civil and political rights, the Constitution required revision to include the concept of 
discrimination on any grounds. It welcomed and encouraged growing attention to women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>issues, particularly violence against women, and work towards ratifying ILO Convention 
No. 189. Noting that Barbados had sought technical assistance to build capacity in reporting 
to CEDAW, it recalled that many reports for treaty bodies were overdue. Estonia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. France welcomed the efforts undertaken by Barbados since the first UPR cycle to 
strengthen the protection of human rights. France made recommendations. </p>


<p>62. Germany remained concerned by gender-based violence, including domestic 
violence, as well as sexual harassment and discrimination against women. It was equally 
concerned by the criminalization of consensual homosexual relations and the lack of 
legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.  It asked what 
measures the State party intended to take to combat the criminalization of and 
discrimination against the LGBT community. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Guatemala recognized progress made by Barbados in the area of human rights. It 
noted that Parliament had approved the Transnational Organised Crime (Prevention and 
Control) Act criminalizing trafficking in persons. It shared the concern expressed by the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding inequality between men and women, 
given that women, unlike men, were not able to confer their Barbadian nationality on 
children born abroad. Guatemala made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>64. Hungary welcomed the firm commitment of Barbados to pursue a zero-tolerance 
policy on all forms of violence against women and children. It noted the de facto 
moratorium on capital punishment and the commitment to abolish the mandatory death 
sentence system. It noted that although the Constitution specifically prohibited torture, 
reports indicated regular occurrences of unprofessional conduct and beatings by police. 
Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Indonesia welcomed action on migrants&#8217; rights, including the establishment of a 
cabinet subcommittee on immigration. Indonesia asked about the progress made concerning 
the intended revision of its migration policy and efforts towards ratification of the 
International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. It welcomed new legislation and the task force addressing human trafficking, and 
the committee established by the Bureau of Gender Affairs to address gaps in domestic 
violence legislation and guarantee victims&#8217; rights. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Ireland commended efforts to implement Barbados&#8217; international obligations by 
revising its Constitution and streamlining legislation. It particularly welcomed efforts to 
ensure that the principle of the best interest of the child is reflected in legislation.  It noted 
the de facto moratorium on the death penalty and encouraged the adoption of a formal 
moratorium. It welcomed the work of the Bureau of Gender Affairs, particularly regarding 
the spread of HIV, and efforts to tackle domestic violence. It noted the continued 
criminalization of consenting same-sex relations. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Italy welcomed the protection of fundamental political and civil rights, and 
appreciated the high degree of independence enjoyed by the judicial system. Although 
efforts to combat domestic violence were commended, it was deeply concerned by reports 
of widespread abuses against women and children. It expressed appreciation of the fact that 
no executions had been carried out in Barbados since 1984. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Latvia thanked Barbados for the comprehensive national report, its presentation and 
constructive engagement in the universal periodic review process. It wished to touch upon 
the issue of standing invitations to the special-procedures mandate holders of the Human 
Rights Council. Latvia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>69. Malaysia acknowledged achievements on the rights of the elderly, youth 
development, poverty alleviation and gender equality. It commended actions taken by 
Barbados to combat domestic violence and human trafficking. It noted that even though 
Barbados had not yet ratified CRPD, it had made significant strides in this area as well as 
progress made in combating HIV/AIDS. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Maldives noted steps taken by Barbados in welcoming the appointment of the 
Human Rights Adviser. As a small developing State, Barbados is confronted with 
constraints in its capacity to enforce and report on its treaty obligations. Maldives called on </p>


<p>the international community to extend technical assistance in its efforts to conduct training, 
awareness-raising programmes and consolidation of its human rights framework. Maldives 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>71. Mexico commended Barbados on its openness to international scrutiny, as 
demonstrated by the 2012 visit of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and it 
encouraged Barbados to implement the recommendations made by her. It noted that 
Barbados had taken action in line with Mexico&#8217;s previous recommendation on the gradual 
incorporation of international obligations into national legislation. Mexico made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Morocco welcomed the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman, which 
would spearhead a public education programme on human rights in 2013, and progress 
made in social protection, health, education, employment, the rights of the elderly, single 
parents and women, and in combating LGBT discrimination. It asked for an update on 
progress in implementing the National Youth Policy. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. The Netherlands noted progress in combating sexual harassment in the workplace. It 
commended Barbados on introducing a bill on sexual harassment in employment, in 
response to its previous recommendation, and trusted that the bill would be adopted and 
implemented in 2013. The Netherlands made a recommendation. 
</p>

maintain a high Human Development Index, despite the negative impact of the global 
financial crisis on small economies. It encouraged Barbados to continue working on a 
social policy guaranteeing the participation of all social actors, in this context taking into 
account constructive UPR recommendations. Nicaragua made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>75. Norway noted steps to follow up on recommendations that were accepted during the 
last review, notably in the fields of decent work, gender equality and the intention to 
establish a national human rights institution. It encouraged Barbados to advance in several 
key areas to meet international human rights standards. It was concerned about corporal 
punishment, especially of children. It stated that religious or cultural beliefs cannot be used

</p>
<p>77. Peru highlighted progress made by Barbados in human rights since the 2008 UPR,

to and the establishment of a National Task Force for the Prevention of Trafficking in 
Persons and adopting the Employment Rights Act as well as the establishment of an 
Employment Rights Tribunal. Peru made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Philippines acknowledged Barbados&#8217; recognition of the economic and social value 
of domestic work and the need to address the exclusion of domestic workers from labour 
and social protection. It noted that despite this positive outlook Barbados had yet to accede 
to the ICRMW and ILO Convention No. 189. It commended Barbados on administrative 
and legislative measures taken to combat human trafficking but noted that it had not yet 
ratified the Palermo Protocol. Philippines made recommendations. </p>


<p>79. Singapore noted significant progress in Barbados in ensuring human rights, 
maintaining a high Human Development Index, literacy rate, level of transparency and a 
robust anti-corruption regime. It also noted efforts to eliminate violence and discrimination 
against women and combat human trafficking, especially the adoption of legislative and 
institutional measures. Singapore made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Slovakia commended Government efforts to upgrade the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office in 
line with international standards, revise the Constitution and update national legislation to 
conform to its treaty obligations. It welcomed the increase in primary school enrolments, 
the development of educational programmes for HIV/AIDS prevention and a project to 
provide technology services and support for blind or visually impaired persons. Slovakia

<p>81. Slovenia noted steps taken to promote women&#8217;s empowerment and advance gender 
equality. It welcomed, particularly, the training programmes and awareness raising 
activities of the Bureau of Gender Affairs. It regretted that no legislation had been adopted 
to decriminalize consensual sexual relations between adults of the same sex. It remained 
concerned about corporal punishment as a legitimate sanction in Barbadian law. Slovenia 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. South Africa commended efforts to empower women and promote gender equality, 
particularly through the Bureau of Gender Affairs. The collaboration between the Ministry 
of Labour and Social Security and UN-Women was an example of positive engagement 
between the United Nations and a Member State. South Africa made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Spain highlighted initiatives taken by Barbados to eliminate discrimination against 
persons with disabilities and the creation of a special unit within the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to deal with human rights, which would provide an effective means of guaranteeing 
sustained cooperation with international bodies on human rights issues. Spain made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>84. Sri Lanka acknowledged positive developments made by Barbados since the last 
review and welcomed efforts to promote children&#8217;s rights and gender equality, to combat 
domestic violence, poverty and trafficking in persons. It noted measures to counter racial 
discrimination, particularly in schools, and acknowledged that progress had been made 
despite the global economic downturn, which had adversely affected Barbados. Sri Lanka 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>85. Viet Nam took note of developments since Barbados&#8217; previous review. It noted 
initiatives taken to combat racial discrimination and trafficking in persons and to promote

</p>
<p>86. Trinidad and Tobago underscored efforts made by Barbados since its last review, to 
promote, protect and uphold human rights, including the signing of ILO Convention No. 
189, initiatives to promote ratification of the CRPD, actions to revise the Constitution and 
update legislation to conform with treaty obligations, the review of all laws directly related 
to the family and children and, the enhancement of the human resources in the Bureau of 
Gender Affairs. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>87. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland noted the ongoing 
commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights. It urged Barbados to take 
prompt action to tackle the issue of violence against women and children. It also urged 
Barbados to ensure that a Human Rights Advisory Committee be set up to oversee the 
establishment of the national human rights institution. While welcoming the de facto </p>


<p>moratorium on the death penalty it urged Barbados to amend the legislation to abolish the 
mandatory death penalty. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. The United States of America, while appreciating Barbados&#8217; commitment to protect 
all members of society from harassment, discrimination and violence regardless of sexual 
orientation, was concerned about reports of discrimination and harassment against members 
of the LGBT community. It was concerned about the criminalization of same-sex sexual 
activity between consenting adults and failure to prohibit discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. Additionally, it expressed concern at allegations of 
excessive use of force by the police and delays in transmitting case files; and about 
legislation on transitional crime being inconsistent with international standards because it 
requires migration as a necessary element of human trafficking. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>89. Uruguay welcomed progress in human rights in Barbados, including the 
implementation of policies for youth and the elderly, the national poverty reduction 
strategy, the development of major economic and social indicators, including the reduction 
of child mortality, access to education and health, placing Barbados among countries with a 
high Human Development Index. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>90. Namibia commended Barbados on criminalizing human trafficking through the 
enactment of national legislation and the signing of the Palermo Protocol, on its proactive 
engagement in environmental issues, particularly climate change, and on ensuring that it 
continued to enjoy a high Human Development Index, despite the challenge of poverty. It 
asked how Barbados intended to expand the Identification, Stabilisation, Enablement and 
Empowerment Bridge Programme. Namibia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Barbados noted that many of the questions raised during the dialogue had already 
been addressed in its opening statement. It stated, however, that it would try to respond to 
some of the recurring issues. 
</p>
<p>92. With regard to the death penalty it was recalled that the Government was working 
toward abolishing mandatory death sentences. The Barbados delegation noted that although 
some believed it important to formally state that there was a moratorium, it believed that it 
was more important not to have executed anyone for 29 years. 
</p>
<p>93. On the issue of discrimination against women, Barbados noted again that detailed 
information on the situation of women had been provided and that this information 
indicates that there has been considerable movement on this issue. Legislation was either 
already in place or being prepared on issues such as domestic violence. Additionally, the 
person in the police service responsible for addressing violence against women was herself 
a woman. 
</p>
<p>94. In relation to HIV/AIDs, there was a massive Government programme which 
included a television campaign with the participation of celebrities from music and sports. 
Transmission from mother to child was eliminated in Barbados as mothers were provided 
with free medical care. Technology permitted the prevention of such cases. 
</p>
<p>95. On questions regarding video recordings of interviews in police custody, Barbados 
stated that the Government remained committed to introducing such recordings and that to 
this end substantial preparatory work has been undertaken, including the construction of 
special physical facilities and the acquisition of support equipment, training of police and 
amendment of legislation. 
</p>
<p>96. Regarding youth, a national youth policy has been debated in Parliament and a 
constant effort had been made to eliminate poverty among youth. Poverty was addressed in 
its two facets: in cases where it could not be eliminated altogether because of specific 
circumstances the Government would intervene to ensure minimum living conditions and </p>


<p>for other cases, there were a number of poverty eradication programmes. The later include a 
number of programmes aimed at the youth. 
</p>
<p>97. With respect to ratification of the Convention against Torture and the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, Barbados 
reiterated that it was difficult to ratify new treaties and that it faced many challenges in 
complying with its reporting obligations. Torture was illegal under the law though there had 
been no allegations of torture. Similarly, there were no cases of forced disappearance but 
such acts would be covered under the Offences Against the Person Act. 
</p>
<p>98. Barbados thanked all who participated in its universal periodic review and in 
particular those who made recommendations on its way forward. It ensured that Barbados 
would give considered thought to the suggestions and recommendations received. It also 
thanked all of those who had contributed to the Trust Fund for Small Island Developing 
States. Barbados noted that the review process has permitted it to hold broad consultations 
within the country and carry out an assessment of what had been accomplished and areas 
where more needed to be done. It highlighted efforts made in areas such as the elderly and 
the young, achievements in areas such as gender equality and progress in the area of the 
rights of the disabled. 
</p>
<p>99. The delegation stated that Barbados had a reputation for the recognition of human 
rights and its support for the human rights system. It reaffirmed its commitment to 
furthering human rights. It noted that the Advisory Board on Governance, chaired by the 
head of the delegation, had produced several draft Bills covering, inter alia, freedom of 
information and the revision of the Ombudsman Act to make the Office of the Ombudsman 
independent. Additionally, Bills had been drafted on the prevention of corruption, primarily 
in the public sector and amending the Defamation Act to make it possible to utter honest 
opinions about public figures without risking being charged with defamation. 
</p>
<p>100. Barbados had also created a social partnership, which represents a process of 
continuous consultation between the Government, the private sector and labour, which had  
averted numerous strike actions or arbitrary dismissals of workers or the simple abuse of 
ordinary workers. This model was considered so effective that two other countries were 
attempting to copy it. 
</p>
<p>101. In conclusion, Barbados stressed that its size had forced it to focus in a way that 
countries with greater resources did not need to. Though it may be slower in reporting or 
enacting legislation, it always tried to ensure that what was achieved was the best practice 
possible. 
</p>
