</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the increasing awareness in the international community of the 
</p>
<p>detrimental impact of widespread corruption on human rights through both the weakening

</p>

</p>
<p>upholding the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity is one of the 
</p>
<p>essential components of good governance,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that the knowledge, training and awareness of public servants, as 
</p>

<p>uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and are predicated on 
</p>
