<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 
</p>
<p>17/119, in which the secretariat was requested to provide an annual written update on the 
</p>
<p>operations of the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review (hereinafter, &#8220;the Voluntary Fund&#8221;) and 
</p>
<p>on the resources available to it. The report has been prepared by the secretariat in 
</p>
<p>consultation with the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund and has been approved by 
</p>
<p>the Board. The present report provides an overview of contributions and expenditure as at 
</p>
<p>31 December 2014, together with a description of action taken since the submission of the 
</p>
<p>previous report (A/HRC/26/54) to operationalize the Voluntary Fund. It also provides a 
</p>
<p>description of the activities to be funded by the Voluntary Fund during the course of 2015. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Background 
</b></p>
<p>2. In its resolution 6/17, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to 
</p>
<p>establish a new financial mechanism called the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical 
</p>
<p>Assistance in order to provide, in conjunction with multilateral funding mechanisms, a 
</p>
<p>source of financial and technical assistance to help countries implement recommendations 
</p>
<p>emanating from the universal periodic review in consultation with, and with the consent of, 
</p>
<p>the country concerned. In its resolution 16/21, the Human Rights Council requested that the 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Fund be strengthened and operationalized in order to provide a source of 
</p>
<p>financial and technical assistance to help countries, in particular least developed countries 
</p>
<p>and small island developing States, to implement the recommendations emanating from 
</p>
<p>their review. The Human Rights Council also requested that a board of trustees be 
</p>
<p>established in accordance with the rules of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>3. The Voluntary Fund was established in 2009. The Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has begun operationalizing the Fund by 
</p>
<p>providing financial and technical assistance to States which have requested support. 
</p>
<p>Support has been provided in the spirit of the universal periodic review, in the founding 
</p>
<p>resolution for which it is provided that the objectives are the improvement of the human 
</p>
<p>rights situation on the ground (Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, annex, para. 4 (a)), 
</p>
<p>the fulfilment of the State&#8217;s human rights obligations and commitments (ibid., para. 4 (b)) 
</p>
<p>and the enhancement of the State&#8217;s capacity and of technical assistance, in consultation 
</p>
<p>with, and with the consent of, the State concerned (ibid., para. 4 (c)). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Operationalization of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Board of Trustees of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>4. On 30 May 2013, the Secretary-General appointed the members of the Board of 
</p>
<p>Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation to serve also as the Board of 
</p>
<p>Trustees for the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review. They are tasked with overseeing the 
</p>
<p>management of the latter Fund. </p>


<p>5. In close consultation with the various sections of OHCHR, the Board of Trustees 
</p>
<p>focuses its attention on broadly guiding the operationalization of the Fund by providing 
</p>
<p>policy advice. 
</p>
<p>6. Since the submission of the last report (A/HRC/26/54), the Board of Trustees has 
</p>
<p>held its third session in Geneva in October 2014 and the fourth session in Phnom Penh and 
</p>
<p>Bangkok in February 2015, during which it had an opportunity to provide OHCHR with 
</p>
<p>policy guidance aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of technical assistance and financial 
</p>
<p>support to States in implementing recommendations of the universal periodic review and 
</p>
<p>other international mechanisms at the country level. 
</p>
<p>7. During its third session in Geneva, the Board of Trustees recommended that 
</p>
<p>OHCHR consider establishing focal point systems for the universal periodic review at the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR regional office level in order to provide support to countries of the respective 
</p>
<p>regions for effective follow-up to universal periodic review and other mechanisms&#8217; 
</p>
<p>recommendations. That should be done hand in hand with the treaty body reform outcome 
</p>
<p>and utilize additional resources. Furthermore, the Board of Trustees highlighted the 
</p>
<p>importance of documenting promising practices and lessons learned on follow-up to the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review that can be shared with OHCHR field presences to promote more 
</p>
<p>effective follow-up to universal periodic review and other mechanisms&#8217; recommendations 
</p>
<p>on the ground.  
</p>
<p>8. During its fourth session, which was focused on reviewing the follow-up support 
</p>
<p>work of OHCHR in the Asia-Pacific region, the Board of Trustees also had an opportunity 
</p>
<p>to discuss with OHCHR how the latter provides technical assistance and financial support 
</p>
<p>through the Voluntary Trust Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance for the 
</p>
<p>Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review in a more systematic fashion and with 
</p>
<p>greater impact. The Board of Trustees also stressed the importance of coherent and 
</p>
<p>coordinated use of the two voluntary funds, namely the Voluntary Fund for Financial and 
</p>
<p>Technical Assistance for the Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review and the 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, for greater 
</p>
<p>efficiency and sustained impact. The Board of Trustees also held a substantive dialogue 
</p>
<p>with United Nations country teams, with a view to identifying broad policy advice in 
</p>
<p>connection with the latter&#8217;s efforts to integrate the recommendations of international human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms, including treaty bodies, special procedures and the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review, into their respective country programming. The Board of Trustees was impressed 
</p>
<p>by efforts to incorporate human rights perspectives and strategies, including the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of international human rights mechanisms, into United Nations common 
</p>
<p>country programming documents, such as the United Nations Development Assistance 
</p>
<p>Framework. It encouraged strongly the continuation and expansion of those efforts. The 
</p>
<p>Board of Trustees welcomed the ongoing OHCHR efforts to provide technical assistance 
</p>
<p>and financial support systematically through the use of the Fund to help States in 
</p>
<p>implementing recommendations of international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> B. OHCHR strategic vision for follow-up to universal periodic review and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Fund: going forward  
</b></p>
<p>9. As noted in the previous report (A/HRC/26/54), OHCHR has been developing the 
</p>
<p>capacity to provide increased support to States in their efforts to implement the outcome of 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review, including through the operationalization of the Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Fund. That effort has included an integrated approach to supporting implementation of 
</p>
<p>recommendations emanating from all the international human rights mechanisms. </p>


<p>10. OHCHR has revitalized a strategic vision for follow-up to the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review that is more proactive, systematic and results-oriented. This newly revitalized 
</p>
<p>strategy for that follow-up has enabled OHCHR to provide more effective support to States 
</p>
<p>on the ground, whether directly or through ensuring the integration of support in United 
</p>
<p>Nations country team programming on follow-up, to enable States to achieve concrete 
</p>
<p>results for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. Building on lessons learned, OHCHR has focused its support on establishing and/or 
</p>
<p>strengthening national processes for follow-up: a well-functioning inter-institutional body 
</p>
<p>has been identified as a key element for more effective follow-up at the national level, 
</p>
<p>along with an implementation action plan that clearly identifies achievable results and 
</p>
<p>priorities, responsible national government agencies for implementation, as well as 
</p>
<p>indicators and timelines against which to measure impact. Furthermore, OHCHR has been 
</p>
<p>providing support to key thematic issues contained in such an implementation action plan, 
</p>
<p>which have been identified as priority issues for implementation.  
</p>
<p>12. The documentation of best practices is also an important priority for OHCHR. It is 
</p>
<p>vital that good practices on national processes for follow-up, including on how the United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies at country level are working together to promote Human Rights Up Front, 
</p>
<p>should be made available as widely as possible. The Voluntary Fund therefore continues to 
</p>
<p>fund the documentation of good practices, in particular on such national processes. It also 
</p>
<p>seeks to document good practices and lessons learned on implementation of important 
</p>
<p>thematic issues that were raised in universal periodic review recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities to be supported by the Fund during 2015 
</b></p>
<p>13. As noted above, in an effort to systematize support given to States, technical 
</p>
<p>assistance will be provided to a number of States, focusing on the establishment and/or 
</p>
<p>strengthening of national follow-up processes.  
</p>
<p>14. For instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, continuing support will be provided to the 
</p>
<p>Government through the United Nations country team for the purpose of the latter&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>preparing an implementation plan for the second-cycle universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations through workshops and advice, strengthening its engagement with 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including the Ombudsman, and training civil servants. 
</p>
<p>15. In Chad, technical assistance will be provided to the authorities to draft and adopt, in 
</p>
<p>collaboration with civil society, a national action plan for the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations emanating from the treaty bodies and the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>Assistance will also be provided for the purposes of reworking the statutes of the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission and strengthening the capacity of its members in line with the 
</p>
<p>principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights (the Paris Principles). 
</p>
<p>16. In Costa Rica, the Regional Office for Central America will continue supporting and 
</p>
<p>assisting the country to strengthen the capacity of the inter-institutional commission to 
</p>
<p>follow-up on the implementation of recommendations from human rights mechanisms and 
</p>
<p>providing technical advice on prioritized recommendations. In particular, OHCHR will 
</p>
<p>assist in defining a roadmap to follow up on universal periodic review recommendations 
</p>
<p>from the first and second cycle, and assist in the mainstreaming of recommendations from 
</p>
<p>all human rights mechanisms in United Nations programming and assistance. 
</p>
<p>17. In the Dominican Republic, through the human rights adviser, support will be 
</p>
<p>provided to promote dialogue between State institutions and civil society and to advance 
</p>
<p>the process of designing a national human rights action plan to follow up on universal </p>


<p>periodic review recommendations. Technical advice will also be provided for defining the 
</p>
<p>methodology and timelines in that regard. 
</p>
<p>18. Through the work of the human rights adviser recently deployed to Jamaica, support 
</p>
<p>will be provided for the drafting of a common core document, which will contribute to 
</p>
<p>increasing the capacity of Jamaica to meet its reporting obligations to international human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms as follow-up to universal periodic review recommendations. Support 
</p>
<p>will also be provided for creating a database on human rights recommendations in order to 
</p>
<p>increase the State capacity to follow up on the recommendations of all international human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>19. In Kazakhstan, technical assistance will be provided to the Government to 
</p>
<p>implement the recommendations that were put forward during the second cycle of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review and in which developing and implementing a national action plan 
</p>
<p>on human rights and strengthening the capacity of the national preventative mechanism 
</p>
<p>were called for. Expert advice and guidance will be provided for the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>standing national coordinating mechanism to ensure integrated follow-up to 
</p>
<p>recommendations of human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>20. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia established the Inter-Sectoral Body on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights following its first universal periodic review. That body is composed of the 
</p>
<p>State secretaries of the key ministries and took the lead in coordinating follow-up to 
</p>
<p>recommendations emanating from the universal periodic review and those of the other 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms. Follow-up to the consultations on its second universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review pointed to the need for increased substantive and expert support to the body and for 
</p>
<p>increased capacity through the addition of an &#8220;expert advisory group&#8221;. Technical assistance 
</p>
<p>will be provided to contribute to increasing the capacity of the body and the expert group. 
</p>
<p>Various actions will be undertaken, including a study visit to other States in a similar 
</p>
<p>situation, &#8220;mentoring&#8221; from another State to follow up on improving the process and 
</p>
<p>capacities, training workshops (which will also reinforce the involvement of civil society 
</p>
<p>stakeholders) and seminars on examining recommendations and developing tools to 
</p>
<p>monitor follow-up to recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. In Malaysia, the Human Rights and Development Theme Group of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations country team has been engaging with the Government for the development of a 
</p>
<p>national action plan on the implementation of recommendations of the second-cycle 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review. In that regard, support will be provided to organize consultative 
</p>
<p>meetings between the Government and different stakeholders on the development of the 
</p>
<p>action plan. The National Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, part of the 
</p>
<p>Governmental Task Force on the development of the national human rights action plan, 
</p>
<p>intends to develop a database to track the implementation of the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations, in consultation with the Government of Malaysia. Support will hence be 
</p>
<p>provided to Commission for developing such a database, which will be modelled on a good 
</p>
<p>practice example in the area from other countries.  
</p>
<p>22. In Mali, technical assistance will be provided to strengthen the national follow-up 
</p>
<p>processes. Hence, assistance will specifically be aimed at: initiating a discussion on the 
</p>
<p>relevance of merging various interdepartmental committees that exist in the country; 
</p>
<p>supporting the Malian authorities in preparing an implementation action plan for universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review recommendations; and supporting the National Steering Committee 
</p>
<p>pending the merging of the various existing interdepartmental committees. A national 
</p>
<p>consultant will assist the authorities in drafting the action plan for the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Following a request from the Government of Mauritania for support in the 
</p>
<p>development and implementation of a strategy to follow up on the recommendations of the </p>


<p>universal periodic review and other human rights mechanisms in coordination with and 
</p>
<p>with the support of the United Nations country team, technical assistance will be provided 
</p>
<p>to the Government, which has committed to setting up the Inter-Ministerial Technical 
</p>
<p>Committee, which will take action to implement the recommendations of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review and of other human rights mechanisms. That technical assistance is 
</p>
<p>specifically geared towards supporting the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Technical 
</p>
<p>Committee responsible for implementation, monitoring and reporting to treaty bodies, 
</p>
<p>special procedures and the universal periodic review. Support will also be provided for 
</p>
<p>drafting a national action plan for implementation. To that end, a workshop on validation of 
</p>
<p>the National Action Plan for the implementation of recommendations of treaty bodies, 
</p>
<p>special procedures and the universal periodic review will be organized with the 
</p>
<p>participation of the National Human Rights Commission and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>24. In Nigeria, assistance will be provided to the Government to strengthen the Inter-
</p>
<p>Ministerial Committee and for drafting a national plan of action for the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review recommendations in collaboration with concerned 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including the National Human Rights Commission and civil society actors. 
</p>
<p>To achieve that, in addition to the OHCHR Human Rights Adviser&#8217;s providing assistance, a 
</p>
<p>national consultant will also be recruited who will assist the Inter-Ministerial Committee in 
</p>
<p>drafting the plan of action and finalizing the reports due to treaties bodies. 
</p>
<p>25. In Paraguay, the Human Rights Adviser will continue providing technical assistance 
</p>
<p>to State institutions in two areas: (a) to implement prioritized recommendations in three 
</p>
<p>thematic areas and (b) to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice and the Human Rights Network of the Executive Branch to monitor and 
</p>
<p>report on progress in the implementation of international human rights recommendations 
</p>
<p>through a monitoring system developed as part of the cooperation. Specifically, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>will continue providing technical assistance, specialized training and support to hold broad 
</p>
<p>consultations with target groups, to enhance the capacity of the Secretariat of Social Action, 
</p>
<p>the Institute for Indigenous Issues and the National Secretary for the Human Rights of 
</p>
<p>People with Disabilities to apply a human rights-based approach in the definition of policies 
</p>
<p>related to the fight against poverty, the protection of indigenous peoples and the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities. OHCHR will also continue assisting Paraguay in enhancing the 
</p>
<p>capacity of institutions to use the SIMORE database (Monitoring System on International 
</p>
<p>Recommendations) developed as part of the first phase of the cooperation provided by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR. In addition, and at the request of the Government, OHCHR will also provide the 
</p>
<p>necessary technical support and assistance to establish a link between the SIMORE 
</p>
<p>database and the Universal Human Rights Index database managed by OHCHR in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>26. In Rwanda, a national consultant will be hired to carry out, under the supervision of 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Adviser, the following main activities. Firstly, he will provide technical 
</p>
<p>support to strengthen the capacity of the Treaty Body Reporting Task Force of the 
</p>
<p>Government of Rwanda, which developed the universal periodic review roadmap after the 
</p>
<p>2011 review and has been entrusted with the implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>Secondly, he will support the National Commission for Human Rights and relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in developing and implementing human rights-related policies. That national 
</p>
<p>consultant is an integral part of the Resident Coordinator&#8217;s Office, focusing on follow-up to 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review and the relevant programmes to be developed under the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Development Assistance Plan Flagship Programme known as &#8220;Access to 
</p>
<p>Justice, Human Rights and Peace Consolidation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>27. In Senegal, technical assistance will be provided to the Technical Committee that 
</p>
<p>will review the National Action Plan for implementation of the recommendations of 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic review. </p>


<p>28. Following a request for financial and technical assistance from Seychelles, technical 
</p>
<p>assistance will be provided to strengthen the national human rights institution to ensure its 
</p>
<p>compliance with the Paris Principles, which will take the form of assisting with the review 
</p>
<p>of the relevant legislation and the drafting of an amendment bill, as well as a review of the 
</p>
<p>current structural set-up of the institution. Assistance will be provided with the 
</p>
<p>development of a coordinating mechanism for human rights education. Assistance will also 
</p>
<p>be provided with a view to strengthening the capacity of law enforcement officials to 
</p>
<p>ensure respect for juvenile justice standards, which will take the form of aiding in the 
</p>
<p>assessment of current practices and the establishment of standards and procedures. 
</p>
<p>29. In Solomon Islands, support will be provided through the deployment of a National 
</p>
<p>United Nations Volunteer to be based in the Ministry of Justice and Legal Affairs. This 
</p>
<p>Volunteer will work closely with relevant government entities, civil society, United Nations 
</p>
<p>agencies and regional organizations in order to promote and support the establishment of an 
</p>
<p>inter-ministerial coordinating committee in charge of reporting to international human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic review and treaty bodies. The 
</p>
<p>Volunteer will also assist the Government in preparing its second-cycle universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review report by taking stock of the level of implementation of the recommendations from 
</p>
<p>the first cycle, including through consultations with various stakeholders on shortfalls, 
</p>
<p>developments and activities related to those recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. In Sudan, technical assistance will be provided with strengthening the capacity of 
</p>
<p>the Special Criminal Court on the Events in Darfur. That assistance will take the form of a 
</p>
<p>training course for judges and court staff on the application of international standards in the 
</p>
<p>delivery of criminal justice. Training courses on criminal investigations will also be 
</p>
<p>provided. The technical assistance will be provided in accordance with recommendations 
</p>
<p>relating, inter alia, to support for the rule of law and the delivery of justice in Darfur, and 
</p>
<p>the organization of training programmes for judicial and law enforcement personnel, all of 
</p>
<p>which enjoy the support of Sudan. 
</p>
<p>31. In Tajikistan, technical assistance will be provided to the Government to strengthen 
</p>
<p>the structure and capacity of the national coordination mechanism in order to ensure 
</p>
<p>effective coordination and monitoring of follow-up to the recommendations of human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms. In particular, the regulatory framework of the national coordination 
</p>
<p>mechanism will be amended and improved based on expert advice to be provided as part of 
</p>
<p>that technical assistance. A series of training sessions and workshops on international 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms and their reporting requirements will be organized for various 
</p>
<p>ministries&#8217; representatives of the national coordination mechanism to ensure their effective 
</p>
<p>input in the follow-up and reporting processes. 
</p>
<p>32. In Timor-Leste, a broad-based National Directive Commission composed of 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Government, the national human rights institution, civil society and 
</p>
<p>the private sector was established in 2014 to draft a national human rights action plan. 
</p>
<p>Support will be provided to increase the capacity of that Commission to draft the action 
</p>
<p>plan through an inclusive and participatory process. The action-planning process will 
</p>
<p>include an exercise of prioritization of key recommendations made to date to Timor-Leste 
</p>
<p>during the universal periodic review and by other United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. Support will also be provided for the drafting of a baseline study, public 
</p>
<p>consultations, capacity development of Commission members and a public information 
</p>
<p>campaign to disseminate information on the action-planning process, seeking input from 
</p>
<p>the public. 
</p>
<p>33. In Afghanistan, support will be provided to the Human Rights Support Unit of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice for reviewing and updating the National Action Plan on Implementation 
</p>
<p>of Recommendations from United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mechanisms 
</p>
<p>following the examination of the periodic reports by Afghanistan by the Committee on </p>


<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (2010), the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women (2013) and the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</p>
<p>(2011), and the universal periodic review (2014). More specifically, support will be 
</p>
<p>provided for follow-up and tracking of the status of the implementation of 
</p>
<p>recommendations of international human rights mechanisms by State institutions. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, support will be provided to the Unit to: ensure the compliance of all Afghan 
</p>
<p>laws, regulations, policies, strategies and State programmes with international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards to which Afghanistan is a State party; raise awareness and build the capacity of 
</p>
<p>State officials on human rights commitments; and provide technical assistance and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building within the Unit in its coordination of the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. In Bhutan, a United Nations Volunteer will be attached to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>country team or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide technical support to the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Foreign Affairs for the establishment of an inter-ministerial coordination body. 
</p>
<p>35. Continuing support has also been provided on the ground for follow-up to 
</p>
<p>recommendations of international human rights mechanisms in the framework of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations country programming. For instance, based on the experience of cooperation with 
</p>
<p>Barbados in 2015, OHCHR will extend cooperation to English-speaking Eastern Caribbean 
</p>
<p>States, through support to be provided by a national human rights institution and universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review focal point based at the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator 
</p>
<p>in Barbados and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, and working closely with 
</p>
<p>United Nations entities in the region. Activities will focus on raising awareness of human 
</p>
<p>rights and the United Nations protection mechanisms; encouraging concrete actions by 
</p>
<p>Governments to address the recommendations made by international human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, the establishment of inter-institutional coordinating mechanisms, the creation 
</p>
<p>of follow-up plans and the development of tools; and providing technical advice and 
</p>
<p>support to build and strengthen existing national capacities to promote and protect human 
</p>
<p>rights.  
</p>
<p>36. The OHCHR Regional Office for South America will continue supporting 
</p>
<p>Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay to enhance their capacity to follow up 
</p>
<p>on the recommendations of international human rights mechanisms, including through 
</p>
<p>cooperation within the framework of the United Nations country programming. In 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the United Nations country teams, and with expert advice and support 
</p>
<p>from the Regional Office, OHCHR will continue to provide support to the Governments 
</p>
<p>and civil society in analysing and reviewing key universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations, establishing inter-institutional mechanisms, defining road maps and 
</p>
<p>identifying the needs for capacity-building and technical assistance, which have been 
</p>
<p>integrated into the respective United Nations common country programming documents, 
</p>
<p>such as the United Nations Development Assistance Framework. Furthermore, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>will support the documenting and sharing of good practices of cooperation with United 
</p>
<p>Nations human rights mechanisms among countries of the region, as well as those of 
</p>
<p>strategies and policies to address key thematic human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>37. Moreover, technical assistance and support will be provided to a number of States 
</p>
<p>focusing on priority thematic issues. For instance, in the Philippines, a seminar package 
</p>
<p>will be provided to the Philippines Human Rights Commission through the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Programme in order for it to organize a workshop on the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>national preventative mechanism envisaged under the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In 
</p>
<p>Thailand, the Ministry of Justice has been taking the lead to prepare for the ratification of 
</p>
<p>the Optional Protocol. Support in that regard will be provided to the Ministry of Justice </p>


<p>with a view to increasing awareness and understanding among the concerned agencies in 
</p>
<p>terms of the implication of ratifying the Optional Protocol. 
</p>
<p>38. In view of specific recommendations accepted by Panama on intensifying its efforts 
</p>
<p>to guarantee the right of all children to birth registration during its 2010 universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review, a project initiated in 2013 is focusing on ensuring birth registration of indigenous 
</p>
<p>children in remote areas. The OHCHR Regional Office in Central America based in 
</p>
<p>Panama, in cooperation with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), is assisting 
</p>
<p>the National Directorate of Civil Registry of the Electoral Tribunal in reaching out to 
</p>
<p>indigenous Ngabe-Bugle communities of Mama Tata religion that have traditionally 
</p>
<p>refused to be registered.

</p>
<p>40. Since the establishment of the Voluntary Fund in 2009, eight countries have made 
</p>
<p>financial contributions: Australia, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Germany, Morocco, Norway, the 
</p>
<p>Russian Federation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Table 2 
</p>
<p>provides an overview of all contributions received for the reporting period, from the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the Fund to 31 December 2014. Additional financial contributions from 
</p>
<p>Germany have been received during the period January&#8211;March 2015.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>41. With the newly revitalized OHCHR strategic vision for follow-up to universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review that enables OHCHR to provide systematic support to States focusing on 
</p>
<p>national follow-up processes, and in line with the projects outlined above for 2015, 
</p>
<p>allocations have significantly increased. Out of a balance of US$ 1,852,673 as at 31 
</p>
<p>December 2014, US$ 1,653,923 have been allocated in 2015. Hence, it is critical to expand 
</p>
<p>the donor base of the Fund and to receive further funding in order to sustain and ensure the 
</p>
<p>universal application of the new strategic vision for follow-up to all Member States, in line 
</p>
<p>with the universality principle of the universal periodic review mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>Securing the political will and enhancing the ability of States to bring about 
</b></p>
<p><b>tangible results with a view to improving the human rights situation are the key 
</b></p>
<p><b>objectives of technical assistance and financial support. With a view to achieving those 
</b></p>
<p><b>objectives, the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review continues to serve as a valuable 
</b></p>
<p><b>source of support for countries in the implementation of their universal periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>review recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>As has been demonstrated, a revitalized OHCHR strategic vision for follow-up 
</b></p>
<p><b>to universal periodic review that is more proactive, systematic and results-oriented 
</b></p>
<p><b>has enabled OHCHR to provide systematic support to States in fulfilling their 
</b></p>
<p><b>primary responsibility to implement the universal periodic review recommendations. </b></p>


<p><b>Particular emphasis has been placed on the importance of establishing and/or 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening national follow-up processes, including support given to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment of an inter-institutional body, design of an achievable implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>action plan and support given to implementation of priority thematic issues identified 
</b></p>
<p><b>in such an implementation action plan.  
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>It is also hoped that an integrated approach to following up on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations of international human rights mechanisms, including treaty bodies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>special procedures and the universal periodic review, continues to be applied as 
</b></p>
<p><b>broadly and systematically as possible, which will help States to bring about concrete 
</b></p>
<p><b>results for the promotion and protection of human rights on the ground.  
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>A growing body of good practices on follow-up to the universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p><b>has been generated, which is being documented by various actors, including civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society organizations. OHCHR continues to pay attention to the need to document 
</b></p>
<p><b>such good practices in a more systematic way as a priority, and will make every effort 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure that good practices on national follow-up processes, including on how the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations agencies at country level are working together to promote Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Up Front and on follow-up to common global thematic human rights issues, 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as global themes such as prevention of violence against women and prevention of 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture, are documented and shared to enable other States to replicate them, while 
</b></p>
<p><b>tailoring them to their own specific needs.  
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>It should be re-emphasized that the primary responsibility for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of recommendations emanating from universal periodic review rests 
</b></p>
<p><b>with States themselves and, as appropriate, with other relevant stakeholders. Hence, it 
</b></p>
<p><b>is crucially important that the active participation of other stakeholders in the follow-
</b></p>
<p><b>up process be secured and encouraged. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>It should also be emphasized that it is vital that more contributions be made to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Voluntary Fund in order to ensure the sustainability of support to States in 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing recommendations of international human rights mechanisms in a more 
</b></p>
<p><b>systematic and integrated manner.
