<p><i> The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 7/28 of 28 March 2008, entitled &#8220;Missing 
persons&#8221;, in which the Council decided to hold a panel discussion on the question of missing 
persons at its ninth session and to invite experts of the International Committee of the Red Cross, 
delegates of Governments and non-governmental organizations as well as national human 
rights institutions and international organizations to participate therein, and requested the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a summary of the panel&#8217;s deliberations with a 
view to subsequently charging the Advisory Committee, at the same session, with the

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Based on </i>the preliminary discussions held by the Advisory Committee at its first session,

<p><i> Noting</i> the importance of designating a member of the Advisory Committee to follow 
closely the panel discussion and stressing that no financial resources will be required to that end, 
</p>
<p><i> Entrusts</i> Mr. Latif Huseynov and Mr. Ansar Burney, who are to be involved in the

<p> <i>The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 6/30, in which the Council requested the 
Advisory Committee to integrate regularly and systematically a gender perspective into the 
implementation of their mandates, including when examining the intersection of multiple forms 
of discrimination against women and to include in their reports information on and qualitative 
analysis of human rights of women and girls,

<p><b>1/5. Elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy

</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 8/13 of 18 June 2008, entitled &#8220;Elimination of 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i> Based on</i> the discussion held at the first session of the Advisory Committee, 
</p>
<p><i> Designates </i>Shigeki Sakamoto to carry out the tasks of (<i>a</i>) following up on the activities of 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, attending the meeting to 
be convened by the Office if extrabudgetary funding is available for an exchange of views 
among the relevant actors; (<i>b</i>) examining the reports to be transmitted by the Office regarding 
information on measures that Governments have taken to eliminate leprosy-related 
discrimination; and (<i>c</i>) formulating a draft set of principles and guidelines for the elimination of 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members, for review by the 
Advisory Committee at its next session in January 2009 and for consideration by the 
Human Rights Council by September 2009.

14 August 2008 
</i></p>
<p><b>1/6. Hunger refugees:  good offices of the Human Rights Council  
and the Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee notes that at its first session, held 
from 4 to 15 August 2008, and in the context of the preliminary activities carried out under 
Human Rights Council resolution 7/14, the Advisory Committee acquainted itself with the drama 
of hunger refugees on several continents. 
</p>
<p>2. The Advisory Committee is concerned by the situation of hunger refugees, who place 
their lives in danger when they flee from their famine-hit countries, only to find themselves 
turned back by the countries of arrival even before their cases have been examined. 
</p>
<p>3. Other hunger refugees, rejected by neighbouring countries, run the risk of political 
persecution on account of their flight after they have been forcibly returned to their countries 
of origin. 
</p>
<p>4. The Advisory Committee therefore suggests that the Council and the Secretary-General 
make available their good offices so as to extend the right to non-refoulement to hunger refugees 
in such situations.

<p><b>1/7.  Realization of the right to food in United Nations refugee camps 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>that, during its first session, held in Geneva from 4 to 15 August 2008, the 
Advisory Committee established a drafting group on the right to food, in pursuance of 
Human Rights Council resolution 7/14, and that the drafting group is to prepare appropriate 
recommendations for the Advisory Committee session in January 2009, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind </i>that the preliminary hearings held by the Advisory Committee and the 
drafting group during the first session revealed that large numbers of refugees and displaced 
persons in many camps run by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees are seriously and continuously underfed, 
</p>
<p> <i>Considering </i>that, in some camps over 80 per cent of all children under 10 years of age 
suffer from anaemia and are incapable of following school programmes of the Office, for 
example, 
</p>
<p> <i>Gravely concerned </i>that this dramatic situation is principally due to the shortfall in 
voluntary contributions to the Office by States members of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting </i>that the failure to assist persons suffering from undernourishment and hunger 
constitutes a violation of the right to food, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> the territorial and extraterritorial obligations of States to respect, protect 
and realize the right to food, as defined in article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and interpreted in general comment No. 12 of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Suggests </i>that the Council, at its next session, launch an urgent appeal to Member States to 
increase their voluntary contributions substantially and as soon as possible so as to enable the 
Office to discharge its mandate. 
</p>
<p><i>15th meeting 
14 August 2008 
</i></p>
<p><b>1/8.  Drafting group on the right to food:  programme of work 
</b></p>
<p>1. Recalling Human Rights Council resolution 7/14, in which the Council requested the 
Human Rights Council Advisory Committee to consider potential recommendations for approval 
by the Council on possible further measures to enhance the realization of the right to food, 
bearing in mind the priority importance of promoting the implementation of existing standards, 
the Advisory Committee, at its first session, held from 4 to 15 August 2008, conducted a </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>discussion on the issue of the right to food and established a drafting group consisting of experts 
from each regional group: Mr. Jos&#233; Antonio Bengoa Cabello, Ms. Chung Chinsung, 
Mr. Latif Huseynov, Mr. Jean Ziegler and Ms. Mona Zulficar. In the course of its work, the 
drafting group held meetings and hearings with representatives of the United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees. 
</p>
<p>2. The drafting group proposes that the structure of its report to the Council be as follows: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The right to food and the current food crisis: 
</p>
<p>(i) The current food crisis: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Increase in food prices 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Increase in poverty 
</p>
<p>(ii) Causes, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Speculation 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The conversion of food into biofuel 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Agricultural export subsidies 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Rising oil prices 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The increase in demand for food 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Financial measures made by certain international financial agencies (such as 
the International Monetary Fund) 
</p>
<p>(iii) Consequences: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Countries in danger 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Hunger refugees 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Hunger in refugee camps 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The negative impact on the situation of peasants 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) State obligations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Recommendations on measures. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>3. The drafting group deems necessary that two further related studies be undertaken, and 
recommends that the Council entrust it with the task of preparing these studies, namely: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Current food crisis, the right to food and hunger refugees: definition and situation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Current food crisis, the right to food and the rights of peasants. 
</p>
<p>4. The drafting group proposes the following timetable for its work: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The drafting group shall work during the period between August and December 2008 
to draft the above-mentioned report; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The drafting group proposes holding a meeting of its members to review the draft 
report during the two days prior to the next session of the Advisory Committee, scheduled to be 
held in January 2009; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The Advisory Committee shall, at the above-mentioned session, consider the draft 
report submitted by the drafting group on the right to food. 
</p>
<p>5. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Council, at its next session, to approve the 
preparation of the studies on hunger refugees and the rights of peasants, as recommended in 
paragraph 3 above, so that the Advisory Committee may subsequently appoint experts to conduct 
such studies and determine the timetable for their realization. 
</p>
<p>6. The Advisory Committee also recommends that the Council allocate the resources 
necessary to cover the drafting group meeting, to be held two days prior to the next session of the 
Advisory Committee.

<p><b>1/9.  Official summary records 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>At its 16th plenary meeting, held on 15 August 2008, the Advisory Committee, taking into 
account the experiences gathered at its session, recommended that the Human Rights Council 
request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take the 
necessary steps to provide official summary records of all plenary meetings held by its Advisory 
Committee. It also recommended that webcasting be made available to it to enhance access to its 
proceedings by the public at large.

<p><b>1/10. Publication of studies completed by the Sub-Commission  
on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee</i>, </p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the clear public interest on the part of States, civil society and the academic 
community in the provision of access to the wealth of varied analytical and theoretical 
knowledge built up by the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recommends</i> that the Human Rights Council authorize that all reports and working papers 
that have been completed and submitted to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights pursuant to the resolutions and decisions of the Sub-Commission at its 
fifty-eighth session be issued as United Nations documents and be sent to the Council.

<p><b>1/11.  New bodies established by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p> At its 16th plenary meeting, held on 15 August 2008, the Advisory Committee designated 
Committee members Mr. Jos&#233; Bengoa and Ms. Purificacion Valera Quisumbing to follow the 
work of the Social Forum and to brief the Committee, at its next session in January 2009, on 
issues of relevance to the work of the Committee. The Advisory Committee also designated the 
members Ms. Mona Zulficar and Mr. Miguel Alfonso Martinez to follow the work of the forum 
on minority issues and the expert mechanism on the rights of indigenous peoples, respectively, 
and to brief the Committee at its next session on issues of relevance to its work. 
</p>
<p><i>16th meeting 
15 August 2008 
</i></p>
<p><b>1/12.  The right of peoples to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council Advisory Committee</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, section III, paragraph 77, in which the 
Council stated that the Advisory Committee may make research proposals within the scope of 
the work set out by the Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 62/144 of 18 December 2007 on the 
universal realization of the right of peoples to self-determination, in which the Assembly 
requested the Council to continue to give special attention to the violation of human rights, 
especially the right to self-determination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> <i>also</i> the different points of view expressed by a large number of 
participants on the various and complex issues relating to the content and realization of the right 
of all peoples, including indigenous peoples, to self-determination. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Will consider</i> this matter only if the Human Rights Council addresses a request regarding 
this matter to the Advisory Committee. 
</p>
<p><i>16th meeting 
15 August 2008 
</i></p>
<p><b>1/13.  Sub-Commission studies 
</b></p>
<p>1. The President of the Human Rights Council, at the inauguration of the first session of the 
Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, stated that the Sub-Commission had left behind a 
substantial body of studies of varying status: some were considered finished by the experts of the 
Sub-Commission, while others were considered to be &#8220;work in progress&#8221; at the time that body 
ceased to exist in 2006. He added that all of these studies had been incorporated in the final 
report of the Sub-Commission transmitted to the Council in 2006. The Council did not address 
the matter in the context of the adoption of the resolution 5/1 and therefore, the status of those 
studies or papers which were listed therein but not acted upon by the Council remained unclear. 
The President of the Council concluded that the suggestions of the Advisory Committee could be 
of great value in determining how the legacy of its predecessor body, the Sub-Commission, 
should be addressed by the Council.  
</p>
<p>2. On the same occasion, the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights stated to the 
Committee members that it was now in their hands, as members of this new human rights body, 
to propose to the Council any other pending studies and mandates of the Sub-Commission that 
should be concluded or completed in the course of the Committee&#8217;s future work. 
</p>
<p>3. In the light of the above statements, and bearing in mind paragraph 77 of the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, the Advisory Committee suggests that the Council examine and 
eventually take the decisions it may consider fit for a possible follow-up to all studies 
commissioned by the Sub-Commission now pending a decision from the Council (see annex), 
in connection with, inter alia, the following studies: 
</p>
<p> (a) Discrimination in the criminal justice system; 
 (b) Corruption and its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights; 
 (c) Discrimination based on work and descent; 
</p>
<p> (d) The role of States in the guarantee of human rights with reference to the activities of 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>4. The Advisory Committee&#8217;s membership includes experts with recognized knowledge on 
matters dealt with in the studies included in the annex to the present text.

intergovernmental organizations, national human rights institutions and non-governmental 
organizations; then Government observers. 
</p>
<p>23. The Advisory Committee also accepted the recommendation of the Bureau on the 
permitted duration and frequency of statements. Members of the Advisory Committee would be

 page 31 
 
</p>
<p>24. Following the practice in other bodies of the United Nations, special rapporteurs and 
authors of working papers and the relevant representatives of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) would be given the floor at the beginning of 
each relevant agenda item or sub-item for the introduction of their reports. The special rapporteur 
and other experts entrusted with the preparation of any such reports or working papers could 
speak for a maximum of 20 minutes, to be divided between the introduction of the report and 
concluding remarks. An interactive discussion with other experts and observers would follow the 
oral introduction of the report. 
</p>
<p>25. Observers for non-governmental organizations would be limited to one statement of 
seven minutes for each item or sub-item. With regard to joint statements by non-governmental 
organizations, the following timing was agreed upon: for 1 or 2 non-governmental organizations, 
7 minutes; for 3 to 5 non-governmental organizations, 10 minutes; for 6 to 10 non-governmental 
organizations, 12 minutes; and for more than 10 non-governmental organizations, 15 minutes. 
Non-governmental organizations making joint statements may request to speak before 
non-governmental organizations speaking individually. 
</p>
<p>26. Observers for intergovernmental organizations, United Nations bodies, specialized 
agencies, national human rights institutions and other organizations would be limited to making 
one statement of seven minutes for each item or sub-item; that speaking time would also apply to 
Government observers. It was also agreed that statements by Government observers, under any 
agenda item or sub-item, should not address the human rights situation in countries other than 
their own. Statements in exercise of that right should be limited to three minutes for the first 
statement and two minutes for the second, normally to be exercised at the end of the general 
debate on any particular agenda item. 
</p>
<p>27. The Chairperson called on all participants to avoid personal attacks and non-parliamentary 
language that might bring into question the character and integrity of any other participant. 
</p>
<p>28. It was also agreed that the list of speakers would be opened at the beginning of the session 
for all participants to register to speak on any agenda item or sub-item. If the list of speakers is 
not exhausted during a particular meeting, the remaining speakers would be given the floor, in 
the same order, as the first speakers at the next meeting. The closure of the list of speakers on 
any particular item or sub-item would be announced by the Chairperson in good time as the work 
proceeded, normally at the beginning of the consideration of that agenda item or sub-item. 
</p>
<p>29. It was further agreed that, if there were no more speakers on an agenda item or sub-item at 
a particular meeting, the Advisory Committee would take up the next item or sub-item on its 
calendar without closing the discussion on the preceding item or sub-item, if deemed necessary. 
</p>
<p>30. It was agreed that, in order to respect editorial and other requirements, draft 
recommendations and suggestions should, as a general rule, be submitted at least three working 
days before the date on which they were scheduled to be considered for a decision. The deadlines 
for the submission of draft recommendations would be set by the Chairperson in consultation 
with the Bureau and announced sufficiently in advance. </p>

statements or documents only at the back of the conference room. They could also place such 
copies on the tables situated at the back of the room. Non-governmental organizations were not 
to distribute documents, pamphlets or any other material by placing them on the desks of
