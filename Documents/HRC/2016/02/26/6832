<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Section I provides a summary of the activities of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism undertaken since 
15 December 2005.  The next two sections focus on two thematic issues that are of special 
interest to the mandate.  Section II contains an analysis of &#8220;profiling&#8221; in the context of 
countering terrorism.  The Special Rapporteur provides an explanation of the concept of terrorist 
profiling and an overview of the different contexts in which law-enforcement agencies have 
employed terrorist-profiling practices.  He assesses the compliance of so-called terrorist-profiling 
practices with human rights standards and sets out permissible forms of terrorist profiling and 
possible alternatives to the reliance on terrorist profiles.  Section III examines the issue of suicide 
attacks as a form of terrorism.  The Special Rapporteur provides a survey of existing research on 
the phenomenon of suicide terrorism.  He addresses &#8220;shoot-to-kill&#8221; policies and other similar 
attempts to evade existing international standards on the use of firearms by law-enforcement 
officials.  The conclusions and recommendations regarding terrorist profiling and responses to 
suicide attacks as a form of terrorism are contained in section IV.

<p><b>II.  &#8220;PROFILING&#8221; IN THE CONTEXT OF COUNTERING TERRORISM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in recent years, so-called terrorist profiling has 
become an increasingly significant component of States&#8217; counter-terrorism efforts.<b>1</b>  The

(SSRN):  http://ssrn.com/abstract=952163; Moeckli, &#8220;Discriminatory profiles:  law enforcement 
after 9/11 and 7/7&#8221; (2005) (5) <i>European Human Rights Law Review</i>, 517. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26

</p>
<p>European Union (EU) has explicitly asked its member States to cooperate with one another and 
with Europol (the European police office) to develop &#8220;terrorist profiles&#8221;, defined as &#8220;a set of 
physical, psychological or behavioural variables, which have been identified as typical of 
persons involved in terrorist activities and which may have some predictive value in that 
respect&#8221;.<b>2</b>  A group of experts from Europol and several EU member States has been established 
for this purpose.<b>3</b>  Terrorist profiling also occurs in less explicit forms.  For example, 
law-enforcement agents often rely on sets of physical or behavioural characteristics when 
deciding whom to stop and search for counter-terrorism purposes. 
</p>
<p>33. &#8220;Profiling&#8221; is generally defined as the systematic association of sets of physical, 
behavioural or psychological characteristics with particular offences and their use as a basis 
for making law-enforcement decisions.  Profiles can be either <i>descriptive</i>, i.e. designed to 
identify those likely to have committed a particular criminal act and thus reflecting the 
evidence the investigators have gathered concerning this act; or they may be <i>predictive</i>, 
i.e. designed to identify those who may be involved in some future, or as-yet-undiscovered, 
crime.  In the view of the Special Rapporteur, profiling is, in principle, a permissible means of 
law-enforcement activity.  Detailed profiles based on factors that are statistically proven to 
correlate with certain criminal conduct may be effective tools better to target limited 
law-enforcement resources. 
</p>
<p>34. However, when law-enforcement agents use broad profiles that reflect unexamined 
generalizations, their practices may constitute disproportionate interferences with human rights.  
In particular, profiling based on stereotypical assumptions that persons of a certain &#8220;race&#8221;, 
national or ethnic origin or religion are particularly likely to commit crime may lead to practices 
that are incompatible with the principle of non-discrimination.  It is therefore of grave concern 
to the Special Rapporteur that, since 11 September 2001, law-enforcement authorities of 
different States have adopted counter-terrorism practices that are based on terrorist profiles 
that include characteristics such as a person&#8217;s presumed &#8220;race&#8221;, ethnicity, national origin or 
religion. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur notes that terrorist profiles have been employed, for example, in 
the context of data-mining initiatives, i.e. searches of personal data sets according to presumed 
characteristics of suspects.  An illustrative case is the so-called <i>Rasterfahndung</i> programme, 
initiated by the German authorities in the wake of 11 September 2001 to identify terrorist 
&#8220;sleepers&#8221;.  The German police forces collected personal records of several million persons from

<p>public and private databases.<b>4</b>  The criteria for the search included:  being male; age 18-40; 
current or former student; Muslim denomination; link through birth or nationality to one of 
several specified countries with a predominantly Muslim population.  Approximately 
32,000 persons were identified as potential terrorist sleepers and more closely examined.  In 
<i>none</i> of these cases did the <i>Rasterfahndung</i> lead to the bringing of criminal charges for 
terrorism-related offences.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>36. Terrorist profiling based on national or ethnic origin and religion has also been used in 
the context of immigration controls.  In the United States, the immigration authorities have 
adopted a series of policies and practices designed to counter terrorism that single out 
certain groups of immigrants based on their country of origin or nationality and, indirectly 
through the choice of the targeted countries, their ethnicity and religion.  Under the 
Voluntary Interview Program, male immigrants, who were not suspected of any criminal 
activity, were selected for questioning solely because they were of a certain age, had entered 
the United States after January 2000 and originated from countries &#8220;in which intelligence 
indicated that there was an Al-Qaida terrorist presence or activity&#8221;.<b>6</b>  Although the authorities 
did not identify these countries, almost all the 8,000 men eventually interviewed were 
Arab and/or Muslim.<b>7</b>  The National Security Entry-Exit Registration System imposed 
fingerprinting, photographing and registration requirements for all males who are citizens 
of, or were born in, certain designated countries;<b>8</b> all of these countries - except for the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea - have predominantly Arab and/or Muslim populations.<b>9</b>

<p>Finally, the Absconder Apprehension Initiative prioritized the enforcement of deportation orders 
against those 2 per cent of deportable persons who originate from Arab and/or Muslim 
countries.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>37. In some cases, police forces have relied on profiles based on a person&#8217;s ethnic and/or 
religious appearance when conducting stops, document checks or searches for counter-terrorism 
purposes.  In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, government officials 
have openly acknowledged that law-enforcement efforts in the counter-terrorism context focus 
on particular ethnic or religious groups.<b>11</b>  Accordingly, stops and searches under section 44 of 
the Terrorism Act 2000, which authorizes the police in designated areas to stop and search 
people without having to show reasonable suspicion, have affected ethnic minorities.  Between 
2001-2002 and 2002-2003, for example, the number of persons of Asian ethnicity subjected to 
section 44 searches rose by 302 per cent as compared to a rise of 118 per cent for white people.  
By 2003-2004, Asian people were about 3.6 times more likely, and black people about 4.3 times 
more likely, to be stopped and searched under counter-terrorism legislation than white people.<b>12</b>  
Similarly, police forces in the Russian Federation have subjected ethnic minorities to stops and 
document checks, which are often carried out in response to terrorist threats.  A study of police 
practices on the Moscow metro system in 2005 found that persons of non-Slavic appearance 
were, on average, 21.8 times more likely to be stopped than Slavs.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Compliance with human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>Non-discrimination and other human rights norms 
</b></p>
<p>38. Terrorist-profiling practices raise concerns with regard to a number of human rights 
guarantees.  In the view of the Special Rapporteur, data-mining initiatives based on broad 
terrorist profiles that include group characteristics such as religion and national origin may 
constitute a disproportionate and thus arbitrary interference with the right to privacy,

described above, violates the constitutional right to privacy.  The Court held that the preventive 
use of this profiling method would only be compatible with the proportionality requirement if it 
were shown that there was a &#8220;concrete danger&#8221; to national security or human life, rather than a 
general threat situation as it existed since 11 September 2001.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>39. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur takes the view that stops and searches of persons that 
are based on stereotypical assumptions that certain religious or ethnic groups are more likely to 
pose a terrorist threat than others may amount to a disproportionate and arbitrary interference 
with the freedom of movement, guaranteed by article 12 of ICCPR, the right to privacy, 
guaranteed by article 17 and/or the right to personal liberty, guaranteed by article 9. 
</p>
<p>40. In addition, the Special Rapporteur observes that any terrorist-profiling practices that are 
based on distinctions according to a person&#8217;s presumed &#8220;race&#8221;, ethnicity, national origin or 
religion raise the question as to their conformity with the principle of non-discrimination.  
Because of its relevance to different forms of terrorist profiling, the Special Rapporteur believes 
that the issue of discrimination deserves particular attention.  The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that profiling based on stereotypical assumptions may bolster sentiments of hostility 
and xenophobia in the general public towards persons of certain ethnic or religious background. 
</p>
<p>41. The guarantees of non-discrimination of articles 2 and 26 of ICCPR prohibit 
discrimination on grounds such as race, national origin and religion.  Discrimination on the basis 
of race and national or ethnic origin is also prohibited by the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).  Article 5 of ICERD explicitly 
prohibits racial discrimination with respect to the &#8220;right to equal treatment before [&#8230;] all [&#8230;] 
organs administering justice&#8221; and to &#8220;freedom of movement&#8221;.<b>15</b>  Furthermore, the prohibition 
against discrimination on the grounds of race and religion is generally accepted as a peremptory 
norm of international law, which cannot be set aside by treaty or acquiescence.<b>16</b>  This view is 
supported by article 4, paragraph 1, of the ICCPR, which makes clear that the right to 
non-discrimination on the grounds of race and religion can never be derogated from, not even 
in times of an officially proclaimed public emergency.  These binding obligations of 
non-discrimination have been reinforced and supplemented by a range of other international and 
regional standards.  The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, for example, provides 
that such officials must &#8220;maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons&#8221;, including the 
right to non-discrimination.<b>17</b>  Similarly, the European Code of Police Ethics of the Council of 
Europe recommends that &#8220;[t]he police shall carry out their tasks in a fair manner, guided, in

<p>particular, by the principles of impartiality and non-discrimination&#8221;.<b>18</b>  A provision specifically 
directed against the use of profiles that are based on racial characteristics is to be found in the 
Programme of Action adopted at the World Conference against Racism in 2000, urging States 
&#8220;to design, implement and enforce effective measures to eliminate the phenomenon popularly 
known as &#8216;racial profiling&#8217;&#8221;.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur notes that several international and regional human rights bodies 
have highlighted the risk of discrimination presented by law-enforcement efforts to counter 
terrorism.  The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has called on States to 
&#8220;ensure that any measures taken in the fight against terrorism do not discriminate, in purpose or 
effect, on the grounds of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin and that non-citizens 
are not subjected to racial or ethnic profiling or stereotyping&#8221;.<b>20</b>  The Special Rapporteur agrees 
with this view and believes that this is equally applicable to the profiling of persons based upon 
their religion.  At the regional level, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in its 
Report on Terrorism and Human Rights, has cautioned that &#8220;any use of profiling or similar 
devices by a state must comply strictly with international principles governing necessity, 
proportionality, and non-discrimination and must be subject to close judicial scrutiny&#8221;.<b>21</b>  The 
European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), in its Policy Recommendation 
No. 8 on combating racism while fighting terrorism, has asked Governments to ensure that no 
discrimination ensues from legislation and regulations, or their implementation, in the field of 
law-enforcement checks.<b>22</b>  Finally, the EU Network of independent experts on fundamental 
rights has expressed serious concerns about the development of terrorist profiles; profiling on the 
basis of characteristics such as nationality, age or birthplace, the experts have cautioned, 
&#8220;presents a major risk of discrimination&#8221;.<b>23</b>

<p>43. The Special Rapporteur finds these pronouncements consistent with the established 
jurisprudence of international human rights bodies interpreting the non-discrimination guarantees 
of the ICCPR and the ICERD, as well as with that of regional bodies on the respective norms 
contained in regional human rights treaties.  According to this jurisprudence, a difference in 
treatment on the basis of a criterion such as race, ethnicity, national origin or religion will only 
be compatible with the principle of non-discrimination if it is supported by objective and 
reasonable grounds.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that terrorist-profiling practices that involve 
distinctions according to a person&#8217;s presumed &#8220;race&#8221; cannot be supported by objective and 
reasonable grounds, because they are based on the wrongful assumption that there are different 
human races and, therefore, inevitably involve unfounded stereotyping through a crude 
categorization of assumed races, such as &#8220;white&#8221;, &#8220;black&#8221; and &#8220;Asian&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Test of legitimate aim and proportionality 
</b></p>
<p>45. As far as distinctions according to national or ethnic origin and religion are concerned, 
the following two sub-tests are generally applicable to determine the existence of an objective 
and reasonable justification.  First, the difference in treatment must pursue a legitimate aim.  
Second, there has to be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the difference in 
treatment and the legitimate aim sought to be realized. 
</p>
<p>46. As far as the first requirement is concerned, the aim of law-enforcement practices that are 
based on terrorist profiling is the prevention of terrorist attacks.  In the view of the Special 
Rapporteur, this constitutes a legitimate and compelling social need. 
</p>
<p>47. The decisive question is therefore whether terrorist-profiling practices, and the 
differential treatment they involve, are a proportionate means of achieving this aim.  In assessing 
proportionality, the Special Rapporteur believes that it is important to consider, first, whether 
terrorist-profiling practices are a suitable and effective means of countering terrorism and, 
second, what kind of negative effects these practices may produce. 
</p>
<p>48. In order to serve as a suitable and effective tool of counter-terrorism, a profile would 
need to be narrow enough to exclude those persons who do not present a terrorist threat and, at 
the same time, broad enough to include those who do.  However, terrorist profiles that are based 
on characteristics such as ethnicity, national origin and religion are regularly inaccurate and both 
over- and under-inclusive.

</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that ethnicity, national origin and religion are 
inaccurate indicators because the initial premise on which they are based, namely that Muslims 
and persons of Middle Eastern and South Asian appearance or origin are particularly likely to be 
involved in terrorist activities, is highly doubtful.  A recent study of Islamist terrorists arrested or 
killed in Western States showed that less than half of them were born in Middle Eastern 
countries.<b>25</b>  Similarly, the Report of the Official Account of the London Bombings has 
concluded that, as far the national, ethnic, religious and social background of potential terrorists 
is concerned, &#8220;there is not a consistent profile to help identify who may be vulnerable to 
radicalization&#8221;.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur observes that, in practice, most terrorist profiles use ethnic 
appearance and national origin as proxies for religion, as religious affiliation is normally not 
readily identifiable (and in any case easy to conceal).  Yet ethnicity and national origin are very 
poor proxies for religion.  For example, only 24 per cent of all Arab Americans are Muslims.<b>27</b>  
In the United Kingdom, where Muslim religion is often associated with &#8220;Asian&#8221; appearance, 
only half of those belonging to this ethnic group are in fact Muslims.<b>28</b>  Thus, profiles based on 
ethnic appearance or national origin are over-inclusive in two respects.  First, many of those 
matching these elements will not be, for example, Muslims.  Second, the overwhelming majority 
of those who <i>are</i> Muslims, for example, have of course nothing to do with terrorism.  As a 
consequence, terrorist-profiling practices that rely on these stereotypical characteristics affect a 
great number of individuals who are in no way linked to terrorism. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that over-inclusive terrorist profiles may 
overwhelm the law-enforcement system.  The broader the profiles, the greater becomes the 
number of people whom the police treat as suspects, even though the vast majority of them will 
turn out to present no risk.  As a consequence, important law-enforcement resources may be 
diverted away from more beneficial work. 
</p>
<p>52. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur believes that profiles based on ethnicity, 
national origin and religion are also under-inclusive in that they will lead law-enforcement 
agents to miss a range of potential terrorists who do not fit the respective profile.  Several of

</p>
<p>recent years&#8217; high profile terrorism suspects would not have been covered by the profile used for 
the German <i>Rasterfahndung</i>.<b>29</b>  This shows that profiles based on ethnicity, national origin or 
religion are easy to evade.  Terrorist groups have regularly proved their ability to adapt their 
strategies, with the use of female and child suicide bombers, to avoid the stereotype of the male 
terrorist as just one example.<b>30</b>  Thus, as law-enforcement specialists acknowledge, any kind of 
terrorist profile based on physical characteristics can easily become self-defeating.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur observes that, accordingly, profiling practices based on ethnicity, 
national origin and religion have proved to be largely unsuccessful.  The German 
<i>Rasterfahndung</i> did not result in a single criminal charge for terrorism-related offences.<b>32</b>  
Instead, the few successes achieved by the German police forces in detecting alleged 
Islamist terrorists were all due to traditional, intelligence-led methods.<b>33</b>  In the United Kingdom, 
the widespread, and ethnically disproportionate, use of stop-and-search powers has produced 
hardly any results.  In 2003-2004, for example, 8,120 pedestrians were stopped under 
section 44 (2) of the Terrorism Act 2000.  Yet these stops led to only five arrests in connection 
with terrorism - a &#8220;success&#8221; rate of 0.06 per cent.  Incidentally, all of those arrested were white.<b>34</b>  
Similarly, the disproportionate targeting of ethnic minorities for stops and document checks in 
the Moscow metro system has proved to be ineffective in detecting and preventing serious 
crime.<b>35</b>  Finally, in the United States, the strategy of mainly targeting immigrants of Middle 
Eastern descent has not produced any significant results in the form of arrests or investigative 
leads.<b>36</b>

<p>54. The available evidence suggests that profiling practices based on ethnicity, national 
origin or religion are an unsuitable and ineffective, and therefore a disproportionate, means of 
countering terrorism:  they affect thousands of innocent people, without producing concrete 
results. 
</p>
<p>55. Moreover, even if the classifications underlying these methods did correspond to a higher 
risk posed by some categories of persons, this would still not mean that their use is justified.  For 
terrorist-profiling practices entail considerable negative effects that must also be factored into the 
proportionality assessment. 
</p>
<p><b>Adverse effects 
</b></p>
<p>56. Profiling practices based on ethnicity, national origin or religion can take a profound 
emotional toll on those subjected to them.  The Special Rapporteur believes that profiling 
practices have a more serious impact than &#8220;neutral&#8221; law-enforcement methods.  While anyone 
stopped, searched or questioned by the police may feel intimidated or degraded to a certain 
extent, the encounter has a particularly humiliating effect when characteristics such as ethnicity 
or religion played a role in the law-enforcement officer&#8217;s decision. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that these individual experiences may translate into 
negative group effects.  Terrorist-profiling practices single out persons for enhanced 
law-enforcement attention simply because they match a set of group characteristics, thus 
contributing to the social construction of all those who share these characteristics as inherently 
suspect.  This stigmatization may, in turn, result in a feeling of alienation among the targeted 
groups. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that the victimization and alienation of certain 
ethnic and religious groups may have significant negative implications for law-enforcement 
efforts, as it involves a deep mistrust of the police.  For the United Kingdom, the Metropolitan 
Police Authority has highlighted &#8220;the huge negative impact&#8221; on community relations of the use 
of stop-and-search powers:  &#8220;It has increased the level of distrust of our police; it has created 
deeper racial and ethnic tensions against the police; &#8230; it has cut off valuable sources of 
community information and intelligence.&#8221;<b>37</b>  The lack of trust between the police and 
communities may be especially disastrous in the counter-terrorism context.  The gathering of 
intelligence is the key to success in largely preventive law-enforcement operations.  Therefore, 
if, as some Governments claim, terrorist &#8220;sleepers&#8221; in their countries are likely to be Muslim, 
Middle Eastern and South Asian men, then it would be crucial for law-enforcement agencies to 
enjoy the cooperation of the respective communities.  To be successful, counter-terrorism 
law-enforcement policies would have to strengthen the trust between the police and 
communities.

</p>
<p><b>C.  Best practices and alternatives to profiling 
</b></p>
<p>59. Despite the human rights concerns outlined above, the use of terrorist profiles that 
include criteria such as ethnicity, national origin and religion is, in the view of the Special 
Rapporteur, not always forbidden.  If, in the context of an investigation into a terrorist crime 
already committed, there are reasonable grounds to assume that the suspect fits a certain 
descriptive profile, then the reliance on characteristics such as ethnic appearance, national origin 
or religion is justified.  Similarly, these factors can be employed to target search efforts where 
there is specific intelligence suggesting that someone fulfilling these characteristics is preparing 
a terrorist act.  The situation is different, however, in the case of preventive counter-terrorism 
efforts that are not intelligence-led.  While profiles used for such efforts may include behavioural 
or psychological characteristics, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that they may not be based 
on stereotypical generalizations that certain ethnic or religious groups pose a greater terrorist risk 
than others. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that, in any event, profiling based on behavioural 
patterns is significantly more efficient than reliance on ethnicity, national origin or religion.  The 
importance of focusing on behaviour is highlighted, for example, by the experiences of the 
United States Customs Service.  In the late 1990&#8217;s, the Customs Service stopped using a profile 
that was based, among other factors, on ethnicity and gender in deciding whom to search for 
drugs.<b>38</b>  Instead, the customs agents were instructed to rely on observational techniques, 
behavioural analysis and intelligence.<b>39</b>  This policy change resulted in a rise in the proportion of 
searches leading to the discovery of drugs of more than 300 per cent.<b>40</b>  The Special Rapporteur 
believes that behaviour is an equally significant indicator in the terrorism context.  He therefore 
urges States to ensure that law-enforcement authorities, when engaging in preventive 
counter-terrorism efforts, use profiles that are based on behavioural, rather than ethnic or 
religious, characteristics.  At the same time, the Special Rapporteur reminds States that 
behavioural indicators must be implemented in a neutral manner and must not be used as mere 
proxies for ethnicity, national origin or religion. 
</p>
<p>61. However, it may not always be possible for law-enforcement agencies to rely on specific 
intelligence or useful behavioural indicators in the context of preventive counter-terrorism 
efforts.  The Special Rapporteur is of the view that in such situations controls should be 
universal, affecting everyone equally.  Where the costs for blanket searches are deemed to be

</p>
<p>too high, the targets for heightened scrutiny must be selected on a random rather than on an 
ethnic or religious basis.  In fact, this is what airlines are already routinely doing.  As opposed to 
profiling, random searches are impossible for terrorists to evade and may thus be more effective 
than profiling.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur reminds States of the crucial importance of good community 
relations for effective measures against terrorism.  Successful counter-terrorism operations 
depend on the cooperation of the communities where the suspects live.  The Special Rapporteur 
therefore calls on States to foster community policing initiatives that build partnerships of trust 
between law-enforcement agencies and ethnic and other communities.  Profiling based on 
ethnicity, national origin and religion may have the contrary effect of alienating communities 
from cooperating with law-enforcement authorities and may thus hamper effective gathering of 
intelligence. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SUICIDE ATTACKS AS A FORM OF TERRORISM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur is mindful of the duty of States to protect the life and security of 
all their inhabitants against terrorist acts.  Preventive action such as profiling addressed in the 
previous chapter of this report is increasingly at the fore of these efforts, both nationally and on 
the international level.  Suicide attacks as a form of terrorism pose a particular challenge to 
counter-terrorism measures that are both effective and compatible with human rights.<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>64. Suicide attacks since 11 September 2001 have received increased attention, both by 
the security systems of States, and in the public debate on terrorism.  States in their 
counter-terrorism efforts have simultaneously opened new ways to interpret old laws, as well as 
enacted new laws which seek to increase the possibilities of State and other security personnel to 
act in identifying and preventing suicide attacks.<b>43</b>  The Special Rapporteur is concerned about 
the increasing discrepancy between the actions taken by many States and the empirical evidence 
of what kind of a danger suicide attacks actually pose and which methods can indeed be defined 
as appropriate.

<p>65. Suicide attacks are a form of terrorism in which the perpetrator is expected to die.  
However, the actual purpose of suicide attacks is not to commit suicide but to kill and injure the 
maximum number of persons.<b>44</b>  Politically motivated suicides may be committed as a form of 
protest, without endangering the lives of others.  Giving up one&#8217;s own life can also happen as an 
intentionally chosen method of warfare between the parties to an armed conflict.  Depending on 
the circumstances, such a method may be lawful or in breach of international humanitarian law.  
As a form of terrorism, however, suicide attacks target &#8220;civilians&#8221; i.e. innocent bystanders or 
members of the general population or segments of it.  Suicide attacks as a form of terrorism aim, 
through a high number of civilian casualties and full media coverage, at the production of a 
negative psychological effect on an entire population and beyond.<b>45</b>  Suicide attacks as a form of 
terrorism are always morally inexcusable. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur notes that language related to warfare is commonly used in the 
context of counter-terrorism, and cautions against this practice, as it frequently leads to 
uncertainty as to the human rights obligations of States in the context of counter-terrorism.  This 
caution is necessary also in respect of suicide attacks as a specific form of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>67. Suicide terrorism often has a political aim.<b>46</b>  It has been used as a method to respond to 
foreign occupation or heavy military action.  Suicide attacks are used to pressure the target 
society to demand that its Government change its policies.<b>47</b>  It is used more generally as a 
method to change current power relationships and, ultimately, to change the world order.<b>48</b>  Even 
though suicide bombers may use religious elements in their rhetoric about killing, the main goal 
is usually secular and political.<b>49</b>

<p>68. A distinction can be made between internal and external use of suicide bombings.  
Internally, suicide bombings may be used as means for the perpetrators to actively seek a 
political solution in their own country or region.  Typical examples are Palestinian suicide 
bombers in Israel and the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka.  External terrorism by means of suicide 
attacks comprises attacks in which the perpetrators act outside of their home territories, such as 
the massive attacks of 11 September 2001.  External suicide terrorism attempts to change 
dominant power relationships in the world and - ultimately - to change the world order. 
</p>
<p>69. Suicide bombings also often occur in the context of armed conflict.  Historical examples 
of warfare using suicide attacks as a method were the Japanese kamikaze bombers at the end of 
the Second World War, and more recently Sri Lanka&#8217;s Tamil Tigers.<b>50</b>  Many Palestinian 
bombers consider Palestine as a country which is forced to exist in circumstances amounting to a 
war; they describe their actions as military defence.<b>51</b>  However, the Special Rapporteur again 
emphasizes that what turns a suicide attack into terrorism, even during an armed conflict, is the 
targeting of civilians as victims. 
</p>
<p>70. Hence, the Special Rapporteur notes that suicide bombings take place in a number of 
political and religious settings.  However, the role of religion, and particularly of Islam, in 
suicide bombings has been the subject of much attention in recent years.  Some researchers have 
pointed out that Islamic suicide bombers argue that their ideology and actions are based on 
religion.  Looking more carefully at the individual cases gives evidence that a typical terrorist 
organization resorting to suicide attacks is rather nourished by national liberation ideologies of 
the nineteenth century than by any Islamic tradition.<b>52</b>  Irrespective of the justification for the 
suicide attacks, their ideologies, symbolism, language and organizational structures resemble the 
anti-colonial struggles.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>71. Some studies link the support for and acceptance of suicide bombings clearly with 
political Islamism.<b>54</b>  According to this research, the greater the commitment to the Islamist

<p>world order the more likely people are to endorse suicide terrorism, while their economic status 
or levels of education are marginal determiners.<b>55</b>  Other researchers point in the opposite 
direction, observing that religious beliefs can both encourage and discourage suicide attacks.<b>56</b>  
Some other researchers have explained the personal motivations behind the terrorist suicide 
bombings by the experience of childhood traumas, when children have experienced their fathers 
being humiliated by military personnel, or themselves being raped by State representatives, and 
not being able to direct their own action so that it could make the feeling of humiliation 
disappear.  In these situations religious or quasi-religious martyrdom can be experienced as a 
chance to reclaim family honour.<b>57</b>  In such circumstances, recruitment of young future suicide 
bombers may become easy, as a perceived way out of the desperate position.<b>58</b> 
</p>
<p>72. According to available sources, a fairly large proportion, 15 to 30 per cent, of suicide 
bombers, are female.  They are active in all organizations, even though in some organizations 
their status is contentious.<b>59</b>  Security measures which ignored women as potential terrorists have 
failed dramatically.  One further challenge has been that female bombers often pretend to be 
pregnant:  this makes them to look vulnerable and helps them to pass security checks.<b>60</b> 
</p>
<p>73. As with other counter-terrorism measures, preventive action and intelligence-gathering 
forms a significant part of States&#8217; responses to terrorism.  In the context of suicide bombings, 
the issue of a &#8220;sleeper&#8221; has gained considerable attention.  The imagery of persons living just 
like anyone else, who are educated and well integrated into modern society, and who would 
suddenly transform into terrorists, has been broadly projected in the debate.<b>61</b>  These sleepers,

<p>as strangers and &#8220;the other&#8221; and as potential suicide bombers, are subject to broad speculations 
as to their identity and the motives behind their actions.  However, research is still scarce as to 
the underlying factors which lead individuals to resort to terrorism and particularly suicide 
bombings.  As was demonstrated with respect to profiling, neither social, national, ethnic 
nor religious background present a basis for predictions of an individual being drawn into 
terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Shoot-to-kill policies 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur notes that suicide bombings present a particular challenge to 
counter-terrorism measures, in that they may cause the loss of many human lives and are 
extremely difficult to predict and prevent.  In addition, suicide bombings are an inexpensive 
form of terrorism, and they may enjoy considerable community support.  The organizations 
behind suicide attacks could not recruit and sustain themselves without acquiescence within the 
larger society.<b>62</b>  Whereas recruitment to terrorist organizations can be very aggressive, suicide 
attackers are mostly volunteers.<b>63</b> 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur observes that many States are trying to carve out considerable 
space for restrictions to internationally recognized human rights and have allowed exceptional 
measures in their fight against suicide bombings as a particularly difficult form of terrorism.  
Surveillance techniques, databanks and data collection, tightened refugee and immigration 
laws and procedures, screening and profiling are some of the counter-terrorism techniques 
which are also motivated on the basis of preventing suicide bombings.  As a fairly large 
proportion of perpetrators of suicide bombings are women, women have also become the focus 
of attention in the measures to counter these attacks.  The human rights guarantees related to 
gender in the context of preventing suicide bombings ought to be a source of particular attention 
of States. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about legal strategies employed by many States, 
such as Nigeria, Myanmar, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States of America to 
extend the powers of policemen to take action against potential suicide bombers.<b>64</b>  Several 
innocent persons have in fact been killed.  He reiterates that the use of lethal force by 
law-enforcement officers must be regulated within the framework of human rights law and its 
strict standard of necessity.

</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has, in several 
of his communications with Governments, drawn attention to the increasing reluctance to respect 
the right to life as a non-derogable human right.<b>65</b>  Several Governments have created their own 
interpretation of what the use of utmost force means.  Such invocations as &#8220;targeted killing&#8221;, or 
&#8220;shoot-to-kill&#8221; are used in order to demarcate a new - officially sanctioned - approach to 
countering terrorism.<b>66</b>  As noted in 2006 by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, human rights law permits the use of lethal force when it is indispensable to 
save human life.  In his communication with Nigeria, this Special Rapporteur stressed that the 
resulting emphasis should be on proportionality, on the use of lethal force as an absolute last 
resort, and only &#8220;when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life&#8221; (see A/HRC/4/20/Add.1).  
The Government of Myanmar was reminded that &#8220;shoot-on-sight policies&#8221; are a deep and 
enduring threat to human rights-based law-enforcement approaches and that law-enforcement 
officials should &#8220;as far as possible apply non-violent means&#8221; before resorting to the use of force 
and firearms. 
</p>
<p>78. It is the view of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
that the rhetoric of &#8220;shoot-to-kill&#8221; should never be used.  It risks conveying the message that 
existing legal standards have been replaced with a vaguely defined licence to kill 
(E/CN.4/2006/53, paras. 45 and 48).  The Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, 
adopted by General Assembly resolution 34/169, and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force 
and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on 
the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (1990):  succinctly stress the limited 
role for lethal force in all enforcement operations.  These instruments are adequate also in 
respect of suicide attacks as a form of terrorism.  There is no need for new standards in respect of 
the use of firearms to prevent suicide terrorism.  The rhetoric of shoot-to-kill serves only to 
displace clear legal standards with a vaguely defined licence to kill, risking confusion among 
law-enforcement officers, endangering innocent persons and rationalizing mistakes, while 
avoiding the genuinely difficult challenges that are posed by the relevant threat (ibid., para. 45).  
Regarding the question of proportionate use of force by law-enforcement officials, see also the 
report to the General Assembly of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions (A/61/311, paras. 33-45).

regrettable security measure error. </p>

</p>
<p><b>C.  Considerations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>79. Upon review of existing research, the Special Rapporteur finds a lack of accurate 
information on the phenomenon of suicide terrorism.  There is a need for Governments to 
carefully assess both the human rights implications and the effectiveness of their measures to 
prevent suicide bombings.  Profiling of potential suicide bombers on the basis of stereotypical 
images of marginalized and fanatic persons prone to manipulation creates a risk of 
discrimination, but may also misdirect efforts to prevent suicide attacks.  Research suggests that 
a typical suicide terrorist does not resemble a murderer or a religious cult member, but is similar 
to an individual who is politically conscious and could join a grass-roots movement in order to 
advance something he or she believes in.<b>67</b> 
</p>
<p>80. Terrorist groupings will continue to find recruits as long as they can offer marginalized 
individuals an illusion of a way out of their desperate situation.  Both the countries concerned 
and other Governments engaged in development cooperation need to enhance the role of women 
and children, addressing their needs and protecting and promoting their human rights:  &#8220;The best 
way to fight the war on terror is to make the terrorist organizations less appealing - to men and to 
women.&#8221;<b>68</b>  Other means for looking for political and social change have to be made available by 
the countries concerned and through a human rights-based approach to development.<b>69</b> 
</p>
<p>81. The available evidence suggests that restrictive asylum and immigration laws, profiling 
practices based on religion, nationality or ethnicity, increased military presence, outsized 
surveillance of public places, surveillance of telephones, text messages (SMS) and e-mails are 
inapt and not productive and thus easily disproportionate means of countering terrorism.  Suicide 
bombings appear to be more politically and socio-economically motivated than religiously or 
ethnically motivated.  The situations in which Governments fear attacks, has prompted reactions 
which clearly do not fulfil the criteria of proportionality.  These reactions must be considered as 
questionable under international human rights law.

&#8220;European Year of Citizenship through Education&#8221; (CAHCIT) to discuss how human rights 
education could contribute to international action against terrorism. The response was that young 
people must be equipped with means of playing an active role in democratic life and in the 
exercise of their rights and responsibilities in the society (paragraph 12 v (e) of the 
recommendation).  See &#8220;Combating terrorism through culture&#8221;, recommendation 1687 (2004) 
(Parliamentary Assembly Doc. 10689, 30 September 2005). </p>

</p>
<p>82. The United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006 includes the following list of 
conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism:  prolonged unresolved conflicts, dehumanization 
of victims of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, lack of rule of law and violations of 
human rights, ethnic, national and religious discrimination, political exclusion, socio-economic 
marginalization, and lack of good governance.  The strategy calls for action to combat these 
conditions while it makes clear that none of these conditions can excuse or justify terrorism.  The 
Special Rapporteur echoes these statements and underlines the need to address the conditions 
mentioned also in order to prevent suicide terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Profiling 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Terrorist-profiling practices that are based on &#8220;race&#8221; are incompatible with human 
rights.  Profiling based on ethnicity, national origin and/or religion involves differential 
treatment of comparable groups of people.  Such differential treatment is only compatible 
with the principle of non-discrimination if it is a proportionate means of countering 
terrorism.  Profiling practices based on ethnicity, national origin and/or religion regularly 
fail to meet this demanding proportionality requirement:  not only are they unsuitable and 
ineffective means of identifying potential terrorists, but they also entail considerable 
negative consequences that may render these measures counterproductive in the fight 
against terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends either universal or random security checks as 
preferred alternatives, instead of measures based on profiling.  Universal or random 
checks are non-discriminatory and at the same time impossible for terrorists to evade, and 
hence more effective than measures based on profiling. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>To the extent that States are to rely on counter-terrorism efforts based on profiling, 
the Special Rapporteur recommends they be based on individual conduct, that is, 
behaviour rather than ethnic or religious characteristics. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States establish clear and strict standards 
as to what factors law-enforcement agents may or may not employ for their search efforts 
in the counter-terrorism context.  These guidelines should make clear that criteria such as 
ethnicity, national origin and religion may only be used in very limited circumstances:  
namely, for <i>descriptive</i> profiles or where there is specific intelligence suggesting that 
someone fulfilling these characteristics is preparing a terrorist act.  Furthermore, these 
standards should make clear that any terrorist-profiling practices that involve interference 
with the freedom of movement, the right to liberty or the right to privacy - regardless of 
the criteria on which they are based - must strictly comply with the principle of 
proportionality. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on States to ensure that the use of terrorist-profiling 
practices by law-enforcement agencies is clearly documented and monitored.  Thus, 
law-enforcement officers should be required to record the stops and searches they carry 
out for counter-terrorism purposes, including the outcomes of the stops.  This data is not </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/26 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>only crucial in ensuring an effective independent supervision of the counter-terrorism 
practices employed by law-enforcement agencies but may also be helpful for the internal 
analysis of the efficiency of these practices.  Factors such as ethnicity or religion may be 
included in these records but only subject to safeguards such as collecting this data from 
the persons concerned and separately from the original interference. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges States to establish systems of transparent and 
independent oversight of law-enforcement agencies to monitor and ensure compliance of 
counter-terrorism practices with human rights standards and operational guidelines.  
States must also provide effective means of holding law-enforcement agents accountable for 
any violations of human rights, including when committed in the context of countering 
terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on States to develop and implement a system of 
training of law-enforcement officials that includes clear instructions as to what factors they 
may legitimately employ for terrorist profiles as well as a substantial training component 
on human rights and non-discrimination.  Importantly, such training of law-enforcement 
agents should make clear that profiling based on stereotypical generalizations that certain 
ethnic or religious groups pose a greater terrorist risk than others is not only impermissible 
but also ineffective and even counterproductive. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Suicide attacks 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Suicide attacks as a specific form of terrorism pose significant challenges to 
counter-terrorism measures that are at the same time effective and compatible with human 
rights.  State responses to the risk of suicide attacks demonstrate in a dramatic way the 
risks inherent in &#8220;profiling&#8221;.  Combined with shoot-to-kill policies or other forms of 
relaxing the standards related to the use of firearms, &#8220;profiling&#8221; can have lethal 
consequences for totally innocent individuals. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends scrupulous adherence to and systematic 
training in existing international standards on the use of firearms by law-enforcement 
officials.  Further, also in the context of preventing suicide attacks, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates his recommendation to apply either universal or random security checks, instead 
of measures based on profiling. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur stresses that the counter-terrorism measures need to be 
continuously and carefully evaluated in order to ensure that they do not breach human 
rights.  Further, in the context of preventing suicide terrorism, special attention should be 
paid to the treatment of women and especially pregnant women and their security and 
integrity in counter-terrorism measures, as there is a risk that women and especially 
pregnant women may become targeted by a new wave of counter-terrorism measures. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>States should develop adequate training for all law-enforcement personnel, 
including private security agencies, and in this way ensure that human rights guide 
counter-terrorism measures and not vice versa.  Intelligence agencies need urgently to 
address the complex cultural and socio-economic issues around suicide attacks and 
terrorism in general. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/26 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur also notes that scientific research on explaining the 
phenomenon of suicide terrorism is unsatisfactory.  More resources should be invested in 
research on both the conditions conducive to the spread of suicide bombings as well as 
methods employed by States and other actors to combat this form of terrorism. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the attempts by non-governmental 
organizations that are involved in narrowing the gap between groups that may be tempted 
to resort to terrorism and majority populations, e.g. in Afghanistan, Israel and Sri Lanka. 
</b>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges States to engage in global peacebuilding efforts and 
raise awareness among their populations about existing human rights standards and 
legitimate methods to react to human rights violations.  These efforts include widespread 
human rights education to all parts of the populations in their territories. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur calls upon States to develop their methods of 
combating the conditions conducive of suicide bombings.  This evidently includes measures 
to ensure that the human rights of all persons are respected, without discrimination.
