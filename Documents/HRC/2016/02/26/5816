Korea to respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms fully, 
</p>
<p><i> Deploring </i>the grave, widespread and systematic human rights abuses in the Democratic

prisoners and repatriated citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea,  
</p>
<p><i> Deeply regretting </i>the refusal of the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of

the Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his mandate; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with all assistance
