&#147;Company&#148;) entered into an underwriting agreement (the 
&#147;Underwriting
Agreement&#148;) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representative (the 
&#147;Representative&#148;) of the several underwriters named therein (the 
&#147;Underwriters&#148;), in connection with an underwritten public offering 
(the &#147;Equity
Offering&#148;) of 7,250,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock. On August 16, 
2016, the Underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase up to 
1,087,500 additional shares, bringing the total offering to 8,337,500 shares of 
Class A common
stock (the &#147;Shares&#148;). The Company expects the net proceeds from the 
Equity Offering to be approximately $271.1 million, after deducting estimated 
fees and expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Equity 
Offering,
along with the net proceeds from the Notes Offering (as defined below), to fund 
the aggregate purchase price for the acquisition of oil and gas interests in 
Glasscock County, Texas (the &#147;Acquisition&#148;), and the remaining net 
proceeds will
be used to fund a portion of the Company&#146;s capital program and for general 
corporate purposes, including potential future acquisitions. </P>

result of the
losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a)&nbsp;or

relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters 
on the other from
the offering of the Securities or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by clause
(i)&nbsp;above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is

but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters 
on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in 
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant 
equitable
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand 
and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion 
as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received
by the
Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the
Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among 
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact 
or the
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information 
supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties&#146; relative 
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent 
such untrue
statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of 
the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of 
this subsection (e)&nbsp;shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses 
reasonably
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending
any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (e). Notwithstanding
the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to 
contribute
any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the 
Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the 
public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise 
been required to
pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged 
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning 
of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any 
person who
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters&#146; 
obligations in this subsection (e)&nbsp;to contribute are several in proportion 
to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the 
Underwriters
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this 
Section&nbsp;8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the 
Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method
of allocation which

otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission or

purchase obligations and not joint. The Issuers, the Guarantors, and the 
Purchasers agree that it
would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this

were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of

total gross proceeds (before underwriters&#146; fees and estimated expenses) of 
approximately $243.2 million (the &#147;Equity Offering&#148;). The
