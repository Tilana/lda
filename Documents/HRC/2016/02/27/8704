<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is my final report to the Human Rights Council as Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. During the period of my 
mandate, I have sought to maintain and build upon the important work and successes of my 
three predecessors since 1982, Asma Jahangir, Bacre Waly Ndiaye and Amos Wako. 
Through communications to Governments, country fact-finding missions, and annual 
reports to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, I have sought to contribute 
to the constructive development of the mandate, to improve working methods and to 
advance understanding of the complex factual, policy and legal issues arising within the 
context of the mandate. In this spirit, in addition to describing the activities undertaken over 
the last year, in the report I assess the mandate&#8217;s key activities and working methods, and 
provide a thematic review of the past six years. I also identify issues that would benefit 
from sustained research and analysis in the future. 
</p>
<p>2. In addition, addenda to the report contain three in-depth studies on: (a) 
accountability for killings by police (A/HRC/14/24/Add.8); (b) election-related killings 
(Add.7); and (c) targeted killings (Add.6). 
</p>
<p>3. The report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 8/3. 
</p>
<p>4. The terms &#8220;extrajudicial executions&#8221; and &#8220;unlawful killings&#8221; are used in the present 
report to refer to killings that violate international human rights or humanitarian law 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 6). The various types of unlawful killings covered by this mandate 
are explained in detail below in section III. 
</p>
<p>5. I am grateful to the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) for their assistance in relation to the mandate. At New York 
University School of Law, my senior advisers Sarah Knuckey and Hina Shamsi have done 
superb work. I am also grateful for the excellent research assistance provided by Anna de 
Courcy Wheeler, Nishant Kumar, Danielle Moubarak, Wade McMullen, Lars Dabney, 
Rupert Watters and Ryan Ghiselli. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities and working methods 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Communications to Governments 
</b></p>
<p>6. One of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s principal activities is to communicate with 
Governments about alleged cases of unlawful killings. These communications take the form 
of &#8220;allegation letters&#8221; or &#8220;urgent action&#8221; letters, which typically set out alleged facts, 
analyse the applicable international law, seek clarification from the relevant Government on 
the accuracy of the allegations, and call upon the Government to take particular actions to 
reduce killings or impunity. 
</p>
<p>7. Such communications with Governments raise international awareness of specific 
domestic incidents and encourage Governmental attention. They create a regular and 
ongoing system of monitoring State behaviour, generate a record of abuses over time, 
provide clarity on the circumstances of specific incidents and give States an opportunity to 
set the record straight. The communications can also shed light on the interpretation of 
applicable law, promote accountability and encourage measures to reduce future killings. </p>


<p>8. But, for the practice to live up to the theory, it is essential to take stock of how the 
system functions in reality and to identify needed reforms. While I have noted in past years 
that response rates from Governments were poor,1 the present wrap-up report provides an 
opportunity to better understand general trends and patterns in communications and 
Government responses during the whole term of my mandate. A systematic review of 
communications is contained in annex II. In brief, from December 2004 to March 2009, 
523 communications were sent to 87 States, concerning over 6,250 individuals. About half 
of these drew no response at all, while a quarter drew largely satisfactory responses. 
</p>
<p>9. Of the 15 countries that received the most communications, 7 failed to respond to 
more than 50 per cent of letters sent: India (no reply to 16 of 18 letters), Iraq (11 of 14 
letters), the Sudan (12 of 16 letters), Saudi Arabia (16 of 22 letters), the United States of 
America (12 of 18 letters), Brazil (8 of 13 letters), and the Islamic Republic of Iran (37 of 
63 letters). 
</p>
<p>10. It is clear that there is a need to consider how to make the procedure more effective 
both in engaging States in dialogue and bringing relief in individual cases. The importance 
of communications within the overall context of the Special Procedures system has grown 
immensely, but without any real planning or strategic vision. It would now be timely to 
consider what such a procedure should ideally look like in the twenty-first century. Six 
steps could usefully be taken. 
</p>
<p>11. First, there should be an examination of the effectiveness of communications.2 
Ideally, this would be based on a major review of allegations received, communications 
sent, responses provided and achievements registered as a result. It would encompass all 
relevant mandates. Such a review would provide an informative picture of the 
responsiveness of Governments to the procedures they have set up through the medium of 
the Council. And it would assist in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the system 
as a whole, thus enabling clearer identification of the reforms needed. 
</p>
<p>12. The second step should be to move towards a better integrated system, which would 
bring together the efforts made by a myriad of individual mandate holders so that they 
would look more like a system. At present the procedures for determining when to send 
communications are uneven, there is no shared vision of the optimal approach, and there is 
no comprehensive strategic plan to develop the system. As a result, there is a strong sense 
that the wealth of information that is being generated by the relatively disparate procedures 
is not being effectively capitalized upon. 
</p>
<p>13. A third step is to update the techniques and technology being used to send, receive 
and manage communications. For example, it can no longer be appropriate to send the vast 
majority of communications to States by fax. Apart from the labour costs, the 
communications charges, the time lost, the reliance on a relatively primitive technology, 
and the difficulty of keeping track of such correspondence, faxing generally renders the 
content difficult to manage electronically and thus undermines all sorts of time- and cost-
saving possibilities. While a full overhaul might require a broader reform of diplomatic 
communications strategies, there is no reason why significant changes could not be 
introduced immediately. Moreover, there is a need for a web-based database accessible to 
all mandate holders so that information can be shared in a far more efficient manner, 
priorities discussed, changes introduced more flexibly, and the overall situation can be 
monitored with ease at any given time. In addition, the publication of unwieldy printed 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/11/2, para. 7; A/HRC/8/3, para. 7; A/HRC/4/20, para. 9; E/CN.4/2006/53, para. 12; and 
</p>
<p>E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 21. 
 2 Government responsiveness is only one factor. Letters never responded to could still affect the 
</p>
<p>behaviour of a Government or other actor. Other intangible impacts may also be difficult to measure. </p>


<p>volumes should be discontinued and an integrated, publicly available, searchable and 
constantly updated database should be put online. Data management and statistical analysis 
experts should be consulted to design a database which is more readily able to be integrated 
with other directly relevant databases within and outside the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>14. Communications should be publicly available online within a fixed period, which 
could be set at three months after the deadline for a Governmental response. At present, 
communications remain confidential until published in the annual report, a procedure which 
might involve a delay of as little as two months or one closer to two years, depending 
entirely on the fortuitous timing of the report and the communication. 
</p>
<p>15. A fourth step involves revisiting the rules that require the submission of the original 
complaint by those affected or those claiming to have direct or reliable knowledge of the 
violation. This rule is often interpreted as being the flip side of the rule that complaints may 
not be based entirely on media reports or even reports from non-governmental 
organizations, unless they are specifically submitted to the Special Rapporteur. These rules 
were designed for another age, well before the communications revolution of the late 
twentieth century. Their entirely legitimate objective is to deter false reports and to 
emphasize that the credibility of sources must be a key consideration. But today&#8217;s reality is 
that those affected might have no access to the United Nations, let alone to Special 
Procedures, those with reliable knowledge such as national or international NGOs might 
not bother sending a complaint to the United Nations when their information is rapidly 
made available online, and the &#8220;mass media&#8221; is no longer the limited group that it once was 
but is now a much more diffuse and heterogeneous concept. 
</p>
<p>16. A fifth step is to pay more attention to the ways in which the information generated 
by the various communications systems is used. In general, most of it remains very poorly 
integrated into the broader United Nations human rights system. Means could easily be 
devised to enhance its relevance to thematic or country specific debates, to the work of the 
treaty bodies, to efforts to integrate human rights information into mainstreaming activities 
and into the universal periodic review process. 
</p>
<p>17. A sixth and final step (these steps can be taken more or less simultaneously) is to 
respond when countries have consistently poor levels of cooperation or meaningful 
engagement with a Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications process. Those that fail to 
respond year after year should surely be asked why this is so by the Council. To do 
otherwise indicates that the communications procedure, despite its significant cost, is not 
being taken seriously as a means of responding to alleged violations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country fact-finding visits 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the six years that I have held this mandate, I have visited 14 countries. Since 
I last reported to the Council, three visits have taken place: Colombia from 8 to 18 June 
2009 (A/HRC/14/24/Add.2), the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 5 to 15 October 
2009 (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3), and Albania from 15 to 23 February 2010 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.9). Countries visited in prior years were: Nigeria (June-July 2005), Sri 
Lanka (November-December 2005), Guatemala (August 2006), Israel and Lebanon 
(September 2006, joint mission), the Philippines (February 2007), Brazil (November 2007), 
the Central African Republic (January-February 2008), the United States of America (June </p>


<p>2008), Afghanistan (May 2008) and Kenya (February 2009). These countries should be 
commended for their openness to international scrutiny.3  
</p>
<p>19. During country missions, my aims have been to understand and explain the 
dynamics of unlawful killings (both in terms of particular incidents, and patterns across the 
country) as well as their causes (legal, historical, institutional, a matter of political will 
etc.), and to propose constructive and specific reforms to reduce killings and eliminate 
impunity. These aims are linked &#8211; if the specifics and patterns of killings and their causes 
are not carefully understood, the Special Rapporteur cannot provide an accurate account of 
the human rights situation in a country, and cannot craft appropriately specific and tailored 
reforms. 
</p>
<p>20. Most country missions last 8 to 12 days. I am often asked how it is possible to write 
a meaningful report in such a time. The short answer is that it is not. My reports are based 
on months of pre-mission research and post-mission analysis. Informed reports and 
constructive recommendations require months of research into all available sources of 
published information, consultations with country experts before the mission, the 
preparation of detailed analyses of key issues, and a very large number of in-depth 
interviews with witnesses and officials. In many countries, detailed files are provided by 
witnesses or family members of victims on each specific incident, and NGOs often submit 
extensive reports. It is essential that Governments are given a full opportunity to respond to 
allegations and to provide all relevant information. I have found it productive in this respect 
to prepare detailed lists of questions for officials, which can be provided before or during 
the mission as appropriate. After the mission, it can take some months to carefully analyse 
all of the information provided. 
</p>
<p>21. Country missions are thus clearly complex and resource-intensive in ways that the 
system does not adequately recognize. The support provided by OHCHR to the mandate is 
significant, and OHCHR staff make admirable efforts. But the Office has simply not been 
given the resources it needs to meet the many demands of the average mandate. It is not 
realistic to expect one or two staff members to assist adequately with the preparation in any 
year of hundreds of allegation letters, two or three country missions and annual reports, 
together with the many other administrative and liaison responsibilities they must fulfil. It 
is essential that Special Rapporteurs and OHCHR are provided the necessary resources and 
staff for these functions to be carried out at a high level. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Follow-up reports on country fact-finding visits 
</b></p>
<p>22. In 2006 I began following up on country missions, two years after they had taken 
place, to assess the extent to which recommendations had been implemented. Two follow-
up reports &#8211; on Brazil (A/HRC/14/24/Add.4) and the Central African Republic 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.5) &#8211; are submitted as addenda to the present report. 
</p>
<p>23. During my term, I prepared follow-up reports on 10 countries. The formal picture 
that emerges from these reports is not encouraging.4 While some countries had taken 
positive measures in response to my reports, many others had done little to implement the 
recommended reforms.  
</p>
<p>  
 3 Some of these countries have also been visited multiple times by this mandate &#8211; including 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan (twice), Albania (twice), Brazil (twice), Colombia (three times), the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (twice), Sri Lanka (twice) and the United States (twice). 
</p>
<p> 4 E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.2, para. 7; A/HRC/8/3/Add.3; and A/HRC/11/2/Add.7 and Add.8. </p>


<p>24. Civil society actors have been eager to provide information on follow-up reports, 
and have contributed substantially. However, less than half of the countries reviewed 
responded to my requests to provide information on their implementation of 
recommendations. Responses from some United Nations country presences have also been 
disappointing. 
</p>
<p>25. Given the disappointing results documented in the follow-up reports, it is clear that 
the Council should devise procedures to ensure that the recommendations are addressed by 
States. Otherwise, there is a risk that country visits will be treated by some Governments as 
a temporary inconvenience to be endured rather than as an occasion for serious stock-taking 
to enhance respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>26. It should also be acknowledged, however, that the effectiveness of country missions 
should not be measured solely on the basis of formal responses to specific 
recommendations. The reality is that country missions have many important benefits, some 
of which are not easily quantifiable. In my own assessment, a number, but by no means all, 
of the country missions I undertook yielded important positive achievements in human 
rights terms. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Country visit requests 
</b></p>
<p>27. The ability of the mandate to be effective is significantly undermined by the extent 
to which States in which there would appear to be serious problems of extrajudicial 
executions can systematically ignore requests to visit, in some cases for over a decade. The 
information below indicates that almost 70 per cent of the 52 countries requested have 
either not responded at all to requests, or have failed to approve a visit. From the 
perspective of the individual State, the decision to respond to a mission request is a matter 
for its sovereign discretion. There may be a number of legitimate reasons why a visit would 
not be appropriate at a given time, and why different mandates might be accorded priority. 
But as the years pass, these reasons become less plausible. From the perspective of the 
Council, there comes a point when the mechanism it has established to monitor and report 
on extrajudicial executions is effectively disabled from doing its job properly in respect to 
the States concerned. This should be a matter of grave concern to the Council in view of its 
mandated responsibility in relation to &#8220;the prevention of human rights violations&#8221;.5 
</p>
<p>28. During my mandate, mission requests have been sent to 53 countries, in addition to a 
range of outstanding requests by my predecessor. Of these: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 14 requests resulted in country missions 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 4 country missions have in principle been accepted to take place in 2010 and 2011 
(Argentina, Ecuador, Mexico and Turkey) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 35 States either did not respond at all or failed to approve a mission despite entering 
into correspondence6 
</p>
<p>  
 5 General Assembly resolution 60/251, para. 5 (f). 
 6 In addition to 21 non-responses, one State stated that the request (made in 2006) was under 
</p>
<p>consideration; three States responded that an initial request could not be granted, and then did not 
respond to subsequent follow-up letters; two States agreed initially to a visit, but then indefinitely 
postponed; two States responded that a visit could not take place in the year requested; four States 
indicated that a visit could take place in the future, but have not responded to subsequent requests; 
one State acknowledged receipt of the request, but did not respond to follow-up requests; and one 
State merely acknowledged receipt of the request. </p>


<p>29. As of March 2010, the following requests to visit remain outstanding: Bangladesh; 
Canada; Chad; China; Dominican Republic; Egypt; El Salvador; Ethiopia; Georgia; 
Guinea; India; Indonesia; Iran (Islamic Republic of); Israel; Kyrgyzstan; Lao People&#8217;s 
Democratic Republic; Mozambique; Myanmar; Nepal; Pakistan; Peru; Russian Federation; 
Saudi Arabia; South Africa; Thailand; Togo; Trinidad and Tobago; Turkmenistan; Uganda; 
United Republic of Tanzania; Uzbekistan; Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of); Viet Nam; 
and Yemen. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Review of issues addressed and research undertaken 
</b></p>
<p>30. The situations dealt with by this mandate often involve complex factual, policy and 
legal issues. In addition to generating pressure for change, I have attached considerable 
importance to specifying and clarifying the applicable international legal framework. 
</p>
<p>31. The many themes addressed in-depth over six years have been approached in 
different ways, but especially the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) <b>Empirical surveys.</b> World-wide surveys of a particular type of killing or 
accountability mechanism (for example electoral killings; killings of &#8220;witches&#8221;; vigilante 
killings; targeted killings; the use of commissions of inquiry); 
</p>
<p>(b) <b>Policy and best practices analyses. </b>Various reports have examined best 
practices in order to assist civil society and Governments with complex legal and policy 
issues, and to bring greater specificity into my own recommendations. Such studies have 
focused on witness protection, military justice and police accountability; 
</p>
<p>(c) <b>Legal analysis. </b>Other reports have focused on contested or unclear areas of 
law, such as the relationship between human rights and humanitarian law, the 
circumstances in which the application of the death penalty is unlawful, and the legality of 
targeted killings. 
</p>
<p>32. The disparate issues arising under the mandate can usefully be understood 
thematically.7 In what follows, I outline the general issues encountered by the mandate, and 
the contributions made with respect to each.8 
</p>
<p><b> A. Killings by law enforcement officials or other security forces 
</b></p>
<p>33. Killings by police and other law enforcement or security officials are frequently 
encountered within the mandate. They can take many forms. All too common are 
intentional murders in which police shoot to kill alleged criminals without resort to other 
appropriate measures. Instances of this approach are detailed in my reports on Brazil, 
Guatemala, Kenya and Nigeria. Some of the killings are carried out by individual police, 
others are killed by unacknowledged police &#8220;death squads&#8221;. Another major problem is the 
use of excessive force while arresting a suspect, or of indiscriminate force in a riot-control 
context. Such killings are often due to poor training, inappropriate &#8220;use of force&#8221; 
regulations and resource deficiencies. In countries where the security forces may be directly 
controlled by politicians, security officials may conduct politically motivated killings, 
</p>
<p>  
 7 As the mandate develops over time, these categories will no doubt expand or be restructured, but I 
</p>
<p>have found the categories described in this section useful as a working structure for understanding the 
issues the mandate addresses. 
</p>
<p> 8 The full text of all contributions of the Special Rapporteur has been organized thematically, and is 
available as a handbook from the website www.extrajudicialexecutions.org. </p>


<p>including of political opposition members or supporters, and election-related killings. I 
have also investigated many killings in the context of extortion attempts or for other 
reasons personal to the official. In some countries, police also carry out killings while off 
duty, whether for &#8220;vigilante&#8221; reasons, for profit, or as part of a well-organized militia or 
business enterprise. 
</p>
<p>34. I have addressed in detail the applicable international legal standards relevant to the 
use of force by police, as well as the policies that seem most likely to reduce or contribute 
to unlawful police killings. In 2006 I set out the basis and content of international law on 
the use of lethal force by police (A/61/311, paras. 33-45). That report explained that the 
rules governing the use of force were built on the principles that the force must be both 
necessary and proportional. The intentional use of lethal force is strictly limited to 
circumstances where it is required to protect life. The report also underscored the 
importance of the principles contained in the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement 
Officials, and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement 
Officials. Country reports, including those on Kenya (A/HRC/11/2/Add.6) and Nigeria 
(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4), indicate that the right to life is at grave risk in States where the 
use-of-force guidelines are inconsistent with these rules. 
</p>
<p>35. My 2006 report to the Commission examined &#8220;shoot-to-kill&#8221; policies in response to 
a number of high-profile pronouncements from officials of various Governments, 
authorizing police to &#8220;shoot on sight&#8221; alleged terrorists and criminals (E/CN.4/2006/53, 
paras. 44-54). Such dangerous official rhetoric displaces the clear legal standards on the use 
of lethal force which stipulate that the police may shoot to kill only when it is clear that an 
individual is about to kill someone (making lethal force proportionate) and there is no other 
available means of detaining the suspect (making lethal force necessary). 
</p>
<p>36. Country reports have addressed policing methods that offer alternatives to counter-
productive, unlawful and violent policing. Examples include community policing in 
Nigeria, and the benefits of a sustained police presence in gang-controlled areas in Brazil. 
In reports on Kenya and Nigeria I addressed the need for centralized data-keeping and 
monitoring of police killings. 
</p>
<p>37. Much of the mandate&#8217;s work on police killings has focused on improving 
accountability, an issue addressed in greater detail in the general section on impunity (see 
below). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings during armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>38. In many of the countries I have visited, armed conflicts have resulted in many 
unlawful killings. These include Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Colombia, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Israel, Lebanon, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p>39. Much of the mandate&#8217;s work on killings in armed conflict has sought to clarify the 
relationship between human rights and humanitarian law, starting with the basis for the 
mandate&#8217;s coverage and investigation of armed conflict killings. In 2004 (E/CN.4/2005/7, 
paras. 5-11 and 45) and 2007 (A/HRC/4/20, paras. 18 and 20-24) I showed that, from the 
very beginning of the mandate, Special Rapporteurs have reviewed the legality of killings 
under international humanitarian law, and that the mandate covers, without exception, 
violations of the right to life in international and non-international armed conflicts. These 
analyses, as well as reports on Afghanistan, Israel and Lebanon, and Sri Lanka, explained </p>


<p>the coextensive protections of, and complementary relationship between, human rights and 
humanitarian law.9 
</p>
<p>40. Another significant element of the mandate&#8217;s work in this area has been to study the 
methods and means of warfare. Thus, for example, the 2007 report to the Council 
(A/HRC/4/20) examined &#8220;mercy killings&#8221; and explained the legal basis for their absolute 
prohibition. Reports have also addressed: the principles of distinction and proportionality; 
airstrikes; cluster bombs; raids; perfidy; suicide attacks; human shielding; issues arising in 
urban counter-insurgencies; and killings of persons <i>hors de combat</i>.10 Mission reports on 
the Central African Republic (A/HRC/14/24/Add.5), Afghanistan (A/HRC/11/2/Add.4, 
paras. 9 and 23-24), and Israel and Lebanon (A/HRC/2/7, paras. 30 and 68-70), also 
addressed the requirement of reciprocity and the illegality of reprisal killings. As the 
discussions on reciprocity explained, one side&#8217;s unlawful use of civilian shields, for 
example, does not affect the other side&#8217;s obligation to ensure that airstrikes do not kill 
civilians in excess of the military advantage of killing the targeted fighters. 
</p>
<p>41. Over the course of the mandate, the responsibility of rebel or insurgent groups to 
observe international humanitarian law has repeatedly been explained and emphasized, 
including in country reports on Afghanistan (A/HRC/11/2/Add.4, para. 71), the Central 
African Republic (A/HRC/11/2/Add.3, para. 6), Colombia (A/HRC/14/24/Add.2), the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3), Sri Lanka 
(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.5, paras. 26, 30 and 33) and the Philippines (A/HRC/8/3/Add.2, 
para. 5). Too often, and especially in insurgency contexts, civilians are trapped between 
State and rebel forces, or between warring rebel factions, in a struggle to avoid being 
threatened or killed by one or more sides. This dynamic, together with the obligations of all 
sides to respect international law, was described in detail in the reports on Afghanistan, 
Colombia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>42. Reports have also addressed the importance of human rights-based security sector 
reform (A/HRC/11/2/Add.3), military recruitment and vetting of military personnel for war 
crimes,11 humanitarian law training,12 killings by private security contractors,13 and the need 
for transparency and accountability mechanisms relating to right-to-life violations during 
armed conflict and occupation.14<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Killings during counter-terrorism operations 
</b></p>
<p>43. I have often had cause to note that while terrorist acts can have terrible 
consequences, counter-terrorism responses must not themselves violate human rights and 
humanitarian law. One example concerns the targeted killings of alleged terrorists. Both 
international human rights and humanitarian law apply to limit the circumstances under 
which States may intentionally kill specific individuals both in and outside the context of 
armed conflict.15 The refusal of States that practice targeted killings, and those on whose 
territory such killings occur, to respond to allegation letters and requests for information on 
whether applicable legal standards and procedural safeguards have been complied with,

<p>creates a situation in which Governments kill without any &#8220;verifiable obligation . . . to 
demonstrate in any way that those against whom legal force is used are indeed terrorists&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 41). 
</p>
<p>44. In response to &#8220;shoot-to-kill&#8221; policies aimed at suspected suicide bombers, I 
examined in detail the rules regulating the use of lethal force by law enforcement officials 
(E/CN.4/2006/53, paras. 44-54). That report emphasized that human rights law provides a 
framework within which States can reconcile their obligations to protect their populations 
from terrorism, with their obligations to respect the rights of suspects. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Killings by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>45. Human rights and humanitarian law clearly apply to killings by non-State actors in 
certain circumstances. Thus, for example, country mission reports have investigated killings 
by rebel and insurgent groups, paramilitary groups, militias, vigilantes, death squads, 
criminal gangs, bandits, mobs, family members and private individuals. Such killings may 
be for the purposes of &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;, to &#8220;restore honour&#8221;, to punish suspected 
criminals, or to punish &#8220;witches&#8221;. They might also be for profit, or be linked to domestic 
violence familial blood feuds, armed conflict, election violence or inter-communal 
violence. 
</p>
<p>46. Because a focus on killings by non-State actors has at times been controversial, the 
mandate has extensively studied and clarified the legal bases for the responsibility of non-
State actors and the State with respect to this category of abuses. In 2004 I identified four 
general categories of non-State actors and explained the legal implications (E/CN.4/2005/7, 
paras. 65-76): 
</p>
<p>(a) The State has direct responsibility for the actions of non-State actors that 
operate at the behest of the Government or with its knowledge or acquiescence. Examples 
include private militias controlled by the Government (which may, for example, be ordered 
to kill political opponents) as well as paramilitary groups and deaths squads; 
</p>
<p>(b) Governments are also responsible for the actions of private contractors 
(including military or security contractors), corporations and consultants who engage in 
core State activities (such as prison management, law enforcement or interrogation); 
</p>
<p>(c) Where non-State armed groups are parties to an armed conflict, such groups 
have their own direct legal responsibilities for any killings they commit in violation of 
international humanitarian law. Where a group exercises significant territorial and 
population control, and has an identifiable political structure, it may also be important for 
the Special Rapporteur to address complaints directly to the group and to call for it to 
respect human rights and humanitarian law norms.16 This has been the approach in reports 
on Afghanistan, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p>(d) The mandate has increasingly addressed fully &#8220;private&#8221; killings, such as 
murders by gangs, vigilante justice, &#8220;honour killings&#8221; or domestic violence killings. In most 
cases, an isolated private killing is a domestic crime and does not give rise to State 
responsibility. However, where there is pattern of killings and the Government&#8217;s response 
(in terms either of prevention or of accountability) is inadequate, the responsibility of the 
State is engaged. Under human rights law, the State is not only prohibited from directly 
violating the right to life, but is also required to ensure the right to life, and must meet its 
due diligence obligations to take appropriate measures to deter, prevent, investigate, 
</p>
<p>  
 16 See A/62/265, paras. 37-44. </p>


<p>prosecute and punish perpetrators. In addition, in reports detailing Governmental violations 
in response to violence by non-State actors (including gangs or sects), it is important to 
report on non-State actor violations in order to provide a fair picture of the situation facing 
the Government. This is reflected in the reports on Brazil, Kenya and Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>47. In order to understand the dynamics of killings by non-State actors, which are often 
underreported and under-studied, reports to the Council and the General Assembly have 
included global studies of particular phenomena such as killings by vigilantes and mob 
justice (A/64/187, paras. 15-83) and killings of &#8220;witches&#8221; (A/HRC/11/2, paras. 43-59). My 
predecessor, Ms. Jahangir, contributed substantially with respect to the issue of &#8220;honour 
killings&#8221; (E/CN.4/2000/3, paras. 78-84). 
</p>
<p><b> E. Deaths in custody 
</b></p>
<p>48. Communications to Governments and country mission reports often address deaths 
in custody, which encompass guards killing prisoners, inter-prisoner violence, suicides, 
death resulting from torture in custody and deaths resulting from prison conditions, 
including poor health care, overcrowding and inadequate food. 
</p>
<p>49. I have analysed in detail the nature of the State&#8217;s responsibility in a custodial setting 
(A/61/311, paras. 49-54). States have a heightened level of responsibility in protecting the 
rights of detained individuals. Indeed, when an individual dies in State custody, there is a 
presumption of State responsibility. The obligation of the State is not only to prohibit and 
prosecute killings by guards or other officials, but also to prevent deaths and to respond 
effectively to the causes of the deaths. The specific content of the obligations of the State 
include: ensuring appropriate prison oversight and monitoring; providing adequate health 
care to detainees (A/HRC/11/2/Add.5) and appropriate budgets to prisons 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.3); stopping practices of prisoners running prisons (A/HRC/8/3); 
ensuring accurate records of detainees and their sentences (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3); and 
exercising due diligence to prevent inter-prisoner violence. 
</p>
<p><b> F. The death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>50. International law does not prohibit the application of the death penalty. However, 
given the fundamental nature of the right to life, the circumstances in which the death 
penalty may lawfully be applied are strictly circumscribed. Executions carried out in 
violation of those limits are unlawful killings. 
</p>
<p>51. Various reports examining the legal limits on the application of the death penalty 
show that: 
</p>
<p>(a) The death penalty is only lawful if imposed after a trial conducted in 
accordance with fair trial guarantees, including judicial independence, the right to counsel, 
an effective right to appeal, and the right not to be coerced or tortured to give evidence 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.5). When a State&#8217;s judicial system cannot ensure respect for fair trials, 
the Government should impose a moratorium on executions (A/HRC/11/2/Add.4, paras. 65 
and 89); 
</p>
<p>(b) States that impose the death penalty must provide transparency in relation to 
the specifics of the processes and procedures under which it is imposed.17 This obligation is 
firmly grounded in existing law (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3). States retaining the death penalty 
</p>
<p>  
 17 E/CN.4/2005/7; E/CN.4/2006/53, para. 28; and A/HRC/8/3/Add.3, para. 81.  </p>


<p>should undertake periodic reviews to determine whether international standards have been 
complied with, and report to the Council on their findings (E/CN.4/2005/7, paras. 60-62, 
88); 
</p>
<p>(c) International law prohibits the application of the death penalty to juveniles;18 
</p>
<p>(d) International law prohibits the mandatory imposition of the death penalty;19 
</p>
<p>(e) International law only permits the death penalty for &#8220;the most serious 
crimes&#8221;. The scope and implications of this important phrase have been explored in detail;20 
</p>
<p>(f) A person sentenced to death has the right to seek pardon or commutation of 
the sentence (A/HRC/8/3, paras. 59-67). 
</p>
<p>52. In the death penalty context it has also been necessary to address the relationship 
between international legal obligations and sharia law or Islamic criminal law as applied in 
some countries. Specifically, reports have discussed stoning, the illegality of the death 
penalty for homosexuality or adultery, and the challenges of diyah (compensation in lieu of 
criminal punishment).21 
</p>
<p><b> G. Impunity: investigation, prosecution and conviction 
</b></p>
<p>53. Impunity is often a central cause of continued killings. In many of the countries 
visited, impunity is maintained through problems at every level of the criminal justice 
system. Thus, police may be unwilling or unable to carry out an independent investigation 
of the killing. The State may lack forensic capacity to conduct investigations. Crimes 
scenes may not be secured. The police may fail to refer cases to the prosecution service. 
Prosecutors may be corrupt or poorly trained. Witnesses may justifiably be unwilling to 
testify because of inadequate witness protection programmes. Judges&#8217; dockets may be so 
overcrowded that cases are delayed for years, or judges may also take bribes to delay cases 
or absolve perpetrators. If perpetrators are convicted, prison systems may be insecure or 
susceptible to corruption, resulting in prisoners escaping or bribing their way out of 
detention. 
</p>
<p>54. In response to these challenges, specific studies have addressed: 
</p>
<p>(a) The need for external oversight of the police, including a study of the various 
forms of oversight, and the applicable law and principles (A/HR/14/24/Add.8);  
</p>
<p>(b) The obstacles to effective national commissions of inquiry, and the 
requirements for the creation and implementation of effective commissions;22  
</p>
<p>(c) Best practices in witness protections programmes (A/63/313); 
</p>
<p>(d) How States can make their military justice systems compatible with human 
rights standards (A/63/313).

</p>
<p>paras. 55-64.  
 22 A/CN.4/2006/53 and A/HRC/8/3.  </p>


<p>55. Mission reports have also addressed the important role of international and non-
governmental actors, including NGOs, national human rights institutions, OHCHR, and the 
International Criminal Court, in promoting accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Reparations of killings 
</b></p>
<p>56. Whenever a State is responsible for an unlawful killing, international law requires 
reparations in the form of compensation and/or satisfaction. This obligation is based in 
general customary international law, as well as duties arising from human rights and 
humanitarian law.23 The State is also required to ensure that victims have access to 
remedies, including judicial remedies, for violations of their rights. 
</p>
<p>57. As a general matter, a great deal more can and must be done by States to meet their 
reparations obligations. Governments in many countries visited by the mandate, such as 
Kenya and Sri Lanka, have not met their obligations, either because they have not created 
reparations programmes, or because programmes are difficult for victims&#8217; families to 
access, or because tort remedies have undue jurisdictional impediments. Reparations should 
also be adequately provided for under post-conflict transitional justice mechanisms. This is 
often not the case (see A/HRC/14/24/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>58. Increasingly, and out of concern that paying &#8220;reparations&#8221; would be an admission of 
State wrongdoing, Governments involved in armed conflict have created other forms of 
payments. These &#8220;ex gratia&#8221; or &#8220;condolence&#8221; payments are often paid to the families of 
civilians killed during armed conflict. This practice, particularly by the United States in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, has important benefits, although problems remain in administration 
and distribution.24 It does not, however, absolve States of their responsibility to 
acknowledge wrongdoing where it has occurred. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Victim groups 
</b></p>
<p>59. Understanding the dynamics and causes of killings in particular situations will often 
require a focus on the victims&#8217; membership of especially vulnerable groups. Thus, for 
example, building upon Ms. Jahangir&#8217;s work (see for example E/CN.4/2000/3, paras. 78-
84), my reports have addressed the particular vulnerability of women in relation to practices 
such as honour killings, domestic violence, sexual violence as a cause of death, &#8220;femicide&#8221; 
and killings of &#8220;witches&#8221;.25 Country reports have addressed other vulnerable groups, 
including: refugees; indigenous persons; those deemed to be &#8220;socially undesirable&#8221;; 
suspected criminals; children; the elderly; the disabled; those perceived to be or identifying 
as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transsexual; human rights defenders; and journalists. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Mandate and working methods 
</b></p>
<p>60. I have placed particular emphasis on enhancing understanding of the scope of the 
mandate and of the working methods adopted. In addition to ensuring continuity with the 
work of my predecessors in relation to the types of violations dealt with and the mandate&#8217;s 
legal framework (see E/CN.4/2002/74, para. 8), I have: 
</p>
<p>  
 23 A/HRC/11/2/Add.4, para. 35, footnote 35.  
 24 Ibid., paras. 35-36 and A/HRC/11/2/Add.5, paras. 67-66.  
 25 See E/CN.4/2004/7, paras. 66-69; A/HRC/11/2/Add.4, paras. 63-64; A/HRC/4/20/Add.2, paras. 22-
</p>
<p>26; A/HRC/11/2/Add.3, paras. 49-51, 87; and A/HRC/11/2, paras. 43-59, 68.  </p>


<p>(a) Limited the overall number of communications sent in order to be able to 
devote more attention to detailed legal analysis within the communications; 
</p>
<p>(b) Introduced a system of evaluating the adequacy or otherwise of responses 
received from Governments;26 
</p>
<p>(c) Instituted follow-up reports on country missions;27 
</p>
<p>(d) Provided detailed legal analysis to back up interpretations adopted by the 
mandate; 
</p>
<p>(e) Sought to raise the Council&#8217;s awareness of the consequences of persistent 
non-responses to requests to undertake country visits (E/CN.4/2006/53, paras. 13-16); 
</p>
<p>(f) Elaborated upon the terms of reference of the mandate and the types of 
killings it covers (E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 6). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Future research 
</b></p>
<p>61. It is not enough just to denounce violations. Many of the issues that arise are 
complex and demand analysis if the mandate is to achieve its full potential. Based on my 
own experience over the past six years, I would encourage research by those in the field on 
the following issues, among others. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Sexual violence and unlawful killings 
</b></p>
<p>62. The link between gender-based violence and killings has been a central theme in 
many situations, whether concerning &#8220;honour&#8221; killings, &#8220;femicide&#8221;, domestic violence or 
&#8220;witchcraft&#8221; killings.28 But situations in which women are literally raped to death have 
actually been significantly underreported, and the links between rape and killings have been 
under-studied.29 While men are also subject to sexual violence linked to killings, women 
have been subject to such killings in situation after situation around the world: 
</p>
<p>(a) Women are killed if they resist rape or are murdered immediately after it;  
</p>
<p>(b) Women are taken into sexual slavery and then killed;  
</p>
<p>(c) Family members (generally men) or others who attempt to stop a rape, or 
refuse orders to rape their female relatives, are killed (S/2009/693, para. 80); 
</p>
<p>(d) Women who have been attacked die as a result of rape-related injuries, or 
contracting HIV/AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3). 
</p>
<p>63. Rape/killings may be particularly brutal when conducted as reprisal attacks for 
alleged cooperation with an opposition group. Deaths are more likely in remote areas where 
victims have little or no access to health services (A/HRC/14/24/Add.3). A consistent 
problem, however, is that data collection in relation to this phenomenon is especially 
difficult. In conflict situations, resources are scarce and survivors become the priority. 
Privacy concerns, combined with problems of stigmatization and reprisals, also restrict the 
possibilities for meaningful data collection. But it is important that the scale and severity of 
the problem should not be underestimated. More research is needed in order to: ensure that

 27 E/CN.4/2005/7, paras. 29-31 and E/CN.4/2006/53, para. 19.  
 28 See also A/HRC/11/2/Add.7, paras. 18-19 and A/HRC/11/2, paras. 43-59 and 68. 
 29 For recent exceptions, see A/HRC/14/24/Add.3 and S/2009/693, annex, para. 79. </p>


<p>the full extent of the phenomenon is recognized; combat impunity; and understand better 
the dynamics which are at play and thus help craft strategies for the future. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Crime scenes and forensic evidence 
</b></p>
<p>64. The capacity to collect and analyse forensic evidence is crucial in combating 
impunity for unlawful killings. Yet it is too often severely lacking, or even entirely absent. 
Where there is no forensics capability, successful prosecutions can be extremely difficult 
and reliance on confessions, no matter how obtained, becomes the preferred option. This is 
especially so where witnesses are afraid to testify, as is often the case where police or 
armed groups were responsible for the killing. In countries with a basic forensics capacity, 
resources, training or evidence-gathering standards are often very limited. In these 
circumstances, even basic evidence (such as X-rays or gun powder analysis) may not be 
examined or analysed correctly (A/HRC/11/2/Add.2, paras. 54-56). In other countries, the 
problem may be one of institutional independence &#8211; if the forensics office is not 
independent from police who may have been involved in an unlawful shooting, it can be all 
too easy for police to hide or manipulate evidence. 
</p>
<p>65. The following issues would benefit from further research: 
</p>
<p>(a) What is the minimum forensics capacity that a State should have in order to 
meet its international legal obligations to investigate and prosecute unlawful killings? How 
can the international community best support the development of forensic labs and 
expertise in developing States? 
</p>
<p>(b) What are the advantages of different institutional models employed in 
different countries? 
</p>
<p>(c) What are best practices with respect to forensics? 
</p>
<p>(d)  How should human rights standards influence the approach to forensics? 
</p>
<p>(e) Where in the forensics process do obstacles to effectiveness and 
independence most often occur? For example, is evidence generally lost or manipulated at 
the crime scene itself, when the body is examined, or when evidence is provided to 
prosecutors? What steps can be taken at each stage to mitigate obstacles?  
</p>
<p><b> C. Non-State armed actors and their use of the &#8220;death penalty&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>66. In a number of countries visited, including Afghanistan, the Central African 
Republic, Colombia and Kenya, non-State armed actors have set up &#8220;tribunals&#8221; to hear 
cases of alleged civilian wrong-doing. Some of these trials have resulted in death sentences. 
In some cases, the process represents little more than the thinly veiled murder of an 
opponent. In others, the group may, in the absence of any State presence, be enforcing a 
rudimentary criminal code. 
</p>
<p>67. This &#8220;black market criminal justice&#8221; phenomenon receives almost no attention, 
although its significance would clearly warrant it. Comparative research should be 
undertaken on whether such processes observe basic fair trial standards, their composition, 
the types of crimes tried, when and how often the death penalty is prescribed, and the 
responses (if any) of States and the international community to such incidents. </p>


<p><b> D. Mass graves and State responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>68. I have visited or been informed of mass grave sites in Afghanistan, Albania, 
Colombia and Kenya. In Kenya, around Mt. Elgon, I learned of sites that had not been 
secured or preserved, and whose victims had not been identified. In Albania, there are 
numerous reports of alleged undiscovered mass grave sites, related both to communist-era 
abuses, and separately to allegations of killings after the Kosovo war 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.9). In Afghanistan, I visited Dasht-e-Leili, suspected of containing the 
remains of some 2,000 Taliban fighters killed after surrendering in 2001. Credible reports 
suggest that those responsible had later removed bodies in order to destroy the evidence 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.4, para. 66). 
</p>
<p>69. States are obligated to investigate alleged violations of the right to life. But what, 
specifically, does this entail with respect to mass graves? Must certain steps be taken when 
there are credible allegations of the existence of such a site? What can be learned from the 
experience of States in dealing with mass graves on their territory? What steps should be 
taken to secure the site, to prevent tampering and to protect witnesses, to identify bodies 
and notify family members? How can the Special Rapporteur most productively respond to 
allegations of mass graves? Should there be some international resources available, beyond 
those provided by groups like Physicians for Human Rights, to conduct independent and 
expert investigations? The effectiveness of efforts to prevent impunity depends 
significantly on answering such questions. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Civil defence groups 
</b></p>
<p>70. The mandate has addressed the use of force by private actors in various contexts. 
One particular subgroup of non-State actors &#8211; civilians who band together to form &#8220;civil 
defence groups&#8221; or &#8220;village self-defence forces&#8221; with a view to exercising force against 
other armed actors &#8211; raises complex issues that merit further research. 
</p>
<p>71. Such groups are most likely to exist when: 
</p>
<p>(a) Civilians face daily threats to their lives and property in situations of armed 
conflict, high levels of lawlessness (especially attacks on villages by bandits), or similar 
heightened insecurity; and 
</p>
<p>(b) The State&#8217;s security presence is minimal or entirely absent because, for 
example, territory is remote, or held or contested by rebel groups or criminal gangs; and/or 
</p>
<p>(c) State forces are themselves a source of threat.30 
</p>
<p>72. The international community has long been concerned about the existence of such 
groups, and the risks they pose,31 but there has been little analysis or understanding of how 
best to mitigate the risks, and when or how such groups should be supported or disbanded. 
On the one hand, civil defence groups may be the only form of security for local 
communities. In some circumstances &#8211; for instance, out of strict necessity and in defence 
against imminent threats to life &#8211; the formation of such groups may be appropriate, and 
their use of force may be lawful.

</p>
<p>E/CN.4/1994/38.  </p>


<p>73. On the other hand, experience shows a significant risk that such groups will commit 
serious human rights abuses with impunity, or evolve into unaccountable militias or bandit 
forces.32 This remains a problem in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 
Central African Republic.33 
</p>
<p>74. Given the prevalence of civil defence groups around the world, and their potential 
either to protect or to violate the right to life, further research is needed to study the 
conditions under which they come into existence, the factors that contribute to illegal 
conduct, and what Governments and the international community can do to mitigate such 
risks. It is clear that human rights law requires Governments to exercise due diligence in 
preventing such groups from committing abuses, and to investigate, prosecute and punish 
violations when they occur. But difficult questions include whether, in what circumstances, 
and how Governments could or should legally support or encourage the development of 
civil defence groups. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Corruption and unlawful killings 
</b></p>
<p>75. Corruption has been a significant issue in most of the countries visited.34 Initial 
appearances notwithstanding, there is often a strong link between corruption and killings. 
Corruption can contribute to the commission of unlawful killings (e.g. violence by police 
against civilians who refuse to pay a bribe), to impunity for killings (through bribery of 
police, prosecutors or judges), and can divert essential resources from much needed 
Government programmes that would help to reduce killings. Thus, corruption can be both a 
cause and a consequence of killings and of impunity. 
</p>
<p>76. Pervasive and deep-rooted corruption is difficult to change, but in the absence of 
such change there is often little point in recommending sweeping reforms of police or legal 
systems. Research could explore the factors that contribute to or reduce killings in corrupt 
contexts and the effectiveness of measures to reduce corruption and their impact on killing 
levels. Such measures might include requiring audits of Government institutions, obligating 
senior officials to publicly declare their assets (A/HRC/14/24/Add.5); instituting zero 
tolerance policies (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4, para. 57); strengthening police oversight 
mechanisms (idem); instituting radical structural reforms (A/HRC/11/2/Add.6, para. 95), or 
tailoring witness protection programmes specifically to guard witnesses against police 
reprisals and widespread witness intimidation.35 
</p>
<p>77. Research could also examine the role and impact of donor assistance for anti-
corruption initiatives. While, for example, donor aid to improve salaries for police forces 
and the judiciary can be necessary and welcome, it is often only one part of the systemic 
reforms required to address corruption, violence and a culture of impunity 
(A/HRC/8/3/Add.3, paras. 90-91). Aid may be more effective when part of a coordinated 
system of donor-provided funding for rule of law programmes, defined broadly to include a 
variety of institutions and all levels of society, but the exact parameters, needs, and 
outcomes of such initiatives needs further study.

<p><b> G. United Nations peacekeeping and multinational force operations 
</b></p>
<p>78. The United Nations currently deploys more peacekeepers than at any other time in 
its history. Some peacekeeping missions, like the one in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, have very strong mandates to protect civilians, use armed force and support the 
national military. Missions are also increasingly mandated to perform a range of activities, 
from active combat to development, justice reform and human rights monitoring. Recent 
years have also seen an increase in regional and international multinational force 
deployments, including where multinational forces are a party to an armed conflict (as in 
Iraq or Afghanistan). 
</p>
<p>79. In almost all cases, the various international missions I have encountered have been 
very cooperative and I have benefited from their knowledge and their facilities. This has 
been true even when my mandate has required me to scrutinize relevant aspects of the work 
of those missions.36 The increased use and changing nature of peacekeeping and 
multinational force operations raise many questions with respect to the human rights and 
humanitarian law obligations of international forces, and accountability for violations of 
those obligations. The development of practical standards necessary to answer many such 
questions is still at an early stage.37  My experience indicates that research could usefully 
focus on the following issues: 
</p>
<p><b>  (a) Participation in peacekeeping and multinational force operations by militaries 
accused of human rights and humanitarian law abuses: 
</b></p>
<p>(i) When, and under what conditions, if any, should such an accused military 
unit be excluded from regional or international peacekeeping operations or other 
military engagements? 
</p>
<p>(ii) How should the international community respond to credible allegations that 
a military contingent in a peacekeeping or multinational force operation committed 
human rights or humanitarian law abuses? What constitutes a &#8220;credible&#8221; allegation? 
How should investigations be conducted, and by whom? 
</p>
<p><b>  (b) United Nations obligations with respect to the national militaries it supports 
</b></p>
<p>(i) Where support is provided to a national military, what are the obligations of 
the United Nations when the former engages in alleged human rights or 
humanitarian law abuses? At what point does the United Nations become complicit 
in, or legally responsible for, the abuses committed? 
</p>
<p>(ii) What forms of conditionality are most effective and should be used as the 
basis for United Nations support for a national military? How can public 
transparency of conditions be secured? What steps should the United Nations take to 
ensure that conditions are met, and what should be done if conditions are violated?  
</p>
<p>(iii)  Which United Nations agency should be tasked with an independent 
investigation of abuse allegations? Should there be a separate and independent 
United Nations human rights investigative entity? What level of investigation is 
required? 
</p>
<p>  
 36 A/HRC/11/2/Add.3 and 4 and A/HRC/14/24/Add.3. 
 37 See, for example, the excellent 2005 report of Prince Zeid Ra&#8217;ad Zeid Al-Hussein on sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation by peacekeepers (A/59/710). </p>


<p>(iv) Where serving military personnel are suspected of war crimes, what 
strategies and tools can effectively be used to: remove the suspect from the position 
of authority without inciting a violent backlash or unravelling any peace agreements; 
disassemble and/or disarm the unit(s) allied to the suspect; and ensure that the 
suspect is effectively investigated and prosecuted? 
</p>
<p><b>  (c) Obligations of donors to those militaries accused of human rights and 
humanitarian law abuses 
</b></p>
<p>(i) What restrictions do and should apply to a Government&#8217;s assistance to a 
foreign military? How effective are restrictions that condition assistance to foreign 
militaries on certification that they have not committed gross human rights 
violations? What legal responsibilities does a Government have to ensure that the 
aid, resources or training it provides is not used to commit abuses, or by units that 
have committed abuses? 
</p>
<p>(ii) In response to credible obligations of abuses by a State&#8217;s military, what are 
the international legal obligations of countries that provide funds or other assistance? 
At what point does or should the donor State incur responsibility for abuses by the 
supported military? 
</p>
<p><b>  (d) Accountability for unlawful killings committed in the course of peacekeeping or 
multinational force operations 
</b></p>
<p>(i) What best practices should the United Nations or multinational forces follow 
to ensure that civilian or other unlawful deaths: are reported accurately; recorded 
and made public; and independently and effectively investigated, prosecuted and 
punished? 
</p>
<p>(ii) What best practices can ensure that victims&#8217; families have adequate access to 
information about investigations, prosecutions and their outcomes? 
</p>
<p>(iii) What jurisdictional obstacles to investigation and prosecution might arise 
(e.g. between the host State and the United Nations or multinational force), and how 
might they be resolved? 
</p>
<p>(iv) What should model memoranda of understanding (between the United 
Nations and troop-contributing countries) or status of force agreements provide with 
respect to jurisdictional issues to ensure accountability obligations are met? 
</p>
<p>(v) What specific responsibilities does a host State have to ensure that United 
Nations or multinational forces comply with their human rights and humanitarian 
law obligations? What should happen if a State does not abide by obligations to 
investigate and prosecute?  
</p>
<p><b>  (e) Human rights monitoring and promotion within a United Nations peacekeeping 
mission 
</b></p>
<p>(i) The human rights functions of the United Nations often fall within the 
general mandate of the country mission. Thus, for example, in both the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, OHCHR does not have an 
independent office, but its functions are integrated into the broader mission. In some 
situations there may be good reasons for this. In others, political considerations may 
curtail the effectiveness of the important work done by human rights officers. 
Consideration needs to be given to how, in such contexts, human rights monitoring 
and promotion is best facilitated. </p>


<p>(ii) Consideration should also be given to the circumstances in which United 
Nations officials, for human rights and humanitarian purposes, should maintain 
contact with rebel or insurgent groups. 
</p>
<p>80. Given the importance and complexity of these issues, it would be especially 
beneficial if a thorough independent study was commissioned. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Demobilization and unlawful killings 
</b></p>
<p>81. In post-conflict countries, or countries seeking to transition out of conflict, 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes for former rebels or 
other armed groups are critical to ending violence. However, my visits to States such as the 
Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Colombia indicate 
that delayed or poorly conceived or implemented DDR programmes may continue or start 
new cycles of violence. 
</p>
<p>82. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the poorly planned rapid integration 
(without vetting for war crimes or other violations) of over 12,000 rebels into the national 
army contributed to large-scale massacres of civilians by those newly integrated forces 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.3). Colombia is an example of a Government that achieved partial 
success in its DDR process &#8211; 48,616 illegal armed group members demobilized between 
2002 and 2009. Yet because the Government did not adequately dismantle command 
structures or investigate and prosecute crimes, new illegal armed groups, composed in large 
part of former paramilitaries, have formed and have allegedly committed over 4,000 
killings between 2002 and 2008 (A/HRC/14/24/Add.2, paras. 53-54 and 61). In the Central 
African Republic, delays and a lack of substantive progress on the country&#8217;s DDR 
programme heighten the risk that rebel groups will engage in more violence and killings in 
the lead-up to 2010 elections (A/HRC/14/24/Add.5). 
</p>
<p>83. In recent years, significant attention has been paid to formulating effective DDR 
programmes from the peacekeeping and security perspectives &#8211; addressing the political, 
military, technical, security, humanitarian and socio-economic needs of both victims and 
ex-combatants.38 But more research on DDR is needed from a human rights perspective. 
The challenges faced by Governments that, as a result of brutal and often decades-long 
conflicts, must re-build war-torn societies and fragile or non-existent State institutions 
cannot be underestimated. In order to assist policymakers, peacekeepers, civil society and 
human rights professionals to formulate and implement programmes that respect and ensure 
the right to life even &#8211; and especially &#8211; in unstable societies, in-depth and systematic 
research on the following would be beneficial: 
</p>
<p>(a) The relationship between different kinds of DDR programmes and their 
effectiveness in eliminating unlawful killings or other grave human rights abuses; 
</p>
<p>(b) The relationship between DDR programmes and transitional justice 
mechanisms as a means of eliminating unlawful killings;

and Reintegration of Former Combatants</i> (2000); Report of the Secretary-General on the prevention 
of armed conflict, (A/55/985-S/2001/574); Report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping 
Operations, &#8220;Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their 
aspects&#8221; (A/57/767); Report of the Secretary-General on disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration (A/60/705). </p>


<p>(c) The extent to which DDR programmes contribute (or not) to accountability 
for serious human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Reparations for unlawful killings and amends for civilian harm 
</b></p>
<p>84. Human rights law, humanitarian law and the international law on State responsibility 
require that individuals should have an effective remedy when their rights are violated, and 
that the State must provide reparations for its own violations.39 States must ensure that 
victims&#8217; families are able to enforce their right to compensation, through judicial remedies 
where necessary. In many cases, reparations can mean the difference between the 
destitution of innocents and their families, and their ability to rebuild their lives and 
livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>85. Yet there is a dearth of legal and factual research on the precise content of States&#8217; 
legal obligations and how those obligations are, or should be, implemented in practice, as 
well as on emerging State practice relating to amends for lawful harm to civilians during 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>86. During visits to countries experiencing armed conflict or other large-scale violence, 
I have found that States rarely complied with their reparations obligations,40 although some 
States, such as the United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland, have made commendable efforts.41 Those efforts include monetary payments to the 
families of those killed even in lawful attacks. Such payments &#8211; unlike formal reparations &#8211; 
are offered without legal implication and as a gesture of condolence and respect. The 
Government of the United States also makes amends by providing livelihood assistance 
programmes to individuals (e.g. skills training to enable widows to make a living) or 
communities (e.g. to repair damage caused by military operations). Most countries with 
combat troops in Afghanistan now offer monetary payments for lawful civilian harm, but 
programme implementation suffers from flaws, including a lack of common funding among 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) partners, inconsistency due to an over-
reliance on commander discretion and different troop-contributing country rules and 
practices, lack of access for civilians seeking payments, lack of a formal ISAF programme, 
and a lack of transparency. Some other States have also announced amends programmes in 
different contexts. In March 2010, Yemen promised payments to civilians killed in counter-
terrorism operations. These examples illustrate an expanding practice which is not yet being 
systematically tracked or instituted by the international community. 
</p>
<p>87. Legal and factual research on extrajudicial killings and reparations in the context of 
armed conflict could: 
</p>
<p>(a) Clarify the forms and amounts that reparations currently take; 
</p>
<p>(b) Promote best practices in the form and amounts of reparations;  
</p>
<p>(c) Assess how best to facilitate victims&#8217; and family members&#8217; access to 
reparations; 
</p>
<p>(d) Study how to promote consistency in amounts paid;

privacy and security needs) about payments; 
</p>
<p>(h) Clarify the relationship between reparations and amends. 
</p>
<p>88. Comparable research on amends could: 
</p>
<p>(a) Document existing State practice, including in relation to civilian deaths, 
injuries and property damage through lawful acts;  
</p>
<p>(b) Promote best practices in terms of the form and amounts of amends such as 
monetary payments, livelihood assistance, community aid and rebuilding, and psycho-
social efforts; 
</p>
<p>(c) Assess how best to facilitate victims&#8217; and family members&#8217; access to amends; 
</p>
<p>(d) Study how to ensure consistency and/or appropriate cultural context in 
amounts paid; 
</p>
<p>(e) Assess how parties to a conflict can ensure amends for losses caused by 
lawful conduct of their private security contractors. 
</p>
<p>89. Outside the context of armed conflict, research is also needed on the practices of 
States in providing effective remedies for violations of the right to life. What obstacles do 
families experience when attempting to enforce their right to a remedy? What statute of 
limitations (if any) commonly apply where a victim has been killed? How can States best 
ensure that unlawful killings are fairly compensated? Where the State is responsible for 
killings on a large scale, what systems or programmes can best provide and distribute 
reparations? 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Since this report consists largely of recommendations, and given space 
constraints, I will not repeat the many recommendations here. 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> In terms of a conclusion, a paradox emerges from the preceding review of the 
mandate&#8217;s impact. In formal terms, the Council itself only rarely takes any specific 
action, even when very serious violations of the prohibition of extrajudicial executions 
are apparent. Nor does it generally debate the details of country visit reports or 
troubling communications exchanges. And there is immense reluctance to respond to 
the persistent failure of certain States to agree to visit requests over a long-period of 
years. In terms of real impact, however, it is clear that the broad range of activities 
undertaken by the mandate pursuant to the Council&#8217;s authorization have mattered a 
great deal. Lives have been saved, lethal practices have been abandoned, greater 
caution has been shown, and awareness of the issues has grown at all levels. It is clear, 
nevertheless, that if the Council has the political will it can do vastly more to prevent 
unlawful killings around the world and to put in place much more effective 
mechanisms for accountability when atrocities do occur. </b></p>

<p><b> II. Assessing State responsiveness to communications 
</b></p>
<p>1. A systematic review of communications from December 2004 to March 2009a yields 
the following findings: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 523 communications relating to unlawful killings were sent (an average of 130 
letters per year). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 231 urgent appeals, 276 allegation letters, and 16 follow-up letters were sent. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Communications were sent to countries in all regions (a total of 87 countries and 3 
other actors).b  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The letters concerned more than 6,250 individuals (an average of over 1,560 
individuals per year). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Most of the letters concerned death penalty cases (over 150 letters), attacks or 
killings (over 90 letters)c, and deaths in custody (over 80). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The response rate to communications was generally poor. Of the 523 
communications sent, 256 (or 49%) were not responded to at all. A &#8220;no response&#8221; 
rate of roughly 50% was observed in each year during the period under review. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There were 118 responses categorized as &#8220;largely satisfactory&#8221; (23% of the total, or 
approximately 50% of the letters responded to). &#8220;Largely satisfactory&#8221; is the most 
positive characterization given to a Government&#8217;s reply in Special Rapporteur 
communications reports in prior years.d It denotes a reply that is responsive to the 
allegations and substantially clarifies the facts, but does not imply that the 
Government&#8217;s actions necessarily complied with international human rights law. 
Nevertheless, it is encouraging that when Governments do respond, half of their 
letters are largely responsive to the allegations made. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Of the countries which received letters, 30% received only one letter during the 
period under review. Over 70% received five or less letters. The 15 countries that 
received the most communications were: Iran (Islamic Republic of) (63), Colombia 
(28), Pakistan (28), Sri Lanka (24), Saudi Arabia (22), China (19), the United States 
of America (18), India (18), Nepal (17), Yemen (17), the Sudan (16), Iraq (14), the 
Philippines (14), Bangladesh (14), and Brazil (13).e Letters to these countries 
represent just over 60% of the total number of communications sent.f 
</p>
<p>  
 a The review relies on the data provided in each annual communication report. It does not cover letters 
</p>
<p>sent between March 2009 and April 2010 since sufficiently detailed information on those letters is not 
yet available. The communications addendum to this report contains letters sent from 16 March 2009 
to 15 March 2010, and replies received from 1 May 2009 to 30 April 2010. During that period 102 
communications were sent to 44 countries and 1 other actor. These included 61 urgent appeals and 41 
allegation letters. The main issues covered in the communications were: the death penalty (31), deaths 
in custody (14), the death penalty for minors (7), excessive use of force (16), impunity (3), attacks or 
killings (23), armed conflict (3), death threats (2) and others (3).  
</p>
<p> b See Appendix I for a list of the letters sent. 
 c The category of &#8220;attacks or killings&#8221; covers acts by State security forces, or by paramilitary groups, 
</p>
<p>death squads, or other private forces cooperating with or tolerated by the State. 
 d The other categories are: &#8220;cooperative but incomplete response&#8221;, &#8220;allegations rejected but without 
</p>
<p>adequate substantiation&#8221;, &#8220;receipt acknowledged&#8221;. See the annual communications reports of the 
Special Rapporteur for more detail. 
</p>
<p> e The fact that these States received the most communications should not necessarily be taken as an 
indication that they have the most significant problems of unlawful killings. This is because letters are 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>&#8226; Of the 15 countries that received the most communications, 7 failed to respond to 
more than 50% of letters they received: India (no reply to 16 of 18 letters), Iraq (no 
reply to 11 of 14 letters), the Sudan (no reply to 12 of 16 letters), Saudi Arabia (no 
reply to 16 of 22 letters), the United States (no reply to 12 of 18 letters), Brazil (no 
reply to 8 of 13 letters), and the Islamic Republic of Iran (no reply to 37 of 63 
letters). This &#8220;response rate&#8221; may not necessarily be a good indicator of country 
cooperation in all cases. For example, countries that received the most letters are 
effectively being asked to cooperate with Special Procedures at a higher level, and, 
where many communications are sent, the country may not have the resources 
necessary to prepare responses. Or, the rate by itself may provide only partial 
information about responses. Brazil, for instance, has a poor overall response rate 
(62% no responses), but did submit 4 (31%) &#8220;largely satisfactory&#8221; responses. 
Likewise, the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose &#8220;no response&#8221; rate was 59%, 
submitted 9 &#8220;largely satisfactory&#8221; responses. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Of the 15 countries that received the most communications, those that performed 
relatively well in responding (where their &#8220;no response&#8221; rate was less than 30 
percent) included Sri Lanka, China, Yemen, the Philippines, and Colombia. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Of the 15 countries that received the most communications, those with more than 
30% of their responses categorized as &#8220;largely satisfactory&#8221; were: Colombia, Sri 
Lanka, China, the Philippines, and Brazil. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The response rate of countries receiving just one letter in the period under review 
was also low. Of the 27 countries which were sent one letter, 16 (59%) did not 
respond at all.g

sent to a country based on several factors, including whether an allegation was received by the 
Special Rapporteur (thus letters sent can depend on the resources and focus of NGOs and others), the 
ease with which information about incidents can be obtained, and the extent to which there were 
indications of an insufficient domestic response. 
</p>
<p> f Perhaps surprisingly, the greater proportion of communications sent to this small number of countries 
does not substantially skew the overall response rate. In order to assess this, the rate was recalculated 
on a number of bases. First, of the 15, those countries whose &#8220;no response&#8221; rate was greater than 50% 
were excluded from the calculation. This resulted in a slightly improved &#8220;no response&#8221; rate of 40%. 
(Excluding these countries (7 States), 359 communications were sent. Of these, there were 144 no 
responses.) If all top 15 countries are excluded, the response rate is 53% - roughly that of the overall 
rate. (Excluding the 15 countries which received the most letters, the total number of letters sent was 
</p><p>198. Of these, there were 105 &#8220;no responses&#8221;).
