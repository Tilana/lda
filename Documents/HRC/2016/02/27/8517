<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102, 
in which the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
to continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions 
adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and 
studies. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
had initially interpreted decision 2/102 as extending previous reports of the Commission of 
Human Rights and providing for an annual reporting cycle. Until recently, this 
interpretation had been deemed to have received the tacit approval of member States. 
However, an objection was placed on the record in 2010, albeit in the context of another 
report which equally used decision 2/102 as the basis for its annual reporting. OHCHR has 
thus further reviewed the said decision, and concluded that the Human Rights Council 
sought to fill a technical gap by ensuring that reports which were deemed to be submitted to 
the sixty-second session of the Human Rights Commission would be extended by one year 
and transferred to the subsequent substantive session of the Human Rights Council. With 
this transition period over, and the objection now on record with regard to the initial 
interpretation of annual reporting cycles, if the Human Rights Council wishes such 
reporting to be continued, a new Human Rights Council resolution or decision on the matter 
should be tabled. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report outlines the progress achieved since the last report on the 
accreditation of national human rights institutions (NHRIs) (A/HRC/13/45), submitted to 
the Human Rights Council at its thirteenth session in March 2010. The report should be 
read together with the report of the Secretary-General on national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (A/HRC/16/76), which includes, inter alia, 
information on OHCHR activities to establish and strengthen NHRIs; measures taken by 
Governments and the said institutions in this regard; and NHRI cooperation with 
international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>3. The Subcommittee on Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee of 
National Human Rights Institutions has the mandate to review and analyse applications for 
accreditation and to make recommendations to members of the International Coordinating 
Committee Bureau on the applicant&#8217;s compliance with the principles relating to the status 
of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). 
The Subcommittee consists of representatives from one &#8220;A&#8221; status NHRI from each of the 
four International Coordination Committee regional groupings: Africa, the Americas, Asia 
and the Pacific, and Europe. Subcommittee members are appointed by the regional 
groupings for a renewable term of three years and they designate by consensus, for a 
renewable term of one year, one member to act as the Chairperson. Currently, the members 
are representatives of the NHRIs of Canada, Togo, the Republic of Korea and Germany. 
OHCHR is a permanent observer of the Subcommittee on Accreditation and serves as its 
secretariat. 
</p>
<p>4. A table reflecting the accreditation status as of December 2010 is included in the 
annex to the present document.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Improvement of the International Coordinating Committee 
accreditation process 
</b></p>
<p>5. The accreditation process carried out by the Subcommittee on Accreditation, with the 
support of OHCHR, is a dynamic process which has over the years increased in its </p>


<p>rigorousness, fairness and transparency. At its seventeenth session, held in April 2006, the 
International Coordinating Committee initiated a revision of the accreditation process of 
NHRIs. A discussion paper on the matter was developed by a working group, comprising the 
then members of the Subcommittee on Accreditation. Three areas were considered: (a) the 
composition of the Subcommittee on Accreditation and its role and responsibilities; (b) the 
accreditation process; and (c) the substance of criteria or minimum standards set for 
accreditation. The paper was submitted to the eighteenth and nineteenth sessions of the 
International Coordinating Committee. A decision paper was developed, which was 
presented and adopted at the twentieth session of the International Coordinating Committee 
in April 2008. 
</p>
<p>6. The accreditation process plays an important role in assessing the effectiveness of 
NHRIs and in strengthening their performance in the fulfilment of their mandate. On that 
basis, the International Coordinating Committee has undertaken a number of measures to 
improve its accreditation procedures:  
</p>
<p> (a) In order to ensure greater transparency and due process for NHRIs that are 
deemed not to comply with the Paris Principles, an appeal process has been included in the 
accreditation procedures; 
</p>
<p> (b) The rigorousness of the review has increased. In that regard the 
Subcommittee on Accreditation bases its review on all the documentary evidence provided 
by the applicant NHRI, including the statement of compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Subcommittee on Accreditation issues more focused recommendations 
to each NHRI (whether &#8220;A&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221; or &#8220;C&#8221; status) to ensure full compliance with the Paris 
Principles, even before the prescribed five-year time frame for review of accreditations;  
</p>
<p> (d) The recommendations of the Subcommittee on Accreditation are 
disseminated more widely among NHRIs and other stakeholders to ensure a more proactive 
role in the context of follow-up action by the United Nations or NHRI regional 
coordinating bodies. The reports of the Subcommittee on Accreditation are posted on the 
Internet (www.nhri.net/default.asp?PID=607&amp;DID=0). 
</p>
<p>7. According to article 7 of its statute, one of the functions of the International 
Coordinating Committee is to promote the establishment and strengthening of NHRIs in 
conformity with the Paris Principles. In this regard, the International Coordinating 
Committee continues to give high importance to the accreditation process, as evidenced in 
the Strategic Plan for 2010&#8211;2013, adopted by consensus at its twenty-third session, held 
from 22 to 25 March 2010. According to the Strategic Plan, the first strategic objective is to 
maintain and strengthen the accreditation process by: better preparing NHRIs for the review 
by the Subcommittee on Accreditation; tailoring and contextualizing the Subcommittee 
recommendations for specific NHRIs; strengthening the transparency in the process; and 
improving accessibility to the Subcommittee on Accreditation processes for NHRIs, the 
regional networks and civil society.  
</p>
<p>8. According to the accreditation procedure, as stipulated in article 12 of the 
International Coordinating Committee Statute, when the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
comes to an accreditation decision, that decision shall be considered an accreditation status 
recommendation, with the final decision being taken by the International Coordinating 
Committee Bureau once the following process has been completed:  
</p>
<p> (a) The recommendation of the Subcommittee shall first be forwarded to the 
applicant;  
</p>
<p> (b) The applicant can challenge a recommendation by submitting a written 
challenge to the International Coordinating Committee Chair, through OHCHR as the 
International Coordinating Committee secretariat, within 28 days of receipt; </p>


<p> (c) Thereafter, the recommendation will be forwarded to the members of the 
International Coordinating Committee Bureau for a decision. If a challenge has been 
received from the applicant, the challenge together with all relevant material received in 
connection with both the application and the challenge will also be forwarded to the 
members of the Bureau;  
</p>
<p> (d) Any member of the International Coordinating Committee Bureau who 
disagrees with the recommendation shall, within 20 days of its receipt, notify the Chair of 
the Subcommittee and the International Coordinating Committee secretariat. The secretariat 
will promptly notify all members of the Bureau of the objection raised and will provide all 
necessary information to clarify that objection. If within 20 days of receipt of this 
information at least four members of the International Coordinating Committee Bureau 
coming from not less than two regional groups notify the secretariat that they hold a similar 
objection, the recommendation shall be referred to the next Bureau meeting for decision;  
</p>
<p> (e) If at least four members coming from two or more regional groups do not 
raise any objection to the recommendation within 20 days of its receipt, the 
recommendation shall be deemed to be approved by the International Coordinating 
Committee Bureau;  
</p>
<p> (f) The decision of the International Coordinating Committee Bureau on 
accreditation is final. 
</p>
<p>9. In accordance with the rules of procedure of the Subcommittee on Accreditation, the 
classifications for accreditation are:  
</p>
<p>A status:  Compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p>B status:  Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient 
information provided to make a determination; 
</p>
<p>C status:  Non-compliance with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>10. The rules of procedure of the Subcommittee on Accreditation are incorporated as an 
annex of the Statute of the International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs (art. 59). The 
Canadian Human Rights Commission, together with OHCHR as the International 
Coordinating Committee secretariat, developed a compendium that includes extracts from 
the Statute relevant to the accreditation process, namely, on the rules of procedure for the 
Subcommittee on Accreditation, general observations, working methods, guidelines for 
accreditation applications, the template of the Statement of Compliance, and the Paris 
Principles. The compendium was submitted to the Subcommittee on Accreditation during 
the latter&#8217;s March-April session.  
</p>
<p>11. The Subcommittee on Accreditation continued to receive from civil society 
organizations information on the NHRIs considered at its last two sessions, in March/April 
and October 2010. Summaries of all communications were prepared by the secretariat and 
shared with the relevant NHRIs prior to the review of their applications by the 
Subcommittee. NHRIs had one week to provide comments on these summaries. 
Subsequently, the summaries and comments were sent to the members of the Subcommittee 
on Accreditation. The summaries and comments were posted on 
(www.nhri.net/default.asp?PID=607&amp;DID=0) following the adoption by the International 
Coordinating Committee Bureau of the recommendations of the Subcommittee.  
</p>
<p>12. In 2010, the Subcommittee on Accreditation increased its efforts to engage NHRI 
regional coordinating committees in the accreditation process. The committees of the four 
International Coordinating Committee regions each received an invitation to participate, as 
observers, in the sessions of the Subcommittee. The Subcommittee welcomed the 
attendance of representatives of the secretariat of the Network of African National Human </p>


<p>Rights Institutions, the secretariat of the Asia Pacific Forum, the European Coordinating 
Committee and the International Coordinating Committee representative in Geneva, as well 
as the attendance of a representative of the Network of National Institutions for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights of the Americas at its October session.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Accreditation process in 2010 
</b></p>
<p>13. There is a growing interest in the creation and strengthening of national human 
rights institutions in line with the Paris Principles, and the number of NHRIs accredited 
with &#8220;A&#8221; status increased in 2010. The General Assembly, in its resolution 64/161, gives a 
greater recognition to the accreditation process carried out by the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation by encouraging NHRIs, including ombudsman institutions, to seek 
accreditation status through the International Coordinating Committee. 
</p>
<p>14. In 2010, the Subcommittee on Accreditation considered three new applications for 
accreditation from NHRIs of the Congo, Scotland and Serbia. The National Human Rights 
Commission from the Congo was granted &#8220;B&#8221; status. The Scottish Human Rights 
Commission and the Protector of Citizens of the Republic of Serbia were accredited &#8220;A&#8221; 
status. 
</p>
<p>15. The Subcommittee on Accreditation reviewed the accreditation status (re-
accreditation reviews) of 12 NHRIs from Algeria, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Maldives, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Slovakia, 
Slovenia and Switzerland1. The National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms of 
Cameroon was upgraded to &#8220;A&#8221; status. The Human Rights Ombudsman of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina was re-accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status. The National Human Rights Commission 
of Algeria, the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman of Slovenia, the Equal Treatment 
Commission of the Netherlands, the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to 
Racism of Belgium, and the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives were granted &#8220;B&#8221; 
status. The Federal Commission against Racism from Switzerland was downgraded to &#8220;C&#8221; 
status. The accreditation decisions for the NHRIs from Austria, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and 
Slovakia were deferred to the next Subcommittee session. 
</p>
<p>16. The Subcommittee on Accreditation also conducted special reviews of the NHRIs of 
Azerbaijan, Great Britain, Greece, Honduras, Jordan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Morocco, 
Nepal, Qatar and Senegal. The decisions regarding the accreditation of the NHRIs from 
Azerbaijan and Senegal were deferred to the next Subcommittee session. The NHRIs from 
Great Britain, Greece, Jordan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Morocco and Qatar maintained their 
&#8220;A&#8221; status. The NHRIs from Honduras and Nepal were recommended to be downgraded to 
&#8220;B&#8221; status.  
</p>
<p>17. During its two last sessions, the Subcommittee on Accreditation issued tailored 
recommendations to the reviewed NHRIs. A recurrent recommendation has been the 
importance of allocating adequate funding to NHRIs in order to ensure an effective 
discharge of their mandate. The Subcommittee has also reiterated that the selection and 
appointment process of NHRI members should be open and transparent, with the 
involvement of all national actors. It has stressed the need for greater cooperation between 
NHRIs and civil society in order to ensure NHRI independence and pluralism.

<p><b> IV. General observations 
</b></p>
<p>18. Since October 2006, the Subcommittee on Accreditation has developed general 
observations concerning accreditation.2 These interpretative tools were formulated on 
common or important issues regarding the Paris Principles and are intended to constitute 
guidance for the Subcommittee with regard to the process for accreditation and the 
implementation of the Paris Principles. As noted in the decision paper adopted by the 
International Coordinating Committee at its twentieth session, the general observations may 
be used to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Instruct institutions when they are developing their own processes and 
mechanisms, to ensure compliance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> (b) Persuade domestic governments to address or remedy issues relating to an 
institution&#8217;s compliance with the standards articulated in the general observations; 
</p>
<p> (c) Guide the Subcommittee on Accreditation in its determination of new 
accreditation applications, re-accreditation applications or special reviews. 
</p>
<p>19. In November 2009, the International Coordinating Committee Bureau made 
suggestions to improve the development and use of the general observations concerning 
accreditation. During its March-April session in 2010, the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
decided to embark on a review of the existing general observations. A consultation on the 
general observations was carried out among the International Coordinating Committee 
members and a draft decision on the review is to be presented at the International 
Coordinating Committee annual session in May 2011.  
</p>
<p>20. The Subcommittee on Accreditation is currently considering the development of 
general observations on:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; NHRIs serving as national monitoring and preventive mechanisms  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The quasi-judicial competencies of NHRIs  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The performance of NHRIs  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>21. <b>Informed stakeholders, such as the regional coordinating bodies of NHRIs, 
have participated more actively in the accreditation process, which has significantly 
increased the transparency of the process.  
</b></p>
<p>22. <b>Tailored recommendations have been issued by the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation, based on reviews of NHRI applications for accreditation. The States 
and other stakeholders, including United Nations agencies, are called upon to join 
efforts and follow up on the recommendations of the Subcommittee to enable NHRIs 
to fully comply with the Paris Principles, both in law and in practice.  
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>The Subcommittee on Accreditation has emphasized the need for allocation by 
States of adequate resources to NHRIs, in order to ensure the effective discharge of 
their mandates. In this regard, States are encouraged to provide NHRIs with 
sufficient funds to perform the functions set out in their mandates.   
</b></p>
<p>  
 2 For a list of the general observations of the Subcommittee as of 2009, see A/HRC/13/45, annex IV. </p>


<p>24. <b>The Subcommittee on Accreditation continues to attach great importance to a 
transparent and open process for appointing NHRI members, with a broad 
participation of all national stakeholders, including civil society organizations. This 
process is a key guarantee of NHRI independence, diversity and accessibility.   
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>Civil society organizations can be an effective link between NHRIs and 
individuals and vulnerable groups. The Subcommittee on Accreditation is encouraged 
to develop a more systematic cooperation with civil society organizations. NHRIs are 
encouraged to implement the Subcommittee recommendation on the maintenance of 
close cooperation with civil society in the fulfilment of their mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>26. <b>The review of the existent general observations is an important initiative, since 
these observations are an additional and progressive interpretative tool of the Paris 
Principles. The development of additional general observations, inter alia on national 
human rights institutions serving as national monitoring and preventive mechanisms, 
on the quasi-judicial competency of national human rights institutions, and on 
assessing their performance, is further encouraged. </b></p>
