<body><p><b> Human Rights Council  
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 6/7. Human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> its decision 4/103 of 30 March 2007 and taking note of General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 61/170 of 19 December 2006, as well as of the report of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on this issue (A/HRC/6/2), 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to 
</p>
<p>international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated 
</p>
<p>character of all human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development 
</p>
<p>as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern</i> about the negative impact of unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures in the field of human rights, development, international relations, trade, 
</p>
<p>investment and cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Final Document of the Fourteenth Conference of Heads of State 
</p>
<p>or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in September 2006 in Havana, in 
</p>
<p>which they agreed to oppose and condemn these measures or laws and their continued 
</p>
<p>application, persevere with efforts to effectively reverse them and urge other States to 
</p>
<p>do likewise as called for by the General Assembly and other United Nations organs, 
</p>
<p>and to request States applying these measures or laws to revoke them fully and 
</p>
<p>immediately, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna 
</p>
<p>from 14 to 25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not </p>

<p>in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates 
</p>
<p>obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of all human 
</p>
<p>rights, and also severely threatens the freedom of trade, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly, the former Commission on Human Rights and United Nations 
</p>
<p>conferences held in the 1990s and their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms of 
</p>
<p>international law and the Charter of the United Nations, unilateral coercive measures 
</p>
<p>continue to be promulgated, implemented and enforced, inter alia through resorting to 
</p>
<p>war and militarism, with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian 
</p>
<p>activities and economic and social development of developing countries, including 
</p>
<p>their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights which provides, inter alia, that in no case may a people be deprived of 
</p>
<p>its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Urges</i> all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful 
</p>
<p>relations among States, in particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>effects, which create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full 
</p>
<p>realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>other international human rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and 
</p>
<p>peoples to development; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, 
</p>
<p>in addition, threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all 
</p>
<p>Member States neither to recognize these measures nor apply them, as well as to take 
</p>
<p>effective administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial application or effects of unilateral coercive measures; </p>

<p> 3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by 
</p>
<p>certain Powers of such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any 
</p>
<p>country, particularly against developing countries, with a view to preventing these 
</p>
<p>countries from exercising their right to decide, of their own free will, their own 
</p>
<p>political, economic and social systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates its call</i> upon Member States that have initiated such 
</p>
<p>measures to abide by the principles of international law, the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, the declarations of the United Nations and world conferences and relevant 
</p>
<p>resolutions and to commit themselves to their obligations and responsibilities arising 
</p>
<p>from the international human rights instruments to which they are parties by putting 
</p>
<p>an immediate end to such measures; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i>, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, 
</p>
<p>by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural development; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recalls</i> that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International 
</p>
<p>Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the Charter of the United Nations, contained in the annex to General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, and according to the relevant principles 
</p>
<p>and provisions contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States 
</p>
<p>proclaimed by the Assembly in its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in 
</p>
<p>particular article 32, no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or 
</p>
<p>any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the 
</p>
<p>subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages 
</p>
<p>of any kind; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms</i> that essential goods such as food and medicines should not 
</p>
<p>be used as tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people 
</p>
<p>be deprived of their own means of subsistence and development; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines</i> that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major 
</p>
<p>obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, 
</p>
<p>in this regard, calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic 
</p>
<p>coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws which run </p>

<p>counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing 
</p>
<p>countries, as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to 
</p>
<p>Development in its report on its second session (E/CN.4/1998/29); 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Rejects</i> all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well 
</p>
<p>as the increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial application which are not in conformity with international law; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recognizes</i> that the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase 
</p>
<p>of the World Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, 
</p>
<p>strongly urged States to avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the 
</p>
<p>Information Society;  
</p>
<p> 11<i>. Invites</i> all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the 
</p>
<p>Council in the field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due attention, within 
</p>
<p>the scope of their respective mandates, to the negative impact and consequences of 
</p>
<p>unilateral coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Decides</i> to give due consideration to the negative impact of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures in its task concerning the implementation of the right to 
</p>
<p>development; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests</i>: </p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 
</p>
<p>discharging her functions in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights, 
</p>
<p>to pay due attention and give urgent consideration to the present resolution; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention 
</p>
<p>of all Member States and to seek their views and information on the implications and 
</p>
<p>negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations, and to submit a 
</p>
<p>report thereon to the Council as appropriate, in accordance with its annual programme 
</p>
<p>of work;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Decides</i> to examine this question, on a priority basis, as appropriate, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with its annual programme of work under the same agenda item. </p>
