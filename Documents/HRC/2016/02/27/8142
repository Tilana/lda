<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present is an advance report on the global thematic study on international 
human rights law capacity-building activities for judges, magistrates, prosecutors, public 
defenders and lawyers, which the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 15/3, requested 
the Special Rapporteur to submit to the Council at its twentieth session. It was prepared on 
the basis of the responses received from States, national human rights institutions and non-
governmental organizations to a questionnaire sent by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p> In the report, the Special Rapporteur assesses the information received on the 
structural elements of current training initiatives on international human rights law. She 
considers that the knowledge of judges, magistrates, prosecutors, public defenders and 
lawyers and the application of international human rights law at the domestic level have a 
direct impact on combating impunity for human rights violations, enforcing the rule of law, 
strengthening democracy and ensuring human rights-based development. 
</p>
<p> In the first stage of the global thematic study, the Special Rapporteur assesses 
international human rights education and the ongoing training of the main judicial actors. 
She explores current training programmes, the way they are conducted, how often they are 
offered, how their effectiveness is assessed, and the main obstacles to adequate capacity-
building activities. 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p> The Special Rapporteur analyses the importance of solid knowledge and 
understanding of international human rights law and legal education in the appointment, 
career and promotion of magistrates, judges, prosecutors and public defenders. She 
analyses the main challenges faced, particularly the lack of adequate resources, and gender 
sensitivity issues in the training of judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes the report with a series of initial 
recommendations in order to encourage the development and improve the quality of 
training activities, as well as their effectiveness. Capacity-building activities in the sphere 
of international human rights law are an important instrument to clear away prejudices 
against human rights, and to promote and protect them more effectively.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 15/3, the Human Rights Council requested the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers to carry out a global thematic study to assess the 
human rights education and continuing training of judges, prosecutors, public defenders, 
and lawyers. The present advance report on that study is based on information gathered by 
means of a questionnaire focusing on the structural elements of existing human rights 
courses and training initiatives. Such courses and training should be aimed at affecting the 
way that legal professionals discharge their functions by encouraging them to apply 
international human rights principles and standards at the domestic level. 
</p>
<p>2. In her first thematic report submitted to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/14/26), 
the Special Rapporteur focused on the need for continuing human rights capacity-building 
for judges, prosecutors, lawyers and public defenders. The report was based on the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment that an independent judiciary should be strengthened in order to 
promote and protect human rights as the quality of the administration of justice has a direct 
impact on democracy and the development of States. 
</p>
<p>3. In resolution 15/3, the Human Rights Council requested the Special Rapporteur to 
carry out the study from within existing resources and with the support of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), specifying also that he 
study was to include recommendations for appropriate follow-up.  
</p>
<p>4. The present report is based on data collected by means of a questionnaire and 
information obtained from different actors within and outside the United Nations. The aim 
of the questionnaire was to investigate the current situation of existing training institutions 
and programmes, as well as the possible causes that may have created the gap noted by the 
Special Rapporteur in her thematic report in order to ensure that the justice system becomes 
more effective in guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms, and fighting human rights 
violations and combating impunity. 
</p>
<p>5. The report was also prepared on the basis of information contained in several 
thematic reports submitted by the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council and the 
General Assembly during the first years of her mandate.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. Analysis of replies to the questionnaire 
</b></p>
<p>6. The global thematic study project is based on the fundamental understanding that the 
effective, ongoing capacity-building of all the actors of the justice system plays a decisive 
role in the independence of judges, magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers and public defenders, 
guaranteeing respect for human rights in a democratic society. The main issues raised in the 
questionnaire sent to all Member States and other stakeholders, including civil society 
organizations, concerned, inter alia, existing training programmes; how are they conducted; 
how often are they offered (both initial and ongoing training); how their effectiveness is 
assessed; and the main obstacles to capacity-building courses. 
</p>
<p>7. The primary responsibility for ensuring human rights lies with the State, including 
the judicial branch. The main actors in the justice system - judges, magistrates, prosecutors, 
</p>
<p>  
 1 On the need for continuous capacity-building for judges, prosecutors, lawyers and public defenders 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/14/2); combating impunity (A/65/274); the integration of a gender perspective in the 
administration of justice (A/HRC/17/30); and the integration of a gender perspective in the criminal 
justice system (A/66/289). </p>


<p>lawyers and public defenders - should therefore be provided with human rights training and 
capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>8. It may be difficult to accept that the main actors of the justice system may lack the 
knowledge related to international human rights law and the State obligations entailed 
therein. It must be said that most of these actors, especially senior ones, have not had the 
opportunity to study international human rights law at university, since human rights-
related matters have only recently and gradually been introduced into the curricula of 
university faculties and law schools. This situation must be recognized in order to urgently 
move forward and work to remedy it. 
</p>
<p>9. The independence of the judiciary is based on the competence, professionalism, 
impartiality and integrity of its actors, as well as on the upholding of its responsibility as an 
institution that is one of the three branches of the State and which is entrusted with 
promoting and ensuring respect for rule of law at the national level. 
</p>
<p>10. The global thematic study aims at filling the gaps observed in the existing capacity-
building mechanisms which, it seems, have limited results,2 by identifying the internal and 
structural elements of human rights training programmes and justice systems and of their 
worldwide functioning, the content of current capacity-building courses in the area of 
international human rights law (from those provided by universities to those promoted by 
courts and/or judicial academies), and the real and potential obstacles to capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>11. The first part of the preparation for the study included the addressing of a 
questionnaire to, inter alia, Member States, courts of justice, associations of magistrates, bar 
associations, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to 
gather information on the issue. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur evaluates the 
results of the first stage. 
</p>
<p>12. The present report is to be followed by regional consultations, which will allow a 
more detailed and in-depth assessment of existing capacity-building programmes, such as 
by identifying good practices, and their effective integration and application of international 
and regional human rights instruments and standards, including by collecting national 
judicial decisions reflecting the application of human rights norms in concrete domestic 
cases. 
</p>
<p>13. Regional consultations, the second part in the project, should comprise meetings to 
be held in different regions in order to allow the Special Rapporteur to gather, examine and 
share information and trends on human rights capacity-building for judicial actors, to 
compare successes and difficulties, and to discuss possible courses of action regarding 
qualification or capacity-building programmes for justice system actors and institutions, 
judicial schools, training centres and non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur wishes to use the regional consultations as a mechanism to 
promote the development and use of human rights manuals in the field of administration of 
justice such as, inter alia, those prepared by OHCHR and the International Bar Association, 
as well as the <i>Human Rights Manual for Prosecutors</i> prepared by the International 
Association of Prosecutors. It is expected that persons benefiting from such training, in 
particular judges, magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers and public defenders, would gain 
comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the functioning of the international and 
regional human rights protection systems. 
</p>
<p>  
 2 A/HRC/14/26, paras. 24 and 27.  </p>


<p>15. The outcome of the regional consultations would enable the Special Rapporteur to 
commence drafting guidelines on effective and continuous human rights capacity-building 
for magistrates, judges, prosecutors, lawyers and public defenders. 
</p>
<p>16. The third stage of the global thematic study will be an international global 
conference,3 during which those guidelines could be finalized and approved. 
</p>
<p>17. It is expected that the guidelines will be a useful tool for Member States as well as 
institutions that offer ongoing human rights education programmes and others that monitor 
their results, and help them to promote the improvement of the effectiveness of capacity-
building programmes. The guidelines will therefore have the ultimate goal of strengthening 
rule of law, good governance, the principle of the separation of powers, and democracy by 
affirming the basic principles for the independence of the judiciary, the role of lawyers and 
the role of prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>18. The active participation of all actors involved in the project will be extremely 
valuable in all its phases, from the responses to the questionnaire to direct participation in 
the regional consultations leading up to the global international conference. 
</p>
<p>19. The questionnaire elaborated for the present report was intended to cover the highest 
number of themes possible with a view to gather comprehensive information on the present 
state of capacity-building programmes in different judicial systems, and information on 
their availability, functioning, effectiveness and implementation. The study aims at 
identifying the elements that could clarify the functioning of existing capacity-building 
programmes, bearing in mind that it is crucial that the actors of the justice system receive 
the necessary training to guarantee the quality of their decisions in ensuring the protection 
and promotion of human rights. Independent judicial systems therefore need to demonstrate 
integrity, competence, diligence and impartiality. 
</p>
<p>20. The questionnaire included questions on several aspects of capacity-building. It was 
intended to collect data and analyse it to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the 
situation, and divided into the categories of general information; legislation framework; 
education in human rights and capacity-building for judges and prosecutors; and education 
in human rights and capacity-building for lawyers and public defenders. The Special 
Rapporteur wishes to thank the State Court of Mato Grosso, Brazil, and in particular its 
information technology department for the extensive support provided for the global study. 
</p>
<p>21. The section below provides preliminary information on the challenges relating to the 
capacity-building programmes for the main actors of the justice system, as requested by the 
Human Rights Council in its resolution 15/3. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the 70 States and entities, as well as the 
several institutions and non-governmental organizations, that replied to the questionnaire. 
In several cases, more than one institution from the same State replied to the questionnaire, 
bringing the total number of replies to 82. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur would also like to thank the States and institutions that sent 
additional information for the questionnaire, thereby demonstrating their great interest in 
the necessity of providing judges, magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers and public defenders 
with ongoing human rights training and capacity-building. She hopes to receive the same 
support for the next two stages of the global study, which will be concluded in June 2015.

</p><p>28. The Special Rapporteur considered that it was more appropriate not to present an 
average of public defenders per inhabitant given that 85 per cent of the participating States 
do not have a public defender&#8217;s office and that legal aid is provided by lawyers directly. In 
many States, legal assistance is provided free of charge by appointed lawyers (through legal 
aid programmes), who are paid by the Government to promote defence at trial or to protect 
people&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>29. The option to present the highest, lowest and average number of people per judge, 
prosecutor and lawyer was preferred in order to avoid giving a false impression that the 
average found in the present study was adequate to ensure good administration of justice. </p>


<p>30. It should be noted that most participating States have a unitary State structure, are 
deemed to have a republican Government and have, predominantly, civil or continental law 
as the basis of their legal system.

<p> 
</p><p>31. On the basis of the information gathered during her missions and activities, the 
Special Rapporteur observed that capacity-building for judges, prosecutors, lawyers and 
public defenders is more complex in federal States owing to the diversity of their 
legislations and the specific justice system in each State and at the federal level. It is very 
challenging to administer justice in a context of coexistence of State and federal courts 
owing to the diversity of rules of competence (an obstacle to effective justice), the 
difference in the functioning of systems and the rules of procedures in each State, also at 
the federal level, the difficulty of communication between the two levels of jurisdiction 
(State and federal), the differences in court infrastructure, and the difference in access to 
them. Considering the complexity of the functioning of the justice system and the fact that 
the population also perceives it as being complex, more efforts are needed to ensure access 
to justice. 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to the justice system, according to the replies received, an estimated 
average4 of 47 per cent of States had a civil law-based legal system, 26 per cent a mixed 
law system, 19 per cent a common law-based system, and 1 per cent a system based on 
Islamic law. In most replies, mixed law legal system comprised common law and Islamic 
law. The Superior Court Judges Association of Canada reported that Canada is a federal 
State in which the common law system applies in most provinces and territories, except in 
the province of Quebec, where a civil law-based system applies (except for matters of 
criminal law).  
</p>
<p>33. It should also be noted that, to a certain extent, there has been a worldwide trend to 
migrate from one legal system to the other, from civil law to common law, in such States as 
Chile, Colombia, Georgia and Mexico in, inter alia, procedural matters. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that oral proceedings existing under common law, together with the 
plea bargaining system, have been regarded as important tools to speed legal proceedings 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Estimated average denotes the average obtained from the replies received for a specific question, also 
</p>
<p>taking into consideration the fact that some States did not reply to all questions. </p>


<p>and criminal trials, and this has been taken into consideration by those promoting changes 
in their respective judicial system.  
</p>
<p>34. Such change is related to each country&#8217;s political and sovereign decision to modify 
(or not) its own legal system. The Special Rapporteur wishes to point out the importance of 
such a political decision in the sense that, when it is made, it should be strong in order to 
give support and implement all the indispensable actions to ensure the effectiveness of that 
change. It means that, besides adapting buildings or establishing infrastructure, capacity-
building and training on the new legal system should be provided to all legal professionals 
and judicial actors. Such training lies far beyond the mere study of the text of the new law; 
it implies a profound cultural change. 
</p>
<p>35. Changes in the legal system also require the adaptation of the curricula of legal and 
judicial courses and trainings, starting with the initial education of those who study law at 
university. The assessment of the effectiveness of judicial activities during a transition from 
one judicial system to another is crucial, especially in order to identify what further 
measures should be taken. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s official mission to Colombia, 
the State had recently decided to migrate from a civil law-based system of criminal 
procedure to a common law-based one by establishing a public oral accusatory system. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed of the existence of capacity-building programmes for 
judges under the new system; she was also told, however, that a group of judges had just 
received a training course based on civil law through a partnership that had been 
established with a foreign institution. During her official mission to Mexico, the Special 
Rapporteur observed that the State had also decided to change its criminal procedural 
system and that the changes still needed to be promoted and implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Career and promotion of judges, prosecutors and public defenders  
</b></p>
<p>36. The career of judicial actors usually begins with oral and written public 
examinations: 62.1 per cent in the case of judges, 59.2 per cent in the case of prosecutors, 
69.4 per cent in the case of lawyers, and 48.6 per cent in the case of public defenders. 
According to the information contained in the replies received, the second most common 
way to start a legal career is by election, appointment or nomination by the executive organ 
(36.7 per cent in the case of prosecutors and 29.3 per cent for judges). It was pointed out 
that practical experience is required prior to admission to judicial and prosecutorial careers 
(in 68.9 per cent and 37.7 per cent respectively). </p>

case of judges, and 70.5 per cent of the responses in the case of prosecutors. Productivity 
was the second criterion for the promotion of judges (52.9 per cent) and prosecutors (59.1 
per cent). Passing periodic evaluations/examinations was also noted as a criterion for the 
promotion of judges (35.3 per cent) and prosecutors (36.4 per cent).

<p>39. Educational curricula (such as training and specialization courses and post-graduate 
degrees) should be taken into consideration in the promotion of magistrates, judges and 
prosecutors. The areas of interest and/or further studies undertaken by judicial actors are 
too rarely taken into account in the criteria for their career development plans (promotion, 
transfer and other circumstances of mobility) or the procedures for filling vacant posts. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur observed that the main challenges for delivering justice 
were case backlog and workload, its costs and length of time. She believes that the various 
forms of alternative dispute-resolution constitute important mechanisms for solving 
conflicts; justice system actors should thus strengthen their use. The replies to the 
questionnaire showed that such alternative dispute-resolution mechanisms are being widely 
used; justice system actors should therefore be trained on how to use them properly.

</p>
<p><b>Participating countries - Forms of alternative dispute resolution.
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>41. The United States of America noted that several other forms of alternative dispute- 
resolution mechanisms are being developed, including case evaluation, early neutral 
evaluations, facilitations, family group conferences, mini-trials, ombudspersons, private 
judging and settlement conferences. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Institutions 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur highlights the role played by several institutions that 
contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights. According to the information 
provided in the replies received, human rights national institutions exist in about two thirds 
of the States surveyed. In addition, universities have the responsibility to provide, in law 
and social and political sciences courses, general basic education on the legal system to the 
future actors of the legal professions. The questionnaire also revealed the existence of a 
similarity in the organization of the functional structure of courts of justice, which is an 
important instrument ensuring a two-tier level of jurisdiction (judicial authority). Most 
States have judicial academies or schools for magistrates; they also have associations of 
judges and prosecutors, as well as bar associations.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Financial resources 
</b></p>
<p>43. In 46 per cent of participating States, the Supreme Court has the responsibility of 
managing its own budget; in 45 per cent, national or high judiciary councils manage their 
own budget; in 32.9 per cent, the executive organ manages the budget of the judiciary. </p>


<p>Approval of budgets is the responsibility of Parliament, except in the Sudan, where the 
national judicial service commission formulates, approves and manages its own budget and 
that of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p>44. Some 67.5 per cent of the replies indicated that training centres had their own 
budget, allowing them to be independent of tribunals, supreme courts and national or high 
judiciary councils. Costs for the training of judges, prosecutors and public defenders are 
mostly covered by the same training centres (40 per cent) and/or the judiciary (25 per cent) 
and/or the executive organ/Ministry of Justice (24 per cent) in courses tailored for their 
respective functions and offered on the premises of the training centres. The costs of post-
graduate courses, however, are paid for by the individuals themselves in almost 90 per cent 
of cases. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur observed that, despite the existing financial resources 
available for training, lack of resources allocated by means of a specific budget is still an 
impediment to necessary capacity-building programmes. This was a common concern 
expressed in the replies to the questionnaire.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>46. The United Nations human rights treaties with the highest number of ratifications 
among the States surveyed were the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

<p>HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION AND CONTINUING TRAINING OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALS  
</p>
<p><b>Participating countries - International treaties/instruments and State parties
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>47. Depending on the constitutional system of each State, international human rights 
treaties, when ratified, enjoy either the same binding force as the Constitution or infra-
constitutional or legal force. The replies obtained indicated that, in 41.9 per cent of 
participating States, human rights treaties are given infra-constitutional or legally binding 
force; in 32.3 per cent, constitutional binding force; and in 30.6 per cent, they are given 
supra-legal status. </p>


<p>48. The Special Rapporteur highlights the fact that, when international treaties are given 
constitutional status, allegations that international provisions are in conflict with the 
Constitution are less likely. The protection of human rights tends, therefore, to be more 
effective, reducing the margin of judicial discretion in the interpretation of legal 
provisions.6 
</p>
<p>49. The independence of the judiciary is laid down by the Constitution in the majority of 
participating States, followed by its further clarification in organic or ordinary laws.

</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>50. The replies also indicated that, in 56.7 per cent of cases, there was no specific legal 
provision regarding the implementation of decisions or recommendations of international 
human rights bodies and/or regional human rights courts. 
</p>
<p>51. With regard to the qualifications and training of judges, magistrates, prosecutors, 
lawyers and public defenders, most States had the requirements for qualification as 
regulated by law; 79.2 per cent for the profession of judge; 73.3 per cent for public 
prosecutors; 71.8 per cent for lawyers; and 57.7 per cent for public defenders. Training is 
required by law only in half of the States, and when training is on human rights, the number 
of States with such a law is halved again. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Human rights education and ongoing training of legal professionals 
</b></p>
<p>52. In general, legal professionals start their careers after completing their law education 
in law faculties or schools at universities. According to the responses concerning the 
curricula of law schools, in 64.5 per cent of participating States, courses on human rights 
and fundamental freedoms were mandatory; however, in only 42.1 per cent of those States 
were courses on international human rights law actually compulsory. Issues of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms are studied in courses on, inter alia, international and 
constitutional law, political sciences, social sciences and civic education. 
</p>
<p>  
 6 A/HRC/14/26, paras. 21-22.  </p>


<p>53. For all legal professions, initial training is usually provided by law faculties, judicial 
academies, universities and bar associations. Judges and prosecutors usually undergo the 
same legal education and are specialized after its completion, or after admission to a 
particular judicial or prosecutorial school or academy. There is usually a joint programme 
for both judges and prosecutors. Lawyers, however, do not have to undergo specific post-
law school training as a requirement of the legal system. They are required to spend a 
period of time in a professional internship. The focus of advanced education of lawyers is 
left to them. Their ongoing training is done on a voluntary basis, for which reason they are 
not required to attend training programmes on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p>54. By way of example, in Tunisia, judges and prosecutors attend continuing training 
sessions twice a year; training is compulsory for judges having served for less than six 
years. In Australia, training is usually tailored to specific specializations, such as family 
law. In Austria, seminars are open for certain targeted groups.  
</p>
<p>55. The table below reflects the important role that judicial schools have played in the 
capacity-building and training of judges and magistrates, prosecutors and public defenders, 
and that of bar Associations in the training of lawyers.

<p>GLOBAL THEMATIC STUDY
</p>
<p>HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION AND CONTINUING TRAINING OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALS  
</p>
<p>Participating countries &#8211; institutions providing training to judges, prosecutors, lawyers and 
</p>
<p><b>public defenders
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>56. As shown in the table, public defenders have the lowest number of institutions 
responsible for their training. This fact highlights the need for investments in the creation of 
legal schools or institutions and for greater promotion of capacity-building courses. The 
Special Rapporteur emphasizes her concern that, as a result, access to justice may be 
jeopardized. 
</p>
<p>57. Universities and Law Schools also play a vital role in international human rights law 
training and capacity-building for lawyers and public defenders, to a far greater extent than 
in the case of capacity-building for judges and prosecutors. With regard to magistrates, 
judges and prosecutors, universities are responsible for specialization courses and post-
graduate degrees. Judicial academies usually offer specialized training for judges and 
magistrates designed for and tailored to the needs of their functions.  
</p>
<p>58. In this context, the Special Rapporteur highlights the important role played by non-
governmental organizations in capacity-building programmes in several States, particularly </p>


<p>where financial budgetary resources and qualified professionals to provide legal training are 
few. Some good examples were given in the response submitted by Afghanistan, where the 
majority of the legal training offered is organized with the help of international non-
governmental organizations in cooperation with the Government. In Angola, the 
International Bar Association&#8217;s Human Rights Institute organized training courses for 
judges, magistrates, prosecutors and lawyers in Luanda. The project was conducted over a 
period of two weeks (one week of training for each group) and was organized in 
conjunction with the Ministry of Justice and the Secretariat for Human Rights of Angola. 
The training programme comprised a general introduction to international and regional 
human rights law for judges, magistrates, prosecutors and lawyers, with a focus on human 
rights in the administration of justice, including fair trial standards and standards related to 
detention. 
</p>
<p>59. It is also interesting to observe that, in some cases, national or high councils of the 
judiciary provide specific training for magistrates, judges and prosecutors. Given that, as a 
rule, national councils of the judiciary have a prerogative to monitor the activities (or 
exercise the control) of magistrates, judges and prosecutors, as well as conduct disciplinary 
proceedings against them, the Special Rapporteur believes that, in the event of judicial 
error, the first measure to be taken by a national councils should be to identify training 
shortfalls in these professionals and take the measures to address them.  
</p>
<p>60. Ongoing capacity-building is also available for judges (86.7 per cent) and 
prosecutors (84 per cent). Training programmes are usually offered on a non-regular basis 
for judges, in 58.8 per cent of States surveyed; and for prosecutors, in 65.9 per cent, with an 
annual average ranging from 20 to 60 hours of training. Seminars are the most frequent 
form of training (91.1 per cent). 
</p>
<p>61. The five themes most frequently included in initial and ongoing training for judges, 
magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers and public defenders are reflected in the tables below. 
</p>
<p>62. For judges, the &#8220;independence and impartiality of judges, prosecutors and lawyers&#8221;, 
&#8220;overall training programme&#8221;, &#8220;the right to a fair trial&#8221;, &#8220;judicial ethics&#8221; and &#8220;children&#8217;s 
rights and juvenile justice&#8221; are the five main themes most frequently included in initial 
</p>
<p>training. With regard to ongoing learning, the main topics are &#8220;judicial ethics&#8221;, &#8220;overall 
training programme&#8221;, &#8220;overall human rights component (including fundamental rights 
recognized by the Constitution)&#8221;, &#8220;independence and impartiality of judges, prosecutors

<p>HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION AND CONTINUING TRAINING OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALS 
</p>
<p><b>Participating countries - five main themes included in training programmes for PUBLIC DEFENDERS
</b></p>
<p><b>Initial Training
</b></p>
<p><b>Continuous Training </b> 
66. At the domestic level, ratification of international and regional human rights treaties 
appears to have a positive impact on the development of capacity-building programmes for 
judicial system actors, since the highest percentages for capacity-building are related to the 
main themes addressed by international treaties. </p>


<p>67. In participating States and entities, initial training for judges, prosecutors and public 
defenders is, as a rule, compulsory (85 per cent), while ongoing learning is voluntary (35 
per cent). For lawyers, on the other hand, ongoing capacity-building accounts for 55 per 
cent of learning activities, and initial training for 28 per cent. They are not imposed by 
express instructions, but by the requirements of their professional practice. 
</p>
<p>68. The above-mentioned tables show the need to improve ongoing capacity-building in 
international human rights law for judges, magistrates, prosecutors and public defenders, as 
well as that to encourage or provide resources for such training. The development of 
mechanisms that recognize and take full advantage of ongoing capacity-building for the 
careers of judges, prosecutors and public defender is also necessary. 
</p>
<p>69. The main challenges encountered while providing human rights education and 
training seem to be directly linked to financial resources.7 Some States have to face high 
levels of poverty, illiteracy and corruption, while others lack experts in international human 
rights law.   
</p>
<p>70. Only a quarter of the participating States and entities monitor the effectiveness of 
capacity-building programmes and, when they do, monitoring is done by institutions that 
offer the programmes as a means of obtaining feedback on specific courses.  
</p>
<p>71. Most States do not have mechanisms that measure the effectiveness of training 
courses. The Czech Republic only has a mechanism to monitor satisfaction with the 
selection of topics offered in courses. Canada has no specific mechanism to evaluate the 
conduct of actors after training, but has audit departments, such as the Law Society of 
Upper Canada in Ontario, which are responsible reviewing the effectiveness of ongoing 
human rights education programmes. 
</p>
<p>72. It was observed, however, that there are few systems that monitor the effectiveness 
of the contents of capacity-building programmes, such as judicial decisions, legal opinions, 
judicial requests and defence. Colombia has a programme that monitors the effectiveness of 
training courses provided by judicial schools, comprising external and internal assessment 
of the application of course contents. Monitoring judicial management in a given 
jurisdiction after a training course allows them to determine the degree of application of the 
content taught. In Colombia, the programme is regarded as a modern, flexible and objective 
way of evaluating the effectiveness of courses and tutors thereof, and of providing 
information on the quality of the programmes offered in education plans. In the Sudan, the 
effectiveness of training for judges and prosecutors is monitored by means of examinations 
and performance evaluations. 
</p>
<p>73. With regard to mechanisms monitoring the effectiveness of training, Peru, for 
instance, explained that public defenders working on criminal procedures are constantly 
monitored through follow-up of the judicial files and cases they have handled. 
</p>
<p>74. The fact that 55 per cent of participating States chose not to answer the question 
about the existence of a mechanism to monitor impunity may be interpreted as indicating 
that there is no such mechanism or that the institutions that replied to the questionnaire may 
not have had access to such information.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Gender integration 
</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur also inquired about the integration of a gender perspective 
into human rights capacity-building of actors in the justice system. Some States interpreted 
</p>
<p>  
 7 In, inter alia, Bhutan, Canada and the Sudan.  </p>


<p>the question as being limited to an inquiry about gender balance in the capacity-building of 
judges. The intention was to learn about gender balance and to understand how the content 
of capacity-building courses integrated a gender perspective. It was, however, possible to 
identify some examples, whether the question was interpreted as limited or more broadly. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Gender balance 
</b></p>
<p>76. In Austria, special attention is paid to gender balance in the judiciary; furthermore, 
seminars and special support for women magistrates after maternal leave are provided. In 
Nigeria, the participation of women in the judiciary is mandatory. Courses on women&#8217;s 
human rights and courses on international and regional women rights conventions are 
offered. In the Philippines, gender sensitivity is mainstreamed through the gender 
sensitivity committee of the Supreme Court. In France, gender is considered throughout the 
entire education process; indeed, it was reported that, in France, there are more women 
magistrates than men. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Gender sensitivity training for judges and lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>77. The flagship publication in 2011 of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality 
and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) entitled &#8220;Progress of the World&#8217;s Women: 
In Pursuit of Justice&#8221;, underscored that while there had been a transformation in women&#8217;s 
legal rights, laws that exist on paper did not always translate into equality and justice for 
most of the world&#8217;s women. In the report, 10 recommendations were made to make justice 
systems work for women, including a recommendation to train judges and monitor their 
decisions. It was concluded that balanced, well-informed and unbiased judicial decision-
making was &#8220;an essential part of ensuring that women who go to court get justice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>78. In 2012, UN-Women conducted a mapping exercise on specialized training for 
judges and lawyers on women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality issues, in order to 
identify the extent and types of training programmes. Interviews were carried out with staff 
members, and a range of documents was reviewed. The mapping illustrated the types of 
initiatives that have been supported and evaluated by United Nations bodies since 2007, 
and the recommendations emerging from evaluation reports and assessments. The 
information below is based on the mapping results. 
</p>
<p>79. Training initiatives for judges, prosecutors and lawyers on women&#8217;s human rights 
and gender equality issues are carried out and supported by a number of United Nations 
bodies, including OHCHR, UN-Women, the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence 
against Women, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the 
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the United Nations Interregional 
Crime and Justice Research Institute and the Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Many of these initiatives are carried out jointly by various United 
Nations agencies; however, not all training programmes are evaluated systematically. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends that assessments be carried out in order to determine the 
effectiveness of capacity-building programmes and that they be adjusted if necessary. 
</p>
<p>80. UN-Women has supported various capacity-building projects for judges, 
magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers, paralegals and other legal actors in the formal and 
informal justice sectors in many States in Africa, Asia, Central and South-eastern Europe, 
Latin America and the Caribbean. Its training initiatives have focused in particular on 
sexual and gender-based violence, including when committed during armed conflicts. They 
have also covered other areas, such as gender equality in the workplace, women&#8217;s rights 
within the family and women&#8217;s access to justice, including through transitional justice 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. The content has included the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and other international human rights treaties, international </p>


<p>criminal law and relevant national laws, such as laws on gender equality and violence 
against women. 
</p>
<p>81. The United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence against Women has supported a 
number of grantees, including the International Association of Women Judges and national 
associations of judges, which have implemented training programmes for judges, 
prosecutors, lawyers and other legal professionals in numerous States, including post-
conflict States. Training has focused on international human rights standards in relation to 
violence against women, access to justice for female survivors of gender-based violence, 
domestic and sexual violence, and relevant national laws. 
</p>
<p>82. United Nations peacekeeping missions, including the United Nations Organization 
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations 
Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the United Nations Mission in the Central African republic and 
Chad, the United Nations Mission in Liberia, the United Nations Stabilization Mission in 
Haiti and the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, have provided human 
rights training to members of the judiciary, magistrates, prosecutors and lawyers on gender 
equality, sexual and gender-based violence, and criminal investigations. UNDP has 
dedicated resources to capacity-building for judicial and other legal professionals in many 
States in the context of democratic governance, rule of law, access to justice and other 
programmes. Training has focused on, inter alia, women&#8217;s human rights, including in the 
context of HIV and AIDS, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, gender equality issues, and sexual and gender-based 
violence. UNFPA has supported capacity-building initiatives for members of the judiciary, 
prosecutors and lawyers in a number of States, including in Latin America, Asia and North 
Africa, with a focus on gender-based violence, including domestic violence, sexual and 
reproductive rights, and gender-biased sex selection and implementation of national 
legislation. 
</p>
<p>83. OHCHR, through its headquarters, regional, subregional and country offices, as well 
at its Headquarters, has supported and implemented international human rights law 
capacity-building programmes for judges, magistrates and prosecutors, with a specific 
focus on women&#8217;s rights. Training has cover gender-based violence, including femicide, 
sexual violence in conflict and non-conflict settings, and women and the administration of 
justice. UNODC has implemented a global training programme aimed at building the 
capacity of criminal justice practitioners, including judicial officers and prosecutors, to 
ensure effective responses to trafficking in persons. The United Nations Interregional 
Crime and Justice Research Institute designs and implements specialized training courses 
for judicial personnel upon the request of Member States, including on human rights and 
trafficking in persons for the purposes of sexual and economic exploitation. UNAIDS has 
launched an initiative to provide support for judicial leadership on HIV-related legal and 
human rights issues. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Good practices for training in gender issues 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur highlights the practices described below as good training 
examples. 
</p>
<p>85. Frequent and regular engagement with the target group is important in order to better 
understand their day-to-day reality and respond effectively and adequately to their needs. 
Holding gender sensitivity discussions with the targeted group prior to developing a 
training programme helps to ensure that the audience will be receptive to the issues </p>


<p>covered.8 United Nations entities have, in many instances, developed the content of training 
programmes in collaboration with recipients, such as in the case of Albania.9 The needs of 
different groups of women should also be taken into account in developing training 
initiatives. Some United Nations entities have focused their initiatives on particular groups 
of women, for example, certain programmes have focused on the needs and situation of 
rural and indigenous women in Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Ecuador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Panama and Peru,. With regard to persons living with or affected by HIV, 
UNAIDS has emphasized that training members of the judiciary on HIV and human rights 
is critical, noting that protective judicial application of the law is essential in that it protects 
people living with or vulnerable to HIV against violations of their rights, addresses fears, 
misconceptions and prejudices against people living with and vulnerable to HIV, generates 
a sense of dignity and justice among people living with or vulnerable to HIV, and supports 
access to prevention, treatment, care and support services for all. 
</p>
<p>86. Partnerships with international and national organizations, such as national judicial 
institutions and civil society organizations, have a key importance. Partnering with judicial 
institutions helps to establish contact with judges who may be resistant to or not usually 
engaged in women&#8217;s rights and gender equality issues. In India, for example, active support 
</p>
<p>was provided by the State Judicial Academy in the development of a training methodology 
on access to justice for judges and lawyers; the active participation of civil society 
representatives brought &#8220;real life&#8221; experience into the judicial training programme.10 In 
Zambia, the Zambia Association of Women Judges was a key partner, as was the Ministry 
of Justice in Morocco. In Jamaica, there was a partnership involving the Jamaica Bureau of 
Women&#8217;s Affairs to support the development and implementation of capacity-building in 
procedures to respond to sexual assault and approaches for prosecutors and the police. 
Successful training programmes have also been conducted in partnership with higher 
learning institutions; for instance, training programmes for lawyers on women&#8217;s human 
rights and mainstreaming gender into the transitional justice process are carried out in 
partnership with the Human Rights Centre at the University of Chile and the External 
University of Colombia in Bogot&#225;. 
</p>
<p>87. Training initiatives should be institutionalized and set out within a standardized 
curriculum in order to ensure sustainability of results and delivery of justice for women.11 A 
number of initiatives have institutionalized training programmes, which include, for 
instance, educational modules on women&#8217;s socio-economic rights, gender-based 
discrimination and gender equality in the workplace as an integral part of mandatory 
judicial academy curriculum in Serbia; the integration of issues surrounding gender-biased 
sex selection and the relevant national legislation into the induction and refresher 
programmes of the Maharasthra State Judicial Academy in India; the inclusion of the issue 
of domestic violence in the training curriculum of the Academy for Judges and Public 
Prosecutors in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; or the development of a

<p>protocol on the prevention, protection and promotion of women victims of sexual violence 
in armed conflict in Colombia, which was made obligatory in all Government institutions 
and will be used for training legal personnel, including prosecutors. All law students should 
be required to take courses on gender equality and women&#8217;s rights, and continuing judicial 
education on these issues should be mandatory for judges at all levels.  
</p>
<p>88. A holistic approach aimed at supporting capacity-building for judges, prosecutors, 
police and other players within the justice system should be adopted. Such an approach 
would help to ensure broad dissemination of good practices and effective responses to 
gender-based discrimination, including violence against women. For example, in Venezuela 
(Bolivarian Republic of), various public officials, including in the justice system, have 
received training on substantive and procedural aspects of violence against women and its 
consequences. 
</p>
<p>89. It was observed that judges are more open to being trained by their peers, seen as an 
effective strategy for developing a constructive dialogue. Training strategies should ensure 
the training is focused on skill-building and sensitization, and trainers should have both 
theoretical and practical experience as judges. Peer-to-peer-based approaches, case studies, 
problem-solving exercises and other adult learning techniques have proven successful, 
including opportunities for judges to deepen their understanding of international law as 
applied to domestic contexts and to provide a forum for judges to discuss legal means to 
address vulnerabilities. Focus should be centred on the practical aspects of the 
implementation of the law and less on theoretical discussions of gender equality and human 
rights. In Albania, for example, a training programme was based on the concluding 
observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on its 
report.12 In Serbia, a pool of experts was created consisting of judges and gender advocates 
from academia and Government institutions who are responsible for training judges on the 
basis of modules. The importance of documenting and disseminating success stories 
demonstrating how women have used the law and engaged the justice system was also 
highlighted. Delivering messages addressing potential biases and prejudices that members 
of the judiciary may have, using experts in professional fields, such as doctors, medical 
professionals and lawyers to counter any bias with data and scientific &#8220;fact&#8221;, has also been 
successful. The Special Rapporteur recommends that case studies be used to deliver key 
messages during training, and that legal manuals and handbooks be elaborated with and 
endorsed by judges.  
</p>
<p>90. It is important that training be provided for members of the judiciary at all levels, 
including provincial and district levels. In India, for instance, training programmes on 
gender-biased sex selection and implementation of national legislation were carried out at 
the district level. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, regional capacity-
building on implementing the domestic violence legislation involved civil and criminal 
judges and prosecutors from all appellate divisions. 
</p>
<p>91. Follow-up meetings or consultations to assess implementation and progress should 
be convened. Similarly, developing feedback loops between members of the judiciary and 
other law enforcement personnel for information and knowledge sharing is important; in 
Zambia, for example, mechanisms of this type focusing on the kind of evidence required 
for conviction in cases of gender-based violence and the measures required for the 
protection of child witnesses in cases of sexual assault were developed. It was noticed that 
arrangements for feedback and the exchange of information often determine the outcome of 
cases of gender-based violence. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a national

<p>Gender Equality in Albania (see footnote 9).  </p>


<p>conference was organized at which trained judges and prosecutors exchanged their 
experiences and standardized judicial practices for dealing with individual cases of 
domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>92. In addition to formal justice systems, customary and religious institutions, which 
make many decisions regarding women&#8217;s rights, local mediators should be involved. In 
Aceh, Indonesia, an exercise highlighting the synergies and points of convergence between 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and 
principles of Islam and customary law proved useful.13 
</p>
<p>93. As good practices, the Special Rapporteur highlights: 
</p>
<p>(a) The Jurisprudence of Equality Programme of the International Association of 
Women Judges, which provides judges and other legal professionals with capacity-building 
on the application of international and regional human rights conventions to cases of 
discrimination against women in domestic courts.14 
</p>
<p>(b) Sakshi, a non-governmental organization based in India that uses innovative 
ways to inform judges on the realities and biases women face in courts adjudicating gender-
based violence cases. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur demonstrates the need to revise 
some aspects of the approach to ongoing human rights capacity-building for the actors 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the justice system, namely, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, public defenders and 
</b></p>
<p><b>lawyers. It is necessary to avoid the biased or flawed premise that these judicial actors 
</b></p>
<p><b>have already obtained the necessary knowledge that will enable them to perform their 
</b></p>
<p><b>duties in an impartial manner. At times, this premise obstructed the understanding of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the need for ongoing human rights education and professional development. In the 
</b></p>
<p><b>light of the changes in legal systems and provisions, and evolving social dynamics, 
</b></p>
<p><b>such education and professional development has proven essential. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Capacity-building is an important instrument to counter prejudice against 
human rights and to strengthen knowledge and adequate application at the domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>level of regional and international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>A key finding in the replies received to the survey conducted by the Special 
Rapporteur was that judges and prosecutors often receive more training possibilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>at the beginning of their careers, and fewer in the form of ongoing training while 
</b></p>
<p><b>discharging their functions.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>In order for judges and magistrates to improve the quality of justice delivered, 
any specialized training courses already taken by them should be taken into 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration as a criterion for their promotion or transfer to higher or different 
</b></p>
<p><b>courts. Ongoing training should be implemented as an institutional measure. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The data collected allowed the Special Rapporteur to conclude that judicial 
academies play an important role in the capacity-building of judges, magistrates,

<p><b>prosecutors and public defenders, where appointed. Capacity-building courses are 
</b></p>
<p><b>usually monitored by judicial academies; evaluation is made by those who have 
</b></p>
<p><b>received the training and the feedback aids in improving training courses. Capacity-
</b></p>
<p><b>building has the aim of broadening the knowledge of these actors while they discharge 
</b></p>
<p><b>their functions in the judiciary, public prosecution or public defence offices. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Monitoring of the knowledge effectively acquired through training courses should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>improved and strengthened, and be performed by the respective institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>(judiciary, national councils, public prosecutors office and public defenders offices). 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The replies to the questionnaire revealed the need for further assessment and 
dialogue between judicial academies and the institutions mentioned (judiciary, public 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors offices, public defenders offices, national councils, universities and bar 
</b></p>
<p><b>associations) so as to allow compliance of decisions on international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>training with the different professional needs. The knowledge acquired during 
</b></p>
<p><b>training must fill existing knowledge gaps. This discussion should be encouraged 
</b></p>
<p><b>among the institutions in order to obtain not only effective international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>law training, but also effective monitoring of the training carried out, mainly in cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>in which there is a plurality of interlocutors. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>It is also important to coordinate the efforts of the sectors of the State that 
work on international human rights law capacity-building for actors of the judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>system, such as judicial academies, the judiciary, the Ministry of Justice, professional 
</b></p>
<p><b>associations and non-governmental organizations, with a view to develop training and 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building programmes that will make for the proper and effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>administration of justice. For this purpose, there is an urgent need to establish better 
</b></p>
<p><b>communication links between these institutions, to identify the areas in the judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>system in need of capacity-building, and to develop adequate capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes that will provide for those needs. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that it is of utmost importance that mechanisms 
capable of measuring the results or effectiveness of international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building programmes be developed. A judge specialized in family law should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be able to discharge her or his functions in a court that corresponds to her or his 
</b></p>
<p><b>competence. In addition, monitoring the use of knowledge acquired in examining 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic judicial decisions, resolutions, legal opinions or petitions is also a good tool to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that this knowledge is employed to the benefit of those who seek justice and 
</b></p>
<p><b>resort to the justice system. The offer of capacity-building programmes implies a cost 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the State, a cost that increases when knowledge is not used and applied in the way 
</b></p>
<p><b>it was intended. In other words, the outcomes of capacity-building courses and 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities should improve the promotion and protection of human rights at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic level. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The effectiveness of capacity-building programmes must be monitored in each 
one of these areas, both from an academic and practical perspective, so that 
</b></p>
<p><b>knowledge may be applied to the judicial and legal services provided to society.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The questionnaire also revealed that international human rights law capacity-
</b>building for lawyers should be encouraged as part of States&#8217; human rights policy in 
</p>
<p><b>order to engage their professional (bar) associations, universities and, also, judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>academies to offer such training for lawyers. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The role of non-governmental organizations is particularly important in cases 
where the State or professional institutions dispose of few financial, human or 
</b></p>
<p><b>technical resources (for instance, in cases where judicial academies are still in process 
</b></p>
<p><b>of being created or developed). It has been observed that non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations greatly contribute to the implementation of human rights capacity-</b></p>


<p><b>building projects, including by bringing professionals and institutions together, 
</b></p>
<p><b>thereby further disseminating human rights knowledge. 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> International human rights law capacity-building activities should be promoted 
and enhanced at all levels. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> States should be encouraged to continue to support the capacity-building 
activities of magistrates and judges, as well as those addressing prosecution bodies 
</b></p>
<p><b>and public prosecutors. Bar association efforts and the contribution of civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions should also be encouraged and promoted. 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b>  Efforts by the United Nations to promote the application, at the domestic level, 
of international human rights law should be strengthened, as should efforts to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote women</b>&#8217;s<b> human rights and fight all forms of discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> A needs assessment should be carried out prior to developing training 
programmes, including gathering data and information on attitudes and perceptions 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the judiciary and a review of the international human rights treaties to which the 
</b></p>
<p><b>State is a party. 
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> The content of training courses should be developed in collaboration with their 
recipients. 
</b></p>
<p>110.<b> The needs of different judicial actors </b>&#8211;<b> judges, magistrates, prosecutors, public 
legal defenders and lawyers </b>&#8211;<b> should be taken into account when developing training 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>111.<b>  Given that coordination and collaboration among international, regional and 
national judicial institutions and civil society organizations is essential, such 
</b></p>
<p><b>collaboration among higher learning institution, such as universities or specialized 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutes and centres, should be clearly defined and established. 
</b></p>
<p>112.<b> Magistrates, judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers should be 
requested to take courses on international human rights law. Ongoing legal education 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be mandatory for judges, magistrates, prosecutors, public legal defenders and 
</b></p>
<p><b>lawyers at all levels. Law and political and social sciences students could also be 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to follow such courses during their education. 
</b></p>
<p>113.<b> A comprehensive approach aimed at supporting international human rights 
law capacity-building for judges, magistrates, prosecutors, public legal defenders and 
</b></p>
<p><b>lawyers should be adopted.  
</b></p>
<p>114.<b> Trainers and professors should have proven academic experience or practical 
experience in the field of human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>115.<b> Case studies, problem-solving exercises and other adult learning techniques 
have proven successful, offering opportunities for judges to deepen their 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding of international human rights law as applied to domestic contexts. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Focus should therefore be put on the implementation of international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>law in practice and less on theoretical discussions.  
</b></p>
