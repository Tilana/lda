<p><b>  25/&#8230;  Human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> at the suffering of the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian 
Golan due to the systematic and continuous violation of their fundamental and human rights 
by Israel since the Israeli military occupation of 1967, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 
 <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> all relevant General Assembly resolutions, the most recent being 
resolution 68/84 of 11 December 2013, in which the Assembly declared that Israel had 
failed to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel 
withdraw from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> <i>once more</i> the illegality of the decision by Israel of 14 December 1981 
to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has 
resulted in the effective annexation of that territory, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by 
force, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of 
international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with deep concern</i> of the report of the Special Committee to Investigate 
Israeli Practices Affecting the Human of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 
Occupied Territories1 and, in this connection, deploring the Israeli settlements in the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>occupied Arab territories and expressing regret at the constant refusal of Israel to cooperate 
with and to receive the Special Committee, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the relevant provisions of the Charter, international law and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirming the applicability of the Geneva Convention 
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 and the 
relevant provisions of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 to the occupied Syrian 
Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of the peace process, which started in Madrid on the 
basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November and 338 (1973) of 
October 1973, and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its concern at the halting 
of the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed on the 
basis of the full implementation of resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) for the 
establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region, 
 <i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human 
Rights and of the Human Rights Council, the most recent being Council resolution 22/17 of 
21 March 2013, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 
resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, 
in particular Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council decided, inter 
alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the 
occupied Syrian Golan was null and void and without international legal effect, and 
demanded that Israel rescind forthwith its decision; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to desist from its continuous building of settlements, 
the most recent of which is the settlement campaign being conducted by the so-called 
Golan Regional Council under the slogan &#8220;Come to the Golan&#8221;, and to desist from 
changing the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure and legal 
status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and emphasizes that the displaced persons of the 
population of the occupied Syrian Golan must be allowed to return to their homes and to 
recover their property; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and 
Israeli identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and to desist from 
its repressive measures against them and from all other practices that obstruct the 
enjoyment of their fundamental rights and their civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights, some of which are mentioned in the report of the Special Committee to 
Investigate Israeli Practices affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other 
Arabs of the Occupied Territories;1 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to allow the Syrian population of occupied Syrian Golan to 
visit their families and relatives in the Syrian motherland through the Quneitra checkpoint 
and under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and to rescind 
its decision to prohibit these visits, as it is in flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to release immediately the Syrian detainees in Israeli 
prisons, some of whom have been detained for more than 27 years, and to treat them in 
conformity with international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel, in this connection, to allow delegates of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Syrian prisoners of conscience and 
detainees in Israeli prisons accompanied by specialized physicians to assess the state of 
their physical and mental health and to protect their lives; </p>


<p> 7. <i>Determines</i> that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken 
or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, including the Knesset&#8217;s decision of 22 
November 2010 to hold a referendum before any withdrawal from the occupied Syrian 
Golan and East Jerusalem, that seek to alter the character and legal status of the occupied 
Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of 
the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 
August 1949, and have no legal effect; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Again calls upon</i> States Members of the United Nations not to recognize any 
of the above-mentioned legislative or administrative measures; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention 
of all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, 
international and regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian 
organizations to disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on this matter to the 
Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides</i> to continue the consideration of the human rights violations in the 
occupied Syrian Golan at its twenty-eighth session.
