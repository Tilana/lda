<p><b>  28</b>/&#8230;<b>Human rights, democracy and the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Vienna Declaration 
</p>
<p>and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other relevant 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Millennium Declaration and all General Assembly resolutions on 
</p>
<p>democracy and the rule of law, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 19/36 of 23 March 2012 on human 
</p>
<p>rights, democracy and the rule of law, and relevant resolutions of the Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the study of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights of 20121 and the outcome of the panel discussion,<footnote name="2">See A/HRC/24/54.  </footnote> held on 11 June 2013 during the 
</p>
<p>twenty-third session of the Human Rights Council, both on the theme of common 
</p>

<p>challenges facing States in their efforts to secure democracy and the rule of law from a 
</p>
<p>human rights perspective, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of people to 
</p>
<p>determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full 
</p>
<p>participation in all aspects of their lives, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that, while democracies share common features, there is no single 
</p>
<p>model of democracy and that democracy does not belong to any country or region, and 
</p>
<p>reaffirming further the necessity of due respect for sovereignty and the right to self-
</p>
<p>determination, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that challenges to democracy arise in all democratic societies, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the fundamental importance of education and training for human 
</p>
<p>rights and democracy in contributing to the promotion, protection and effective realization 
</p>
<p>of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> that, while States have the primary responsibility for safeguarding and 
</p>
<p>strengthening democracy and the rule of law, the United Nations has a critical role in 
</p>
<p>providing assistance and coordinating international efforts to support States, on their 
</p>
<p>request, in their democratization processes, 
</p>
<p><i>Urging</i> States to acknowledge the important contribution of civil society and human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders to the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to 
</p>
<p>create a safe and enabling environment for their work, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the value of a Human Rights Council forum for exchange, dialogue, 
</p>
<p>mutual understanding and cooperation on issues related to human rights, democracy and the 
</p>
<p>rule of law, in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter, and 
</p>
<p>acknowledging the importance of existing regional formats, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that human rights, democracy and the rule of law are interdependent and 
</p>
<p>mutually reinforcing, and in this regard taking note with interest of the report of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on strengthening and coordinating United Nations rule of law activities,<footnote name="3">A/68/213/Add.1. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>in which the Secretary-General addressed the ways and means of developing further the
