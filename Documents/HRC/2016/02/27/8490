<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its tenth 
session from 24 January to 4 February 2011.  The review of Georgia was held at the 9th 
meeting on 28 January 2011. The delegation of Georgia was headed by Sergi Kapanadze, 
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. At its 13th meeting held on 1 February 2011, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Georgia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Georgia: Cameroon, Mexico and Ukraine.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Georgia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with

</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c)

</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Germany, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Russian Federation, Slovenia, 
Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was

the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Sergi Kapanadze, Deputy Foreign Minister, introduced the national report of 
Georgia developed through inclusive inter-agency process and participation of the civil 
society.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that the Georgian Constitution safeguarded human rights and 
freedoms. The Constitutional amendments adopted in 2010 reinforced the balance of power 
among the various branches and strengthened the independence of the judiciary, inter alia, 
by introducing the lifetime appointment of judges. 
</p>
<p>7. The Constitutional Court of Georgia assessed the compatibility of legislation with 
human rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p>8. The Office of the Ombudsman established in 1996 received status &#8220;A&#8221; in 2007. In 
2008, the Ombudsman was designated as the national preventive mechanism under the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In June 2010, the mechanism published its first 
report. 
</p>
<p>9. The Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights and Civil Integration enacted 
human rights acts and monitored their observance. At the executive level, human rights 
were dealt by various inter-agency councils and human rights monitoring units. </p>


<p>10. Reforms in the judiciary increased the number of professional judges, modernized 
the judicial framework and improved accessibility of the system. Public trust in the court 
system has improved, demonstrated by recent surveys which showed that 71 per cent of 
total users of a court system were satisfied with the court service. 
</p>
<p>11. Criminal justice reforms in Georgia were led by the Criminal Justice Reform 
Council.  
</p>
<p>12. In 2009, the Criminal Procedure Code and the Code of Imprisonment were adopted. 
The Criminal Procedure Code transformed existing procedural system based on the 
principles of adversarial proceedings, equality of arms and jury trials. Particular attention 
was paid to improving the access to fair and effective justice. The Code of Imprisonment 
safeguarded detainees&#8217; rights and improved conditions in the penitentiary.  
</p>
<p>13. Georgia had a strategic approach towards prison overcrowding by promoting 
discretionary prosecution, diversion, alternative sanctions and increased use of probation.  
</p>
<p>14. The delegation reaffirmed its respect for the principle of the freedom of association 
and assembly.  Recent amendments to the Law on Assembly and Manifestation, welcomed 
by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) as 
&#8220;significant improvement&#8221;, further adapted the Georgian legislation to international 
standards.  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation stated that the law enforcement agencies were undergoing extensive 
training in crowd management.  
</p>
<p>16. Georgia adopted the Law on Broadcasting, which transformed the State Television 
and Radio Company into a Georgian public broadcaster and guaranteed editorial, 
managerial and financial independence.  
</p>
<p>17. A new political television channel modeled after the channel C-SPAN/BBC 
Parliament was launched in 2010, providing live and unedited coverage of all political 
events. 
</p>
<p>18. Defamation was decriminalized in 2004. The Criminal Procedure Code guaranteed a 
higher standard of protection for media institutions during the investigative proceedings.  
</p>
<p>19. In 2010, a tax amnesty was introduced for television outlets including regional 
broadcasters.  
</p>
<p>20. Georgia acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1994. In 2004, the 
Child welfare reform was launched. The Child Welfare Action Plan 2008&#8211;2011 covered 
children with disabilities and minority and internally displaced children and emphasized the 
fight against poverty and violence among children. Georgia was reforming the childcare 
institution system. 
</p>
<p>21. The delegation noted that as a result of two waves of ethnic cleansing, in 1991&#8211;1993 
and in 2008 in Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, Georgia, close 
to half a million people were displaced, most of them within Georgia. Georgia elaborated 
the State Strategy and Action Plan on internally displaced persons (IDPs) with the 
participation of civil society, IDPs themselves and international organizations.  
</p>
<p>22. By 2010, up to 17,000 IDP families living in collective centres have received 
rehabilitated apartments under private ownership. About 8,000 IDP families displaced as a 
result of the 2008 Georgia-Russia war received an individual house or apartment, or 
targeted financial assistance. Over 5,000 IDP families received allotments and agricultural 
land plots. 
</p>
<p>23. The Constitution safeguarded the principle of non-discrimination. The National 
Concept and Action Plan for Tolerance and Civil Integration, both adopted in 2009, </p>


<p>safeguarded minority rights. The national curriculum was updated and textbooks were 
improved to promote tolerance. Steps were undertaken to teach Georgian language to 
national minorities. The public broadcaster aired news programmes in minority languages.  
</p>
<p>24. Positive quotas were established for educational institutions, which accepted 
students on the basis of examination in general aptitudes, conducted in Azeri, Armenian, 
Ossetian and Abkhazian languages.  
</p>
<p>25. Georgia acknowledged positive obligations under international law to protect human 
rights throughout its territory including in Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Tskhinvali 
region/South Ossetia, Georgia.  However it was unable to do so due to the occupation of 
these regions by a third country. The delegation stressed that no effective mechanisms 
existed for ensuring protection of human rights in these regions.1 
</p>
<p>26. The delegation noted that the human rights situation in these regions of Georgia was 
of concern to the international community. Various United Nations documents stressed the 
necessity of human rights protection in these regions and safe and dignified return of IDPs 
and refugees. 
</p>
<p>27. The delegation noted systematic unlawful restrictions discriminately exercised 
against ethnic Georgians in the occupied regions. Human rights violations included 
ethnically targeted violence, looting, violation of security and religious rights, hindering of 
freedom of movement and residence, destruction of property and forced passportization. 
These acts were aimed at preventing the safe and dignified return of ethnic Georgians.  
</p>
<p>28. The delegation recalled recent cases of property rights violations in the occupied 
regions.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Russian Federation made the following point of order: the Republic of Abkhazia and the 
</p>
<p>Republic of South Ossetia are independent States. Therefore the human rights situation in these two 
countries cannot be subject to discussion within the UPR of Georgia. The allegations of Georgia 
about the occupation of the mentioned territories are absurd. Russia does not exercise authority in the 
said countries and does not control their governing bodies, which have been formed by democratic 
means. In this regard we request you to call on the delegation of Georgia not to politicize the 
situation, but to do what it is supposed to do &#8211; consider the human rights violations in Georgia. We 
request to fully reflect this statement in the report of our session. 
</p>
<p>  In response, Georgia made a point of order objecting to the point of order raised by the delegation of 
Russian Federation. The Georgian Delegation stressed that it wanted to focus discussions strictly on 
the human rights and that it was unfortunate that Russia was trying to politicize the process. It was no 
secret that Russia challenged Georgia&#8217;s territorial integrity, even though Georgia&#8217;s territorial integrity 
and sovereignty was recognized by the international community which was adequately reflected in 
the United Nations documents, including all Security Council resolutions adopted on the situation in 
Georgia since 1993 and all United Nations General Assembly resolutions adopted since 2008. 
Georgia called on Russia to respect the very essence of the Human Rights Council and concentrate on 
issues related to human rights.  The Georgian side was ready to engage in a constructive discussion 
and reflect on all issues related to the human rights record in its country. 
</p>
<p>  Subsequently, the President recalled all delegations that, as per rule 113 of the rules of procedure, a 
point of order should focus on procedural matters. Debating of territorial issues was a substantive 
exercise. Moreover, those issues were more appropriately dealt with in other forums. The Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review was not the competent body to discuss issues of a political 
or territorial nature. Consequently, he invited all delegations to focus on human rights issues, in the 
context of their statements. In that regard, he also reiterated that all States were entitled to their views. 
He asked that those be voiced in a respectful manner. He also appealed to all concerned to refrain 
from using the review to deal with bilateral issues as that ultimately undermined the principles of 
universality and goals of this mechanism. </p>


<p>29. Finally, the Head of the delegation called for a result-oriented constructive dialogue 
on human rights, avoiding the artificial politicization of the debate by some delegations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>30. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in chapter II of the present report. A number of 
delegations acknowledged the constructive engagement of the Georgian Government with 
the universal periodic review mechanism and commended the process of preparation of the 
national report which included the participation of the civil society and other stakeholders. 
They thanked the delegation for the detailed and informed presentation and for responses to 
advance questions. They noted with satisfaction that various achievements in the promotion 
and protection of human rights since independence notwithstanding remaining challenges.

strengthened the independence of the judiciary. It noted with appreciation that Georgia is 
party to the majority of human rights conventions and welcomed initiatives taken to 
institutionalize social dialogue. Algeria made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. The Russian Federation emphasized that human rights violations committed by 
Georgia against the population of Abkhazia and South Ossetia during and before 2008 
conflict were yet to be investigated. Focusing on systemic human rights problems in 
Georgia, it pointed at the unwillingness of Georgia to objectively evaluate them.  It 
reminded that Russia and a number of other States recognized the independence of the 
Republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and thus their human rights situation could not be 
discussed under the review of Georgia.  Accusations that Russia was occupying the 
mentioned territories were false and unacceptable.  It made recommendations.

human rights institution, which received &#8220;A&#8221; status in accordance with the principles 
relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human 
rights (Paris Principles). The Republic of Moldova made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>43. Japan asked whether Georgia was considering accession to international human 
rights instruments to which it was not a party. Japan noted concerns on the use of force by 
law enforcement officials and prison staff, torture, lack of judicial independence, corruption

</p>

gender stereotyping, intensified women&#8217;s political partaking, and equality in the labour

combating domestic violence and protecting victims. The Inter-agency Council with active 
participation of national and international organizations developed the action plan and a 
national referral mechanism on fight against domestic violence.

<p>83. The delegation noted the commitment undertaken in 1999 to return the persons 
forcefully displaced in the 1940s by the Soviet Regime. In 2007, the Law on the 
Repatriation of the Forcefully Displaced Persons was adopted; in 2008 relevant application-
related procedures were developed. The deadline for submitting the applications for 
receiving the status of repatriates was prolonged twice providing two years for submitting 
applications. More than 5,800 applications had been submitted and Georgia was now in the 
process of reviewing them, after which a four-month period would be given to correcting 
flaws. The first persons would receive the status of repatriates by the end of 2011. Measures 
were undertaken by the Government in cooperation with the international community to 
ensure their integration and raise awareness.  
</p>
<p>84. The delegation underscored that the Steering Committee &#8211; that included donors, 
NGOs and experts &#8211; had overseen the resettlement process of IDPs. More than 3,000 IDP 
families received durable housing solutions. Standard operating procedures for vacation and 
reallocation of IDPs were elaborated in cooperation with relevant stakeholders and 
international organizations. Temporary shelters were vacated in full compliance with the 
procedures. The resettled IDPs received temporary houses before the resettlement or were 
offered alternative housing. After the resettlement, IDPs received firewood, food, non-food 
items and other assistance.  
</p>
<p>85. The Government, together with international and local partners, supported socio-
economic and other livelihood activities for IDPs.  The rural population of IDPs affected by 
the 2008 war received 860 hectares of agricultural land and assistance for cultivation. 
Irrigation systems were improved. The regions with higher employment opportunities were 
identified for further resettlement of IDPs, where the process of creation of living spaces 
had started. The delegation stated that the best solution for the IDPs would be to return to 
their places of permanent residence in safety and dignity, which was, unfortunately, not 
possible at this stage. 
</p>
<p>86. In response to the alleged unequal treatment of ethnic minorities, including 
Ossetians, the delegation responded that no evidence of such practice existed. At least twice 
as many Ossetians resided on the territory of Georgia outside of the Tskhinvali 
Region/South Ossetia than within the occupied region itself. The delegation cited the 2009 
OSCE report on the situation of Ossetians in Georgia outside the former Autonomous 
District of South Ossetia, stating that &#8220;Inter-ethnic relations between Georgians and 
Ossetians &#8230; do not give reason for concern&#8221; and that &#8220;the OSCE is not aware of any recent </p>


<p>individual cases of ethnically motivated violence or discrimination, let alone a state policy 
of discrimination&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>87. The delegation noted that for the implementation of the National Concept for 
Tolerance and Civil Integration, a five-year action plan had been adopted by the Council of 
Tolerance and Civil Integration in cooperation with the Ethnic Minority Council 
functioning under the Public Defender&#8217;s Office. Several State agencies signed a 
memorandum of understanding with the Office, thus establishing an effective system of 
cooperation and consultation. 
</p>
<p>88. The delegation noted that a number of high-ranking officials were self-declared 
national minorities. The Ministry of Internal Affairs&#8217; policy was to give priority to minority 
applicants while recruiting people in the regions inhabited by national minorities. The 
Zurab Zhvania School of Public Administration provided training for national minorities 
for preparing them for employment in public sector.  
</p>
<p>89. The legislation regarding the registration of religious groups provided the possibility 
to any religious group to operate as registered and/or non-registered legal entity. 
Amendments to the Civil Code simplified registration and provided tax breaks for non-
profit organizations, including religious groups. Twenty religious organizations were 
registered in Georgia. Discussions were under way to accommodate interest of those 
traditional religious organizations that refused to register in accordance with the current 
legislation.  
</p>
<p>90. The delegation also stressed positive actions on the restitution of property to a 
number of religious organizations.   
</p>
<p>91. The delegation noted that a comprehensive reform was under way in the childcare 
institution system. The delegation underlined the importance of the State Care Agency, 
responsible for almost all childcare institutions.  
</p>
<p>92. Reform aimed at substituting a network of family group homes for large residential 
institutions for children without parental care was mentioned by the delegation. Measures 
were taken to foster reintegration of a child into biological families, promotion of adoption 
and foster-care services, including kinship and emergency foster care. Small-to-medium 
size group homes and long-term palliative care services would be developed for children 
with disability.   
</p>
<p>93. As to street children, the delegation underlined the importance of establishing a day 
centre in Tbilisi and the launching of another centre in 2011, in line with the Child Welfare 
Action Plan. 
</p>
<p>94. Serbia noted the strengthened legislative and operational efforts of Georgia. It 
requested more information on practical steps planned or under way to increase the 
participation of ethnic minorities in civil, political and economic life, and the practical steps 
emerging from the recently adopted Gender Equality Law. Serbia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>95. Latvia noted that Georgia had made efforts in a number of fields by enhancing legal 
reforms and enforcing human rights legislation.  Latvia also welcomed the fact that Georgia 
had extended a standing invitation to the special procedures in March 2010. Latvia made a 
recommendation.  
</p>
<p>96. Sweden observed that reports indicated that prison conditions remain poor, in certain 
cases amounting to inhuman treatment. It also noted that, in 2010, the forced eviction of 
some 5,000 persons had been carried out without adequate consultation or the provision of 
appropriate housing alternatives. Sweden made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>97. Australia noted efforts to improve the situation in a number of areas such as criminal 
justice, gender equality and children&#8217;s rights. It voiced concerns about prison conditions </p>


<p>and reports of low public trust in the judiciary. Australia supported the territorial integrity 
of Georgia and called on all parties to respect the terms of the ceasefire agreement and to 
engage constructively in international discussions on stability in the Georgian territories of 
South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>98. Kazakhstan welcomed the active cooperation of Georgia with human rights 
mechanisms of the United Nations, Council of Europe and the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, and the standing invitation to special procedures, 
demonstrating the country&#8217;s will to establishing an open policy regarding freedom of 
religion and to combat torture. Kazakhstan made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>99. The Plurinational State of Bolivia noted the ethnic, racial and religious diversity of 
the population, as noted in the national report, and asked about their participation in the 
preparation of the report. It further asked if cases of discrimination had been brought to 
justice and what the results had been. The Plurinational State of Bolivia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>100. Iraq noted positively that Georgia was party to the main human rights instruments, 
and that the Constitution guaranteed basic human rights principles. It noted further efforts 
to establish a priority strategy for IDPs and to find sustainable solutions in accordance with 
international agreements. Iraq made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>101. Ecuador noted the positive participation of Georgia in the universal periodic review 
and its commitment in the protection of human rights. It recognized progress made by 
Georgia in the promotion of gender equality. Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>102. Bangladesh shared the concerns expressed by United Nations mechanisms and 
agencies on minorities, discrimination against women, gender-based violence, feminization 
of poverty and the situation of disabled children. It also noted observations of the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Human Rights 
Committee on the population living in the South Caucus and IDPs. Bangladesh made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>103. Kyrgyzstan noted with satisfaction the cooperation of Georgia with international 
mechanisms, including the standing invitation to special procedures in 2010, as wells as the 
growing share of the State budget on social welfare. It called on Georgia to take further 
steps to eliminate deficiencies in the protection of the rights of women and children. 
Kyrgyzstan made recommendations.2 
</p>
<p>  
 2 The Russian Federation made the following point of order: &#8220;Regarding the statements of the 
</p>
<p>delegations of Georgia, the USA and Australia, made in spite of the call of the Chairperson of our 
session, we would like to point out once again that allegations about the occupation of Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia are false and unacceptable. The allegations of discrimination by Russia of Georgian 
population in Abkhazia and South Ossetia from the 1990s are also absurd. During all this period 
Russia exercised in the mentioned regions peace-making function in full compliance with the 
mandates of the CIS and the UN and by approbation of the Georgian side. In conclusion we would 
like to reaffirm that the human rights situation in the Republic of Abkhazia and Republic of South 
Ossetia cannot be subject to discus within the UPR of Georgia, and the relevant chapters of the 
documents submitted to it must not be considered by the Working Group and the Human Rights 
Council. We request to fully reflect this statement in the report of our session.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> In response the Georgian delegation made a point of order regretting that, despite the President&#8217;s call 
and the call from the head of the Georgian delegation, Russia continued to misuse the point of order 
procedures and was giving no other choice, but to take the floor. Georgia did not want to take the 
valuable time from the speakers, who were eager to sincerely discuss the progress as well as 
challenges that Georgia had with regard to the human rights protection and, thus, it would not to 
repeat the points already mentioned during the first point of order. Georgia underlined once again that 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>104. While responding to the issues regarding allegations of ill-treatment, torture and 
excessive use of force, the delegation noted that every single case of power abuse needed to 
be investigated effectively. The delegation noted the inconsistency in some of the 
statements, probably due to the lack of information. It was emphasized that torture as a 
systemic problem had disappeared as cited by national and international human rights 
institutions. Regarding alleged deaths and torture caused by excessive use of force, the 
delegation noted that no such cases had been confirmed during last several years. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Conclusions and/or recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The recommendations formulated during the interactive dialogue and listed 
below have been examined by Georgia enjoy the support of Georgia: 
</b></p>
<p>105.1. <b>Consider accession to the remaining core international human rights 
instruments (Brazil); 
</b></p>
<p>105.2. <b>Consider the possibility of becoming a party to the following 
international instruments: the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography; the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (Argentina); 
</b></p>
<p>105.3. <b>Consider ratifying of the International Convention on the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, in accordance with the 
recommendation  of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, as 
well as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Algeria); 
</b></p>
<p>105.4. <b>Consider ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (Mexico); 
</b></p>
<p>105.5. <b>Consider ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities as well as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (India);

<p>105.6. <b>Respect fully the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
in particular its article 14, as well as the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, particularly its 
</b></p>
<p>  
the territorial integrity of Georgia was recognized by the United Nations and the international 
community. It was regrettable that the only State that challenged Georgian territorial integrity had still 
managed to politicize the debate. Georgia was in the working group for human rights. Georgia 
reminded representatives of the Russian Federation that the military presence and the effective control 
of a territory of one country by another country, without the consent of the country, made the other 
country an occupying power. It urged the President to strongly call on certain delegation to respect 
the procedures, the format and the goals of the session and of the Human Rights Council. It requested 
that both points of prder to be reflected in the minutes of the meeting. 
</p>
<p> Subsequently, the President stated that he understood that delegations may be tempted to raise issues 
which they considered very important in a bilateral context. However, he reminded that the Working 
Group on Universal Periodic Review was not the competent or appropriate forum to raise and discuss 
bilateral issues of a political or territorial nature. He already clarified what should be the framework 
within which the Working Group was operating. He urged those concerned to take this into account 
and avoid resorting to points of order. Substantive considerations should be included in the relevant 
statements and not in points of order.  </p>
