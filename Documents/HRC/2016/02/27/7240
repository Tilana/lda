<p><b>Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p>In its resolution 27/27, the Council invited the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights to submit a report to it at its thirtieth session. The present report on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights and the activities of the United Nations Joint Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo assesses the progress made by the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in implementing the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (OHCHR) and other United Nations human rights mechanisms. The report 
</p>
<p>covers the period from June 2014 to May 2015. 
</p>
<p>The High Commissioner commends the efforts made by the authorities to address 
</p>
<p>the recommendations, which have resulted in important developments, including the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the National Human Rights Commission and the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>action plan of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Forces arm&#233;es 
</p>
<p>de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo &#8212; FARDC) on fighting sexual violence. The 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner also notes progress in the fight against impunity, particularly with the 
</p>
<p>conclusion of several emblematic trials, including those of two former FARDC soldiers 
</p>
<p>who were on a list of five senior army officers who had allegedly committed serious 
</p>
<p>crimes. The list had been handed over to the President, Joseph Kabila, by a Security 
</p>
<p>Council delegation in May 2009. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>Despite such efforts, the High Commissioner points out that the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation remains of great concern throughout the country. The United Nations Joint 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Office  registered the highest number of human rights violations and abuses, 
</p>
<p>committed by elements of over 30 armed groups as well as by FARDC soldiers, in the east. 
</p>
<p>The reporting period was also marked by serious incidents that affected the protection of 
</p>
<p>civilians in the east of the country. 
</p>
<p>In the western provinces, particularly in Kinshasa, the deplorable shrinking of 
</p>
<p>democratic space resulted in serious violations of fundamental freedoms by security forces, 
</p>
<p>mainly targeting political opponents, human rights defenders and protesters. These 
</p>
<p>developments are particularly worrisome ahead of the upcoming electoral cycle. 
</p>
<p>The High Commissioner deeply regrets the October 2014 decision of the 
</p>
<p>Government to expel the Director of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</p>
<p>following the publication of the joint report by the United Nations Organization 
</p>
<p>Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and OHCHR on human 
</p>
<p>rights violations committed between 15 November 2013 and 15 February 2014, by agents 
</p>
<p>of the Congolese national police during Operation Likofi in Kinshasa. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner calls upon the Government to reinforce its collaboration with the Joint 
</p>
<p>Office. 
</p>
<p>The High Commissioner encourages the Government to implement all 
</p>
<p>recommendations made in the present report, and reiterates the engagement of his Office to 
</p>
<p>support the authorities&#8217; efforts to protect and promote human rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Prepared pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 27/27 on technical assistance 
</p>
<p>and capacity-building for human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the 
</p>
<p>present report provides an overview of the situation of human rights and the activities of the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in the 
</p>
<p>country through the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office between June 2014 and 
</p>
<p>May 2015.  
</p>
<p>2. The report highlights major human rights developments and focuses on issues 
</p>
<p>relating to fundamental freedoms1 and protection of human rights defenders, journalists and 
</p>
<p>political opponents; sexual violence; extrajudicial killings and summary executions; torture 
</p>
<p>and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; the fight against impunity; and 
</p>
<p>protection of civilians. In relation to these issues, the report assesses progress made by the 
</p>
<p>Government in implementing the recommendations of OHCHR and other United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Main human rights developments  
</b></p>
<p>3. The Government made considerable efforts to advance the human rights situation 
</p>
<p>during the reporting period. In particular, the appointment of the members of the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission on 1 April 2015 is to be welcomed, as is the adoption, on 
</p>
<p>29 October 2014, of the action plan of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the 
</p>
<p>Congo (Forces arm&#233;es de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo &#8212; FARDC) on fighting 
</p>
<p>sexual violence. Progress was also registered in the fight against impunity, notably with the 
</p>
<p>conclusion of several emblematic trials, including those of two former FARDC officers 
</p>
<p>who were on the list of five senior army officers handed over to the President, Joseph 
</p>
<p>Kabila, in May 2009 by a delegation of the Security Council. These senior officers were 
</p>
<p>accused of committing serious crimes, including rape and other forms of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>4. The human rights situation remains, however, of serious concern throughout the 
</p>
<p>country. The conflict-stricken provinces of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
</p>
<p>namely Orientale, North Kivu, South Kivu and North Katanga, continued to register the 
</p>
<p>highest number of human rights violations and abuses, perpetrated by elements of over 
</p>
<p>30 armed groups, as well as by FARDC soldiers in the context of military operations 
</p>
<p>against some of those groups. Reprisals for real or perceived collaboration of the population 
</p>
<p>with other armed groups or with security and defence forces, or grievances along ethnic 
</p>
<p>lines, were often motives for the attacks. If considered separately among other actors, 
</p>
<p>FARDC elements have been the main perpetrators of human rights violations for most of 
</p>
<p>the reporting period, with the Congolese national police overtaking them for the months of 
</p>
<p>January, February and March 2015. 
</p>
<p>5. Increasing restrictions on the political space and violations of the rights to freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression, association and peaceful assembly were mainly registered in the western 
</p>
<p>provinces, particularly in Kinshasa. Agents of the Congolese national police and FARDC 
</p>
<p>soldiers (including the Republican Guard) have used excessive force and lethal weapons to 
</p>
<p>restrict those rights and freedoms during demonstrations and political rallies. The arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrest and detention, sometimes incommunicado, of demonstrators also raised due process 
</p>
<p>concerns.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Mainly the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. </p>


<p>6. The Government&#8217;s expulsion in October 2014 of the Director of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Joint Human Rights Office following the publication of a joint report by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) 
</p>
<p>and OHCHR on human rights violations committed by agents of the Congolese national 
</p>
<p>police during Operation Likofi was an alarming development and the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>urged the Government to investigate continuing acts of intimidation and threats against 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights staff, and hold those responsible accountable. As the country 
</p>
<p>moves towards an electoral cycle, there are serious concerns about further restrictions to 
</p>
<p>political space and increased human rights violations targeting individuals critical of the 
</p>
<p>Government. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Fundamental freedoms and protection of human rights defenders, 
</b></p>
<p><b>journalists and political opponents  
</b></p>
<p>7. The Human Rights Committee recommended that the Government guarantee 
</p>
<p>freedom of speech and of the press and other media, and ensure that any restriction on press 
</p>
<p>and media activities be strictly compatible with article 19 (3) of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights (see CCPR/C/COD/CO/3, para. 22). During the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2009, it was recommended that 
</p>
<p>the Government develop a legal framework to protect and ensure the security of journalists, 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders, members of civil society and the political opposition (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/13/8, para. 96 (22&#8211;26)).  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Current situation and action taken by the Government  
</b></p>
<p>8. During the reporting period, the Government was responsible for a high number of 
</p>
<p>violations of the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, there were numerous cases of excessive use of force by security forces that 
</p>
<p>resulted in extrajudicial killings and other human rights violations mainly targeting political 
</p>
<p>opponents, human rights defenders and media workers particularly during demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>In early 2015, political opponents were targeted by security and defence forces, and several 
</p>
<p>demonstrations were violently repressed, including through lethal force.  
</p>
<p>9. On 17 January 2015, the lower house of Parliament approved a law containing a 
</p>
<p>controversial provision, making the holding of the 2016 presidential and legislative 
</p>
<p>elections conditional upon the conduct of a national census. Many civil society actors 
</p>
<p>interpreted that as an attempt to delay the elections and thereby to allow President Kabila to 
</p>
<p>prolong his tenure. That led to widespread discontent, with large demonstrations organized 
</p>
<p>by members of the opposition and civil society activists around the country in the first 
</p>
<p>quarter of 2015. 
</p>
<p>10. On 19 January 2015, the Government deployed riot police and FARDC soldiers, 
</p>
<p>including the Republican Guard, to respond to the protests, mainly in Kinshasa and Goma. 
</p>
<p>Disproportionate force was used by national security forces against unarmed civilians. 
</p>
<p>According to information gathered by United Nations Joint Human Rights Office, from 
</p>
<p>19 to 23 January 2015, at least 20 persons were killed and 75 injured by the police and the 
</p>
<p>Republican Guard.  
</p>
<p>11. In the context of the demonstrations, over 500 individuals were arrested across the 
</p>
<p>country. Several leaders of the opposition were locked up by the police in their 
</p>
<p>headquarters on 20 January 2015 in Kinshasa, so that they were unable to join the 
</p>
<p>demonstrations. On 21 January, in Lubumbashi, Katanga Province, the police reportedly 
</p>
<p>arrested 13 members of the opposition party, Union pour la d&#233;mocratie et le progr&#232;s social, </p>
<p>at the party&#8217;s local headquarters.  </p>


<p>12. On 15 March 2015, around 30 civil society activists, including three nationals of 
</p>
<p>Senegal, one of Burkina Faso, four of France and one of the United States of America, were 
</p>
<p>reportedly arrested in Kinshasa by officers of the Congolese national police, the National 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Agency and the military police during a workshop to encourage the 
</p>
<p>participation of the youth in the democratic process in the Democratic Republic of the 
</p>
<p>Congo, organized by the civil society organization Filimbi<i>.</i> All were accused of attempting 
</p>
<p>to organize an insurrection in the country and detained on Agency premises in Kinshasa. 
</p>
<p>The foreign nationals were released, some were expelled from the country, and at least two 
</p>
<p>Congolese were still being detained at the time of drafting the present report. In Goma, four 
</p>
<p>civil society activists of the national non-governmental organization (NGO) Lutte pour le 
</p>
<p>changement were arrested, on 7 and 8 April, during a public gathering requesting the 
</p>
<p>release of their colleagues arrested in Kinshasa in the context of the workshop. They were 
</p>
<p>charged with instigation to disobey public authority and provisionally released on bail by 
</p>
<p>the Court of Appeal in Goma on 29 April.  
</p>
<p>13. While many demonstrators were charged with looting, destruction of property and 
</p>
<p>insurrection, no State agent has so far been investigated or prosecuted for the extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>executions and other violations committed to control the demonstrations.<b> </b>This raises 
</p>
<p>questions as to the independence of the judiciary when dealing with cases against political 
</p>
<p>opponents and civil society actors. 
</p>
<p>14. On 20 January 2015, the Government blocked access to text messaging services, the 
</p>
<p>Internet and social media for several weeks to prevent the organization of further 
</p>
<p>demonstrations. Those services were re-established, respectively, on 7 and 8 February and 
</p>
<p>in early March. Some radio programmes and stations were also suspended during that 
</p>
<p>period. For instance, on 17 January, <i>Canal Kin T&#233;l&#233;vision</i>, which belongs to opposition 
</p>
<p>leader Jean-Pierre Bemba, and <i>Radio T&#233;l&#233; Catholique Elikya</i> were suspended for having 
</p>
<p>allegedly broadcast inflammatory messages in connection with the draft electoral law. The 
</p>
<p>radio branch of <i>Radio T&#233;l&#233; Catholique Elikya</i> was reopened a few days later but its 
</p>
<p>television service remains suspended. The signal of <i>Radio France International</i> was 
</p>
<p>suspended on 21 January. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>15. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office followed closely the situation of 
</p>
<p>civil society activists and political opponents arrested in connection with demonstrations 
</p>
<p>and meetings in Kinshasa and Goma. For instance, it followed the case of Christopher 
</p>
<p>Mutanda Ngoy, President of the NGO Synergies for Congo and Human Rights and an 
</p>
<p>active member of the Save the Congo campaign, who was arrested on 21 January 2015 in 
</p>
<p>Kinshasa and held incommunicado in the facilities of the National Intelligence Agency for 
</p>
<p>three weeks before being brought before a judicial official on 10 February. At the time of 
</p>
<p>writing the present report, he was being held in pretrial detention at Makala prison, in 
</p>
<p>Kinshasa, facing 10 criminal charges. The Joint Office also followed the case of Fred 
</p>
<p>Bahuma, the leader of Lutte pour le changement, who was arrested by agents of the 
</p>
<p>Congolese national police and the National Intelligence Agency on 15 March, in Kinshasa, 
</p>
<p>during the workshop organized by Filimbi.  
</p>
<p>16. Among political opponents, the provincial President of the opposition party 
</p>
<p>Rassemblement congolais pour la d&#233;mocratie/Mouvement de lib&#233;ration de Kisangani, 
</p>
<p>Ernest Kyaviro, was arrested on 22 January 2015 in Goma and transferred to National 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Agency facilities in Kinshasa on 23 January. He was transferred to Makala 
</p>
<p>central prison in Kinshasa on 20 April, after almost three months in detention, with limited 
</p>
<p>access to external visitors.  
</p>
<p>17. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office also provided legal support and 
</p>
<p>targeted multifaceted protection assistance to human rights defenders, journalists and </p>


<p>victims and witnesses of serious human rights violations who faced risks of reprisals for 
</p>
<p>testifying in trials, as well as to human rights defenders and journalists who received threats 
</p>
<p>owing to their work. It thus dealt with 138 cases of threats and human rights violations 
</p>
<p>against 86 human rights defenders, 16 journalists and 36 victims and witnesses of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>18. Despite extensive advocacy by representatives of NGOs and human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>in recent years, no significant progress has been made towards the adoption of the bill on 
</p>
<p>the protection of human rights defenders. On 1 November 2013, with the support of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Joint Human Rights Office, human rights organizations, parliamentarians 
</p>
<p>and representatives of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights held a technical workshop, 
</p>
<p>during which participants agreed to changes in the draft legislation. However, the draft was 
</p>
<p>not submitted to the National Assembly because parliamentarians argued that some of their 
</p>
<p>peers would consider that it would only grant protection to human rights defenders as a 
</p>
<p>specific category of people. Consequently, members of civil society have commissioned a 
</p>
<p>study on the constitutionality of the draft legislation with a view to persuading 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians to adopt it. The conclusions of the study were presented to the Platform of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Defenders on 27 March 2015 and to a larger group of human rights activists 
</p>
<p>and partners on 17 April in Kinshasa. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual violence  
</b></p>
<p>19. For many years, successive High Commissioners for Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms have urged the Government to take more effective 
</p>
<p>measures to combat impunity for sexual violence. During the universal periodic review of 
</p>
<p>the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2014, it was recommended that the Government 
</p>
<p>improve the implementation of national legislation on sexual violence and ensure that 
</p>
<p>perpetrators are brought to justice (see A/HRC/27/5, paras. 134.60 and 134.85). The 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended that the 
</p>
<p>Government ensure access to justice for all women affected by sexual violence during 
</p>
<p>conflict by providing appropriate funding to military jurisdictions. It also recommended 
</p>
<p>that the Government ensure that the justice system be responsive to gender-based violence, 
</p>
<p>including by increasing the number of women judges dealing with cases of sexual violence 
</p>
<p>in conflict-affected areas and of judges and prosecutors specialized in sexual violence (see 
</p>
<p>CEDAW/C/COD/CO/6&#8211;7, para. 10 (c)). Other recommendations have been made to 
</p>
<p>improve victims&#8217; access to comprehensive medical treatment and psychological support 
</p>
<p>(ibid., para. 10 (f)). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Current situation and action taken by the Government 
</b></p>
<p>20. Sexual violence remains a major concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
</p>
<p>as parties to the conflict continue to use rape as a weapon of war. During the reporting 
</p>
<p>period, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office documented 550 cases of rape 
</p>
<p>throughout the country. Approximately 81 per cent of them (448 victims) were raped in the 
</p>
<p>eastern provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu and Orientale. Over 44 per cent (243 victims) 
</p>
<p>were allegedly raped by State agents, including members of FARDC (165 victims), the 
</p>
<p>Congolese national police (72 victims), the National Intelligence Agency (2 victims) and 
</p>
<p>other State actors (4 victims). Armed groups were responsible for raping approximately 
</p>
<p>56 per cent (307 victims) of the total. Among the armed groups, the main perpetrators were 
</p>
<p>Mai Mai Simba/Lumumba members, who had been identified as responsible for the rape of 
</p>
<p>80 victims.  
</p>
<p>21. Survivors of sexual violence still do not have access to legal services, reparation and 
</p>
<p>remedy. There are no life-saving health and psychosocial services, such as fistula surgery, </p>


<p>access to antiretroviral drugs and safe abortion services, particularly in conflict-affected 
</p>
<p>areas where State authorities are absent or weak, and the infrastructure is insufficient or 
</p>
<p>inadequate. Holistic support (legal, medical and psychosocial) can only be found in and 
</p>
<p>around urban areas, where they are far from adequate or sufficient. In isolated areas where 
</p>
<p>the justice system is absent or weak, practices such as amicable arrangements are frequently 
</p>
<p>resorted to, whereby the victim&#8217;s family agrees with the perpetrator&#8217;s relatives to a financial 
</p>
<p>settlement or other transactions (including marriage), in order to &#8220;close&#8221; the case.  
</p>
<p>22. Nevertheless, during the reporting period, there were landmark advances to combat 
</p>
<p>conflict-related sexual violence. Military tribunals convicted 30 individuals, including 
</p>
<p>20 FARDC members, 9 Congolese national police elements and 1 member of an armed 
</p>
<p>group (a combatant from the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda) for sexual 
</p>
<p>violence.2 The trials of General J&#233;r&#244;me Kakwavu and Lieutenant Colonel Bedi Mobuli 
</p>
<p>Engangela, alias &#8220;Colonel 106&#8221;, took place on 7 November and 15 December 2015, 
</p>
<p>respectively. Those two individuals were on a list of five senior FARDC officers accused of 
</p>
<p>rape, among other crimes, which a Security Council delegation provided to President 
</p>
<p>Kabila in May 2009.3 
</p>
<p>23. On 14 July 2014, President Kabila appointed a Presidential Adviser on Sexual 
</p>
<p>Violence and the Recruitment and Use of Children, Jeanine Mabunda, to accelerate 
</p>
<p>national action on the issue and engage with the international community. Ms. Mabunda 
</p>
<p>has undertaken field missions all over the country to familiarize herself with the situation 
</p>
<p>of victims of sexual violence and observe mobile court hearings (supported by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Joint Human Rights Office) in Kiwanja, Rutshuru and Matadi. Victims highlighted 
</p>
<p>to her the hindrances they faced in seizing justice and requested measures to facilitate such 
</p>
<p>a process. In December 2014 Ms. Mabunda launched a toll-free number that victims, 
</p>
<p>witnesses and families can call to denounce sexual violence and request assistance. At the 
</p>
<p>time of drafting the present report, 432 calls had been made using the toll-free number and 
</p>
<p>50,000 awareness text messages had been sent to the population.  
</p>
<p>24. On 28 August 2014, the Government, together with the MONUSCO Sexual 
</p>
<p>Violence in Conflict Unit, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office  and the Office of 
</p>
<p>the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, 
</p>
<p>launched the FARDC action plan against sexual violence. FARDC was directly involved in 
</p>
<p>drafting a plan for addressing sexual violence committed by FARDC members. The plan 
</p>
<p>included the creation of a specialized commission and the definition of five priority 
</p>
<p>activities: prevention, repression, protection, communication, monitoring and evaluation. A 
</p>
<p>commission was created on 29 October 2014 by a decree of the Vice-Prime Minister in 
</p>
<p>charge of national defence and former combatants. It includes representatives of 
</p>
<p>MONUSCO and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
</p>
<p>Women. During her mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 29 to 31 March 
</p>
<p>2015, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General attended the official ceremony 
</p>
<p>establishing the commission, during which 10 FARDC unit commanders signed a 
</p>
<p>declaration reiterating their commitment to eradicating sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>25. In September 2014, reparations were paid to 30 victims who had been raped in 
</p>
<p>Songo Mboyo and Equateur Provinces in 2003. The payment of individual financial 
</p>
<p>compensation to survivors was unprecedented and marked a breakthrough in the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice. This case points, however, to the length of time the execution of 
</p>

</p>
<p> 2 These figures are from June 2014&#8211;January 2015. 
</p>
<p> 3 The other three officers were Colonel J. C. Mosala (on the run), Colonel Safari Kizungu (acquitted on 
</p>
<p>21 October 2011) and Lieutenant Colonel Papy Lungu Mobambo, alias &#8220;Pitchen&#8221; (deceased in 
</p>
<p>Mitwaba, Katanga Province in 2012).  </p>


<p>an award of reparations can take. The Presidential Adviser on Sexual Violence and the 
</p>
<p>Recruitment and Use of Children has indicated that clearing the backlog of reparations 
</p>
<p>awards and establishing a fund for this purpose are key priorities for her office.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office  
</b></p>
<p>26. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office remained occupied with building the 
</p>
<p>capacity of seven NGOs running legal clinics to improve victims&#8217; access to justice. 
</p>
<p>Between June 2014 and May 2015, with the support of the Governments of Canada and the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Joint Office supported the work 
</p>
<p>of NGOs in establishing 12 legal clinics in the Provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, 
</p>
<p>Katanga, Bas-Congo, Maniema and Kinshasa. These clinics provide free legal assistance to 
</p>
<p>victims of sexual violence and accompany them through the judicial process, starting with 
</p>
<p>the filing of complaints.  
</p>
<p>27. Over the reporting period, at least 400 victims of sexual violence received assistance 
</p>
<p>from the legal clinics, which resulted in 103 sentences being pronounced against the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators. The legal clinics also established referral mechanisms to holistic services for 
</p>
<p>survivors to help them receive the urgent medical, psychosocial and rehabilitation services 
</p>
<p>they need. During the reporting period, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office  
</p>
<p>further provided financial and technical support to six mobile court hearings involving 
</p>
<p>cases of sexual violence &#8212; three trials in North Kivu, two in Bas-Congo and one in South 
</p>
<p>Kivu.4  
</p>
<p>28. Between April and May 2015, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</p>
<p>organized training for 39 medical doctors on forensic expertise on sexual violence and for 
</p>
<p>49 judicial police officers on handling sexual violence cases, in Kinshasa, Matadi, Kalemie 
</p>
<p>and Kindu. The Joint Office also contributed to the creation of five mini-libraries in 
</p>
<p>prosecutors&#8217; offices5 for the special cells aimed at eradicating sexual and gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence.  
</p>
<p>29. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office remained committed within the 
</p>
<p>framework of the Task Force on Children and Armed Conflict to matters pertaining to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the action plan to stop and prevent underage recruitment, sexual violence 
</p>
<p>against children and other grave child rights violations that was signed by the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Special Representative of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General for the country and Head of MONUSCO on 4 October 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Extrajudicial killings and summary executions  
</b></p>
<p>30. The Human Rights Committee recommended that the Government investigate, 
</p>
<p>prosecute and punish all acts of extrajudicial killings and summary executions, and grant 
</p>
<p>appropriate reparation to the families of victims (see CCPR/C/COD/CO/3, paras. 10 and 
</p>
<p>15). The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions also 
</p>
<p>recommended that the Government implement fully its &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy and 
</p>
<p>investigate, arrest and prosecute FARDC members responsible for such killings (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/14/24/Add.3, para. 109).  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office supported one trial in Kiwanja, Rutshuru territory, 
</p>
<p>North Kivu; two trials in Kitchanga, Masisi territory, North Kivu; one trial in Kasangulu, Bas-Congo; 
</p>
<p>and the trial of Colonel 106 in Bukavu, South Kivu.  
</p>
<p> 5 In Kinshasa, Matadi, Kindu, Kalemie and Lubumbashi.  </p>


<p><b> 1. Current situation and action taken by the Government 
</b></p>
<p>31. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office continued to document extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>killings by State agents during the reporting period in areas not affected by any conflict. 
</p>
<p>From June 2014 to May 2015, State agents were responsible for at least 114 cases of 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial executions targeting 140 victims not affected by armed conflict. In many 
</p>
<p>cases, the disproportionate use of force and of firearms by FARDC, the Republican Guard 
</p>
<p>and the Congolese national police has resulted in the killing of civilians.  
</p>
<p>32. During the reporting period, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances 
</p>
<p>were committed by agents of the Congolese national police, including during Operation 
</p>
<p>Likofi, conducted in Kinshasa between 15 November 2013 and 15 February 2014 against 
</p>
<p>alleged street bandits named &#8220;<i>kulunas</i>&#8221;.6 So far, only one judgement has been rendered by 
</p>
<p>the Military Garrison Tribunal of N&#8217;djili, in Kinshasa, on 24 June 2014, sentencing a chief 
</p>
<p>superintendent of police to 10 years in prison for abduction, arbitrary arrest and forgery. No 
</p>
<p>other action seems to have been taken so far by the competent authorities to identify and 
</p>
<p>prosecute all the perpetrators of the violations committed in the framework of Operation 
</p>
<p>Likofi. 
</p>
<p>33. As mentioned above, at least 20 civilians were killed in the context of 
</p>
<p>demonstrations in Kinshasa and Goma in early 2015. In March 2015, a mass grave 
</p>
<p>containing 421 bodies was discovered in the Maluku commune, Kinshasa Province. It is 
</p>
<p>alleged that those corpses might be those of people reported missing in the context of 
</p>
<p>Operation Likofi7 and after the demonstrations in Kinshasa. The Government of the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo has pledged to conduct a transparent and credible 
</p>
<p>investigation and shed light on the mass grave.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office  
</b></p>
<p>34. On 15 October 2014, MONUSCO and OHCHR published a report on human rights 
</p>
<p>violations committed by the Congolese national police in the context of Operation Likofi, 
</p>
<p>documenting the killing of at least nine civilians and the enforced disappearance of 
</p>
<p>32 others, based on investigations conducted by United Nations Joint Human Rights Office. 
</p>
<p>The report, intended to serve as an advocacy tool, indicated in its conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations corrective actions the Government could take with MONUSCO support.8 
</p>
<p>Following the release of the report, the Government declared the Director of the Joint 
</p>
<p>Office persona non grata.  
</p>
<p>35. In the framework of its mandate to fight against impunity, the United Nations Joint 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Office followed up on serious incidents that had taken place in Lubumbashi 
</p>
<p>and Kinshasa on 30 December 2013, during which at least 70 civilians were killed, mainly 
</p>
<p>by FARDC soldiers. Those killings took place in the context of defence and security force 
</p>
<p>operations against followers of political opponent and religious leader Joseph Mukungubila, 
</p>
<p>who was believed to be behind the attacks against strategic Government installations in 
</p>
<p>Lubumbashi, Kinshasa and Kindu. In addition, over 60 civilians and alleged coup plotters 
</p>
<p>were arrested by the security forces between 30 December 2013 and 2 January 2014. The 
</p>
<p>Joint Office continued to advocate investigations at the local level and with the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice and Human Rights. To date, the Joint Office has no information indicating that an

</i></p>
<p><i>agents of the Congolese national police during Operation Likofi in Kinshasa between 15 November 
</i></p>
<p><i>2013 and 15 February 2014</i>, published in October 2014.  
</p>
<p> 7 See paragraph 34 below.  
</p>
<p> 8 As per standard United Nations Joint Human Rights Office practice, the report was shared with the 
</p>
<p>Government for comments prior to its publication and comments were annexed to the report. </p>


<p>investigation has been opened into the alleged killings by the security forces, nor has it 
</p>
<p>received any response to a letter it sent on 14 August 2014 to the Minister, concerning the 
</p>
<p>killings. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b>or punishment  
</b></p>
<p>36. The Committee against Torture recommended that the Government eliminate 
</p>
<p>impunity for alleged acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by 
</p>
<p>carrying out prompt, impartial and exhaustive investigations into all reported cases of 
</p>
<p>torture and ill-treatment. It also stressed that the perpetrators should be tried and the victims 
</p>
<p>properly compensated. Furthermore, the Committee requested the Government to ensure 
</p>
<p>that those who reported cases of torture and ill-treatment be protected from intimidation or 
</p>
<p>reprisals for reporting such cases (see CAT/C/DRC/CO/1, para. 6). During the 2014 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Government was 
</p>
<p>urged to initiate investigations to determine responsibilities in cases of allegations of abuse 
</p>
<p>and torture by security forces &#8212; especially in places of detention &#8212; and prosecute 
</p>
<p>perpetrators (see A/HRC/27/5, paras. 134.49&#8211;134.50). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Current situation and action taken by the Government  
</b></p>
<p>37. During the reporting period, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</p>
<p>documented 605 violations by torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, 
</p>
<p>affecting 1,191 victims throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Approximately 
</p>
<p>62 per cent of the violations (377) were committed by State agents &#8212; FARDC soldiers, 
</p>
<p>Congolese national police elements and National Intelligence Agency agents, while 38 per 
</p>
<p>cent of those violations (228) were reportedly committed by members of armed groups.  
</p>
<p>38. Some victims were reportedly tied up and beaten by members of the security forces 
</p>
<p>upon arrest, allegedly for resisting extortion, participating in political activities, failing to 
</p>
<p>participate in community work, committing petty theft or failing to pay a debt. For 
</p>
<p>example, on 22 March 2015, in Kalembe, Masisi territory, North Kivu, six men were 
</p>
<p>allegedly arbitrarily arrested and beaten by soldiers of the 804th regiment of FARDC for 
</p>
<p>refusing to participate in community work organized by FARDC to build their military 
</p>
<p>camp. On 2 January, in Buyinga, Lubero territory, two children resisted extortion of their 
</p>
<p>property by a FARDC soldier and were arbitrarily arrested, tied up and beaten with batons, 
</p>
<p>hammers and wooden sticks by FARDC soldiers. They were stripped half-naked and left an 
</p>
<p>entire night tied to poles.  
</p>
<p>39. Some victims have been subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, 
</p>
<p>which may have constituted torture by security force elements, for taking part in activities 
</p>
<p>perceived to be in opposition to or critical of Government actions. On 7 April 2015, 
</p>
<p>Congolese national police elements allegedly arrested four militants of Lutte pour le 
</p>
<p>changement in Goma during a public rally organized to request the release of civil society 
</p>
<p>activists detained by the National Intelligence Agency in Kinshasa. The four activists 
</p>
<p>reported that about 10 police agents had beaten them during their detention. On 13 April 
</p>
<p>2015, they were transferred to the central prison in Goma. The United Nations Joint Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Office confirmed reports alleging that they had been subjected to degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment during their detention. Prison guards forced them to collect 
</p>
<p>excrement with their bare hands while cleaning the toilets, and beat them when they refused 
</p>
<p>to obey. They were provisionally released on bail by the Court of Appeal in Goma on 
</p>
<p>29 April.  </p>


<p>40. Members of armed groups have also subjected civilians to mutilation and cruel 
</p>
<p>treatment during attacks on villages. For example, on 20 June 2014, in Makumo, Lubero 
</p>
<p>territory, North Kivu, Mai Mai Lumumba combatants reportedly mutilated the ears of two 
</p>
<p>civilians and wounded another&#8217;s face with a machete for their alleged complicity in the 
</p>
<p>killing of their leader.  
</p>
<p>41. The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo promulgated a national 
</p>
<p>law against torture on 9 July 2011, but its implementation has been weak. During the 
</p>
<p>reporting period, military tribunals convicted at least six individuals for torture &#8212; four 
</p>
<p>Congolese national police agents and two FARDC soldiers &#8212; according to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Joint Human Rights Office. The low number of convictions may partly be due to a 
</p>
<p>lack of awareness of the law against torture within the judiciary. More efforts are therefore 
</p>
<p>required to raise awareness about the law across the country.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>42. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office continued to monitor and report on 
</p>
<p>incidents of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</p>
<p>throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>43. Together with the Vice-Minister for Human Rights and United Nations police 
</p>
<p>officers, representatives of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office visited places of 
</p>
<p>detention in Bas-Congo and Bandundu Provinces to evaluate arrest procedures and 
</p>
<p>conditions of detention, and assess their compliance with national and international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards. Despite the adoption by the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture in 2010, and the sustained advocacy 
</p>
<p>conducted by the Joint Office, the Government has not yet set up a national mechanism for 
</p>
<p>the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as 
</p>
<p>required by article 3 of the Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Fight against impunity  
</b></p>
<p>44. The Human Rights Committee recommended that the Government take all 
</p>
<p>appropriate steps to ensure that all human rights violations brought to its attention be 
</p>
<p>investigated, and that those responsible for such violations be prosecuted and punished (see 
</p>
<p>CCPR/C/COD/CO/3, para. 10). During the 2014 universal periodic review of the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Government was in particular urged to take the 
</p>
<p>measures necessary to put an end to impunity in all cases of violence against women (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/27/5, para. 134.61). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Current situation and action taken by the Government  
</b></p>
<p>45. Positive and significant developments were observed in the fight against impunity, 
</p>
<p>some of which resulted from activities conducted with the support of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Joint Human Rights Office and its partners. During the period under review, according to 
</p>
<p>information received by the Joint Office, at least 60 Congolese national police agents and 
</p>
<p>165 FARDC soldiers were convicted throughout the country for various human rights-
</p>
<p>related offences. 
</p>
<p>46. On 15 December 2014, in Bukavu, the Military Court of South Kivu rendered its 
</p>
<p>verdict in the case of Lieutenant Colonel Bedi Mobuli Engangela, alias &#8220;Colonel 106&#8221;, who 
</p>
<p>was charged with crimes against humanity in connection with grave crimes committed in 
</p>
<p>South Kivu between 2005 and 2007, including rape, sexual slavery and murder. The Court 
</p>
<p>convicted him of crimes against humanity for murder, rape, sexual slavery, imprisonment 
</p>
<p>and severe deprivation of liberty, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The Court also </p>


<p>condemned him, in solidum with the State, to the payment of damages to the civil parties. 
</p>
<p>On 7 November 2014, the High Military Court convicted General J&#233;r&#244;me Kakwavu for his 
</p>
<p>individual and command responsibility for rape and war crimes, and sentenced him to 
</p>
<p>10 years of imprisonment. General Kakwavu was a former commander of the Forces 
</p>
<p>arm&#233;es du peuple congolais, a militia active in the district of Ituri between 2003 and 2005. 
</p>
<p>Despite the length of the proceedings, the convictions of Colonel 106 and General 
</p>
<p>Kakwavu represent an important step in the fight against impunity. 
</p>
<p>47. Other developments include the conviction of a former high-level commander of the 
</p>
<p>Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda, Kizimi Lenine Sabin, for crimes against 
</p>
<p>humanity. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Military Garrison Tribunal of 
</p>
<p>Bukavu on 29 December 2014, after mobile court hearings supported by MONUSCO. On 
</p>
<p>17 November 2014, in Beni, the Military Operational Court of North Kivu rendered its 
</p>
<p>judgement in the case concerning the assassination of Colonel Mamadou Ndala after a 
</p>
<p>series of mobile court hearings held in Beni territory. The Court convicted five FARDC 
</p>
<p>officers and six commanders of the Allied Democratic Forces-National Army for the 
</p>
<p>Liberation of Uganda for the assassination.  
</p>
<p>48. In November 2014, Justin Banakoli, alias &#8220;Cobra Matata&#8221;, leader of the Forces de 
</p>
<p>r&#233;sistance patriotiques en Ituri, indicated that he was going to surrender to FARDC, along 
</p>
<p>with 812 of his combatants. However, negotiations with the Government failed as Cobra 
</p>
<p>Matata insisted on a general amnesty for himself and his men, as well as integration of his 
</p>
<p>forces into FARDC, with recognition of their ranks. He was arrested on several charges, 
</p>
<p>including that of child recruitment, and transferred from Bunia to Kinshasa Ndolo military 
</p>
<p>prison on 5 January 2015 with MONUSCO support. He is accused of desertion, forming a 
</p>
<p>rebel movement, crimes against humanity, war crimes, child recruitment and attempting to 
</p>
<p>escape from detention.  
</p>
<p>49. Many challenges remain in the fight against impunity and in the administration of 
</p>
<p>justice. Several case files considered emblematic owing to the high number of victims or 
</p>
<p>the nature of the violations and the profile of the perpetrators, remain unresolved due to 
</p>
<p>lack of action by judicial authorities to hold the perpetrators accountable. OHCHR is 
</p>
<p>concerned moreover about the lack of appeal for the accused, tried in first instance before 
</p>
<p>the Cour militaire op&#233;rationnelle, the Supreme Court and the Military High Court, as well 
</p>
<p>as the imposition of the death penalty<i>,</i> despite a de facto moratorium on its application 
</p>
<p>since 2003. 
</p>
<p>50. On 2 June 2015, the National Assembly adopted draft legislation on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo ratified in 2002. A large conference organized by the 
</p>
<p>Minister of Justice and Human Rights was held, from 27 April to 2 May, to assess the 
</p>
<p>situation of the justice system and suggest reforms. Several important recommendations 
</p>
<p>relating to the fight against impunity and witness and victim protection were adopted on 
</p>
<p>that occasion.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office  
</b></p>
<p>51. The sentencing of General Kakwavu and Colonel 106 marked the culmination of 
</p>
<p>years of effort (seven in the case of Colonel 106) by MONUSCO and other national and 
</p>
<p>international partners in the fight against impunity. The United Nations Joint Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Office supported the process from the investigation, reporting and advocacy phases to the 
</p>
<p>judicial investigation process and the trial. The Joint Office also worked closely with the 
</p>
<p>authorities to set up a witness protection system allowing witnesses to testify without fear 
</p>
<p>of reprisal and implemented protection measures for victims and witnesses throughout the 
</p>
<p>pretrial and trial phases, which resulted in pretrial support being provided to 100 victims 
</p>
<p>and in 80 victims testifying anonymously. </p>


<p>52. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office continued to assist the judicial 
</p>
<p>authorities in the fight against impunity by providing, among others, technical and logistical 
</p>
<p>support to bring investigators and magistrates to sites where human rights violations had 
</p>
<p>been committed. During the reporting period, the Joint Office was able to support nine joint 
</p>
<p>investigation team missions,9 conducted by judicial authorities in various parts of the 
</p>
<p>country.  
</p>
<p>53. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office assisted the judicial authorities 
</p>
<p>through support to mobile court hearings, especially in the east, where the request from 
</p>
<p>military justice was higher. For example, on 7 March 2015, the military garrison tribunal of 
</p>
<p>Goma sitting in mobile court hearings in Kitchanga, Masisi territory, North Kivu, convicted 
</p>
<p>20 State agents for various crimes, including murder, sexual violence, armed banditry and 
</p>
<p>illegal possession of weapons of war. MONUSCO supported the trial through logistic and 
</p>
<p>financial support as well as in matters pertaining to the protection of victims, witnesses and 
</p>
<p>plaintiffs. The Joint Office has also advocated with the Government for the abolition of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty. Thus, in its work with the Government and civil society to implement a 
</p>
<p>follow-up plan to the universal periodic review recommendations, it has suggested that 
</p>
<p>legislation be drafted to abolish the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>54. In June and July 2014, in Goma, Bukavu, Lubumbashi, Bunia and Kisangani, the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Joint Human Rights Office organized workshops for civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations on reform proposals in the area of transitional justice, specifically for the 
</p>
<p>reorganization of the judiciary to enable it to prosecute serious crimes under international 
</p>
<p>law. Following those workshops, participants issued collective advocacy letters to their 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians on the subject. In November, the Joint Office co-organized a workshop 
</p>
<p>with the International Centre for Transitional Justice on strengthening the judicial 
</p>
<p>framework and its ability to investigate and prosecute grave crimes in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo, which analysed proposed reforms on transitional justice, including 
</p>
<p>the possible establishment of specialized chambers to try international crimes.  
</p>
<p>55. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office supported the transfer of 29 high-
</p>
<p>risk inmates, including Colonel 106, to more secure facilities to address persistent security 
</p>
<p>concerns in prison. Indeed, 1,510 detainees escaped from prisons during the period under 
</p>
<p>review. Systematic and mass escapes from prison represent a serious setback to the fight 
</p>
<p>against impunity. The dilapidated prison infrastructure in some cases, combined with 
</p>
<p>negligence, and sometimes corruption of prison guards, explain many of the escapes.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Protection of civilians  
</b></p>
<p>56. The Human Rights Committee recommended that the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo take all the steps necessary to strengthen its capacity to 
</p>
<p>protect civilians, especially women and children, in zones of armed conflict. It advised that 
</p>
<p>relevant guidelines be made available to all members of the armed forces and that human 
</p>
<p>rights training be made compulsory for them (see CCPR/C/COD/CO/3, para. 13). During 
</p>
<p>the 2014 universal periodic review, the Government was urged to take the measures 
</p>
<p>necessary to protect civilians in any situation of armed violence (see A/HRC/27/5, 
</p>
<p>para. 134.163).

<p>57. In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, civilians remain vulnerable to the 
</p>
<p>continued armed conflict between the Congolese army and various armed groups. The 
</p>
<p>United Nations Joint Human Rights Office continued to document the killing and injuring 
</p>
<p>of civilians, as well as rapes, abductions and looting by armed groups and State agents in 
</p>
<p>the context of operations against such groups. 
</p>
<p>58. During the reporting period, military operations to neutralize armed groups, 
</p>
<p>including Operation Sukola I against the Allied Democratic Forces and Operation Sukola II 
</p>
<p>against the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda and the Forces de r&#233;sistance 
</p>
<p>patriotique en Ituri, seem to have resulted in the radicalization of these groups. All those 
</p>
<p>combatants targeted civilians in retaliation for the victims&#8217; real or perceived support to 
</p>
<p>FARDC in military operations against them. 
</p>
<p>59. On the night of 6 June 2014, 31 civilians were killed by members of a Barundi and 
</p>
<p>Banyamulenge militia group in Mutarule, Uvira territory, South Kivu, in an outdoor church 
</p>
<p>service. The FARDC commander stationed nearby had reportedly been repeatedly warned 
</p>
<p>and informed of the attack by the local population, but failed to prevent or stop the killings. 
</p>
<p>From 1 October to 31 December 2014, a series of attacks in several localities of Beni 
</p>
<p>territory resulted in the killing of at least 237 civilians by combatants of the Allied 
</p>
<p>Democratic Forces. At the request of the Government, the United Nations Joint Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Office has granted support to the national investigation into the killings. 
</p>
<p>60. In the context of the drawdown of MONUSCO, it is especially important that State 
</p>
<p>security forces take the lead in the protection of civilians. To this effect, FARDC and the 
</p>
<p>MONUSCO force regularly undertake day and night joint patrols in volatile areas. Officers 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations police also cohabit with Congolese national police agents in 
</p>
<p>provincial offices of eastern Congo. Provincial officials participate alongside MONUSCO 
</p>
<p>and other protection stakeholders in the provincial Senior Management Group on 
</p>
<p>Protection.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office  
</b></p>
<p>61. The protection of civilians remains the core priority for MONUSCO and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Joint Human Rights Office. Besides various protection mechanisms, in an effort to 
</p>
<p>be proactive rather than reactive in protecting civilians, the Joint Office spearheaded the 
</p>
<p>establishment of an early warning alert and response cell, with corresponding provincial 
</p>
<p>and local entities. MONUSCO also stepped up efforts to protect civilians through increased 
</p>
<p>interaction with the local population and advocacy efforts with local and national 
</p>
<p>authorities. It conducted awareness-raising activities on the early warning networks in areas 
</p>
<p>that could be affected by military operations against the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration 
</p>
<p>du Rwanda and worked with some 90 communities in North Kivu to improve local early 
</p>
<p>warning systems. Furthermore, through routine inductions for newly deployed United 
</p>
<p>Nations police and MONUSCO, the Joint Office has sought to maintain the focus on 
</p>
<p>protection in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>62.  Protection of civilians in the context of the series of attacks by the Allied 
</p>
<p>Democratic Forces in Beni territory, North Kivu, mainly during the period October-
</p>
<p>December 2014, presented some challenges.10 However, in view of FARDC unilateral 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 See <i>Report of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office on international humanitarian law 
</i></p>
<p><i>violations committed by Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) combatants in the territory of Beni, North 
</i></p>
<p><i>Kivu province, between 1 October and 31 December 2014</i>, jointly published by OHCHR and 
</p>
<p>MONUSCO in May 2015. </p>


<p>operations against the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda, MONUSCO has 
</p>
<p>heightened its alert networks in Sukola II areas of operation, namely North Kivu and South 
</p>
<p>Kivu, to ensure that information and alerts on threats to civilians are properly channelled 
</p>
<p>and addressed by the MONUSCO force and Congolese authorities. In the light of imminent 
</p>
<p>heightened operations against the Forces de r&#233;sistance patriotique en Ituri, the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Joint Human Rights Office has been engaging MONUSCO in a joint planning 
</p>
<p>exercise to ascertain whether the plan incorporates appropriate protection concerns.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Human rights due diligence policy and the role of the United Nations Joint Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>63. In compliance with the human rights due diligence policy on United Nations support 
</p>
<p>to non-United Nations security forces, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</p>
<p>continued to screen FARDC battalion commanders and Congolese national police agents 
</p>
<p>for past human rights violations as a condition for any support provided by MONUSCO or 
</p>
<p>the United Nations country team. During the reporting period, the Joint Office conducted 
</p>
<p>1,805 screenings for the provision of recommendations to MONUSCO leadership prior to 
</p>
<p>the provision of Mission support to security forces. While this number comprises personnel 
</p>
<p>who have been screened more than once, 906 distinct individuals have been screened. More 
</p>
<p>than 85 per cent of the screened officers are FARDC while the remaining officers belong to 
</p>
<p>the police. Information collected by the Joint Office through monitoring and investigation 
</p>
<p>functions remained critical for the Mission&#8217;s ability to support joint operations.  
</p>
<p>64. In January 2015, on the eve of the launch of the planned FARDC-MONUSCO joint 
</p>
<p>operation against the Forces d&#233;mocratiques de lib&#233;ration du Rwanda in North Kivu, the 
</p>
<p>appointment of two FARDC generals as commanders to key positions within the operation 
</p>
<p>led MONUSCO to withdraw its support. This was due to records of gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations for which the commanders allegedly bore direct and command responsibility, as 
</p>
<p>well as with a view to preventing human rights violations in the context of operations 
</p>
<p>supported by MONUSCO. None of the FARDC units falling under their command received 
</p>
<p>MONUSCO support. The Government then decided that Sukola II would be a unilateral 
</p>
<p>operation. Those developments highlighted the need for improved communication between 
</p>
<p>MONUSCO and the Government on the human rights due diligence policy. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms 
and national mechanisms to promote and protect human 
rights  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Action to implement universal periodic review recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>65. The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office has been working closely with the 
</p>
<p>Government and civil society to support implementation of universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations made to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 2014. On 23 and 
</p>
<p>24 December 2014, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights met with various 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to adopt an implementation plan for review recommendations. The Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister is to submit the plan to all ministries concerned to start the implementation.  
</p>
<p>66. In November and December 2014, the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</p>
<p>and the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights organized training workshops in the 
</p>
<p>provincial capitals of South Kivu, Orientale, North Kivu and Katanga on the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review process and its final recommendations, including the role of each 
</p>
<p>stakeholder in their implementation. Participants included the <i>entit&#233;s de liaison</i>, provincial 
</p>
<p>government officials, and representatives of FARDC, the Congolese national police, the </p>


<p>National Intelligence Agency and leaders of civil society. Thirty-three participants were 
</p>
<p>trained in Goma, 37 in Bukavu, 38 in Kisangani and 29 in Lubumbashi. The Joint Office 
</p>
<p>also conducted awareness-raising meetings on the subject for 428 beneficiaries in Kindu, 
</p>
<p>Kalemie, Matadi, Bandundu, Kinshasa, Butembo, Mbuji-Mayi, Uvira, Dungu and Bunia.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Update on national mechanisms for the protection and promotion 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National Human Rights Commission  
</b></p>
<p>67. Members of the National Human Rights Commission were appointed by Parliament 
</p>
<p>on 1 April 2015 and confirmed by presidential decree &#8212; over two years after the enabling 
</p>
<p>legislation was promulgated (March 2013). The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office 
</p>
<p>had previously engaged with the human rights NGOs&#8217; coordination committee and the 
</p>
<p>President of the Parliamentarians&#8217; Network for Human Rights, and advocated a consensual 
</p>
<p>approach in nominating qualified candidates according to the Organic law and the 
</p>
<p>Principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights (Paris Principles). On 24 April 2015, the Commission adopted its internal 
</p>
<p>rules and regulations, which were submitted to the Constitutional Court for review on 
</p>
<p>30 April. The Joint Office provided technical assistance to the subcommittee tasked with 
</p>
<p>drafting the rules.  
</p>
<p>68. One of the 11 candidates to the National Human Rights Commission, who was not 
</p>
<p>appointed, challenged the designation procedure before the Constitutional Court on 6 April 
</p>
<p>2015, arguing that the process violated several provisions of the Constitution and of the 
</p>
<p>internal rules of the National Assembly. At the time of drafting, the Constitutional Court 
</p>
<p>had not yet answered this claim of unconstitutionality. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. <i>Entit&#233;s de liaison</i> 
</b></p>
<p>69. No significant progress has been observed during the reporting period to ensure that 
</p>
<p>the <i>entit&#233;s de liaison</i> are operational and effective since their establishment by decree 
</p>
<p>No. 09/35 of 12 August 2009 and their official launch on 17 April 2010. Despite continued 
</p>
<p>efforts by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office to advocate that the authorities 
</p>
<p>make these entities fully operational at the national and provincial levels, they remain 
</p>
<p>inactive. Some provincial governors complained of not having funds to implement the 
</p>
<p>mechanism, while other stakeholders considered that the situation was due to lack of 
</p>
<p>political will.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>During the period under review, the human rights situation in eastern 
</b></p>
<p><b>Democratic Republic of the Congo continued to be affected by conflict and violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed by armed groups and FARDC in the context of military operations against 
</b></p>
<p><b>those groups. In the western part of the country, the human rights situation was 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected by political factors, with restrictions to the political space and violations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. </b>The<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>intervention of State agents in the repression of political opponents and other civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society actors, including excessive use of force against demonstrators, arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>arrests and incommunicado detention, without judicial oversight, are of serious 
</b></p>
<p><b>concern, particularly in the lead-up to the upcoming electoral cycle. </b></p>


<p>71. <b>The conclusion of several emblematic trials, including of FARDC officers, was 
</b></p>
<p><b>a welcome step forward in the fight against impunity. However, structural problems 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the justice system, particularly its lack of independence when dealing with cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>against political opponents and civil society actors, remain of great concern and have 
</b></p>
<p><b>resulted in the still low prosecution rate of human rights violations.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The High Commissioner deplores the expulsion of the former Director of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations Joint Human Rights Office from the Democratic Republic of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Congo in October 2014 following the publication of the report on Operation Likofi.</b>11<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>He notes with concern that the Government had decided, in January 2015, to carry 
</b></p>
<p><b>out the Sukola II operation unilaterally led by two FARDC generals suspected of 
</b></p>
<p><b>having committed gross human rights violations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of the Democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic of the Congo: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Establish judicial and non-judicial mechanisms to fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>for serious past and ongoing human rights violations, committed across the country, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through the adoption of the law on the specialized chambers;</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b)</b> <b>Take all the legislative measures necessary to ensure that all those 
</b></p>
<p><b>convicted of crimes can appeal against their convictions and sentences to a higher 
</b></p>
<p><b>court;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c)</b> <b>Ensure that the fundamental freedoms of all people in the Democratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic of the Congo are respected in the run-up to the upcoming elections; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that the National Human Rights Commission is fully operational, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through the allocation of appropriate financial and logistical capacity, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that it works in line with the Paris Principles; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Take all the measures necessary to ensure that the defence and security 
</b></p>
<p><b>forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo fully respect international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights and humanitarian law, including by reinforcing oversight and accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Work towards the full implementation of the FARDC action plan to stop 
</b></p>
<p><b>and prevent underage recruitment, sexual violence against children and other grave 
</b></p>
<p><b>child rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators are systematically brought to justice, and that victims receive timely and 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate reparation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) In accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the assistance of the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, create a national mechanism for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the prevention of torture independent of the Government;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Establish and empower national institutions and mechanisms for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>coordination and implementation of recommendations of the United Nations human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 The High Commissioner issued a press release on 19 October 2014 to condemn the expulsion of the 
</p>
<p>Director of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office. </p>


<p><b>(i) Reinforce its collaboration with the United Nations Joint Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office, MONUSCO and other partners to ensure better protection of human rights in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country.
