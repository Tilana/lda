<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as other 
pertinent human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>resolutions 2002/26 of 22 April 2002, 2003/26 of 22 April 2003, 2004/20 of 
16 April 2004 and 2005/20 of 14 April 2005 of the former Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member States of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that numerous declarations within the United Nations system promote respect for 
cultural diversity, as well as for international cultural cooperation, in particular the Declaration 
of the Principles of International Cultural Cooperation and the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, adopted by its 
General Conference in 1966 and 2001 respectively, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of the Tehran Declaration and Programme of Action on Human Rights 
and Cultural Diversity adopted in the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement 
on Human Rights and Cultural Diversity, held in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, 
on 3 and 4 September 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the entry into force on 18 March 2007 of the Convention on the Protection and 
Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, adopted by the General Conference of the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, on 20 October 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the importance of the promotion of the cultural rights of everyone and of respect 
for cultural diversity, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms for all should be based on an understanding of the economic, 
social and cultural specificities of each country and on the full realization and recognition of  
the universality of all human rights and the principles of freedom, justice, equality and 
non-discrimination, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that cultural rights are an integral part of human rights, which are 
universal, indivisible, interrelated and interdependent; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
on the promotion of the enjoyment of the cultural rights of everyone and respect for different 
cultural identities (E/CN.4/2006/40); </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses its appreciation</i> to States and intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations that responded to or participated in the consultations held pursuant to Commission 
on Human Rights resolutions 2002/26 of 22 April 2002, 2003/26 of 22 April 2003, 2004/20 
of 16 April 2004 and 2005/20 of 14 April 2005; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the establishment of a thematic procedure on the promotion of the 
enjoyment of the cultural rights of everyone and respect for cultural diversity should not develop 
a new monitoring mechanism, and that the appointment of an independent expert in the field of 
cultural rights could assist the implementation of the present resolution, taking into account the 
work already done in this field by other bodies, organs and organizations of the United Nations 
system; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Acknowledges</i> that the process of review, rationalization and improvement of 
mandates represents momentum towards the establishment of an independent expert on the 
promotion of the enjoyment of the cultural rights of everyone and respect for cultural diversity, 
and to this end requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consult 
States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations on the content and scope of the 
mandate of the independent expert, the basis of which would be the comprehensive 
implementation of the present resolution, and to report on the results of those consultations to 
the Council at its eighth session (to be held in June 2008); 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Underlines</i> that it is important to avoid overlapping with the activities of the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other bodies and 
organizations of the United Nations system when establishing the mandate of the independent 
expert and to bear in mind the significance of encouraging synergy between all actors dealing 
with cultural rights and the issue of cultural diversity; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter at its eighth session under the 
same agenda item.
