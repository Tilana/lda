Re:
Issue and Sale of Subscription Receipts by Solimar Energy Limited
Canaccord Genuity Corp. ("Canaccord Genuity" or the "Underwriter") understands that 
Solimar  Energy  Limited  (the  "Corporation")  proposes  to  issue  and  sell,  by  way  of  private 
placement, 27,778,000 subscription receipts of the Corporation ("Subscription Receipts") at a price 
of $0.072 per Subscription Receipt, for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,000,016, subject to the terms 
and conditions as set out below (collectively, the "Offering").
The  Underwriter  further  understands  that  the  Corporation  will  use  the  proceeds  of  the 
Offering primarily to fund the Corporation's exploration and development program and for general 
corporate purposes and that each Subscription Receipt represents the right to automatically receive, 
upon the satisfaction of the Release Condition (as defined herein) and without payment of additional 
consideration or any further action on the part of the holder thereof, one special warrant ("Special 
Warrant").  Each Special Warrant represents the right to automatically receive, without payment of 
additional consideration and upon the satisfaction of the Warrant Release Condition (as defined 
herein), one  ordinary share ("Common Share") in the capital of the Corporation and one half of one 
ordinary share purchase warrant ("Warrant").  Each whole Warrant will entitle the holder thereof to 
purchase one Common Share at a price of $0.144 per Common Share for a period of 36 months 
following the Closing Date (as defined herein).  In the event the Qualification Date (as defined 
herein) has not occurred prior to 5:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on the 30th day following the Closing 
Date, each unexercised Special Warrant will thereafter entitle the holder to receive upon the exercise 
thereof, at no additional consideration, 1.1 Common Shares (instead of one Common Shares (instead 
of one Common Share) (the additional 0.1 Common Shares per Special Warrant are collectively 
referred to herein as the "Penalty Shares").
Each  Subscription  Receipt  will  automatically  be  exchanged  into  one  Special  Warrant 
immediately prior to the Effective Time upon delivery to the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) of:  
(i) a Listing Notice (as defined herein) by the Corporation and acknowledged by the Underwriter  
confirming that the Release Conditions have been satisfied; and (ii) an Irrevocable Direction (as 
defined herein) by the Corporation to issue the Special Warrants issuable upon exchange of the 
Subscription Receipts.
The Escrowed Funds (as defined herein) will be held by Computershare Trust Company of 
Canada, as trustee and escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") and invested in short-term obligations of, 
or guaranteed by, the Government of Canada or invested on deposit in an interest bearing trust
1777574v13

account of the Escrow Agent (and other approved investments) pending satisfaction of the Release 
Conditions.  Provided that the Listing Notice and Irrevocable Direction are delivered prior to the 
Deadline (as defined herein), the Escrow Agent shall release:  (i) to Canaccord Genuity, an amount 
equal to the fees and reimbursable expenses payable by the Corporation to the Underwriter pursuant 
to this Agreement, together with accrued interest thereon; and (ii) to the Corporation, the Escrowed 
Funds, together with accrued interest thereon, less the amount of the fees and reimbursable expenses 
paid to the Underwriter pursuant to this Agreement.  If:  (i) the Release Conditions have not been 
satisfied or the Escrow Agent has not received the Listing Notice and the Irrevocable Direction on or 
before the Deadline; or (ii) the Corporation advises the Underwriter or announces to the public that it 
does not intend to proceed with the Listing (the earliest of such events being referred to as the 
"Termination Date"), each Subscription Receipt shall be cancelled (and be void and of no further 
force or effect) and, the Escrow Agent will return to holders of Subscription Receipts, an amount 
equal to $0.072 per Subscription Receipt and each holder’s pro rata portion of the interest that has 
accrued on the Escrowed Funds as provided for and in accordance with the Subscription Receipt 
Indenture (as defined herein).
Subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  hereof,  the  Underwriters  agree  to  act  as,  and  the 
Corporation appoints the Underwriter as, the sole and exclusive agent of the Corporation to offer the 
Subscription Receipts for sale on the Closing Date in the Selling Jurisdictions (as defined herein) on 
a private placement basis at a price of $0.072 per Subscription Receipt.  In the event that less than all 
of the Subscription Receipts are sold by the Underwriter as agent prior to the Closing Time (as 
defined  herein),  the  Underwriter  hereby  agrees  to  purchase  from  the  Corporation  and  the 
Corporation hereby agrees to issue and sell to the Underwriter at the Closing Time, the remaining 
balance of Subscription Receipts not sold to purchasers, subject to any arrangements for substituted 
purchasers that may be made by the Underwriter.
The Corporation hereby grants to the Underwriter an option (the "Underwriter’s Option") 
to purchase from the Corporation, at the Underwriter’s election, up to an additional 41,667,000 
Subscription Receipts (the "Underwriter’s Option Subscription Receipts").  The Underwriter may 
exercise the Underwriter’s Option, in whole or in part, at any time up to 48 hours prior to the Closing 
Time  by  written  notice  from  the  Underwriter  to  the  Corporation  setting  forth  the  number  of 
Underwriter’s  Option  Subscription  Receipts  to  be  purchased.    If  and  to  the  extent  that  the 
Underwriter’s Option is exercised, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, except to the extent 
that Underwriter’s Option Subscription Receipts have been sold by the Underwriter as agent, the 
Underwriter also agrees to purchase from the Corporation the number of Underwriter’s Option 
Subscription Receipts as to which the Underwriter’s Option has been exercised and the Corporation 
agrees  to  issue  and  sell  such  number  of  Underwriter’s  Option  Subscription  Receipts  to  the 
Underwriter at the purchase price of $0.072 per Underwriter’s Option Subscription Receipt.
Based upon the understanding of the Underwriter set out above and upon the terms and 
subject to the conditions contained hereinafter, the Subscription Receipts will be issued and sold 
pursuant  to  exemptions  under  Applicable  Securities  Laws  (as  defined  herein)  in  the  Selling 
Jurisdictions  and  the  Underwriter  hereby  agree  to  purchase  or  to  find  substituted  purchasers 
(“Substituted Purchasers”) in such Selling Jurisdictions to purchase the Subscription Receipts, by 
way of private placement.  The Corporation and the Underwriter hereby acknowledge that the 
Subscription Receipts have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act (as 
defined herein) or any U.S. state securities laws. The Underwriter, acting through their U.S. Affiliate
1777574v13
- 3 -
(as defined herein), may offer and sell the Subscription Receipts in the United States (as hereinafter 
defined) to Accredited Investors (as defined herein) in accordance with Rule 506 of Regulation D (as 
defined herein) and although this Agreement is presented on behalf of the Underwriter as purchasers 
of the Subscription Receipts, all Subscription Receipts issued and sold in the United States shall be 
sold  directly  to  such  U.S.  Purchasers  (as  defined  herein)  as  Substituted  Purchasers  by  the 
Corporation.  To the extent that Accredited Investors purchase Subscription Receipts as Substituted 
Purchasers  on  the  Closing  Date  in  accordance  with  Rule  506  of  Regulation  D  under  the  U.S. 
Securities Act, the obligation of the Underwriter to purchase the Subscription Receipts from the 
Corporation shall be reduced by the number of Subscription Receipts purchased by the Substituted 
Purchasers; provided, however, that the fee payable to the Underwriter pursuant to this Agreement 
shall be payable in respect of any purchases of Subscription Receipts made in accordance with Rule 
506 of Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act by Substituted Purchasers. For purchases other 
than  those  made  by  Accredited  Investors,  the  obligation  of  the  Underwriter  to  purchase  the 
Subscription Receipts from the Corporation shall be reduced by the number of Subscription Receipts 
purchased by such Substituted Purchasers.  Accordingly, the Corporation and the Underwriter 
hereby agree that all offers and sales of the Subscription Receipts in the United States or to, or for 
the account or benefit of, a U.S. Person (as defined herein) shall be conducted only in the manner 
specified in Schedule A hereto, which terms and conditions are hereby incorporated by reference in 
and form a part of this Agreement.
In connection with the offering and sale of the Subscription Receipts, the Underwriter shall 
be entitled to retain as sub-agents other registered securities dealers and may receive (for delivery to 
the Corporation at the Closing Time) subscriptions for Subscription Receipts from other registered 
securities dealers.  The fee payable to such sub-agents shall be for the account of the Underwriter 
and shall not exceed the fee payable to the Underwriter hereunder. The Underwriter shall, however, 
be under no obligation to engage any sub-agent.
In  consideration  for  its  services  hereunder  and  advising  on  the  terms,  conditions  and 
structuring of the Offering, the Underwriter shall be entitled to the fee provided for in Section 10, 
which fee shall be payable as described therein.  For greater certainty, the services provided by the 
Underwriter pursuant to this Agreement will not be subject to the Goods and Services Tax ("GST") 
provided for in the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and taxable supplies will be incidental to the exempt 
financial services provided.

The Corporation (the "Indemnitor") hereby agrees to indemnify and save harmless the

any time hereafter are suffered or incurred by reason of any event, act or omission in any way caused 
by, or arising directly or indirectly from or in consequence of:
(a)
any  information  or  statement  contained  in  the  Public  Record  (other  than  any 
information or statement relating solely to the Underwriter and furnished to the 
Corporation by the Underwriter expressly for inclusion in the Public Record), or 
contained in any of the Transaction Agreements or any certificate or other document 
delivered by or on behalf of the Corporation to the Underwriter hereunder which is or 
is  alleged  to  be  untrue  or  any  omission  or  alleged  omission  to  provide  any
1777574v13
- 41 -
information or state any fact the omission of which makes, or is alleged to make, any 
such information or statement untrue or misleading in light of the circumstances in 
which it was made;
any  misrepresentation  or  alleged  misrepresentation  (except  a  misrepresentation 
which is based upon information relating to the Underwriter and furnished to the 
Corporation  by  the  Underwriter  expressly  for  inclusion  in  the  Public  Record) 
contained in the Public Record;
any prohibition or restriction of trading in the securities of the Corporation or any 
prohibition  or  restriction  affecting  the  distribution  of  the  Subscription  Receipts 
imposed by any competent authority if such prohibition or restriction is based on any 
misrepresentation  or  alleged  misrepresentation  of  a  kind  referred 
in 
to 
subparagraph 17(b) or prohibits or restricts the completion of the Acquisition;
any order made or any inquiry, investigation (whether formal or informal) or other 
proceeding commenced or threatened by any one or more competent authorities (not

or selling group members, if any) relating to any of the transactions contemplated in 
the Transaction Agreements or materially affecting the trading or distribution of the 
Subscription Receipts or the Underlying Securities; or
any  breach  of,  default  under  or  non-compliance  by  the  Corporation  with  any

Agreements, or any document delivered pursuant thereto or any requirement of 
Applicable Securities Laws.
(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnity of this Section 17 shall not apply in respect of 
any particular Indemnified Party, in the event that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final 
judgment  that  has  become  non-appealable  shall  determine  that  such  Liabilities  to  which  that 
particular Indemnified Party may be subject were primarily caused by the gross negligence, fraud or 
wilful misconduct of that particular Indemnified Party (provided that if such Liabilities were caused 
only in part by such gross negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct, the indemnity shall apply only in 
respect of the proportion of such Liabilities which were not so caused).  With respect to this Section 
17, the Indemnitor acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriter is contracting on its own behalf 
and as agent for the other Indemnified Parties in accordance with Section 22.
Section 18  Notice of Indemnity Claim
If any Proceeding is brought, instituted or threatened in respect of any Indemnified Party 
which may result in a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall 
promptly after receiving notice thereof notify the Corporation of the nature of such claim and the 
Indemnitor shall be entitled (but not required) to assume conduct of the defence thereof and retain 
counsel on behalf of the Indemnified Party who is satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, acting 
reasonably, to represent the Indemnified Party in such Proceeding and the Indemnitor shall pay the 
reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel and all other expenses of the Indemnified Party 
relating to such Proceeding as incurred.  Failure to so notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve the
1777574v13
- 42 -
Indemnitor from liability except and only to the extent that the failure materially prejudices the 
Indemnitor.    If  the  Indemnitor  assumes  conduct  of  the  defence  for  an  Indemnified  Party,  the 
Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate in the defence including without limitation the provision of 
documents, appropriate officers and employees to give witness statements, attend examinations for 
discovery,  make  affidavits,  meet  with  counsel,  testify  and  divulge  all  information  reasonably 
required to defend or prosecute the Proceedings.
In any such Proceeding the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel
and to participate in the defence thereof if:
(a)
(b)
(c)
the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that there may be a 
reasonable legal defence available to the Indemnified Party that is different from or 
in addition to those available to the Indemnitor, or that a conflict of interest exists 
which makes representation by counsel chosen by the Indemnitor not advisable (in 
which case the Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume the defence of such 
proceedings on behalf of the Indemnified Person);
the  Indemnitor  shall  not  have  undertaken  the  defence  of  such  proceedings,  or 
indicated its intent to do so, and employed counsel within ten days after notice of 
commencement of such proceedings; or
the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Indemnitor in connection 
with the defence of such proceeding,
in which event the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel (on a solicitor and his client 
basis) shall be paid by the Indemnitor.  It being understood, however, that the Indemnitor, shall not, 
in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the 
same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the 
reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate law firm (in addition to any local counsel) in 
each jurisdiction for all such Indemnified Parties.
Section 19  Admission of Liability
No  admission  of  liability  and  no  settlement  of  any  Proceeding  shall  be  made  by  the 
Indemnitor without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Parties affected, such consent not to 
be unreasonably withheld.  No admission of liability and no settlement of any Proceeding shall be 
made by an Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor and the other 
Indemnified Parties affected, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld and the Indemnitor shall 
not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding made without the Indemnitor’s consent.
Section 20  Contribution
In  order  to  provide  for  just  and  equitable  contribution  in  circumstances  in  which  the 
indemnification provided for in this Agreement is due in accordance with its terms but is (in whole 
or in part), for any reason, held by a court to be unavailable from the Corporation, on grounds of 
policy  or  otherwise,  the  Corporation,  and  the  party  or  parties  seeking  indemnification  shall 
contribute to the aggregate Liabilities (or Proceedings in respect thereof) to which they may be 
subject or which they may suffer or incur:
1777574v13
- 43 -
(a)
(b)
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefit received by the 
Indemnitor on the one hand and by the Underwriter on the other hand from the 
offering of the Subscription Receipts; or
if the allocation provided by subsection (a) above is not permitted by applicable law, 
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to 
in subsection (a) above but also to reflect the relative fault of the party or parties 
seeking indemnity, on the one hand, and the parties from whom indemnity is sought, 
on the other hand, in connection with the statement, omission, misrepresentation or 
alleged misrepresentation, order, inquiry, investigation or other matter or thing which 
resulted in such liabilities, claims, demands, losses, costs, damages or expenses, as 
well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
However, no party who has engaged in any fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or gross 
negligence shall be entitled to claim contribution from any person who has not engaged in such 
fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or gross negligence.
The relative benefits received by the Indemnitor, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on 
the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion that the total proceeds of the Offering 
received by the Indemnitor (net of fees but before deducting expenses) bear to the fees received by

Indemnitor or the Underwriter and the parties’ relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and

investigation or other matter referred to in Section 17 hereof.
