international humanitarian law and of the human rights of the Palestinian people therein and

Donors&#8217; Conference for the Palestinian State, aimed at invigorating the peace process and 
establishing a viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State by the end 
of 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that the recent Israeli attacks and incursions in the occupied Gaza Strip

</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses</i> its shock at the Israeli bombardment of Palestinian homes and the killing

the perpetrators to justice; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> the immediate cessation of all Israeli military attacks throughout the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory and the firing of crude rockets, which resulted in the loss of two 
civilian lives and some injuries in southern Israel; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also calls for</i> urgent international action to put an immediate end to the grave 
violations committed by the occupying Power, Israel, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including the series of incessant and repeated Israeli military attacks and incursions therein and 
the siege of the occupied Gaza Strip;

Palestinian Territory in compliance with international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law;

</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that transparent, responsible, accountable and participatory government, 
responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, including women and members of 
vulnerable and marginalized groups, is the foundation on which good governance rests and that 
such a foundation is an indispensable condition for the full realization of human rights, including 
the right to development,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that democracies have embedded institutional advantages incontestably 
favourable to sustainable development, and that when based on the respect for human rights,

necessary checks and balances on Government power,

the erosion of public trust in government, as well as through the impairment of the ability of 
Governments to fulfil their human rights obligations, particularly the economic and social rights 
of the most vulnerable and marginalized,

from Enforced Disappearances, no State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced 
disappearances; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) All acts of enforced or involuntary disappearance are crimes punishable by 
appropriate penalties, which should take due account of their extreme seriousness under criminal 
law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) They should ensure that their competent authorities proceed immediately to conduct 
impartial inquiries in all circumstances where there is reason to believe that an enforced 
disappearance has occurred in territory under their jurisdiction; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) If there is reason to believe that an enforced disappearance has occurred in territory 
under their jurisdiction, all the perpetrators of that disappearance must be brought to justice; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Impunity is simultaneously one of the underlying causes of enforced disappearances 
and a major obstacle to the elucidation of such cases; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) As proclaimed in article 11 of the Declaration, all persons deprived of liberty must be 
released in a manner permitting reliable verification that they have actually been released and, 
further, have been released in conditions in which their physical integrity and ability fully to 
exercise their rights are assured;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Its thanks to the many Governments that have cooperated with the Working Group 
and replied to its requests for information and to the Governments that have accepted visits of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Working Group to their countries, requesting them to give all necessary attention to the 
Working Group&#8217;s recommendations and inviting them to inform the Working Group of any 
action they take on those recommendations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Its appreciation to the Governments that are investigating, cooperating at the 
international and bilateral levels, and have developed or are developing appropriate mechanisms 
to investigate any claims of enforced disappearance that are brought to their attention, and 
encourages all Governments concerned to expand their efforts in this area; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> States to take legislative, administrative, legal and other steps, including when 
a state of emergency has been declared, at the national and regional levels and in cooperation 
with the United Nations, if appropriate through technical assistance, and to provide the Working 
Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in 
preventing enforced and involuntary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set 
forth in the Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Takes note</i> of the assistance provided to the Working Group by non-governmental 
organizations and their activities in support of the implementation of the Declaration, and invites 
those organizations to continue their cooperation; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to continue: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To ensure that the Working Group receives all the assistance and resources it 
requires to perform its functions, including supporting the principles of the Declaration, 
carrying out and following up on missions and holding sessions in countries that are prepared to 
receive it; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To provide the resources needed to update the database on cases of enforced 
disappearance; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To keep the Working Group and the Council regularly informed of the steps taken 
for the wide dissemination and promotion of the Declaration; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic 
environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will 
enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the 
World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political 
or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation 
and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in 
accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food 
security, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced </i>that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities 
to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome 
Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the 
same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to 
global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and 
economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have global dimensions and 
that there has been virtually no progress made on reducing hunger and that it could increase 
dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, given the 
anticipated increase in the world&#8217;s population and the stress on natural resources,<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are 
exacerbating destitution and desperation, causing a negative impact on the realization of the right 
to food, in particular in developing countries,

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its deep concern </i>at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests 
and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and 
livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing 
countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official development 
assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development 
assistance, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the theme &#8220;The right to food&#8221;, chosen by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations to mark World Food Day on 16 October 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the Final Declaration adopted at the International Conference on Agrarian 
Reform and Rural Development of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
in P&#244;rto Alegre, Brazil, on 10 March 2006,<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and 
therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international 
levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms </i>the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, 
consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from 
hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Considers it intolerable </i>that more than 6 million children still die every year from 
hunger-related illness before their fifth birthday and that there are about 854 million 
undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the 
absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years when, according 
to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce 
enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world&#8217;s present population;

(C 2006/REP), appendix G. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that women and girls are disproportionately affected by 
hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, 
that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable 
childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from 
malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages </i>all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination 
against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, 
including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that 
women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water, to enable them to feed 
themselves and their families; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue mainstreaming a 
gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms 
addressing the right to food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their 
relevant policies, programmes and activities; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms </i>the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are 
inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>all States to take steps with a view to achieving progressively the full 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free 
from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food, and to create and adopt 
national plans to combat hunger, and recognizes in this regard the great efforts and positive 
developments with respect to the right to food in some developing countries and regions, 
including those highlighted in the report of the Special Rapporteur;<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Stresses </i>that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural 
development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing

 <p> 
</p>
<p>countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-scale irrigation 
and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recognizes </i>that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are 
small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, 
given the increasing cost of inputs, and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds 
and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; and that support by 
States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is an element key to food 
security and provision of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national 
efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and 
through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, 
and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat 
Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, 
particularly in Africa;<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also stresses </i>its commitments to promote and protect, without discrimination, the 
economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples, in accordance with international 
human rights obligations and taking into account, as appropriate, the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,<b>12</b> and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations 
and representatives of indigenous communities have expressed in different forums their deep 
concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, 
and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately 
high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous 
discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests </i>all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within 
their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization 
of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields;

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Recognizes </i>the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international 
assistance, upon request and in cooperation with affected countries, towards a better realization 
and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms 
for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or natural or man-made 
disasters affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Stresses </i>the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and 
utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for 
developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security 
policies; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Recognizes </i>the need for a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round 
negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a contribution to creating international 
conditions that permit the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Stresses </i>that all States should make every effort to ensure that their international 
policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade agreements, do not have 
a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Recalls </i>the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and 
Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of 
financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Recognizes </i>that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the 
number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and invites once again all 
international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations 
agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of 
halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as 
set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security<b>5</b> and the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration;<b>3</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Reaffirms </i>that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people 
at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and 
food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread 
of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Urges </i>States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and 
expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in 
particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as 
natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the 
achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary 
responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this 
regard; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Calls upon </i>Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant 
stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently 
occurring across Africa and expresses its deep concern that funding shortfalls are forcing the 
World Food Programme to cut operations across different regions, including Southern Africa; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Invites </i>all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the 
right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common 
projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and 
to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution of the 
private sector to the realization of the right to food, including the importance of ensuring 
sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 26. <i>Recognizes</i> the negative impact of massive rises in prices of food on the realization 
of the right to food, particularly on people in developing countries with a high level of 
dependence on food imports for the fulfilment of nutritional national requirements; 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Takes note </i>of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food,<b>13</b> and of his 
valuable work in the promotion of the right to food in all parts of the world and expresses its 
appreciation for the work and commitment of the first mandate-holder to achieving the 
realization of the right to food;

activities taking into account the important achievements in the fulfilment of the mandate in 
recent years;

period of three years by the Council in its resolution 6/2 of 27 September 2007;

Human Rights to provide all the necessary human and financial resources for the effective 
fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 31. <i>Welcomes </i>the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its general comment 
No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights),<b>14</b> in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the 
right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and is 
indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill of 
Human Rights, and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate 
economic, environmental and social policies, at both the national and the international levels, 
oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all;

of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture in the realization 
of the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 33. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the 
Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,<b>7</b> represent a 
practical tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, contribute to the achievement 
of food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the attainment of internationally 
agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration;

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the valuable contribution of all religions to modern civilization and the 
contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make to an improved awareness and 
understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the Declaration adopted by the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers at its 
thirty-fourth session in Islamabad, in May 2007, which condemned the growing trend of 
Islamophobia and systematic discrimination against the adherents of Islam and emphasized the 
need to take effective measures to combat defamation of religions,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Noting also </i>the final communiqu&#233; adopted by the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
at its eleventh summit, in Dakar, in March 2008, in which the Organization expressed concern at 
the systematically negative stereotyping of Muslims and Islam and other divine religions, and 
denounced the overall rise in intolerance and discrimination against Muslim minorities, which 
constitute an affront to human dignity and run counter to the international human rights 
instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the joint statement of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the 
European Union and the Secretary-General of 7 February 2006, in which they recognized the 
need, in all societies, to show sensitivity and responsibility in treating issues of special 
significance for the adherents of any particular faith, even by those who do not share the belief 
in question, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the call made by the President of the General Assembly in his statement 
of 15 March 2006 that, in the wake of existing mistrust and tensions, there is a need for dialogue 
and understanding among civilizations, cultures and religions to commit to working together to 
prevent provocative or regrettable incidents and to develop better ways of promoting tolerance, 
respect for and freedom of religion and belief, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>all international and regional initiatives to promote cross-cultural and interfaith 
harmony, including the Alliance of Civilizations and the International Dialogue on Interfaith 
Cooperation and their valuable efforts towards the promotion of a culture of peace and dialogue 
at all levels, </p>

</p>
<p><i> Welcoming also </i>the report by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on the situation of Muslims and Arabs 
in various parts of the world,<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming further </i>the reports of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the Council at its 
fourth and sixth sessions,<b>3</b> in which he draws the attention of Member States to the serious nature 
of the defamation of all religions and to the promotion of the fight against these phenomena by 
strengthening the role of interreligious and intercultural dialogue and promoting reciprocal 
understanding and joint action to meet the fundamental challenges of development, peace and 
the protection and promotion of human rights, as well as the need to complement legal strategies, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating </i>the call made by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to Member States to wage a systematic 
campaign against incitement to racial and religious hatred by maintaining a careful balance 
between the defence of secularism and respect for freedom of religion and by acknowledging 
and respecting the complementarity of all the freedoms embodied in the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights,<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that States, non-governmental organizations, religious bodies and the media 
have an important role to play in promoting tolerance and freedom of religion and belief through 
education, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with concern </i>that defamation of religions is among the causes of social disharmony 
and instability, at the national and international levels, and leads to violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with deep concern </i>the increasing trend in recent years of statements attacking 
religions, including Islam and Muslims, in human rights forums,

manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also expresses deep concern </i>at attempts to identify Islam with terrorism, violence 
and human rights violations and emphasizes that equating any religion with terrorism should be 
rejected and combated by all at all levels; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further expresses deep concern </i>at the intensification of the campaign of defamation 
of religions and the ethnic and religious profiling of Muslim minorities in the aftermath of the 
tragic events of 11 September 2001; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> at the recent serious instances of deliberate stereotyping 
of religions, their adherents and sacred persons in the media and by political parties and groups 
in some societies, and at the associated provocation and political exploitation; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes </i>that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, defamation of religions 
becomes an aggravating factor that contributes to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms 
of target groups and their economic and social exclusion; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Expresses concern </i>at laws or administrative measures that have been specifically 
designed to control and monitor Muslim minorities, thereby stigmatizing them and legitimizing 
the discrimination that they experience; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Strongly deplores </i>physical attacks and assaults on businesses, cultural centres and 
places of worship of all religions and targeting of religious symbols; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges </i>States to take actions to prohibit the dissemination, including through political 
institutions and organizations, of racist and xenophobic ideas and material aimed at any religion 
or its followers that constitute incitement to racial and religious hatred, hostility or violence; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also urges </i>States to provide, within their respective legal and constitutional systems, 
adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination, intimidation and coercion resulting 
from the defamation of any religion, to take all possible measures to promote tolerance and  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>respect for all religions and their value systems and to complement legal systems with 
intellectual and moral strategies to combat religious hatred and intolerance; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Emphasizes</i> that respect of religions and their protection from contempt is an 
essential element conducive for the exercise by all of the right to freedom of thought, conscience 
and religion; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges </i>all States to ensure that all public officials, including members of law 
enforcement bodies, the military, civil servants and educators, in the course of their official 
duties, respect all religions and beliefs and do not discriminate against persons on the grounds 
of their religion or belief, and that all necessary and appropriate education or training is 
provided; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes </i>that, as stipulated in international human rights law, everyone has the 
right to freedom of expression, and that the exercise of this right carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities, and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but only those provided by 
law and necessary for the respect of the rights or reputations of others, or for the protection of 
national security or of public order, or of public health or morals; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Reaffirms </i>that general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee stipulates that the prohibition of the 
dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the 
freedom of opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the question of incitement to 
religious hatred; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Deplores </i>the use of printed, audio-visual and electronic media, including the 
Internet, and of any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia or related intolerance and 
discrimination towards Islam or any religion; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Invites </i>the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to continue to report on all manifestations of 
defamation of religions, and in particular on the serious implications of Islamophobia, on the 
enjoyment of all rights to the Council at its ninth session; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on the implementation 
of the present resolution and to submit a study compiling relevant existing legislations and 
jurisprudence concerning defamation of and contempt for religions to the Council at its 
ninth session.
