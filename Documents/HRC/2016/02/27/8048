<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fourteenth session from 
22 October to 5 November 2012. The review of the Republic of Korea was held at the 8th 
meeting on 25 October 2012. The delegation of the Republic of Korea was headed by Ghil 
Tae-Ki, Vice Minister, Ministry of Justice. At its 13th meeting, held on 31 October 2012, 
the Working Group adopted the report on the Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Republic of Korea: Djibouti, Hungary and 
Indonesia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of the 
Republic of Korea: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with

</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/14/KOR/3 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, 
Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland was transmitted to the Republic of Korea through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Republic of Korea had achieved both development and democratization within a 
50-year period and continued its efforts to promote and protect the full scope of human 
rights. It had also given attention to better promoting the human rights of minorities and 
vulnerable members of society so as to ensure that every member of society equally 
enjoyed universal human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation referred to the process of preparing the national report, including 
consultations with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and relevant non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). 
</p>
<p>7. The results of the first UPR review were reported to the National Human Rights 
Policy Council (NHRPC) in 2008. Since 2010, annual examinations of the implementation 
of the recommendations from the first review had been carried out, primarily through the 
Ministry of Justice, and were reported to the NHRPC. The Government planned to further 
develop the system of follow-up after the second UPR cycle. 
</p>
<p>8. The NHRPC was responsible for drafting the National Plan of Action for the 
Protection and Promotion of Human Rights. The second such plan was launched in March 
2012 and included 209 projects under the 24 ministries and agencies relating to the </p>


<p>protection and promotion of human rights. During the drafting of the plan, the Government 
reviewed the NHRC recommendations as well as those of international human rights 
mechanisms and opinions of civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>9. Regarding efforts to implement its human rights obligations, the Government had 
ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and had 
withdrawn its reservation to article 9, paragraph 3, of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (CRC) and to article 7 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. 
</p>
<p>10. The Republic of Korea had submitted its reports in accordance with the seven core 
human rights treaties ratified and had diligently responded to individual communications. 
</p>
<p>11. The 2012 Refugee Act would enter into force in July 2013. The Act was expected to 
put in place a fair and effective process of refugee recognition and improved refugee 
protection measures. A centre for refugee support was currently under construction and 
support for asylum seekers and refugees would be further strengthened. 
</p>
<p>12. Concerning anti-discrimination measures, there were about 90 individual pieces of 
legislation. Aside from those laws and in response to national and international requests, the 
Government had continued to examine and review the need for the enactment of a 
comprehensive anti-discrimination act. 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding the right to security of the person, the Habeas Corpus Act had been in 
force since June 2008. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation referred to notable changes in the family structure. The Government 
was making efforts to establish policies for ensuring that marriage immigrants adjust well 
to society in the Republic of Korea and that the children of those families receive all due 
protection and respect. In 2011 the revised Multicultural Family Support Act had reinforced 
efforts concerning medical and health care as well as education support for marriage 
immigrants who suffered from domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>15. The delegation referred to increased demands and challenges regarding the 
protection of individual privacy. Through the enactment of the Personal Information 
Protection Act and the establishment of the Personal Information Protection Commission, 
rules had been set for the protection of personal information in both the public and private 
spheres and standards had been set for the handling of personal information. Moreover, the 
Government had reinforced corrective measures for damages caused by privacy rights 
violations. To prevent abuse of the resident registration system, the collection and usage of 
resident registration numbers had been limited and provision of alternative measures for 
personal verification had been made mandatory. Efforts were being made to have public 
documents record the date of birth instead of resident registration numbers. 
</p>
<p>16. Freedom of expression had been expanded through the amendment of the Public 
Official Election Act allowing the use of telecommunication networks in election 
campaigns. 
</p>
<p>17. In the midst of increasing labour market flexibility, the Republic of Korea had 
initiated and implemented comprehensive measures to protect non-regular workers from 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>18. For low-wage workers the Government had subsidized both the individual 
employment insurance and the national pension premium. The scope of applicability for 
employment insurance had been expanded to include the self-employed. 
</p>
<p>19. The right to form a trade union was better protected through the introduction of 
multiple trade unions in a workplace. </p>


<p>20. The supply of rental housing for those in the lower income bracket had been 
reinforced. Improvements to the programme for residential environment development had 
been promoted to guarantee the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>21. There had been a gradual expansion of the protection of social security, with the 
recent revision of the National Basic Livelihood Security System to accommodate the 
minimum cost of living and the lowering of eligibility conditions for benefits to allow more 
people in vulnerable groups to receive benefits. 
</p>
<p>22. The coverage of the universal national medical health insurance had been steadily 
expanded. For some patients, such as those with rare and incurable diseases, the co-pay rate 
had been reduced. The Republic of Korea was making continuous efforts to provide 
medical services to as many people as possible by reducing the burden on patients for the 
cost of medical care needed in cases of rare and incurable diseases and by providing 
medical support for foreigners and their families. 
</p>
<p>23. With the rapidly aging population in mind, the Government had introduced long-
term care insurance systems in 2008 in order to relieve the burdens on families caring for 
the elderly, and had also taken measures for patients with dementia. 
</p>
<p>24. The Government had established and promoted the Framework Policy on 
Immigration<b>,</b> which would be evaluated every five years, to facilitate more comprehensive 
migrant policies. The second plan, to be initiated in 2013, was aimed at expanding 
comprehensive services for immigrants to assist with their adjustment in society and to 
support education for migrant children. 
</p>
<p>25. Foreign workers who entered the country through the Employment Permit System 
were afforded the same protections as citizens under various labour-related laws. Many 
services were provided to migrant workers, such as interpretation, counseling and medical 
services. Female migrant workers were guaranteed equal access to the maternity protection 
system in accordance with labour standards. In cases where women migrants were involved 
in the process of legal proceedings for human rights violations, even if the person was an 
illegal resident, deportation would be delayed and a special stay permitted. 
</p>
<p>26. The Republic of Korea was proud that it had become a model case, as it had 
transformed from aid beneficiary to aid donor, and was committed to increasing its official 
development aid volumes. In 2010, the Framework Act on International Development 
Cooperation had been enacted and the Government intended to consider human rights 
principles in the planning and carrying out of development projects. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the interactive dialogue, 65 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>28. Botswana commended the Republic of Korea for developments since its first review 
and referred to the withdrawal of reservations under article 9 of CRC and the development 
of policies in favour of persons with disabilities. It noted concerns raised by the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child over multiple forms of discrimination against children. Botswana 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Brazil noted the accession by the Republic of Korea to CRPD and the enactment of 
legislation and policies to support persons with disabilities. Brazil raised concerns over 
reports of social stigma and hardship faced by single mothers, which may lead mothers to 
relinquish their children. It hoped that the enactment of the 2011 Special Adoption Act 
would improve that situation. Brazil made recommendations. </p>


<p>30. Bulgaria noted substantive developments in the normative and institutional 
framework and the launching of the second National Plan of Action for the Protection and 
Promotion of Human Rights. It noted the expansion of the scope of investigation of the 
NHRC in March 2012 and underlined the importance of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (OP-CAT). Bulgaria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Cambodia commended the Republic of Korea on its achievements and welcomed the 
launching of the second National Plan of Action for the Protection and Promotion of 
Human Rights (2012-2016). It recognized efforts to address all remaining human rights 
challenges, including human trafficking, rights of migrant workers, especially women, and 
further consideration of the ratification of international instruments. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>32. Canada requested an update on steps taken with regard to the emphasis on women 
and children in policies regarding the rights of migrant workers, and on the provision of 
training for law enforcement personnel. Canada positively noted court rulings recognizing 
marital rape and expressed concern over reports of police taking domestic violence cases 
lightly. It raised concerns about HIV and drug testing for E2 visa non-citizens. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Chad noted that the Republic of Korea had accepted the majority of the 
recommendations made in 2008 and that it was party to many international human rights 
instruments. It welcomed the measures adopted in 2009 for follow-up to the UPR. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>34. Chile valued the efforts made by the Republic of Korea to implement the UPR 
recommendations from 2008. It commended the Republic of Korea for its high standard of 
education. Chile asked about measures taken to address the highly competitive conditions 
prevalent in the education system, as raised by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. 
Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. China welcomed the national plan of action for human rights (2012-2016). It 
appreciated efforts to protect personal information and privacy, to provide equal access to 
education and to guarantee the rights of the elderly and persons with disabilities. It raised 
concerns about serious gender inequality, discrimination against women, widespread 
corporal punishment and abuse of children, rampant human trafficking, unprotected rights 
of non-regular workers, and access to health care for poor persons. China made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Costa Rica appreciated the information on the implementation of the 
recommendations from its first review under the universal periodic mechanism. It 
expressed concern at the discrimination of children of single women; the lack of 
criminalization of marital rape; domestic violence; and the unequal division of assets in 
divorce cases. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Cuba welcomed plans for an anti-discrimination law and asked whether the 
delegation could provide more information in that regard. It encouraged the Republic of 
Korea to continue exploring avenues to overcome challenges identified for the ratification 
of international instruments and the withdrawal of reservations, as well as with regard to the 
National Security Act. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Cyprus commended the Republic of Korea for its commitment to human rights and 
noted that it was a party to most core human rights instruments. It welcomed efforts made 
to promote women&#8217;s rights, such as the enactment of the 2011 Gender Impact Assessment 
and Analysis Act. Cyprus asked about measures foreseen to facilitate the social insurance 
enrolment of female non-regular workers and to guarantee such workers maternity leave. </p>


<p>39. The Czech Republic expressed appreciation for the participation of the Republic of 
Korea in the UPR process. It asked the Republic of Korea to elaborate more on the reasons 
for the slow progress in adopting a national anti-discrimination act. It welcomed the interest 
of the Republic of Korea in acceding to OP-CAT. The Czech Republic made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea expressed grave concern over the 
National Security Act and the Security Surveillance Act. It noted that that the National 
Security Act was the main source of systematic human rights violations. Many violations of 
rights, including freedom of expression and assembly had been committed in accordance 
with the Act, in particular article 7. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. France welcomed the death penalty moratorium and commented on the 
establishment of an alternative to military service for conscientious objectors and efforts to 
promote freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. It asked what concrete 
measures had been taken to protect migrant workers. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Germany commended the active role of the Republic of Korea in implementing 
recommendations from the first UPR. It expressed its regret that the Republic of Korea had 
not yet abolished the death penalty and expressed concern over the long sentences of 
conscientious objectors and the situation of single mothers and their children. Germany 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Honduras highlighted the launching of the second National Plan of Action for the 
Protection and Promotion of Human Rights (2012-2016) and the incorporation in the Plan 
of the recommendations made by international human rights bodies and from the UPR 
mechanism. It also referred to important progress made in the protection of children&#8217;s 
rights. Honduras made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Hungary noted steps taken to achieve gender equality and the protection of women. 
It requested information on measures to protect pregnant employees as well as to counter 
discrimination against single mothers. Hungary encouraged the Republic of Korea to 
continue efforts to protect children from violence and abuse, and to introduce alternative 
service for conscientious objectors before the next UPR cycle. Hungary made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. India welcomed the withdrawal of the reservation to article 9, paragraph 3, of CRC 
and the adoption of the Social Services Act and the Gender Impact Assessment and 
Analysis Act. It expressed its hope that adequate monitoring mechanisms would be 
established to implement the legislation. India expressed concern over the delayed anti-
discrimination bill. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>46. Indonesia commended the expanded investigatory mandate of the NHRC. It noted 
the formulation of the second Framework Policy on Immigration (2013-2017). It 
commended initiatives to eliminate discrimination against women. It welcomed the 
enactment of the Framework Act on International Development Cooperation, the expanded 
development assistance and the enactment of the mid-term policy emphasizing the 
Millennium Development Goals. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern about human rights violations, with 
particular regard to children&#8217;s rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Iraq expressed its appreciation for measures taken to promote and protect human 
rights through the adoption of a national plan. It welcomed the act for the prevention of 
suicide and the promotion of a culture of respect for life. Iraq made recommendations </p>


<p>49. Ireland noted the absence of a universal birth registration system in the Republic of 
Korea, which may give rise to children being secretly adopted between their birth and 
registration. It noted the results of a 2010 survey, which estimated that there might be as 
many as 17,000 undocumented migrant children who were unable to gain access to medical 
care and other services. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Italy acknowledged efforts to protect human rights. It commended the de facto death 
penalty moratorium. It raised concerns over reports of an inadequate universal birth 
registration system, and of serious domestic violence problems. It noted measures to raise 
awareness of the criminal nature of domestic violence and to prohibit corporal punishment 
in schools, and requested further information. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Japan welcomed the amendment of the Child Welfare Act, the introduction of legal 
provisions to prohibit corporal punishment in schools and amendments to the Act on the 
Protection of Children and Juveniles from Sexual Abuse. Japan pointed out gaps in 
guaranteeing children&#8217;s rights, including issues relating to trafficking in children and 
violence against and sexual exploitation of children. Japan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Responding to questions raised, the delegation stated that the need to establish 
regulations in the Criminal Act regarding the definition of torture as stipulated by the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, other than those already provided for in established laws, would be carefully 
considered. The Government was currently reviewing national laws and systems for 
possible discrepancies between OP-CAT and national laws. With the NHRC already 
carrying out inspections of detention and protection facilities, the prevention effect that was 
intended in OP-CAT had already been achieved to a significant extent. 
</p>
<p>53. The second National Plan of Action for the Protection and Promotion of Human 
Rights included the task of preparing for the enactment of a general anti-discrimination act. 
The Government would fully consider including in it grounds for discrimination, such as 
sexual orientation, and indirect discrimination. 
</p>
<p>54. Given the military confrontation in the Korean Peninsula, the importance of national 
security had been emphasized. The revision or abolition of the National Security Act would 
require public consensus. The Government was strictly interpreting and applying the law to 
prevent the National Security Act from being abused or arbitrarily interpreted. Article 7 of 
the Act did not apply to those who simply praised or supported the claims of an anti-
government organization. Therefore, the law could not be seen as violating the 
fundamentals of academic freedom or freedom of expression. The average number of 
persons detained for violating the National Security Act each year in the last five years 
remained steady at about 20. 
</p>
<p>55. Regarding birth registration and adoption, the law had been changed in 2008 so that 
an adopted child would enjoy the same rights and status as a biological child, and the 
problems in the past of registering a birth rather than an adoption had been corrected to a 
great extent. Legal controls had also been strengthened. Adoptions<b> </b>could take place only 
with a court permit. 
</p>
<p>56. The Government established the Comprehensive Countermeasures for the Protection 
of Women and Children in 2008 in order to counteract sexual violence crimes, as well as 
the Countermeasures for Prevention of Recurrence of Violence against Children and 
Support for Victims in 2009, and the Comprehensive Countermeasures for Prevention of 
Domestic Violence in 2011. Punishment of sexual crimes against the disabled and children 
and juveniles was also strengthened and the statutory limitation would be suspended until a 
minor victim reached the legal age of majority. The Government also continued to provide 
education and conduct public campaigns with a view to raising awareness of the serious 
nature of damages caused by sexual and domestic violence. </p>


<p>57. The National Police Agency established a task force to counter child pornography, 
and strengthened control over the making, dissemination and possession of child 
pornography. 
</p>
<p>58. As the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, CRC and 
CRPD provide for economic, social and cultural rights, and decision criteria for violations 
may vary according to available resources of individual States, ratification of the optional 
protocols required more considered deliberation. 
</p>
<p>59. Ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW) would be carefully examined, 
taking into account the special characteristics of the country&#8217;s labour market and the need 
for social consensus. 
</p>
<p>60. The Government had been undertaking thorough preparations for accession to the 
Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry 
Adoption. For instance, international adoption previously overseen by private adoption 
agencies would be overseen by the Government. The Government would also monitor 
closely the recently launched &#8220;court permit system&#8221;, prior to ratifying the Hague 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>61. Under the Single Parent Family Support Act<i>,</i> support for childcare, education and 
living subsidies were provided. For low-income single mothers there were self-support and 
employment-package programmes with counselling and training to enable the families to 
become financially independent and viable. Moreover, relevant laws and school regulations 
had been amended to help teenage parents stay in school. 
</p>
<p>62. Through the amendment to the Enforcement Decree of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act in 2011, the Government had completely banned all forms of 
corporal punishment. Schools were required to collect the opinions of students, parents and 
teachers to establish and employ their own discipline methods and standards. The Child 
Welfare Act had been amended as of 5 August 2012 to strengthen the ban on corporal 
punishment in child welfare facilities and in homes. 
</p>
<p>63. To reduce the educational gap resulting from differences in income levels and 
regional background, the Government was providing the disadvantaged with systematic and 
comprehensive support in the areas of education, culture and welfare. The Government was 
diversifying the forms of high schools. It was also expanding the Admissions Officer 
System, which evaluated a student&#8217;s aptitudes and skills rather than simply comparing 
exam scores for college admission, with a view to alleviating excessive competition. The 
Government had tightened regulations on the private education market. 
</p>
<p>64. Given the special security situation of the Republic of Korea, the introduction of an 
alternative system for conscientious objectors to military service could be considered when 
positive changes in inter-Korean relations as well as the security landscape occurred, and 
when a national social consensus for accepting such an alternative system existed. The 
Constitutional Court had ruled that the clause in the Military Service Act was 
constitutional. A bill to amend the Military Service Act to introduce alternative military 
service had been proposed, but discarded, in the National Assembly. 
</p>
<p>65. Kuwait appreciated the positive steps taken with regard to the second national 
human rights plan of action. It commended the expansion of competences for the national 
human rights institution and other positive legislative and institutional developments since 
the first review. Kuwait made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Kyrgyzstan welcomed the expanded scope of the NHRC and the withdrawal of 
reservations to human rights instruments. It appreciated the establishment of the crime 
victims&#8217; support fund and the enactment of the Gender Impact Assessment and Analysis </p>


<p>Act. It particularly commended the provision of scholarships for the most disadvantaged 
students. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>67. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic commended the enactment of the 
Framework Act on International Development Cooperation, expanded development 
assistance to promote human rights, and the achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals. It noted the accession by the Republic of Korea to human rights treaties, including 
CRPD, and encouraged continued cooperation with the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>68. Malaysia welcomed measures taken to comply with international human rights 
instruments. It was encouraged by the launching of the second national plan of action on 
human rights and the expanded investigatory scope of the NHRC. Malaysia welcomed the 
promotion by the Republic of Korea of humanitarianism in its official development 
assistance programmes. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Mexico praised the Republic of Korea for its progress in the protection of human 
rights. It further recognized efforts towards the ratification of the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, OP-CAT and ICRMW, and 
hoped that the Republic of Korea would be able to remove the challenges that hindered the 
ratification of those instruments. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Morocco commended progress in implementing recommendations. It welcomed the 
good practices described in the national report. It commended progress in the protection of 
health, social, education and employment rights. It welcomed the 2008 ratification of 
CRPD. It welcomed specific measures for social protection of persons with disabilities. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Nepal commended the revision of the national plan of action on human rights and 
the adoption of measures to monitor its implementation and the UPR follow-up actions at 
the NHRPC. Nepal noted the important enactment of the 2010 Framework Act on 
International Development Cooperation. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. The Netherlands commended the efforts made by the Republic of Korea to integrate 
a human rights perspective in its policies. It hoped that the Republic of Korea would soon 
abolish the death penalty. It noted concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women about disadvantages faced by women in the employment 
sector, and the concerns of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
regarding sexual harassment in the workplace. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Norway remained concerned that the Republic of Korea lacked sufficient measures 
to protect the rights of unwed mothers, of children and of persons affected by the National 
Security Act. Norway remained concerned about the increased use of the National Security 
Act. Norway was encouraged by the de facto moratorium on the death penalty. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. Oman noted that the Republic of Korea had taken up commitments to promote and 
protect human rights on the national and international levels. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Palestine noted measures taken to guarantee the right to education for all children 
and encouraged the Republic of Korea to take additional efforts to review its educational 
policies with a view to alleviating the level of pressure to which children were subjected. It 
noted the continuation of efforts in putting forward an anti-discrimination law. Palestine 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Paraguay recognized important efforts, in particular with regard to the launching of 
the second National Plan of Action for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 
(2012-2016). It also noted progress made with regard to the enactment of the Framework 
Act on International Development Cooperation. Paraguay made a recommendation. </p>


<p>77. The Philippines welcomed the enactment by the Republic of Korea of legislation 
enhancing the promotion, protection and fulfilment of the human rights of its people, the 
ratification of CRPD, and that the Republic of Korea had been a good host to thousands of 
Filipino and other migrant workers. The Philippines encouraged the Republic of Korea to 
enact further laws to protect the as yet unprotected rights of migrant workers. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Poland welcomed the establishment of the national plan of action on human rights 
and of the NHRPC. Poland noted that issues requiring attention in the Republic of Korea 
included protection of women against discrimination and violence. The unresolved issue of 
the right to conscientious objection to military service also attracted the attention of Poland. 
It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. The Republic of Moldova noted with satisfaction the enactment of the Gender 
Impact Assessment and Analysis Act, aimed at ensuring effective gender equality in 
Government policies. It also acknowledged the Government&#8217;s commitment to prevent and 
</p>
<p>prosecute domestic violence and ensure protection of victims of domestic violence. It noted 
with satisfaction the strong commitment to combat human trafficking. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Romania commended progress in protecting refugees and asylum seekers, and 
extensive steps to ensure enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights for all members 
of society. Steps taken so far by the Republic of Korea and its commitments clearly showed 
the political will to ensure protection of human rights. Romania made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>81. Rwanda noted with satisfaction the impressive and significant efforts in 
implementing the recommendations of the previous review. It welcomed the adoption of the 
Framework Act on International Development Cooperation, which recognized the 
promotion of the human rights of women and children, the fulfilment of gender equality 
and the promotion of humanitarianism as fundamental principles of development

</p>
<p>83. Slovakia welcomed the adoption by the Republic of Korea of the second national 
plan of action on human rights and the enactment of the Framework Act on International 
Development Cooperation, aimed at promoting the human rights of women and children, 
fulfilling gender equality and promoting humanitarianism as fundamental principles of its 
official development assistance. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>84. Slovenia<b> </b>welcomed the fact that since the first cycle of the UPR, the Republic of 
Korea had ratified CRPD and had withdrawn one of its reservations to CRC. However, 
several human rights instruments had not been ratified and several reservations remained.<b> 
</b>Slovenia was concerned about reports of discrimination against women and asked whether 
any awareness-raising campaign was planned in that connection. Slovenia made 
recommendations.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>85. South Africa noted progress made, particularly in the promulgation of laws aimed at 
enhancing the practical enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. It asked about 
measures to ensure the early consideration and promulgation of the anti-discrimination act.

achieving gender equality and equity. It also commended the efforts to address work-related 
grievances of migrant workers and the implementation of regulations with respect to their 
rights, through the establishment of a counselling centre and support centres for workers&#8217; 
assistance and advice. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>88. The Sudan appreciated efforts to ensure the right to education and equal 
opportunities in the area of education, including for children with disabilities. It enquired 
about legislative and administrative measures to guarantee education for all, including 
migrants. Sudan highlighted challenges regarding the human rights of vulnerable groups, 
including women migrant workers, who suffered from violence and discrimination. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>89. Switzerland commended the de facto death penalty moratorium, which had been 
established for many years. It would seem that the Republic of Korea had subjected 
legislative provisions on freedom of opinion and of the press to more restrictive 
interpretations since 2008. Switzerland noted deficiencies in the birth registration system. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>90. Thailand commended the establishment, by the Ministry of Gender Equality and 
Family, of Emergency Support Centres for foreign women married to Korean men. 
Additional interpreters would hopefully be provided at those centres. Thailand noted the 
promotion and protection of the welfare of migrant workers, but was concerned by the 
withholding of travel documents and involuntary relocation of migrant workers, who were 
frequently subjected to unfair treatment. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Timor-Leste asked how the Republic of Korea viewed the risk that the policy of 
creating jobs tailored to women would entrench differentiation between women and men, 
instead of promoting employment equality. Noting that two draft anti-discrimination bills 
submitted to the eighteenth National Assembly had expired at the end of its term, Timor-
Leste asked if their processing had been rescheduled. 
</p>
<p>92. Tunisia noted measures to guarantee the right of children to education, including 
those from less favoured backgrounds and disabled children. It also noted initiatives to

encouraged the Republic of Korea to adopt a general anti-discrimination law. It 
commended the adoption of Framework Act on International Development Cooperation. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. Turkey commended the launching of the second National Plan of Action for the 
Protection and Promotion of Human Rights in 2012. It encouraged the human rights efforts 
made by the Republic of Korea through the implementation of the Official Development 
Assistance programme. It drew attention to the endeavours of the Republic of Korea to 
expand the coverage of the national health insurance. Turkey made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>94. The United Kingdom urged the Republic of Korea to ratify OP-CAT and asked if it 
would be willing to set a timeline to that end. It was concerned that the use of the death 
penalty was still permitted. It urged the Republic of Korea to bring the National Security 
Act into line with international standards. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>95. The United States of America noted that the Republic of Korea had emphasized the 
necessity of the National Security Act, but remained concerned that it was vague and, in 
some cases, restricted freedom of expression, including Internet freedom. It was also </p>

conscientious objectors. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>96. Uruguay<b> </b>highlighted the launching of the second National Plan of Action for the 
Protection and Promotion of Human Rights, the withdrawal of some reservations to

procedures of the Human Rights Council. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>97. Viet Nam commended the progress made by the Republic of Korea in ensuring a 
better life for its citizens, and the practical steps taken in strengthening the domestic legal 
system and in improving social welfare. While referring to shared difficulties encountered

of migrant workers to the country&#8217;s economic and social dynamism. It made 
recommendations.

made recommendations. 
</p>

Plan of Action for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights (2012-2016) and the 
enactment of the Habeas Corpus Act and the Refugee Act. Argentina made

<p>100. Australia noted that the death penalty remained applicable and that no formal 
moratorium had been decided. It encouraged the Republic of Korea to reach a social 
consensus for abolition. It noted that there remained a substantial difference between men&#8217;s

legislation protecting homosexual, bisexual and transgender social groups. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>101. Bahrain appreciated efforts to guarantee the right to education for all children, with 
special attention being paid to children of low income families and children with 
disabilities. It wished to receive more information on ways and means to meet the needs of

recognized the noteworthy progress in addressing migrant exploitation. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>103. Belarus<b> </b>noted the broad range of positive developments in the Republic of Korea.

expression. It made recommendations.

<p>105. Uzbekistan noted the efforts by the Republic of Korea to improve the protection of 
women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights and the renewal of its national plan of action for human 
rights. Uzbekistan noted concerns involving racial discrimination, restriction of freedom of 
religion, and human trafficking. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>106. The Republic of Korea stated that it was a de facto abolitionist State. The 
Government would continue to examine carefully the need to abolish the death penalty, 
taking into consideration such factors as public opinion, legal perception and social 
realities, as well as the function of the death penalty in criminal policy. Currently, it was 
difficult to ratify the second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>107. The Ministry of Justice held the annual inter-agency meeting on countermeasures to 
prevent and eliminate human trafficking and was strengthening cooperation and 
information sharing among Government agencies for the effective punishment of human 
trafficking and the understanding of its trends. The Government had put forward a 
amendment to the Criminal Act which contained a comprehensive definition of human 
trafficking. The amendment was currently under consideration by the National Assembly, 
and the ratification process of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol) would be carried out as soon as 
legislative procedures had been completed. 
</p>
<p>108. The Government had strengthened the control and management of business sites that 
employed foreign workers. In cases of discrimination, exploitation or delay in payment, the 
foreign worker could leave the site of employment and go to a different employment. The 
Government had established and operated 34 support centres and a counselling centre for 
foreign workers. 
</p>
<p>109. The Government had been supporting and taking a special interest in children from 
multicultural families and migrant children in terms of policymaking. The Government had 
revised the applicable laws and regulations in December 2010 to allow any child to receive 
free primary and secondary education up to middle school regardless of the parents&#8217; status 
of stay. Children of foreign workers who were not eligible for legal medical assurance 
services, such as health insurance or medical benefits, due to illegal stay were also granted 
medical support through the medical services support project for foreign workers and the 
marginalized class. 
</p>
<p>110. The revised Civil Act was to take effect in July 2013; the Government planned to 
withdraw, at that time, the reservation to article 21 (a) of CRC. 
</p>
<p>111. Regarding acts of violence and acts to obstruct other persons&#8217; rights during 
assemblies and demonstrations, the police force was mobilized in compliance with 
international human rights standards. As for police officers who had used excessive force in 
law enforcement, cases were investigated thoroughly. The Government would continue to 
harmonize the rights to assembly and demonstration and public order. 
</p>
<p>112. To reduce disadvantages faced by women in employment, the Government was 
promoting childcare leave, providing childcare support and expanding the flexible work 
system to prevent career breaks caused by child-bearing and child-rearing. It was also 
implementing affirmative action to help women ascend the corporate ladder. The 
Government designated the Equal Employment Promotion Week (1-7 April) to raise public 
awareness about the importance of gender equality in employment. It also awarded a prize 
to those who made outstanding contributions to equal employment. 
</p>
<p>113. According to article 92-5 of the Military Criminal Act, sodomy and acts of sexual 
molestation were to be punished. The Constitutional Court on two occasions had decided </p>


<p>that such a provision was constitutional considering that it was meant for military discipline 
and sustenance of combat capabilities and only valid in the case of an act taking place 
between military personnel within a barrack. Therefore, it was inappropriate to repeal or 
revise such a provision at that time. Meanwhile, the Government was making efforts to 
protect the human rights of homosexuals in the military. 
</p>
<p>114. The scope of those with the duty to report child abuse had recently been expanded. 
The Government was working on enacting an act on special cases of punishment for child 
abuse crimes, according to which the perpetrator would be subject to stricter punishment 
and reformation rules than those applied when adults were the target. 
</p>
<p>115. A Korean NGO had been assigned the operation of the Monitoring Centre for 
Children&#8217;s Rights. Ombudspersons and Ombudskids for children&#8217;s rights were appointed to 
monitor children&#8217;s rights in eight areas and provide inputs on possible institutional 
improvements regarding current laws and policies that violate children&#8217;s rights. The 
Government was working on stabilizing the operation of the Monitoring Centre for 
Children&#8217;s Rights through legal formalization. 
</p>
<p>116. The Government had continuously reviewed the feasibility of the ratification of the 
core International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. The harmonization of 
regulations would be required for the ratification of ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) 
concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers. The Government would continue to work 
on the ratification, taking into consideration public opinion and circumstances. 
</p>
<p>117. Recognizing challenges in tackling gender discriminatory ideas and practices in<b> 
</b>society, the Government would continue to work to promote a deeper understanding of 
gender equality, and to address gender discriminatory practices in day-to-day life through 
education, promotion and campaigns. The Government had enacted the Gender Impact 
Assessment and Analysis Act in September 2011, and starting in March 2012, the Gender 
Impact Assessment had been applied to the drafting and amendment of laws and the 
development of mid- to long-term national policies, as a critical component of all policies 
formulated at the national level. 
</p>
<p>118. The Marriage Brokerage Business Management Act had been amended to reinforce 
control of intercountry marriage brokerages and to strengthen the visa issuance process for 
those agencies to eliminate any potential elements of human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>119. To tackle the problem of school bullying, including of migrant children, relevant 
ministries joined together and came up with the Comprehensive Plan to Eliminate School 
Bullying in February 2012. 
</p>
<p>120. To relieve the tuition burden, the Government established national grants and 
scholarships, as well as the Income Contingent Loan system. Students in the bottom 70 per 
cent of the income scale received financial support that amounted to 25 per cent of their 
tuition. 
</p>
<p>121. Regarding recommendations to extend an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially in women and children, among others, delegates were 
reminded that a standing invitation had been extended to all special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>122. With regard to discrimination against children with disabilities, starting August 
2012, childcare and rehabilitation services were being provided so that children with 
disabilities could be cared for in their homes, and education was provided free of charge to 
children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>123. The delegation expressed appreciation to Member States for preparing their 
evaluation of and recommendations to the Republic of Korea. The Government would </p>


<p>conduct a thorough review of those recommendations. The delegation would also push for 
the recommendations from the dialogue to be reflected in the second national plan of action 
for human rights. 
</p>
