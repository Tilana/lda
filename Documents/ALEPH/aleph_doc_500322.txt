MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
 
Forward Looking Statements 
 
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis is a review of the Company’s operations, financial position and plans 
for the future based on facts and circumstances as of August 12, 2009. Except for statements of fact relating to the 
Company, certain information contained herein constitutes forward looking statements. Forward looking statements 
are based on the opinions, plans and estimates of management at the date the statements are made and are subject to 
a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those 
projected  by  such  statements.  The  primary  risk  factors  affecting  the  Company  are  discussed  further  under  the

statements. 
 
Overview 
 
Revenues were $48.9 million in the three months ending June 30, 2009 compared to $124.9 million in comparative 
2008  period.  The  decrease  is  the  result  of  lower  sales  volumes  on  lower  copper  prices.  The  London  Metals 
Exchange cash settlement copper price per pound averaged US$2.12 in the 2009 period compared to US$3.83 in the 
2008 period or about 45% lower. The average US Dollar/CDN Dollar exchange rate over the same period was about 
16% higher in 2009 compared to 2008. In CDN Dollar terms the average copper price in the 2009 period was 36% 
lower than the 2008 period average copper price.  
 
Revenue in the second quarter of 2009 included positive revenue revaluations of $6.1 million compared to positive 
revenue revaluations of $0.2 million in the June 30, 2008 period. The revaluation of accounts receivable include the 
revenue changes resulting from shipments settling in the current quarter that were recorded as sales in prior quarters 
and for shipments sold in the current quarter that will settle in future quarters.  Positive revenue revaluations are the 
result of the copper price on the settlement date and/or at the current period balance sheet date being higher than 
when the revenue was initially recorded or the copper price at the last balance sheet date. 
 
Operating income decreased to $0.9 million from $62.3 million in 2008 as result of lower contribution margins from 
mine operations and a higher foreign exchange loss in the current period. 
 
Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $6.6 million ($0.20 per share) compared to a net income of 
$44.2 million ($1.35 per share) in the comparative 2008 period.   
 
Adjusted net income in the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $2.8 million ($0.9 per share) compared to $42.6 
million ($1.30 per share) in the June 30, 2008 period. Adjusted net income is calculated by removing the gains or 
losses,  net  of  related  income  taxes,  resulting  from  mark  to  market  revaluation  of  copper  and  foreign  exchange 
hedging not related to the current period, removing the unrealized share based compensation expense, net of taxes, 
as further detailed on the following table.

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in the fair value, net of taxes, 
flowing through net income. The amounts ultimately realized may be materially different than reflected in the financial statements 
due to changes in prices of the underlying copper and foreign exchange hedged.
(b)  Effective with the June 30, 2007 quarter, the Company’s employee stock option plan provides for a cash payment option.
Accordingly, the intrinsic value of the outstanding vested options is recorded as a liability on the Company’s balance sheet and 
periodic changes in the intrinsic value, net of taxes, flow through net income.
(c)  Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are not terms recognized under generally accepted accounting principles
however it does show the current year’s financial results excluding the effect of items not settling in the current year.  The 
Company believes these measures are useful to investors because they are included in the measures that are used by management 
in assessing the financial performance of the Company.
Cash  flow  decreased  to  $15.5  million  in  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2009  from  $66.1  million  in  the 
comparative 2008 period.  The $50.6 million decrease is primarily the result of reduced operating margins at Mount 
Polley and Huckleberry, and higher than normal inventory of copper concentrate at quarter end.  Cash flow is a 
measure used by the Company to evaluate its performance, however, it is not a term recognized under generally 
accepted accounting principles. Cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations before the net change in non-cash 
working capital balances. The Company believes cash flow is useful to investors and it is one of the measures used 
by management to assess the financial performance of the Company. 
 
Capital expenditures in the June 2009 period were $6.0 million, down from $13.7 million in the June 2008 period as 
the Company reduced capital expenditures to fall in line with reduced cash generated from operations.  
 
In both periods expenditures were financed by cash flow from the Mount Polley and Huckleberry mines. At June 
30, 2009 the Company had $14.7 million (December 31, 2008-$41.4 million) in cash and cash equivalents and short 
term investments. The reduction in cash was largely the result of payments on negative final settlements in the first 
quarter of 2009 which totaled $28.7 million. 
 
Derivative Instruments 
 
The Company has not hedged gold or silver, only copper and the CDN/US Dollar exchange rate. During the June 
30, 2009 period the Company recorded $9.2 million in losses on derivative instruments compared to losses of $0.4 
million  in  the  comparative  2008  period.  These  gains  and  losses  result  from  the  mark  to  market  valuation  of  the 
derivative instruments based on changes in the price of copper and the CDN/US Dollar exchange rate.  The increase 
in the price of copper in the June 2009 quarter from the low prices at December 31, 2008 resulted in unrealized 
losses being recorded by the Company. These unrealized losses reversed part of the large unrealized gains recorded 
by the Company in the December 2008 quarter when the price of copper fell sharply. The Company does not use 
hedge accounting therefore accounting rules require that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value on each 
balance sheet date, with the adjustment resulting from the revaluation being charged to the statement of income as a 
gain or loss.

The Company utilizes a variety of instruments for hedging including the purchase of puts, forward sales and the use 
of  min/max  zero  cost  collars.  Imperial’s  income  or  loss  from  derivative  instruments  may  be  very  volatile  from 
period to period as a result of changes in the copper price and exchange rates compared to the copper price and 
exchange rate at the time when these contracts were entered into and the type and length of time to maturity of the 
contracts.  
 
Hedges for Huckleberry include puts extending out to the second quarter of 2011.  In conjunction with the extension 
of the Huckleberry mine life announced in the June 2009 Huckleberry entered into hedges to cover a large portion 
of the anticipated production from the extended mine life. These hedges were a combination of puts, forwards and 
calls on copper and a forward sales contract on the CDN/US Dollar exchange rate. 
 
At June 30, 2009 the Company has unrealized income of $11.8 million on its derivative instruments. This represents 
an increase in fair value of the derivative instruments from the dates of purchase to June 30, 2009 due to the decline 
in the price of copper from date of purchase.  Refer to Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for 
the three ended June 30, 2009 for further details. 
 
The Company has granted security to certain hedge counterparties to cover potential losses in excess of the credit 
facilities  granted  by  the  counterparties.  At  June  30,  2009  the  Company  had  $1.2  million  on  deposit  with 
counterparties.  
 
Share Based Compensation Expense 
 
During the June 2007 quarter the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s stock option 
plans (the “Plan”) that provides option holders the right to receive common shares or a direct cash payment in exchange 
for options exercised. The amendment to the Plan balances the need for a long term compensation program to retain 
employees and the concerns of shareholders regarding the dilution caused by the exercise of stock options. As a result of 
the change to the Plan, generally accepted accounting principles result in a liability and related expense being recorded 
for the intrinsic value of the stock options. Additionally, payments made to option holders by the Company are deductible 
for  income  tax  purposes.  The  liability  associated  with  the  Company’s  stock  options  are  revalued  quarterly  to  reflect 
changes in the market price of the Company’s common shares and the vesting of additional stock options. The net change 
is recognized in net income for the period.  None of the options outstanding at June 30, 2009 or December 31, 2008 were 
in-the-money and therefore the Company had no share based compensation liability on those dates. The Company had no 
share based compensation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared to a $0.6 million recovery in the 
June 30, 2008 period. 
 
Developments During the June 2009 quarter 
 
General 
 
Copper  prices  were  significantly  lower  in  the  June  2009  quarter  than  in  the  June  2008  quarter,  averaging  about 
US$2.12/lb compared to US$3.83/lb in 2008 or about 45% lower. The US Dollar continued to decline against the 
CDN  Dollar  during  the  three  months  ending  June  30,  2009  ending  the  period  stronger  against  the  CDN  Dollar. 
Factoring in the increase in the exchange rate the price of copper averaged CDN$2.48/lb in the June 2009 quarter, 
about  36%  less  than  the  average  of  CDN$3.87/lb  in  the  June  2008  quarter.    Since  December  2008  the  monthly 
average  copper  price  increased  every  month  during  2009  rising  about  63%  from  the  December  2008  monthly 
average.  
 
The increases during the last few years in certain costs resulting from changes in market conditions for such items 
as  labour,  fuel  and  other  consumables,  impacted  the  profitability  of  Mount  Polley,  Huckleberry  and  of  resource 
projects generally.  Changes in economic conditions in the latter part of 2008 have reversed this trend with some 
items such as fuel, falling significantly in the last year. These cost reductions have offset a portion of the decline in 
copper price.

Mount Polley 
 
Mill throughput and copper head grade averaged 20,706 tonnes per day, up 15% from the first quarter throughput of 
17,467  tonnes  per  day.  Copper  production  was  up  30%  to  9.7  million  pounds,  as  a  result  of  the  additional 
throughput and increased recovery, 59% compared to 55% in the first quarter. Gold production also increased from 
9,937 troy ounces in the first quarter to 12,728 troy ounces. The majority of ore delivered to the mill was from the 
Springer  pit.  The  remaining  ore  was  delivered  from  the  Wight  and  Southeast  pits  to  blend  with  the  oxidized 
Springer ore. 
 
Clearing work has begun at the Pond zone pit which contains approximately 1.37 million tonnes grading 0.476% 
copper,  0.27  g/t  gold  and  6.89  g/t  silver.  We  expect  to  begin  receiving  ore  from  this  pit  in  2009.  Good  copper 
recovery is expected as this ore is not oxidized. 
 
Exploration expenditures at Mount Polley were $1.4 million in the June 2009 quarter compared to $1.0 million in 
the June 2008 quarter.  
 
In April 2009 Imperial entered into an option agreement with Valley High Ventures Ltd. to acquire a 100% interest 
in a portion of a claim adjacent to the Company’s Boundary zone on the Mount Polley property.  Imperial may exercise 
the option by making a total of $300,000 in cash payments on or before January 1, 2010. The optioned property will be 
subject to a two stage royalty for each tonne milled at the Mount Polley mine concentrator.  The stage I royalty is $2.50 
per tonne for the first 400,000 tonnes milled.  The stage II royalty is $1.25 per tonne for all tonnes milled in excess of 
400,000 tonnes. The stage II royalty can be reduced to $0.62 per tonne by Imperial making a payment of $1,000,000 to 
Valley High. The optioned property will facilitate an open pit design for the near surface mineralization discovered in the 
Boundary zone.  
 
The 2009 drill program at Mount Polley has focused on the Boundary zone.  Highlights include drill hole ND09-79 
which intersected 157.0 metres grading 1.73% copper, 1.11 g/t gold and 10.53 g/t silver starting at 158.1 metres below 
surface. This area is being explored for underground mineable mineralization that is too deep to be captured in the current 
open pit design. A 500 metre long underground ramp, to provide access from the Wight pit to the Boundary zone, 
has been designed and submitted for approval. The ramp will be used to conduct further exploration and to provide 
access for potential underground mining of this zone.  
 
Exploration has also been conducted in the Springer and other zones on the property, as well as the Pond zone where the 
objective is to delineate high grade mineralization below the designed open pit which may be amenable to underground 
mining. Drill hole PZ09-35 returned 71.3 metres grading 0.57% copper, 0.22 g/t gold and 6.81 g/t silver but more notably 
included a 4.4 metre section of 4.20% copper, 1.03 g/t gold and 52.31 g/t silver. Drill hole PZ09-43 also proved fruitful 
with an intercept of 9.3 metres grading 6.40% copper, 0.89 g/t gold and 67.68 g/t silver. The 2009 drill program at the 
Pond zone will explore the portion of skarn mineralization that carries the highest grades discovered to date. 
 
Huckleberry  
 
The financial results of Huckleberry continue to have a significant impact on Imperial’s results. Imperial’s share of 
Huckleberry’s losses was $4.7 million in the June 2009 quarter compared to income of $1.4 million in June 2008 
quarter.  Huckleberry’s  net  losses  increased  due  to  lower  operating  margins  and  higher  losses  on  derivative 
instruments. Huckleberry also had a shipment of about 10,000 tonnes at port and ready for shipment at quarter end. 
Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three months ended June 30, 2009 
discloses information on the impact of Huckleberry operations on the financial position and results of operations of 
Imperial.  
 
Copper production increased during the first six months compared to the same 2008 period. Throughput, grade and 
recovery all improved. Molybdenum was produced only for a few days when higher grades were intersected in the 
pit.

Second Quarter Report 
June 30, 2009
In  the  second  quarter  Huckleberry  approved  an  extension  of  the  mine  plan,  which  includes  the  Saddle  zone 
resource, and will provide for mill feed to extend milling operations to the end of 2011.  Annual estimated copper 
production will be about 40 million pounds per year. The Saddle zone resource, located between the Main Zone pit 
and the Main Zone Extension pit, has a high potential to provide additional extensions to the mine life depending on 
the copper price. 
 
Red Chris 
 
Exploration  at  the  Red  Chris  property  was  restarted  during  the  second  quarter.  The  current  planned  program 
includes  an  expanded  and  deep  penetrating  geophysical  program,  shallow reconnaissance  drilling  to  map  the  till 
covered plateau area, and the restart of a deep diamond drill program to further explore the depth potential of the 
Red Chris deposit. 
 
Sterling 
 
A  program  of  diamond  drilling  from  underground  workings  was  begun  in  the  second  quarter.    The  program  is 
ongoing, with 27 holes totaling 8,435 feet drilled to date.  Underground diamond drilling has targeted the 144 zone 
to the north, west and south, and mineralization in the latite dike that divides the 144 zone from its east extension. 
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
The  critical  accounting  policies  adopted  by  the  Company  and  used  in  preparation  of  its  consolidated  financial 
statements have not changed form those described in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the year ended 
December 31, 2008.   
 
Recent Canadian Accounting Pronouncements   
 
Several  new  accounting  standards  will  be  applicable  to  the  Company  commencing  January  1,  2009  with  most 
focused on providing additional disclosure on various items. 
 
(a)   In February 2008, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) issued Section 3064 – Goodwill 
and Intangible Assets, which replaces Section 3062 – Goodwill and Other Intangible assets and Section 3450 – 
Research and Development Costs. The new standard establishes the recognition, measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of goodwill subsequent to initial recognition and of intangible assets by profit-oriented enterprises. 
The Company adopted Section 3064 effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of this new standard did not have 
a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results.
(b)  In  February  2008,  the  Canadian  Accounting  Standards  Board  confirmed  that  Canadian  publicly  accountable 
enterprises will be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) for financial periods 
beginning on and after January 1, 2011.  Accordingly, the Company will be required to present its financial 
statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  for  its  fiscal  year  beginning  January  1,  2011,  including  2010  IFRS 
compliant  comparative  financial  results.    The  Company  will  prepare  IFRS  financial  statements  effective 
January 1, 2010.
IFRS employs a conceptual framework that is similar to Canadian GAAP, however, significant differences exist 
in certain matters of recognition, measurement and disclosure.  While adoption of IFRS will not change the 
actual cash flows of the Company, the adoption will result in changes to the reported financial position and 
results of operations of the Company.
In the second quarter of 2009, the Company completed its initial IFRS scoping and impact assessment analysis, 
the results of which were reported to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors, along with management’s 
policy recommendations.

Second Quarter Report 
June 30, 2009
In the next quarter, the Company’s IFRS team will design model financial statements compliant with IFRS to 
highlight the accounting policy choices and selective exemptions available to the Company under IFRS.  This 
process will quantify the impact of IFRS on the various financial statement items effected by the adoption of 
IFRS.
In the final quarter of 2009, the Company will execute the required changes to information systems, business 
processes  and  staff  training  to  implement  the  accounting  policy  choices  made  by  the  Audit  Committee  and 
Board of Directors.
(c)    In  January  2009,  the  CICA  issued  Section  1582  –  Business  Combinations,  which  replaces  Section  1581  – 
Business  Combinations,  and  Section  1601  –  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  Section  1602  –  Non-
Controlling Interests, which replace Section 1600 – Consolidated Financial Statements. These new sections are 
effective  for  years  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2011  with  earlier adoption  permitted.  Section  1582  and 
1602 will require net assets, non-controlling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be 
recorded at fair value and non-controlling interests will be reported as a component of equity. In addition, the 
definition of a business is expanded and is described as an integrated set of activities and assets that are capable 
of being managed to provide a return to investors or economic benefits to owners. In addition, acquisition costs 
are not part of the consideration and are to be expensed when incurred. These new sections are not expected to 
have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results.
(d)  In January 2009 the CICA issued EIC-173 Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial 
Liabilities, which provides guidance on how to take into account an entity’s own credit risk and that of the 
counterparty when determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including derivative 
instruments. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of this EIC did not 
have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009  
COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2008 
 
This  review  of  the  results  of  operations  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  unaudited  consolidated  financial 
statements  of  the  Company  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2009  and  the  audited  consolidated  financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2008. 
 
Financial Results 
 
Overview 
 
Revenues decreased to $48.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009 from $124.9 million in the three 
months ended June 30, 2008 due to lower sales volumes and lower copper prices. 
 
In the three months ended June 30, 2009 Imperial recorded a net loss of $6.6 million ($0.20 per share) compared to 
net income of $44.2 million ($1.35 per share) in the comparative period. The decrease in net income is due to the 
large decline in the price of copper which commenced in mid 2008 and lower shipment volumes. 
 
The  financial  results  of  the  Company  are  closely  tied  to  the  profitability  of  the  Mount  Polley  and  Huckleberry 
mines.  The  Mount  Polley  mine  contributed  $2.1  million  to  Imperial’s  operating  income in the June 2009 period 
compared to $60.5 million in the 2008 period. Imperial’s share of Huckleberry contributed $4.2 million in the June 
2009 period to operating income versus $3.3 million in the comparative 2008 period.  
 
Imperial recorded a total of $9.2 million in realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments in the June 2009 
period compared to a total of $0.4 million in the June 2008 period. These derivative instruments were put in place to 
provide cash flow protection against declines in the price of copper. During the 2009 quarter the Company realized 
gains of $4.7 million on derivative instruments, however, due to increase in the price of copper from December 31, 
2008,  these  gains  were  more  than  offset  by  unrealized  losses  from  the  reversal  of  the  large  unrealized  gains  on 
derivative instruments recorded in the December 31, 2008 quarter.  
 
Mineral Production and Transportation Costs 
 
Mineral production and transportation costs were $36.4 million in the June 2009 period comprised of $25.7 million 
from Mount Polley and $10.7 million representing the Company’s 50% share of Huckleberry.  This compares to 
$51.6 million in 2008 period, comprised of $38.2 million from Mount Polley and $13.4 million from Huckleberry.  
 
The impact of high oil and steel prices on operating costs has been reduced in the June 2009 period compared to the 
June 2008 period as these cost inputs have dropped. 
 
Mineral Property Holding Costs 
 
Mineral property holdings costs were steady in both periods at $0.2 million. 
 
Depletion and Depreciation  
 
Depletion and depreciation decreased to $6.2 million in the June 2009 period from $9.0 million in the 2008 period 
due to lower sales volumes in the current period.

Second Quarter Report 
June 30, 2009
General and Administration 
 
General and administration expense decreased to $0.5 million in the June 2009 period from $0.8 million in 2008 
period due to the absence of staff bonus accruals in the 2009 period. 
 
Share Based Compensation 
 
There was no share based compensation expense in the June 2009 period compared to a $0.6 million recovery in the 
June  2008  period.  The  large  decline  in  the  Company’s  share  price  in  the  latter  part  of  2008  resulted  in  the 
elimination  of  the  share  based  expense  obligations  at  December  31,  2008  as  all  options  were  no  longer  in-the-
money  at  that  date  and  through  to  June  30,  2009.  See  heading  Share  Based  Compensation  Expense  for  further 
details.  
 
Interest Expense on Long Term Debt 
 
Interest expense on long term debt decreased to $0.2 million in the June 2009 period from $0.3 million in June 2008 
period due to a lower level of debt in 2009.  
 
Other Interest Expense 
 
Other interest expense decreased to under $0.1 million in the June 2009 period compared to $0.4 million in June 
2008 period. The 2008 period included interest on a short term loan facility and higher short term borrowing on 
concentrate advances.  
 
Interest Accretion on Long Term Debt 
 
Interest accretion was steady at $0.3 million in both periods. 
 
Foreign Exchange Gain 
 
The average CDN/US Dollar exchange rate of 1.167 in the June 2009 period was significantly higher than the June 
2008  period  average  of  1.010.  During  the  June  2009  quarter  the  CDN/US  Dollar  exchange  rate  was  on  an 
decreasing trend going from 1.260 to 1.163 resulting in a $3.9 million foreign exchange loss being recorded in the 
June 2009 period. A loss of $0.3 million in the June 2008 period was recorded as the exchange rate also increased 
but  at  a  slower  rate.  These  gains  and  losses  are  attributable  to  holding  US  Dollar  denominated  cash,  accounts 
receivable  and  derivative  instruments,  partially  offset  by  gains  on  short  term  debt.    These  net  US  Dollar  asset 
balances are the result of the operations at the Mount Polley and Huckleberry mines. 
 
Losses on Derivative Instruments 
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2009 the Company entered into additional hedge contracts for the sale of 
copper and US Dollars to protect the Company’s cash flow against a decline in the price of copper and US Dollar. 
None of the Company’s contracts qualify for hedge accounting and therefore the Company must mark to market the 
unrealized gains and losses on all its contracts. Changes in valuation of this hedge position and the hedge position 
carrying over from prior quarters resulted in a loss of $9.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2009 
compared  to  a  loss  of  $0.4  million  in  the  June  2008  period.  The  unrealized  net  gains  on  the  hedge  contracts 
outstanding at June 30, 2009 totaled $11.8 million. The ultimate gain or loss on these contracts will be determined 
by the copper prices in the periods when these contracts settle.

Recovery of Income and Mining Taxes 
 
Recovery of income and mining taxes was $3.9 million in the June 2009 period compared to an expense of $17.3 
million in the June 2008 period. Huckleberry became cash taxable in 2008 and Imperial become cash taxable in 
2009 as a result of taxable income deferred from 2008, net of the utilization of loss carry forwards and other tax 
deductions.  Refer  to  note  9 of unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three months 
ended June 30, 2009. A total of $0.2 million expense was recorded for mineral taxes payable to the Province of 
British Columbia in the June 2009 period compared to $1.3 million in the June 2008 period.   
 
Capital Risk Management 
 
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the 
return to stakeholders through the optimization of the debt and equity balance.  The Company’s overall strategy 
remains unchanged from 2008.   
 
The capital structure of the Company consists of short term debt, credit facilities, including credit facilities with 
counterparties related to derivative instruments, long term debt, convertible debt and equity attributable to common 
shareholders,  comprised  of  share  capital,  contributed  surplus,  equity  component  of  convertible  debentures  and 
retained earnings. 
 
The  Company  is  in  compliance  with  the  debt  covenants  related  to  its  short  term  debt,  credit  facilities  with 
counterparties, and long term debt. 
 
Liquidity & Capital Resources 
 
Credit Risk 
 
The  Company’s  credit  risk  is  limited  to  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short  term  investments,  accounts  receivable, 
future site reclamation deposits and derivative instruments in the ordinary course of business.   The credit risk of 
cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and future site reclamation deposits is mitigated by placing funds 
in financial institutions with high credit quality.  
 
The  Company  sells to a limited number of smelters and traders. These customers are large, well capitalized and 
diversified multinationals, and credit risk is considered to be minimal. The balance of trade receivables owed to the 
Company in the ordinary course of business is significant and the Company often utilizes short term debt facilities 
with customers to reduce the net credit exposure.  
 
The Company enters into derivative instruments with a number of counterparties. The credit risks associated with 
these  counterparties  was  previously  thought  to  be  minimal  because  of  their  strong  capital  base,  diversity  and 
multinational  operations.  However,  the  bankruptcy  of  one  of  the  Company’s  counterparties,  Lehman  Brothers 
Commodity Services Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2008 demonstrated that counterparty risk increased at that time. 
Changes in Government regulations and intervention by Governments in the financial sector since that time have 
mitigated the risk to some extent.

Liquidity Risk 
 
The  Company  has  in  place  a  rigorous  planning  and  budgeting  process  to  help  determine  the  funds  required  to 
support the Company’s normal operating requirements on an ongoing basis and its planned capital expenditures.  
The Company ensures that in addition to cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances there are 
sufficient committed credit facilities, including the advance payment facilities noted above, to provide the necessary 
cash to meet projected cash requirements. The Company’s primary sources of credit are short term debt secured by 
concentrate inventory and a $1.0 million line of credit with a financial institution.  
 
The  Company  also  holds  derivative  instruments,  its  investment  in  Huckleberry,  mineral  property  holdings  and 
marketable  securities.  While  these  may  be  convertible  to  cash  they  are  not  considered  when  assessing  the 
Company’s liquidity as they are part of the risk management program of the Company, long term strategic holdings, 
or are only convertible to cash over a longer time horizon if realizable values exceed management’s assessment of 
fair  value,  respectively.  Therefore,  as  part  of  the  Company’s  planning,  budgeting  and  liquidity  analysis  process, 
these  items  are  not  relied  upon  to  provide  operational  liquidity.    The  Company  does  not  hold  any  asset  backed 
commercial securities. 
 
The Company’s overall liquidity risk has not changed significantly from December 31, 2008.  An increase in the 
price of copper from the levels at December 31, 2008, partially reduced by the decline in the US Dollar/CDN Dollar 
exchange rate, have reversed a portion of the decline in operating margins and cash flow recorded in the December 
2008 quarter.  Liquidity risk is also impacted by credit risk should a counterparty default on its payments to the 
Company. 
 
Currency Risk 
 
Financial  instruments  that  impact  the  Company’s  net  income  and  comprehensive  income  due  to  currency 
fluctuations include US dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable, 
derivative  instrument  assets  and  margin  deposits,  reclamation  deposits,  accounts  payable,  derivative  instrument 
liabilities, and short term debt. 
 
Cash Flow 
 
The Company recorded a net loss of $6.6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2009 compared to net income 
of $44.2 million in the June 2008 period. Cash flow was $15.5 million in the June 2009 period compared to cash 
flow  of  $66.1  million  in  the  comparative  period.  The  $50.6  million  decrease  is  primarily  the  result  of  reduced 
operating margins at Mount Polley and Huckleberry. Cash flow is a measure used by the Company to evaluate its 
performance,  however,  it  is  not  a  term  recognized  under  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Cash  flow  is 
defined as cash flow from operations before the net change in working capital balances.  
 
Working Capital 
 
At June 30, 2009 the Company had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $36.4 million, an 
decrease of $17.8 million from working capital of $54.2 million at December 31, 2008. The June 30, 2009 working 
capital position reflects the unprofitable operations of the Company during the March and June 2009 quarters and 
the value of the Company’s derivative instruments. Current liabilities at June 30, 2009 include $13.1 million for the 
debt component of convertible debentures that is due in March 2010.

Acquisition and Development of Mineral Properties 
 
Acquisition and development of mineral properties totaled $6.0 million in the June 2009 period compared to $13.7 
million in the comparative 2008 period. 
 
Capital and development expenditures on Mount Polley, Huckleberry, Sterling and Red Chris were $3.5 million in 
the  June  2009  period  compared  to  $11.1 million in  the June 2008 period. The June 2009 period expenditures at 
Mount Polley included $1.1 million for ongoing capital to maintain and extend productive capacity. The June 2009 
period expenditures at Huckleberry were $1.9 million for a drill and ongoing capital projects. Capital expenditures 
in 2009 and 2008 were financed from cash flow from operations. Development expenditures at Red Chris totaled 
$0.1 million in the June 2009 period compared to $0.2 million in the June 2008 period. 
 
Exploration  expenditures  were  $2.5  million  in  the  June  2009  period  compared  to  $2.6  million  in  the  June  2008 
period. In the June 2009 quarter Mount Polley exploration drilling was $1.4 million, Red Chris drilling was $0.3 
million  and  underground  exploration  work  at  Sterling  was  $0.6  million.  In  the  June  2008  quarter  Mount  Polley 
exploration  drilling  was  $1.0 million,  Red  Chris  exploration  trail  and drilling  was  $1.0 million  and  underground 
exploration work at Sterling was $0.5 million.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009  
COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2008 
 
This  review  of  the  results  of  operations  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  unaudited  consolidated  financial 
statements  of  the  Company  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2009  and  the  audited  consolidated  financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2008. 
 
Financial Results 
 
Overview 
 
Revenues decreased to $83.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 from $181.5 million in the six months 
ended June 30, 2008. 
 
In the six months ended June 30, 2009 Imperial recorded a net loss of $13.9 million ($0.43 per share) compared to 
net income of $45.9 million ($1.40 per share) in the comparative period. The decrease in net income is due to the 
large decline in the price of copper which commenced in mid 2008 and lower shipment volumes. 
 
The  financial  results  of  the  Company  are  closely  tied  to  the  profitability  of  the  Mount  Polley  and  Huckleberry 
mines.  The  Mount  Polley  mine  contributed  $2.7  million  to  Imperial’s  operating  income in the June 2009 period 
compared to $79.3 million in the 2008 period. Imperial’s share of Huckleberry contributed $6.7 million in the June 
2009 period to operating income versus $8.7 million in the comparative 2008 period.  
 
Imperial recorded a total of $22.3 million in realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments in the June 
2009 period compared to a total of $22.2 million in the June 2008 period. These derivative instruments were put in 
place to provide cash flow protection against declines in the price of copper. During the 2009 period the Company 
realized  gains  of  $4.7  million  on  derivative  instruments,  however,  due  to  increase  in  the  price  of  copper  from 
December 31, 2008, these gains were more than offset by unrealized losses from the reversal of the large unrealized 
gains on derivative instruments recorded in the December 31, 2008 quarter.  
 
Mineral Production and Transportation Costs 
 
Mineral production and transportation costs were $63.3 million in the June 2009 period comprised of $43.4 million 
from Mount Polley and $19.9 million representing the Company’s 50% share of Huckleberry.  This compares to 
$79.9 million in 2008 period, comprised of $54.4 million from Mount Polley and $25.5 million from Huckleberry.  
 
The impact of high oil and steel prices on operating costs has been reduced in the June 2009 period compared to the 
June 2008 period as these cost inputs have dropped. 
 
Mineral Property Holding Costs 
 
Mineral property holdings costs were steady in both periods at $0.5 million. 
 
Depletion and Depreciation  
 
Depletion and depreciation decreased to $10.8 million in the June 2009 period from $12.9 million in the 2008 period 
due to lower sales volumes in the current period.

Second Quarter Report 
June 30, 2009
General and Administration 
 
General and administration expense decreased to $1.2 million in the June 2009 period from $1.5 million in 2008 
period due to the absence of staff bonus accruals in the 2009 period. 
 
Share Based Compensation 
 
There was no share based compensation expense in the June 2009 period compared to a $2.6 million recovery in the 
June  2008  period.  The  large  decline  in  the  Company’s  share  price  in  the  latter  part  of  2008  resulted  in  the 
elimination  of  the  share  based  expense  obligations  at  December  31,  2008  as  all  options  were  no  longer  in-the-
money  at  that  date  and  through  to  June  30,  2009.  See  heading  Share  Based  Compensation  Expense  for  further 
details.  
 
Interest Expense on Long Term Debt 
 
Interest expense on long term debt decreased to $0.5 million in the June 2009 period from $0.6 million in June 2008 
period due to a lower level of debt in 2009.  
 
Other Interest Expense 
 
Other interest expense decreased to under $0.1 million in the June 2009 period compared to $1.0 million in June 
2008 period. The 2008 period included interest on a short term loan facility and higher short term borrowing on 
concentrate advances.  
 
Interest Accretion on Long Term Debt 
 
Interest accretion was similar at $0.6 million in the June 2009 period compared to the June 2008 period. 
 
Financing Costs 
 
Financing costs of $1.1 million in the June 2008 period were associated with a short term loan facility entered into 
in that period compared to $nil million in the June 2009 period when there was no such comparable item. 
 
Foreign Exchange Gain 
 
The average CDN/US Dollar exchange rate of 1.206 in the June 2009 period was significantly higher than the June 
2008  period  average  of  1.007.  During  the  June  2009  quarter  the  CDN/US  Dollar  exchange  rate  was  on  an 
decreasing trend going from 1.225 to 1.163 resulting in a $2.8 million foreign exchange gain being recorded in the 
June 2009 period. A loss of $0.1 million in the June 2008 period was recorded as the exchange rate also increased 
but  at  a  slower  rate.  These  gains  and  losses  are  attributable  to  holding  US  Dollar  denominated  cash,  accounts 
receivable  and  derivative  instruments,  partially  offset  by  gains  on  short  term  debt.    These  net  US  Dollar  asset 
balances are the result of the operations at the Mount Polley and Huckleberry mines.

Losses on Derivative Instruments 
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2009 the Company entered into additional hedge contracts for the sale of 
copper and US Dollars to protect the Company’s cash flow against a decline in the price of copper and US Dollar. 
None of the Company’s contracts qualify for hedge accounting and therefore the Company must mark to market the 
unrealized gains and losses on all its contracts. Changes in valuation of this hedge position and the hedge position 
carrying over from 2008 resulted in a loss of $21.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to 
a loss of $22.2 million in the June 2008 period. The unrealized net gains on the hedge contracts outstanding at June 
30, 2009 totaled $11.8 million. The ultimate gain or loss on these contracts will be determined by the copper prices 
in the periods when these contracts settle. 
 
Recovery of Income and Mining Taxes 
 
A  recovery  of  income  and  mining  taxes  of  $3.9  million  was  recorded  in  the  June  2009  period  compared  to  an 
expense of $16.5 million in the June 2008 period. Huckleberry became cash taxable in 2008 and Imperial become 
cash taxable in 2009 as a result of taxable income deferred from 2008, net of utilization of loss carry forwards and 
other tax deductions. Refer to note 9 of unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three 
months ended June 30, 2009. A total of $0.4 million expense was recorded for mineral taxes payable to the Province 
of British Columbia in the June 2009 period compared to $1.7 million in the June 2008 period.

Debt and Other Obligations 
 
Interest Rate Risk 
 
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and short term investments. Presently, 
the  majority  of  the  Company’s  outstanding  borrowings  are  at  fixed  interest  rates.    The  Company  monitors  its 
exposure  to  interest  rates  and  is  comfortable  with  its  current  exposure.    The  Company  has  not  entered  into  any 
derivative contracts to manage this risk. 
 
The Company did not incur any new long term debt during the six months ended June 2009.  Select use of short 
term debt during the June 30, 2009 and 2008 periods from purchasers of the Company’s concentrate and short term 
advances from related parties provided working capital to meet day to day cash requirements.  
 
Debt repayment and working capital requirements for 2009 are expected to be met from cash on hand and cash flow 
generated by Mount Polley and Huckleberry. The Company currently does not forecast the requirement for any long 
term debt or equity financings during 2009 however long term debt may be utilized when terms are favourable. The 
Company will continue to utilize short term debt to manage its day to day financing needs.

Second Quarter Report 
June 30, 2009
In the March 2008 quarter the Company entered into a $30.0 million short term revolving working capital facility, a 
portion  of  which  was  used  to  repay  the  $10.0  million  balance  owing  on  the  term  facility  for  the  purchase  of 
bcMetals in 2007.  The remaining balance of $10.0 million of a term facility for the purchase of bcMetals was paid 
in February 2008 from a new $30.0 million short term revolving working capital facility with a syndicate of lenders. 
Both these credit facilities are described under the heading Related Party Transactions.  
 
There were no conversions of the Company’s convertible debentures during either six month period ended June 30, 
2009 or 2008. These debentures bear interest at 6% per annum and are due in March 2010. They are convertible into 
common shares of the Company at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of 
$8.65 per common share. In accordance with the accounting standards for convertible instruments the net proceeds 
of  the  convertible  debenture  has  been  allocated  between  debt  and  equity  components  at  the  date  of  issue  and 
reflected as such in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company. As of June 30, 2009 and 2008 debentures with a 
face value of $14.0 million were outstanding. 
 
Payments on the non-interest bearing Mount Polley mine construction loan are only due when the mine and mill are 
in  operation.  Payments  are  limited  to  $116,667  per  month,  to  a  maximum  of  $1,166,667  per  year.  This  debt  is 
similar in nature to a capped royalty on operations. This debt is non recourse to Imperial and secured only by the 
mining property assets on which the funds were invested. The balance owing on this debt at June 30, 2009 is $1.3

The  Company  is  exposed  to  equity  price  risk  arising  from  marketable  securities  and  share  based  compensation 
liabilities.  Marketable  securities  are  classified  as  held  for  trading  because  the  Company  intends  to  liquidate  the 
marketable securities when market conditions are conducive to a sale of these securities. Share based compensation 
liabilities  arise  because  the  option  holders  have  the  right,  in  lieu  of  receiving  common  shares,  to  receive  a  cash 
payment from the Company equal to the difference between the exercise price of each stock option and the market 
price of the Company’s common shares on the date of exercise. 
 
The Company’s sensitivity to equity prices has not changed significantly from the prior year.

Fair Value Estimation 
 
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as held for trading securities and share based 
compensation liabilities) is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.  The quoted market price used 
for  financial  assets  held  by  the  Company  is  the  current  bid  price.  The  quoted  market  price  used  for  financial 
liabilities owed by the Company is the current ask price. 
 
The  fair  value  of  derivative  instrument  assets  and  liabilities  are  determined  by  the  counterparties  using  standard 
valuation techniques for these derivative instruments.  
 
The  carrying  value  less  impairment  provision,  if  necessary,  of  trade  receivables  and  payables  are  assumed  to 
approximate  their  fair  values.  Management  believes  that  the  carrying  value  of  short  and  long  term  debt 
approximates fair value. Although the interest rates and credit spreads have changed since the long term debt was 
issued  the  fixed  rate  portion  of  the  long  term  debt  is  close  to  maturity,  will  not  be  refinanced  and  therefore  the 
carrying  value  is  not  materially  different  from  fair  value.    The  debt  component  of  the  convertible  debentures  is 
estimated to have a fair value of $12.9 million at June 30, 2009 based on the estimated interest rate expected on a 
similar instrument at that date.

(2)   Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income adjusted for certain items of a non-operational nature that pertain to future periods
as described in further detail under the heading Adjusted Net Income.
(3)   Cash flow and cash flow per share are measures used by the Company to evaluate its performance however, they are not terms 
recognized under generally accepted accounting principles and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used 
by other companies. Cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations before net change in working capital balances and cash 
flow per share is the same measure divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The Company believes these measures are useful to investors, because they are included in the measures that are used by management 
in assessing the financial performance of the Company.

Related Party Transactions 
 
Corporate 
 
In February 2008 the Company entered into a $30.0 million short term revolving working capital facility with a 
syndicate of lenders which include Edco and a company controlled by Larry Moeller, a director of Imperial. Edco’s 
share of the facility is 75%, Mr. Moeller’s share is 8.3% and the balance of 16.7% is held by four funds that are 
shareholders  of  the  Company.  This  facility  bears  interest  at  10%  per  annum,  payable  monthly,  and  was  due  on 
February 15, 2009.  The facility was secured by a floating charge on all the assets of the Company plus guarantees 
by Mount Polley Mining Corporation and Red Chris Development Company Ltd.  In consideration of the facility, 
the lenders would be granted one warrant for each $25.00 advanced under the facility such that warrants to purchase 
up  to  1,200,000  common  shares  of  the  Company  at  $10.00  per  share,  exercisable  until  July  31,  2009  could  be 
granted.  A maximum of 1,200,000 warrants would be issued if the facility were fully drawn. An arrangement fee of 
$225,000 was paid to the lenders.  A total of $15.0 million was drawn on the facility and 600,000 warrants were 
issued. The facility was repaid in June 2008 and expired on February 15, 2009. All the warrants under this facility 
expired unexercised on July 31, 2009. 
 
In June 2009 the Company borrowed a total of $3.0 million from Edco and a company controlled by Larry Moeller, a 
director of Imperial. These short advances, which bore interest at 7% per annum, were repaid in July 2009.

As of August 12, 2009 the Company had 32,128,985 common shares outstanding, and on a diluted basis 35,706,837 
common shares outstanding. Additional information about the Company, including the Company’s Annual Information 
Form, is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. 
 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered 
and  reported  on  a  timely  basis  to  senior  management,  so  that  appropriate  decisions  can  be  made  regarding  public 
disclosure. As at the end of the period covered by this management’s discussion and analysis, management evaluated the 
effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as required by Canadian securities laws. 
 
Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this management’s 
discussion and analysis, the disclosure controls were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required 
to  be  disclosed  in  the  Company’s  annual  filings  and  interim  filings  (as  such  term  are  defined  under  Multilateral 
Instrument  52-109  –  Certification  of  Disclosure  in  Issuers’  Annual  and  Interim  Filings)  and  other  reports  filed  or 
submitted  under  Canadian  securities  laws  is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods 
specified by those laws, and that material information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to 
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Controls and Procedures 
 
The  Company’s  management  evaluated  the  design  and  operational  effectiveness  of  its  internal  control  and 
procedures  over  financial  reporting  as  defined  under  Multilateral  Instrument  52-109.   Management  has  excluded 
from  its  assessment  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  at  Huckleberry  Mines  Ltd.  (“Huckleberry”),  in 
which  the  Company  holds  a  50%  interest  and  is  proportionally  consolidated  in  the  Company’s  consolidated 
financial statements, because Imperial’s management does not have the ability to dictate or modify controls at this 
entity and does not have the ability to assess, in practice, the controls at the entity.  Huckleberry constitutes 19% of 
net assets, 18% of total assets, 33% of revenues, income of $4.6 million from operations, and 70% of net loss of the 
consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2009. 
 
As of June 30, 2009, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the 
period covered by this Management’s Discussion and Analysis that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to 
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
Contingent Liabilities 
 
The Company is from time to time involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the conduct of its 
business.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  these  matters  will  not  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company’s 
consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 
In 2007 the Company acquired bcMetals Corporation (“bcMetals”) which is a party to a number of legal actions and 
contingent liabilities pertaining to the Red Chris project. The status of the principal actions is as follows: 
 
Screening Level Review of Red Chris Project under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (“CEAA”) 
 
In December 2008 the Supreme Court of Canada issued a decision granting the application of MiningWatch Canada 
for leave to appeal from the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal issued June 13, 2008. The Federal Court of 
Appeal decision confirmed the Federal Environmental Assessment of the Red Chris project was valid and in full 
compliance  with  the  Canadian  Environmental  Assessment  Act.    The  granting  of  leave  to  appeal  to  the  Supreme 
Court of Canada does not overturn the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal.  It is a procedural step only which 
authorizes  MiningWatch  to  bring  an  appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court  of  Canada.  The  appeal  process,  including  the 
filing of written submissions by all parties, scheduling of a hearing and a decision, is expected to be concluded at 
year end. 
 
American Bullion Minerals Ltd. (“ABML”) 
 
In  2006  two  minority  shareholders  of  ABML  (“Petitioners”)  commenced  action  against  the  bcMetals  (now  Red 
Chris Development Company Ltd.) seeking a declaration that the affairs of ABML had been conducted in a manner 
oppressive to its minority shareholders and asking that bcMetals purchase the shares of the minority shareholders of 
ABML.  The events complained of predate the acquisition of bcMetals by the Company.  The Petitioners are also 
seeking to certify their action as a class action proceeding. The Company has expressed an interest in purchasing the 
shares of the minority shareholders of ABML subject to such regulatory approvals that will be required given that 
ABML, a reporting issuer, has been cease traded since 2001 and is delisted.  
 
Risk Factors 
 
The reader is cautioned that the following description of risks and uncertainties is not all-inclusive as it pertains 
only to conditions currently known to management.  There can be no guarantee or assurance other factors will or 
will  not  adversely  affect  the  Company.  The  risk  factors  affecting  the  Company  have  not  changed  from  those 
described in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Outlook 
 
Operations, Earnings and Cash Flow 
 
Imperial’s equity share of production from the Mount Polley mine and the Huckleberry mine is expected to be about 
60 million pounds of copper, 54 thousand ounces of gold and 325 thousand ounces of silver during 2009 and at 
current metals prices it is expected to generate sufficient cash flow for repayment of debt and exploration. Cash 
flow protection for 2009 is supported by derivative instruments that will see the Company receive certain minimum 
average copper prices and exchange rates as disclosed under the heading Derivative Instruments. 
 
However, the quarterly revenues will fluctuate depending on the timing of concentrate sales which is dependant on 
the availability and scheduling of transportation, copper and gold prices and the US Dollar/CDN Dollar exchange 
rate. Copper production at Mount Polley was lower in the half of 2009 but is expected to increase in the second half 
of the year as the mine processes the balance of the high grade unoxidized ore from the Wight pit. 
 
Exploration 
 
The  Company’s  plans  for  2009  are  to  continue  exploration  at  its  two  operating  mines  Mount  Polley  and 
Huckleberry, and at its Red Chris and Sterling properties.   
 
The  ongoing  exploration  at  Mount  Polley  has  focused  on  the  Boundary  zone,  which  is  being  explored  for 
underground  mineable  mineralization  too  deep  to  be  captured  in  the  current  open  pit  design.  A  500  metre  long 
underground ramp, to provide access from the Wight pit to the Boundary zone, has been designed and submitted for 
approval. The ramp will be used to conduct further exploration and to provide access for potential underground mining 
of this zone. Exploration has also been conducted in the Springer and other zones on the property, as well as the Pond 
zone where the objective is to delineate high grade mineralization below the designed open pit which may be amenable to 
underground mining. The current drill program at the Pond zone will explore the portion of skarn mineralization that 
carries the highest grades discovered to date. 
 
Exploration work at Huckleberry this year will focus on areas immediately adjacent to the mine.  
 
Exploration  at  the  Red  Chris  property  was  restarted  during  the  second  quarter.  The  current  planned  program 
includes  an  expanded  and  deep  penetrating  geophysical  program,  shallow reconnaissance  drilling  to  map  the  till 
covered plateau area, and the restart of a deep diamond drill program to further explore the depth potential of the 
Red Chris deposit. 
 
At  the  Sterling  property  in  the  second  quarter,  a  program  of  diamond  drilling  from  underground  workings  was 
begun and 27 holes totaling 8,435 feet have been drilled to date.  Underground diamond drilling has targeted the 
144 zone to the north, west and south, and mineralization in the latite dike that divides the 144 zone from its east 
extension. 
 
The Company also continues to evaluate exploration opportunities both on currently owned properties and on new 
prospects.

Development 
 
Development of the Red Chris project will be dependant on the timing of the construction of a power line to serve 
the northwest portion of British Columbia, and resolution of the challenge to the Federal environmental assessment 
review. The Company is completing a program of metallurgical test work to try and enhance gold recovery. 
 
Financing 
 
Debt repayment and working capital requirements for 2009 are expected to be met from cash on hand, cash flow 
from the Mount Polley and Huckleberry mines and short term debt facilities.  Selective debt financings may also be 
entered into during 2009. The Company currently does not forecast the requirement for any equity financings during 
2009. 
 
Acquisitions 
 
Management continues to evaluate potential acquisitions to further grow the Company.
