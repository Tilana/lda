<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that no one shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment is a non-derogable right under international law that must be respected and 
protected under all circumstances, including in times of international and internal armed 
conflict or internal disturbance or any other public emergency, that the absolute prohibition 
of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is affirmed in the 
relevant international instruments, and that legal and procedural safeguards against such 
acts must not be subject to measures that would circumvent this right, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that the prohibition of torture is a peremptory norm of international 
law, and that international, regional and domestic courts have recognized the prohibition of 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to be customary international law, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

and fight against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
