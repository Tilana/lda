Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Uruguay, noted that 
consensus should be the working method and remained unconvinced of the need to 
elaborate complementary standards in the form of an additional protocol.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Ad Hoc Committee on the elaboration of complementary standards (Ad Hoc 
Committee) submits the present report pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 3/103 
and resolutions 6/21 and 10/30.  
</p>
<p>2. In order to conform with the note by the secretariat on control and limitation of 
documentation (A/58/CRP.<footnote name="7">6. Greece called for a multi-stakeholder dialogue which would include 
parliamentarians.  </footnote>), the thematic section of this report only contains text 
proposals formulated during the session, as well as amendments and proposals submitted to 
the Secretariat up to two weeks following the session, provided the proposals were 
articulated during the session.  
</p>
<p>3. Summaries of views and full position papers are contained in A/HRC/13/CRP.<footnote name="1">16. The Chairperson opened the 13th meeting with a discussion on the way forward. 
Pakistan, on behalf of the OIC, stated that the way forward had to mean tangible action, 
adding that the Committee was obliged to implement its mandate. The delegate stated that 
the Chairperson needed to formulate the proposals made during the session in the form of 
draft complementary standards and that, in doing so, he could consult relevant experts.

</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b>4. The Ad Hoc Committee held its second session from 19 to 30 October 2009, holding 
14 meetings in total. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>5. The session was attended by representatives of Member States and non-Member 
States represented by observers, United Nations entities, intergovernmental organizations, 
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in consultative status with the Economic and 
Social Council. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>6. Mona Rishmawi, Chief of the Rule of Law, Equality and Non-Discrimination 
Branch of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) welcomed 
delegates to the second session of the Ad Hoc Committee, which provided an opportunity 
to build on the momentum of the Durban Review Conference. She indicated that the wide 
range of ideas contained in the outcome referred to in paragraph 2 (d) of the road map 
offered an opportunity for constructive engagement, and gave an overview of the historical 
process leading up to the establishment of the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>7. Idriss Jaza&#239;ry, Permanent Representative of Algeria, was re-elected Chairperson-
Rapporteur of the Ad Hoc Committee by acclamation. He thanked delegates for their 
confidence and emphasized that the specific focus of the second session would be on the 
outcome referred to in paragraph 2 (d) of the road map on the elaboration of 
complementary standards, contained in document A/HRC/AC.<footnote name="1">4. The United States of America did not believe new norms were necessary or useful. 
The problem was not one of gaps in the existing international legal framework, but rather </footnote>/2/2 (further referred to as 
the outcome document under the road map).  
8. The Chairperson explained that the following parameters were used for the 
elaboration of this document: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Paragraph 199 of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.<footnote name="1">3. On behalf of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Japan, 
Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Uruguay, Argentina stated that due 
consideration was to be given to the study of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, contained in document A/HRC/4/WG.3/7, and the study by the five 
experts, contained in document A/HRC/4/WG.3/6. Argentina added that a discussion on the 
identification of procedural and substantive gaps should precede any discussion on themes 
and should be conducted in a spirit of consensus, a view supported by Norway. 
</footnote>0-10366 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Human Rights Council decision 3/103 establishing the mandate of the Ad Hoc 
Committee 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Human Rights Council resolution 10/30 which endorsed the road map 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Core international human rights treaties 
</p>
<p>9. The Chairperson underlined that he had taken the comments formulated during the 
informal meeting of 10 July 2009 into account in the elaboration of the outcome document 
under the road map. He noted, however, that some contributions received did not fall under 
the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee, interfered with mandates of other mechanisms, or 
pertained to process, thematic issues or principled positions. In order to enhance 
transparency, a section summarizing the views and comments of Member States had 
nevertheless also been included in the outcome document. The Chairperson requested that 
discussions focus on the main sections of the outcome document under the road map. Given 
the nature of the substantive issues included in the outcome document, a victim-oriented 
approach was imperative. He welcomed the opportunity for the Ad Hoc Committee to 
advance its endeavours and expressed his wishes for a fruitful, effective and substantive 
session. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Adoption of the agenda and organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Chairperson invited comments on the agenda contained in document 
A/HRC/AC.<footnote name="1">2. Sweden, on behalf of the European Union (EU), stated that, while the EU was not 
against the principle of adopting complementary standards, it felt the decision to do so 
should be consensual. Sweden also underlined that any identification of gaps needed to be 
based on empirical data and not simply views, and stressed that the need to adopt standards 
was to be rationally justifiable and evidence-based. Any complementary standards should 
not undermine or duplicate existing standards, and all relevant stakeholders should be 
associated to the process, including members of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination. Sweden also stated that agreement on these principles was necessary 
before it could endorse the proposed agenda. Azerbaijan supported the elaboration of 
complementary standards since some challenges are not covered by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination and emphasized that consensus should not be a 
precondition for the work of the Ad Hoc Committee. 
</footnote>/2/1. In the course of discussion, statements on the agenda were frequently 
intertwined with statements on the organization and draft programme of work contained in 
document A/HRC/AC.<footnote name="1">1. Nigeria, on behalf of the African Group, indicated it could not accept the agenda and 
programme of work as structured and requested that the Chairperson elaborate a new 
agenda and a new programme of work that would allow the Committee to start the process 
of developing a new international instrument.  
</footnote>/2/CRP.1. Both items are therefore addressed under the same 
heading. 
</p>

<p>GE.10-10366 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>one of gaps in the implementation of existing norms. Understanding why some approaches 
did or did not work would be more useful than elaborating new norms. Self-examination 
and scrutiny were important for all States.  
</p>
<p>15. The Russian Federation stressed that complementary standards should not 
undermine existing standards. In particular, the work of the Ad Hoc Committee should take 
into account the Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference.  
</p>
<p>16. Sweden, on behalf of the EU, felt that the outcome document under the road map 
and the draft programme of work did not accurately reflect the contributions submitted by 
the EU. Key principles of the EU had not been included in the principles section of the 
outcome document under the road map. Sweden requested that the outcome document 
under the road map and the programme of work be revised. It stated that the outcome 
document under the road map had a strong religious bias which did not accurately reflect 
the contributions received. On the other hand, double and multiple forms of discrimination, 
including discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation, as well as the need for 
universal ratification and better implementation of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, were insufficiently visible in the 
outcome document under the road map and the draft programme of work. 
</p>
<p>17. Canada stressed the importance of proceeding by consensus, a view also emphasized 
by other delegations of the Western Europe and Other States Group. Cuba indicated that 
this was an artificial debate as the principle of consensus constituted a de facto veto right. 
Pakistan, on behalf of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), stated that only 
United Nations rules of procedure were to guide the work of the Ad Hoc Committee and 
that while consensus remained desirable, it was not the only way forward. The OIC also 
commented on the allegation that the outcome document of the road map was biased in 
favour of religious intolerance. The view was expressed that maybe this was the case 
because it was also a burning reality.  
</p>
<p>18. Nigeria, on behalf of the African Group, warned against the insinuation that some 
issues might be more important than others. Nigeria also alleged that consensus was being 
used as a pretext by those States who preferred not to genuinely engage in the discussion. 
Nigeria also noted that, while the idea of consensus was inherent to negotiations, it was not 
forced on any meeting as a condition, as doing so would make it a constraining factor in 
applying the rules of procedure of the General Assembly guiding all United Nations 
meetings. Hence, amendments to the rules should be made at the General Assembly and not 
in a subsidiary body.  
</p>
<p>19. Ireland expressed its resentment over the fact that legitimate positions by western 
countries were being interpreted by some as a reluctance to deal thoroughly, honestly and 
seriously with the problem of racism, while in fact exactly the opposite was the case. The 
delegate cited the example of his country which recently hosted a visit by experts from the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Denmark added that any outcome 
of the Ad Hoc Committee would not have the same weight or impact if not decided by 
consensus, a position supported by Greece. Portugal inquired about the applicable rules of 
procedure. Mexico stated that consensus was not the only way forward, but a minimum 
level of agreement on the topics to be addressed was necessary.  
</p>
<p>20. The Syrian Arab Republic, supported by the Islamic Republic of Iran, noted that the 
issue of complementary standards had sprung from the constant evolution of international 
human rights law and that consensus and unanimity were not identical. The Syrian delegate 
also inquired why the outcome document under the road map was not available in Arabic. 
The Chairperson, after having been informed by the secretariat that the document would be 
available in Arabic soon, expressed his dissatisfaction over the late availability of the 
translation. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10366 
</p>
<p>21. The Chairperson cited the rules of procedure of the General Assembly contained in 
document A/520/Rev.17 and deduced that, as a subsidiary body of the Human Rights 
Council, the Ad Hoc Committee had to apply the rules of procedure of the Human Rights 
Council which, in turn, applied the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. There was 
no legal ambiguity in this respect. As the Chairperson, however, he obviously preferred 
consensus. This did not mean, however, that a document which was not adopted by 
consensus was not a valid document. Indeed, such an approach would contradict the very 
essence of multilateralism. He also clarified that the outcome document under the road map 
presented substance and procedure separately, and that it was obvious that the document 
could have been structured in a myriad other ways. As for the issue of sexual orientation, 
the Chair stated that some States had requested in prior sessions that the discussion focus on 
racial discrimination only, while others favoured a focus on all forms of discrimination. 
Hours had already been devoted to this issue, inconclusively, and it had become clear that 
the matter was not conducive to consensus. The Chair then proposed that informal 
consultations take place on a draft programme of work which would enable the Ad Hoc 
Committee to elaborate complementary standards, indicating that the nature of the 
instruments was not predetermined.  
</p>
<p>23. An indigenous representative, speaking on behalf of the Indigenous Peoples and 
Nations Coalition and the Indian Council of South America, stated that the rights of peoples 
under foreign occupation had to be addressed directly. 
</p>
<p>24. At the opening of the second meeting, the Chairperson presented the revised agenda 
contained in document A/HRC/AC.1/2/1/Rev.1. The Ad Hoc Committee adopted this 
agenda for its second session.  
</p>
<p>25. Discussions on the draft programme of work were pursued during the second and 
third meetings. At the opening of the fourth meeting, pending final approval of the draft 
programme of work, it was agreed that discussions would be pursued in alphabetical order 
on the basis of themes submitted by States or groups for inclusion in the draft programme 
of work. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Advocacy and incitement to racial, ethnic, national and religious hatred 
</b></p>
<p>25. Statements and/or text proposals were made by Nigeria (on behalf of the African 
Group), Switzerland (on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican 
Republic, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and Uruguay), Pakistan (on 
behalf of States members of the OIC), Liechtenstein, Sweden (on behalf of States members 
of the EU), Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, United States of America, Belgium, 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, France, Canada, Germany, Syria, 
South Africa, Algeria, Argentina (see A/HRC/13/CRP.1). 
26. Nigeria, on behalf of the African Group, made the following proposals: 
</p>
<p><i>1. States parties shall condemn any propaganda, practice, or organization 
aimed at justifying or encouraging any form of racial hatred or 
discrimination targeting people of particular groups, such as racial, ethnic 
or religious groups, refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced persons, 
stateless individuals, migrants and migrant workers, communities based on 
descent, such as people of African descent, indigenous people, minorities and 
people under foreign occupation; 
</i></p>
<p><i>2. States parties shall immediately undertake to adopt positive measures 
designed to eliminate all incitement to racial, ethnic or religious hatred or 
discrimination and, to this end, shall commit themselves, inter alia</i>: </p>


<p>GE.10-10366 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p> <i>(a) To declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of 
ideas aimed at discrimination or hatred, as well as all acts of violence or 
incitement to such acts against any particular group of persons;

organized and all other propaganda activities, which encourage and incite 
racial, ethnic or religious hatred or discrimination, and shall declare

</i></p>
<p><i> (c) Not to permit national or local public authorities to incite 
racial hatred or discrimination; 
</i></p>
<p><i> (d) Not to permit political parties to incite racial hatred or 
discrimination.  
</i></p>
<p>27. Switzerland, on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican 
Republic, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and Uruguay, suggested that: 
</p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Committee and the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination could consult with States and stakeholders and possibly 
consider elaborating a joint general comment on the issue of advocacy and 
incitement to hatred, as enshrined in the above-mentioned articles, in the framework 
of their respective competencies and bearing in mind article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</i></p>
<p>28. Pakistan, on behalf of the OIC, expressed support for the proposal formulated by 
Nigeria on behalf of the African Group, while proposing the following amendments and 
additions: 
</p>
<p><i>1. Replace the word &#8220;condemn&#8221; in the first line of the first proposal by the 
word &#8220;prohibit&#8221; and add &#8220;ethnic, national, and religious&#8221; between the 
words &#8220;racial&#8221; and &#8220;hatred&#8221; in the second line. 
</i></p>
<p><i>2. Add &#8220;ethnic, national, and religious&#8221; between the words &#8220;racial&#8221; and 
&#8220;hatred&#8221; in the second line of the second proposal. 
 (a) Add &#8220;racial, ethnic, national, and religious&#8221; after &#8220;aimed at&#8221;

 (b) Add &#8220;ethnic, national, and religious&#8221; after &#8220;racial&#8221; in the first 
line. 
</i></p>
<p><i> (c) Add &#8220;ethnic, national, and religious&#8221; after &#8220;racial&#8221; in the first 
line. 
</i></p>
<p><i> (d) To strengthen their legislation or adopt necessary legal 
provisions to prohibit and suppress racist and xenophobic platforms and to 
discourage the integration of political parties who promote such platforms in 
government alliances in order to legitimize the implementation of these 
platforms. 
</i></p>
<p>29. In addition, Pakistan, on behalf of the OIC, added the following two proposals: 
</p>
<p><i>1. States parties shall, in accordance with human rights standards, declare 
illegal and prohibit all organizations based on ideas or theories of 
superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or 
which attempt to justify or promote national, racial and religious hatred and 
discrimination in any form. </i></p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10366 
</p>
<p><i>2. States parties shall promulgate, where they do not exist, specific legislation 
prohibiting any propaganda for war and any advocacy of national, racial or 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence. 
</i></p>
<p>30. The EU submitted the following proposals: 
</p>
<p><i>1. States should condemn any advocacy of racial or religious hatred that 
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence; 
</i></p>
<p><i>2. States should implement existing standards regarding incitement to racial or 
religious hatred and violence. 
</i></p>
<p>31. The United States of America made the following proposals: 
</p>
<p><i> Member States are called upon to:  
</i></p>
<p><i>1. Speak out against intolerance, including advocacy of national, racial or 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility, or 
violence; 
</i></p>
<p><i>2. Adopt measures to criminalize the incitement to imminent violence based on 
race or religion; 
</i></p>
<p><i>3. Censure, as appropriate, government officials who in their official capacity 
advocate for racial, ethnic, and religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility, or violence; and 
</i></p>
<p><i>4. Present in their periodic reports to the Human Rights Committee and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and include in their 
universal periodic review report to the Human Rights Council, a full account 
of the measures that they have taken consistent with their obligations under 
international law, including equal protection of the law, to address and 
combat advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility, or violence.  
</i></p>
<p><b> 2. Comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation 
</b></p>
<p>32. During the 5th meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee, statements and/or text proposals 
were made by Sweden (in its national capacity and on behalf of the EU), Italy, the United 
Kingdom, Ireland, Indonesia, Brazil, Canada, Slovakia, the United States, France, Slovakia, 
Pakistan (on behalf of the OIC), Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, Denmark, Norway, the 
Syrian Arab Republic. The following observers took the floor: Cercle de Recherche sur les 
Droits et les Devoirs de la Personne Humaine (CRED); Association of World Citizens; 
Indigenous Peoples and Nations Coalition and the Indian Council of South America (joint 
statement) (see A/HRC/13/CRP.1). 
33. The United States of America submitted the following proposals:  
</p>
<p><i> Member States are called upon to:  
</i></p>
<p><i>1. Compile a comprehensive list of current laws prohibiting racial and religious 
discrimination;  
</i></p>
<p><i>2. Review existing national laws to ensure that protections against racial and 
religious discrimination comply with their obligations under international 
human rights law;  
</i></p>
<p><i>3. Facilitate an international meeting of national experts to assess this 
legislation and evaluate its effectiveness in practice; </i></p>


<p>GE.10-10366 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><i>4. Assess whether their current domestic institutions robustly enforce anti-
discrimination laws, and determine actions necessary to fill any gaps in 
enforcement;  
</i></p>
<p><i>5. Assess whether domestic institutions appropriately enforce such anti-
discrimination laws equally among members of all racial and religious 
groups within the State;  
</i></p>
<p><i>6. Establish, if one does not already exist, a national body or bodies responsible 
for ensuring the implementation of anti-discrimination laws, investigation of 
cases, maintenance of relevant statistics, reviewing allegations of failed or 
improper enforcement, and for bringing cases against individuals who 
violate the law; 
</i></p>
<p><i>7. Take effective measures to ensure equal access to governmental programmes 
or activities, irrespective of an individual&#8217;s race or religion;  
</i></p>

their public duties do not discriminate based on an individual&#8217;s race or 
religion;  
</i></p>
<p><i>9. Take effective measures to ensure that members of racial or religious 
minority groups have equal access to housing, education, and employment;  
</i></p>
<p><i>10. Foster religious freedom and pluralism by promoting the ability of members 
of all religious communities to manifest their religion, and to contribute 
openly and on an equal footing to the public realm;  
</i></p>
<p><i>11. Encourage representation and meaningful participation of individuals, 
irrespective of their race or religion, in all sectors of society, especially in 
government; and  
</i></p>
<p><i>12. Undertake strong efforts to counter racial or religious profiling which is 
understood to be the invidious use of race, religion or ethnicity as a criterion 
in conducting stops, searches, and other law enforcement investigative 
procedures. 
</i></p>
<p>The proposal was supported by the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Canada and Slovakia.  </p>
<p>34. Nigeria, speaking for the African Group, contributed the following proposal, 
supported by the OIC:  
</p>
<p><i>1. States parties shall review and, as and where required, modify their laws, 
policies, and practices relating to migration, asylum, and citizenship, on the 
basis of relevant international human rights instruments, and not solely on 
the basis of security considerations; they shall notably avoid any 
criminalization or ethnic approach to such issues, thus making the said laws, 
policies and practices free from racial, religious and ethnic discrimination 
and compatible with State obligations as enshrined in international human 
rights instruments; 
</i></p>
<p><i>2. States parties shall take all other necessary actions to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular the new 
contemporary forms of racism, through specific measures and programmes, 
including in the areas of legislation, judiciary and administrative systems, 
education and information. 
</i></p>
<p>The proposal was supported by Mexico and Ecuador. Argentina also expressed interest in 
the proposal. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10366 
</p>
<p>35. The United Kingdom made the following proposal, building on the United States 
proposal: 
</p>
<p><i> That experts be invited to brief the Ad Hoc Committee on the implementation 
of national anti-discrimination legislation.  
</i></p>
<p>The proposal was supported by Argentina, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Denmark, the United 
States and Canada. 
</p>
<p>36. The Chairperson opened the 6th meeting, explaining that further consultations were 
necessary before the programme of work could be adopted. The agreement to continue the 
discussion of issues put forward in alphabetical order, as recorded in the draft programme 
of work not yet adopted, was therefore extended.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Discrimination based on religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>37. Statements and/or text proposals were made by Pakistan (on behalf of the OIC), Iran 
(Islamic Republic of), South Africa, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, Mexico (on 
behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Japan, 
the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Uruguay), Denmark, United States of America, 
Sweden (on behalf of the EU), Azerbaijan, Norway, Poland, France, Germany, Nigeria (on 
behalf of the African Group). The following observer made a statement: Becket Fund for 
Religious Liberty (see A/HRC/13/CRP.1). 
38. Pakistan, on behalf of the OIC, made the following proposals: 
</p>
<p><i>1. States parties shall prohibit by law the uttering of matters that are grossly 
abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion thereby 
causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents to that 
religion; 
</i></p>
<p><i>2. States parties must enact legal prohibitions on publication of material that

<p>82. Switzerland, on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican 
Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua and Uruguay stated that it favoured an 
inclusive approach to multiple and aggravated forms of discrimination and that there was

their uniquely disadvantaged positions in society;  
</i></p>
<p><i>3. That States shall prosecute civil and criminal cases of violations of the

<p><i>2. An international legal rule on non-discrimination (without distinction as to 
race, colour, or national or ethnic origin) in the assistance and protection of 
persons affected by natural disasters in relation to the immediate response, 
reconstruction and prevention, through measures of risk reduction made 
regarding the needs, especially of the most vulnerable, would be a clear 
advance in the elimination of discrimination on an increasing portion of

<p><b>20</b> GE.10-10366 
</p>
<p><i> This issue should be taken into consideration by the Ad Hoc Committee due 
to the lack of application of principles and the lack of incorporation of these 
principles by States, especially the lack of typification in the national legislation of 
actions, public declarations and propaganda oriented to discrimination or promote 
against migrants and their families.  
</i></p>
<p>89. Ecuador associated itself with the statement made by GRULAC and suggested that

of their human rights by international migrants in vulnerable situations, in 
particular with regard to the protection against discrimination based on race, 
colour, descent or ethnic origin.   
</i></p>
<p>91. Nigeria, on behalf of the African Group, presented the following proposal:

<p><i>2. States parties shall combat, prevent and prohibit by law any racist, 
discriminatory and xenophobic practices against migrants in relation to

accordance with international human rights instruments, free from racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  
</i></p>

migrants and actively discourage and protect against all racist 
demonstrations, acts and practices that generate xenophobic behaviour and 
negative sentiments towards, or rejection of, migrants;  
</i></p>
<p><i>4. States parties shall recognize the same economic opportunities and 
responsibilities to documented long-term migrants as to other members of

<p>GE.10-10366 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><i>2. States parties should criminalize acts and crimes where racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance are aggravating motives,

good idea and could be modelled on the European protocol.</i>  
</p>
<p>106. Sweden, on behalf of the EU, flagged the need to use the potential of the Internet to

of excessive legislation or technical measures.  
</p>
<p>107. The EU submitted the following proposals:  
</p>
<p><i>1. States should ensure that any restrictions to the right to freedom of 
expression are only on grounds outlined in articles 19 (3) and 20; States

essential foundations of a democratic society, as it ensures individual self-
fulfilment and a pluralistic, tolerant society with access to multitudes of ideas 
and philosophies;
