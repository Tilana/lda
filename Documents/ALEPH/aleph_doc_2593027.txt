CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than statements of historical facts,
included in this report that address activities, events or developments that the Company expects, believes or
anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this report specifically include the expectations of plans,
strategies, objectives and anticipated financial and operating results of the Company, including guidance regarding the
timing and location of our anticipated drilling and completion activity, our ability to increase capital spending in
connection with leasing, our ability to mitigate commodity price risk through our hedging program, our revised 2016
capital expenditure program, our ability to fund the revised 2016 capital budget largely with free cash flow, our ability
to close the pending acquisition of assets in the Anadarko basin and the expected benefits from such acquisition, and
our ability to successfully execute our 2016 development plan and guidance for the remaining quarters and full year
2016. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by the Company based on management’s
experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors
believed to be appropriate. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of
which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied
or expressed by the forward-looking statements. These include, but are not limited to, changes in prices for oil, natural
gas liquids, and natural gas prices, weather, including its impact on oil and natural gas demand and weather-related
delays on operations, the amount, nature and timing of planned capital expenditures, availability and method of
funding acquisitions and divestitures, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results,
operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital
markets generally, as well as our ability to access them, customers’ elections to reject ethane and include it as part
of the natural gas stream, ability to fund our 2016 capital expenditure budget, the proximity to and capacity of
transportation facilities, and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory
developments affecting the Company’s business and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those projected as described in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company
undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Jones Energy, Inc.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
1.                            Organization and Description of Business
Organization
Jones Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed in March 2013 as a Delaware corporation to become a publicly-traded
entity and the holding company of Jones Energy Holdings, LLC (“JEH”). As the sole managing member of JEH, the
Company is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to JEH’s business and
consolidates the financial results of JEH and its subsidiaries.
JEH was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on December 16, 2009 through investments made by the
Jones family and through private equity funds managed by Metalmark Capital and Wells Fargo Energy Capital
(collectively, the “Pre-IPO Owners”). JEH acts as a holding company of operating subsidiaries that own and operate
assets that are used in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties.
The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and
Class B common stock. The Class B common stock is held by the owners of JEH prior to the Company’s initial public
offering (“IPO”) and can be exchanged (together with a corresponding number of units representing membership
interests in JEH (“JEH Units”)) for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary
conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications and other similar transactions. The
Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles its holders to one vote on all matters to be voted on by
the Company’s stockholders generally. As a result of the IPO and as of June 30, 2016, the Pre-IPO Owners had
74.7% and 50.0%, respectively, of the total economic interest in JEH, but with no voting rights or management power
over JEH, resulting in the Company reporting this ownership interest as a non-controlling interest.
Description of Business
The Company is engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties
in the mid-continent United States. The Company’s assets are located within the Anadarko and Arkoma basins of
Texas and Oklahoma, and are owned by JEH and its operating subsidiaries. The Company is headquartered in Austin,
Texas.
2.                            Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2015 and the financial
statements reported for June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the three and six month periods then ended include the Company
and all of its subsidiaries.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
These interim financial statements have not been audited. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary for a fair statement of the financial statements have been included, and all such adjustments are of a
normal, reoccurring nature. As these are interim financial statements, they do not include all disclosures required for
financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results
of operations or cash flows for a full year.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all
disclosures required by GAAP and should be read in conjunction with our most recent audited consolidated financial
statements included in Jones Energy, Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Use of Estimates
There have been no significant changes in our use of estimates since those reported in Jones Energy, Inc.’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Adopted in the current year-to-date period:
In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement—Extraordinary and Unusual Items. This
ASU removes the concept of extraordinary items from GAAP. Under existing guidance, an entity is required to
separately disclose extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if
an event or transaction is of an unusual nature and occurs infrequently. This separate, net of tax presentation will no
longer be allowed. The amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. Therefore, the Company has adopted ASU No. 2015-01 for the period ended March 31, 2016.
Adoption did not have a material impact on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. Entities that have historically presented debt issuance costs as an asset,
related to a recognized debt liability, will be required to present those costs as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability. The ASU does not change the recognition, measurement, or subsequent measurement
guidance for debt issuance costs. Adoption of this ASU will be applied retrospectively. In August 2015, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest—Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), which addresses the presentation or
subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, given the absence of
authoritative guidance within ASU No. 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The
amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Therefore, the
Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 beginning with the period ended March 31, 2016. Changes to the balance sheet
have been applied on a retrospective basis. This resulted in the reclassification of debt issuance costs of $10.3
million from Other assets to Long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the period ended December 31,
2015. Adoption did not have a material impact on the financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
To be adopted in a future period:
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which creates a new topic in the ASC, topic 606, “Revenue
from Contracts with Customers.” This ASU sets forth a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is
recognized. Under the model, an entity will be required to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or
services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or
services. Additional disclosures will be required to describe the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from customer contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the
effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The amendments are now effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and may be applied on either a full or modified retrospective basis. Early
adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of Update 2014-09 and Update
2015-14 will have on our financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This amendment requires, among other things,
that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement
date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a
discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control
the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition
approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the
financial statements. The amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the amendments to our financial statements
and accounting practices for leases.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This amendment is
intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment awards to employees, specifically in regard to (1) the
income tax consequences, (2) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and (3) classification on the
statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of
ASU 2016-09 will have on our financial statements.

There were no exploratory wells drilled or completed during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and as
such, no associated costs were capitalized.
The Company did not capitalize any interest during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as no projects lasted more
than six months. Costs incurred to maintain wells and related equipment are charged to expense as incurred.
Depletion of oil and gas properties amounted to $37.8 million and $79.3 million for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, and $51.0 million and $102.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015,
respectively.
Due to the decline in forward commodity prices in early 2016, the Company continues to monitor its proved and

Senior Unsecured Notes
On April 1, 2014, JEH and Jones Energy Finance Corp., JEH’s wholly owned subsidiary formed for the sole purpose
of co-issuing certain of JEH’s debt (together the “Issuers”), sold $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the
Issuers’ 6.75% senior notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). The Company used the net proceeds from the issuance of
the 2022 Notes to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan ($160.0 million), a portion of the outstanding
borrowings under the Revolver ($308.0 million) and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company
subsequently terminated the Term Loan in accordance with its terms. The 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.75%
per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year beginning October 1, 2014. The 2022 Notes
were registered in March 2015.
On February 23, 2015, the Issuers sold $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.25% senior notes due 2023
(the “2023 Notes”) in a private placement to affiliates of GSO Capital Partners LP and Magnetar Capital LLC. The
2023 Notes were issued at a discounted price equal to 94.59% of the principal amount. The Company used the $236.5
million net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes to repay outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and for
working capital and general corporate purposes. The 2023 Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.25% per year, payable
semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning September 15, 2015. The 2023 Notes were
registered in February 2016.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, through several open market and privately negotiated purchases, the
Company purchased an aggregate principal amount of $190.9 million of its senior unsecured notes. As of June 30,
2016, the Company had purchased $90.9 million principal amount of its 2022 Notes for $38.1 million, and $100.0
million principal amount of its 2023 Notes for $46.5 million, in each case excluding accrued interest and including any
associated fees. The Company used cash on hand and borrowings from its Revolver to fund the note purchases. In
conjunction with the extinguishment of this debt, JEH recognized cancellation of debt income of $8.9 and $99.5
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, on a pre-tax basis. This income is recorded in
Gain on debt extinguishment on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. Of the Company’s total
repurchases, $20.3 million principal amount of its 2022 Notes were not cancelled and are available
for future reissuance, subject to applicable securities laws.
The 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and by all of its
significant subsidiaries. The 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes will be senior in right of payment to any future subordinated
indebtedness of the Issuers.
The Company may redeem the 2022 Notes at any time on or after April 1, 2017 and the 2023 Notes at any time on or
after March 15, 2018 at a declining redemption price set forth in the respective indentures, plus accrued and unpaid
interest.
The indentures governing the 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes are substantially identical and contain covenants that,
among other things, limit the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock,
pay dividends on capital stock, transfer or sell assets, make investments, create certain liens, enter into agreements
that restrict dividends or other payments from the Company’s restricted subsidiaries to the Company, consolidate,
merge or transfer all of the Company’s assets, engage in transactions with affiliates or create unrestricted
subsidiaries. If at any time when the 2022 Notes or 2023 Notes are rated investment grade and no default or event of
default (as defined in the indenture) has occurred and is continuing, many of the foregoing covenants pertaining to the
2022 Notes or 2023 Notes, as applicable, will be suspended. If the ratings on the 2022 Notes or 2023 Notes, as
applicable, were to decline subsequently to below investment grade, the suspended covenants would be reinstated.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the indentures governing the 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes.
Other Long-Term Debt
The Company entered into two credit agreements dated December 31, 2009, with Wells Fargo Bank N.A, the Senior
Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolver”) and the Second Lien Term Loan (the “Term Loan”), each of which
has been amended. On April 1, 2014, the Term Loan was repaid in full and terminated in connection with the issuance
of the 2022 Notes. On November 6, 2014, the Company amended the Revolver to extend the maturity date of the
Revolver to November 6, 2019. The Company’s oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral to secure its
obligations under the Revolver. The borrowing base on the Revolver was subsequently adjusted to $562.5 million in
accordance with its terms as a result of the issuance of the 2023 Notes in February 2015 and was reaffirmed at this
level effective April 1, 2015. Effective October 8,
Table of Contents

2015, the borrowing base was reduced to $510 million during the semi-annual borrowing base re-determination. On
August 1, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revolver. See Note 14, “Subsequent Events” for
further details of this amendment. Pursuant to the amendment to the Revolver, the borrowing base on the Revolver
was set at $410.0 million effective immediately, with an increase to $425.0 million upon closing of our executed
Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire producing and undeveloped oil and gas assets in the Anadarko Basin (the
“Pending Anadarko Acquisition”).
The terms of the Revolver require the Company to make periodic payments of interest on the loans outstanding
thereunder, with all outstanding principal and interest under the Revolver due on the maturity date. The Revolver is
subject to a borrowing base which limits the amount of borrowings which may be drawn thereunder. The borrowing
base will be re-determined by the lenders at least semi-annually on or about April 1 and October 1 of each year, with
such re-determination based primarily on reserve reports using lender commodity price expectations at such time.
Any reduction in the borrowing base will reduce our liquidity, and, if the reduction results in the outstanding amount
under our revolving credit facility exceeding the borrowing base, we will be required to repay the deficiency within a
short period of time.
Interest on the Revolver is calculated, at the Company’s option, at either (a) the London Interbank Offered (“LIBO”)
rate for the applicable interest period plus a margin of 1.50% to 2.50% based on the level of borrowing base utilization
at such time or (b) the greatest of the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, the one month adjusted LIBO rate plus 1.00%, or
the prime rate announced by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in effect on such day, in each case plus a margin of 0.50% to
1.50% based on the level of borrowing base utilization at such time. For the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, the average interest rates under the Revolver were 2.25% and 2.43%, respectively, on average outstanding
balances of $185.0 million and $164.0 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the
average interest rates under the Revolver were 2.35% and 2.43%, respectively, on average outstanding balances of
$100.0 million and $185.5 million, respectively.
Total interest and commitment fees under the Revolver were $1.3 million and $2.6 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and $1.0 million and $3.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30,
2015, respectively.
Jones Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are subject to certain covenants under the Revolver, including
the requirement to maintain the following financial ratios:
·                                          a total leverage ratio, consisting of consolidated debt to EBITDAX, of not
greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and
·                                          a current ratio, consisting of consolidated current assets, including the unused
amounts of the total commitments, to consolidated current liabilities, of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as
of the last day of any fiscal quarter.
As of June 30, 2016, our total leverage ratio is approximately 3.2 and our current ratio is approximately 6.2, as
calculated based on the requirements in our covenants. We are in compliance with all terms of our Revolver at
June 30, 2016.
5.                            Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in commodity prices. While the use of these
instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price changes, their use may also limit future revenues from favorable
price changes. Depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management’s view of underlying supply
and demand trends, we may increase or decrease our hedging positions.
The following tables summarize our hedging positions as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The Company recognized net losses on derivative instruments of $40.0 million and $22.8 million for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. The Company recognized net losses on derivative instruments of $25.1
million and net gains of $21.2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively,
The Company routinely enters into oil and natural gas swap contracts as seller, thus resulting in a fixed price. In early
2016, the Company crystalized certain mark-to-market gains associated with oil and natural gas hedges the Company
had in place for years 2018 and 2019. The gains were effectively crystalized by purchasing, as opposed to selling, oil
and natural gas swap contracts for the equal volume that was associated with the initial hedge transaction. Therefore,
as prices fluctuate, the loss (or gain) on any single contract in 2018 and 2019 will be offset by an equal gain (or loss).
This essentially leaves the underlying production open to fluctuations in market prices. Since no contracts were
canceled or liquidated, the gains will be recognized as the hedge contracts mature in 2018 and 2019. Information
related to these purchased oil and natural gas swap contracts is presented in the table above as the “offset exercise
price”, and the volumes in the table above are presented “net” of such purchased oil and natural gas swap contracts.
Offsetting Assets and Liabilities
As of June 30, 2016 the counterparties to our commodity derivative contracts consisted of six financial institutions.
All of our counterparties or their affiliates are also lenders under the Revolver. We are not generally required to post
additional collateral under our derivative agreements.
Our derivative agreements contain set-off provisions that state that in the event of default or early termination, any
obligation owed by the defaulting party may be offset against any obligation owed to the defaulting party.
We adopted the guidance requiring disclosure of both gross and net information about financial instruments eligible for
netting in the balance sheet under our derivative agreements. The following table presents information about our
commodity derivative contracts that are netted on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 and

6.                            Fair Value Measurement
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company determines fair value amounts using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or
estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
The Company enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments, which may include over-the-counter
instruments, such as natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquid contracts. The Company utilizes valuation
techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. If listed market prices or quotes are not
published, fair value is determined based upon a market quote, adjusted by other market-based or independently
sourced market data, such as trading volume, historical commodity volatility, and counterparty-specific
considerations. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality, the time value of
money, and the liquidity of the market.
Counterparty credit valuation adjustments are necessary when the market price of an instrument is not indicative of
the fair value as a result of the credit quality of the counterparty. Generally, market quotes assume that all
counterparties have low default rates and equal credit quality. Therefore, an adjustment may be necessary to reflect
the quality of a specific counterparty to determine the fair value of the instrument. The Company currently has all
derivative positions placed and held by members of its lending group, which have high credit quality.
Liquidity valuation adjustments are necessary when the Company is not able to observe a recent market price for
financial instruments that trade in less active markets. Exchange traded contracts are valued at market value without
making any additional valuation adjustments; therefore, no liquidity reserve is applied.
Valuation Hierarchy
Fair value measurements are grouped into a three-level valuation hierarchy. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument’s
categorization within the hierarchy is based upon the input that requires the highest degree of judgment in the
determination of the instrument’s fair value. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level 1                  Pricing inputs are based on published prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2                  Pricing inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, as of
the reporting date. Contracts that are not traded on a recognized exchange or are tied to pricing
transactions for which forward curve pricing is readily available are classified as Level 2
instruments. These include natural gas, crude oil and some natural gas liquids price swaps and
natural gas basis swaps.
Level 3                  Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally unobservable from
objective sources. The Company classifies natural gas liquid swaps and basis swaps for which
future pricing is not readily available as Level 3. The Company obtains estimates from
independent third parties for its open positions and subjects those to the credit adjustment criteria
described above.
The financial instruments carried at fair value as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, by consolidated balance
sheet caption and by valuation hierarchy, as described above are as follows:

Significant increases/decreases in natural gas liquid prices in isolation would result in a significantly lower/higher fair
value measurement. The following table presents the changes in the Level 3 financial instruments for the six months
ended June 30, 2016. Changes in fair value of Level 3 instruments represent changes in gains and losses for the
periods that are reported in other income (expense). New contracts entered into during the year are generally entered
into at no cost with changes in fair value from the date of agreement representing the entire fair value of the
instrument. Transfers between levels are evaluated at the end of the reporting period.

The Revolver (as defined in Note 4) is categorized as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy as the debt is not publicly
traded and no observable market exists to determine the fair value; however, the carrying value of the Revolver
approximates fair value, as it is subject to short-term floating interest rates that approximate the rates available to the
Company for those periods.
Table of Contents

The fair value of the 2022 Notes (as defined in Note 4) is based on pricing that is readily available in the public
market. Accordingly, the 2022 Notes are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy as the pricing is based on
quoted market prices for the debt securities and is actively traded.
The fair value of the 2023 Notes (as defined in Note 4) is based on indicative pricing that is available in the public
market. Accordingly, the 2023 Notes are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy as the pricing is based on
quoted market prices for the debt securities but is not actively traded.
The Company reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment purposes by comparing the expected
undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. Significant
assumptions associated with the calculation of future cash flows used in the impairment analysis include the
Company’s estimate of future commodity prices, production costs, development expenditures, production, risk-
adjusted discount rates, and other relevant data. As such, the fair value of oil and gas properties used in estimating
impairment represents a nonrecurring Level 3 measurement.

Effective January 1, 2010, JEH implemented a management incentive plan that provided indirect awards of
membership interests in JEH to members of senior management (“management units”). These awards had various
vesting schedules, and a portion of the management units vested in a lump sum at the IPO date. In connection with
the IPO, both the vested and unvested management units were converted into the right to receive JEH Units and
shares of Class B common stock. The JEH Units (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B
common stock) will become exchangeable under this plan into a like number of shares of Class A common stock
upon vesting or forfeiture. No new management units have been awarded since the IPO and no new JEH Units or
shares of Class B common stock are created upon a vesting event. Grants listed below reflect the transfer of JEH
Units that occurred upon forfeiture.
The following table summarizes information related to the vesting of management units as of June 30, 2016:

2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan
Under the Amended and Restated Jones Energy, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”), established in
conjunction with the Company’s IPO and amended on May 4, 2016 following approval by the Company’s
stockholders, the Company has reserved a total of 7,350,000 shares of Class A common stock for non-employee
director, consultant, and employee stock-based compensation awards.
The Company granted (i) performance share unit and restricted stock unit awards to certain officers and employees
and (ii) restricted shares of Class A common stock to the Company’s non-employee directors under the LTIP during
2014, 2015 and 2016. During 2016, the Company also granted performance unit awards to certain members of the
senior management team under the LTIP.
Restricted Stock Unit Awards
The Company has outstanding restricted stock unit awards granted to certain officers and employees of the Company
under the LTIP. The fair value of the restricted stock unit awards is based on the value of the Company’s Class A
common stock on the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period, which
is typically three years.

and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses on the
Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Performance Share Unit Awards
The Company has outstanding performance share unit awards granted to certain members of the senior management
team of the Company under the LTIP. The performance share unit awards were described in earlier filings as
performance unit awards. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company created a new class of equity award,
described below as a performance unit award, that is settled in cash rather than shares of the Company’s Class A
common stock. As a result, references to performance unit awards in prior filings refer to this description of
performance share unit awards.
Upon the completion of the applicable three-year performance period, each recipient may vest in a number of
performance share units. The percent of awarded performance share units in which each recipient vests at such time,
if any, will range from 0% to 200% based on the Company’s total shareholder return relative to an industry peer group
over the applicable three-year performance period. Each vested performance share unit is exchangeable for one share
of the Company’s Class A common stock. The grant date fair value of the performance share units was determined
using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which results in an estimated percentage of performance share units earned.
The fair value of the performance share units is expensed on a straight-line basis over the applicable three-year
performance period.
The following assumptions were used for the Monte Carlo model to determine the grant date fair value and associated
stock-based compensation expense of the performance share unit awards granted during the six months ended
June 30, 2016:

months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses on the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Performance Unit Awards
The Company has outstanding performance unit awards, granted initially in 2016, to certain members of the senior
management team of the Company under the LTIP. References to performance unit awards in prior filings do not
correspond to these newly created performance unit awards. Upon the completion of the applicable three-year
performance period, each recipient may vest in a number of performance units. The value of awarded performance
units in which each recipient vests at such time, if any, will range from $0 to $200 per performance unit based on the
Company’s total shareholder return relative to an industry peer group over the applicable three-year performance
period. For accounting purposes, the performance units are treated as a liability award with the liability being
remeasured at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, the expense associated with these
awards is subject to volatility until the payout is finally determined at the end of the performance
period. The value of the performance units was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation
model, as of the grant date, which results in an estimated final value upon vesting of $1.3 million.
The fair value measured as of June 30, 2016 increased to $1.4 million.
The following assumptions were used for the Monte Carlo model to determine the grant date fair value and associated
stock-based compensation expense of the performance unit awards granted during the six months ended June 30,

For the performance units granted during the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Monte Carlo simulation model

Stock compensation expense associated with the performance unit awards was less than $0.1 million for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, and is included in general and administrative expenses on the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of June 30, 2016, $1.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense
related to the performance unit awards, subject to remeasurement and adjustment for the change in estimated final
value as of the end of each reporting period, is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average
service period of 2.5 years.
Restricted Stock Awards
The Company has outstanding restricted stock awards granted to the Company’s non-employee members of the
Board of Directors under the LTIP. The restricted stock will vest upon the director serving as a director of the
Company for a one-year service period in accordance with the terms of the award. The fair value of the awards was
based on the price of the Company’s Class A common stock on the date of grant.

9.                            Income Taxes
The Company records federal and state income tax liabilities associated with its status as a corporation. The
Company recognizes a tax liability on its share of pre-tax book income, exclusive of the non-controlling interest. JEH
is not subject to income tax at the federal level and only recognizes Texas franchise tax expense.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 17.4% and 14.3% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively and 20.8% and 19.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The effective rate
differs from the statutory rate of 35% due to net income allocated to the non-controlling interest, percentage depletion,
state income taxes, and other permanent differences between book and tax accounting.
The Company’s income tax provision was a benefit of $12.4 million and $1.7 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and a benefit of $13.5 million and $11.1 million for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015, respectively.
The following table summarizes information related to the allocation of the income tax provision between the
controlling and non-controlling interests:

The Company had deferred tax assets for its federal and state net operating loss carry forwards at June 30, 2016
recorded in its deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of
June 30, 2016, we have a valuation allowance of $2.7 million as a result of management’s assessment of the
realizability of deferred tax assets in Oklahoma. Management believes that there will be sufficient future taxable
income based on the reversal of temporary differences to enable utilization of substantially all other tax carryforwards.
Tax Receivable Agreement
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company had recorded a TRA liability of $38.1 million for the
estimated payments that will be made to the pre-IPO members who have exchanged shares. Such exchanges
generated tax basis increases leading to deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of $44.8
million, net of valuation allowance. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the amount of the TRA
liability was increased by $0.3 million and reduced by $0.2 million, respectively, as a result of the valuation allowance
recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets, and is included in other income (expense) on the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Operations. The reduction in the TRA liability was offset by an increase of $0.2 million
recorded against equity. To the extent the Company does not realize all of the tax benefits in future years or in the
event of a change in future tax rates, this liability may change.
Table of Contents
16
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had not made any payments under the TRA to pre-IPO members who have
exchanged JEH Units and Class B common stock for Class A common stock. The Company does not anticipate
making a material payment under the TRA in 2016. However, the Company projects to make a payment in 2017 as a
result of 2016 taxable income.
Cash Tax Distributions
The holders of JEH Units, including Jones Energy, Inc., incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their
share of any taxable income of JEH. Under the terms of its operating agreement, JEH is generally required to make
quarterly pro-rata cash tax distributions to its unitholders (including us) based on income allocated to its unitholders
through the end of each relevant quarter, as adjusted to take into account good faith projections by the Company of
taxable income or loss for the remainder of the calendar year, to the extent JEH has cash available for such
distributions and subject to certain other restrictions. This tax distribution is computed based on the estimate of net
taxable income of JEH allocated to the holders of JEH Units multiplied by the highest marginal effective rate of
federal, state and local income tax applicable to an individual resident in New York, New York, without regard for the
federal benefit of the deduction for any state taxes.
A Special Committee of the Board of Directors comprised solely of directors who do not have a direct or indirect
interest in such distribution approved, and JEH made, aggregate cash tax distributions of approximately $20.0 million
to its unitholders towards its total 2016 projected tax distribution obligation. The distributions were made pro-rata to all
members of JEH, and included a $9.9 million payment to the Company, and a $10.1 million payment to Pre-IPO
Owners. The 2016 tax distributions are the result of taxable income generated by our operations and debt
extinguishment.
10.                     Stockholders’ equity
Stockholders’ equity is comprised of two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common
stock. The Class B common stock is held by the owners of JEH prior to the Company’s IPO and can be exchanged
(together with a corresponding number of units representing membership interests in JEH Units) for shares of Class A
common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock
dividends and reclassifications and other similar transactions. The Class B common stock has no economic rights but
entitles its holders to one vote on all matters to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders generally.
Equity Distribution Agreement
On May 24, 2016, the Company and Jones Energy Holdings, LLC entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement
(“Equity Distribution Agreement”) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (each, a
“Manager” and collectively, the “Managers”). Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company
may sell from time to time through the Managers, as the Company’s sales agents, the Company’s Class A common
stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $73.0 million (the “Class A Shares”). Under the terms of the Equity
Distribution Agreement, the Company may also sell Class A Shares from time to time to any Manager as principal for
its own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of Class A Shares to a Manager as
principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate terms agreement between the Company and such Manager.
Sales of the Class A Shares, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions, to or through a market
maker or directly on or through an electronic communication network, a “dark pool” or any similar market venue, or as
otherwise agreed by the Company and one or more of the Managers.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold approximately 0.3 million Class A Shares under the
Equity Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $1.1 million ($1.3 million gross proceeds, net of
approximately $0.2 million in commissions and professional services expenses). The Company used the net proceeds
for general corporate purposes. At June 30, 2016, approximately $71.7 million in aggregate offering proceeds
remained available to be issued and sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement.
11.                     Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to controlling interests by the
weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Shares of Class B
common stock are not included in the calculation of earnings per share because they are not participating securities
and have no economic interest in the Company. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilutive
effect of shares that could be issued by the Company in conjunction with stock awards that have been granted to
directors and employees. Awards of nonvested shares are considered outstanding as of the respective grant dates for
purposes of computing diluted EPS even though the award is contingent upon vesting. For the three and six months
ending June 30, 2016, 1,295,182 restricted stock units, and 1,035,205 performance share units were excluded from
the calculation as they would have had an anti-dilutive effect.

12.                     Related Parties
Related Party Transactions
Transactions with Our Executive Officers, Directors and 5% Stockholders
On May 7, 2013, the Company entered into a natural gas sale and purchase agreement with Monarch Natural
Gas, LLC, (“Monarch”), under which Monarch has the first right to gather the natural gas the Company produces from
dedicated properties, process the NGLs from this natural gas production and market the processed natural gas and
extracted NGLs. Effective May 1, 2015, the rights to gather natural gas under the sale and purchase agreement
transferred from Monarch to Enable Midstream Partners LP, (“Enable”), an unaffiliated third party. Therefore, no
related party revenue relating to natural gas and NGL production was recognized during 2016 associated with the
aforementioned agreement. The initial term of the agreement, which remains unchanged by the transfer to Enable,
runs for 10 years from the effective date of September 1, 2013.
At the time the Company entered into the 2013 Monarch agreement, Metalmark Capital owned approximately 81% of
the outstanding equity interests of Monarch. In addition, Metalmark Capital beneficially owns in excess of five percent
of the Company’s outstanding equity interests and two of our directors, Howard I. Hoffen and Gregory D. Myers, are
managing directors of Metalmark Capital.
In connection with the Company’s entering into the 2013 Monarch agreement, Monarch issued to JEH equity interests
in Monarch, having an estimated fair value of $15 million, in return for marketing services to be provided throughout
the term of the agreement. The Company recorded this amount as deferred revenue which is being amortized on an
estimated units-of-production basis commencing in September 2013, the first month of product sales to Monarch. The
Company amortized $0.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of the deferred revenue balance during the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, during the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015. This revenue is included in other revenues on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of
Operations.
In September 2014, the Company signed a 10 year oil gathering and transportation agreement with Monarch Oil
Pipeline LLC, pursuant to which Monarch Oil Pipeline LLC built, at its expense, a new oil gathering system and
connected the gathering system to dedicated Company leases in Texas. At the time the Company entered into the
agreement, Metalmark Capital owned the majority of the outstanding equity interests of Monarch Oil Pipeline LLC
and/or its parent. The system began service during the fourth quarter of 2015 and provides connectivity to both a
regional refinery market as well as the Cushing market hub. The Company incurred gathering fees, which were paid to
Monarch Oil Pipeline LLC, of $0.7 million and $1.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively, associated with the approximately 0.3 MMBoe and 0.7 MMBoe of oil production transported under the
agreement. These costs are recorded as an offset to Oil and gas sales in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of
Operations. The aforementioned production was recognized as Oil and gas sales on the Company’s
18
Table of Contents
Consolidated Statement of Operations at the time it was sold to the purchasers, who are unaffiliated third parties, after
passing through the gathering and transportation system.
Purchase of Senior Unsecured Notes
On February 29, 2016, JEH and Jones Energy Finance Corp. purchased $50.0 million principal amount of their
outstanding 2023 Notes from investment funds managed by Magnetar Capital and its affiliates, which investment
funds collectively own more than 5% of a class of voting securities of the Company, for approximately $23.3 million
excluding accrued interest and including any associated fees. On the same day, JEH and Jones Energy Finance
Corp. purchased an additional $50.0 million principal amount of their outstanding 2023 Notes from investment funds
managed by Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. and its affiliates, which investment funds collectively own more
than 5% of a class of voting securities of the Company, for approximately $23.3 million excluding accrued interest
and including any associated fees. In conjunction with the extinguishment of this $100.0 million principal amount of
debt, JEH recognized cancellation of debt income of $48.3 million on a pre-tax basis. This income is recorded in Gain
on debt extinguishment on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.
13.                     Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. When
applicable, we record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be
incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. While the outcome of lawsuits and
other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management,
individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits are expected to have a material effect on our
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
In an action filed on June 12, 2015 in the 31st District Court of Hemphill County, Texas, Donna Kim
Flowers and Mitchell Kirk Flowers v. Jones Energy, LLC f/k/a Jones Energy Limited, LLC f/k/a
Jones Energy, Ltd. (Case No. 7225), the Company was sued by Donna Kim Flowers and Mitchell
Kirk Flowers (the “plaintiffs”). The plaintiffs own surface rights to property located in Hemphill
County, Texas. The mineral rights are leased to third parties, and the Company is the operator of
the Oil and Gas Mineral Lease. On May 28, 2010, the plaintiffs and the Company entered into a
Surface Use Agreement concerning Jones’ fracking operations on the property, which require the
Company to minimize disruption and damage to the plaintiffs’ surface rights. The plaintiffs allege
that the Company is in breach of such contract, and seek monetary damages. In June 2016, the
Company presented a settlement offer to the plaintiffs. As a result of this settlement offer, the
Company has accrued $1.5 million related to its estimated obligation under this settlement offer.
This accrual was included in accrued liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet
as of June 30, 2016, and the charge was recorded as general and administrative expense on the
Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
However, no certainty exists that a settlement will be reached or if so, the amount of any such
settlement. Therefore, the ultimate loss could be greater or less than the amount accrued. In the
event the plaintiffs and the Company are not able to reach a settlement, a court date has been set
for October 31, 2016.
14.                     Subsequent Events
Borrowing Base Redetermination
On August 1, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Revolver to, among other things (i) require that
the Company’s deposit accounts and securities accounts (subject to certain exclusions) become subject to control
agreements, (ii) restrict the Company from making borrowings under the Revolver if the Company has or, after giving
effect to the borrowing, will have a Consolidated Cash Balance (as defined in the Revolver) in excess of $30.0 million
and (iii) set the borrowing base under the Revolver at $410.0 million effective immediately, with an increase to $425.0
million upon closing of the Pending Anadarko Acquisition.
15.                     Subsidiary Guarantors
On April 1, 2014, the Issuers sold $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes. On February 23,
2015, the Issuers sold $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes.
The 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and by all of JEH’s
current subsidiaries (except Jones Energy Finance Corp. and two immaterial subsidiaries) and certain future
subsidiaries, including any future subsidiaries that guarantee any indebtedness under the Revolver. Each subsidiary
guarantor is 100% owned by JEH, and all guarantees are full and unconditional, subject to customary exceptions
pursuant to the indentures governing our 2022 Notes
Table of Contents
19
and 2023 Notes, as discussed below, and joint and several with all other subsidiary guarantees and the parent
guarantee. Any subsidiaries of JEH other than the subsidiary guarantors and Jones Energy Finance Corp. are
immaterial.
Guarantees of the 2022 Notes and 2023 Notes will be released under certain circumstances, including (i) in
connection with any sale or other disposition of (a) all or substantially all of the properties or assets of a guarantor
(including by way of merger or consolidation) or (b) all of the capital stock of such guarantor, in each case, to a person
that is not the Company or a restricted subsidiary of the Company, (ii) if the Company designates any restricted
subsidiary that is a guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, (iii) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or
satisfaction and discharge of the applicable indenture, or (iv) at such time as such guarantor ceases to guarantee any
other indebtedness of the Company or any other guarantor.
The Company is a holding company whose sole material asset is an equity interest in JEH. The Company is the sole
managing member of JEH and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions related to
JEH’s business. In accordance with JEH’s limited liability company agreement, the Company may not be removed as
the sole managing member of JEH.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company held approximately 50.0% of the economic interest in JEH, with the remaining
50.0% economic interest held by a group of investors that owned interests in JEH prior to the Company’s IPO (the
“Pre-IPO Owners”). The Pre-IPO Owners have no voting rights with respect to their economic interest in JEH.
The Company has two classes of common stock, Class A common stock, which was sold to investors in the IPO,
and Class B common stock. Pursuant to the Company’s certificate of incorporation, each share of Class A common
stock is entitled to one vote per share, and the shares of Class A common stock are entitled to 100% of the
economic interests in the Company. Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights in the Company,
but entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by the Company’s stockholders generally.
In connection with a reorganization that occurred immediately prior to the IPO, each Existing Owner was issued a
number of shares of Class B common stock that was equal to the number of JEH Units that such Existing Owner
held. Holders of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock generally vote together as a
single class on all matters presented to the Company’s stockholders for their vote or approval. Accordingly, the Pre-
IPO Owners collectively have a number of votes in the Company equal to the aggregate number of JEH Units that
they hold.
The Pre-IPO Owners have the right, pursuant to the terms of an Exchange Agreement by and among the Company,
JEH and each of the Pre-IPO Owners, to exchange their JEH Units (together with a corresponding number of shares
of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary
conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications and other similar transactions. As
a result, the Company expects that over time the Company will have an increasing economic interest in JEH as
Class B common stock and JEH Units are exchanged for Class A common stock. Moreover, any transfers of JEH
Units outside of the Exchange Agreement (other than permitted transfers to affiliates) must be approved by the
Company. The Company intends to retain full voting and management control over JEH.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction
with the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section and
audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on March 9, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and with
the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto presented in this Quarterly Report and in our
quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, filed on May 6, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Unless indicated otherwise in this Quarterly Report or the context requires otherwise, all references to
“Jones Energy,” the “Company,” “our company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Jones Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries,
including Jones Energy Holdings, LLC (“JEH”). Jones Energy, Inc. (“JONE”) is a holding company whose sole material
asset is an equity interest in JEH.
Overview
We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of
oil and natural gas properties in the mid-continent United States, spanning areas of Texas and Oklahoma. Our
Chairman and CEO, Jonny Jones, founded our predecessor company in 1988 in continuation of his family’s long
history in the oil and gas business, which dates back to the 1920’s. We have grown rapidly by leveraging our focus on
low cost drilling and completion methods and our horizontal drilling expertise to develop our inventory and execute
several strategic acquisitions. We have accumulated extensive knowledge and experience in developing the Anadarko
and Arkoma basins, having concentrated our operations in the Anadarko basin for over 25 years and applied our
knowledge to the Arkoma basin since 2011. We have drilled 836 total wells as operator, including 660 horizontal wells,
since our formation and delivered compelling rates of return over various commodity price cycles. Our operations are
focused on horizontal drilling and completions within two distinct basins in the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma:
·                  the Anadarko Basin—targeting the liquids rich Cleveland, Granite Wash, Tonkawa and
Marmaton formations; and
·                  the Arkoma Basin—targeting the Woodford shale formation.
We seek to optimize returns through a disciplined emphasis on controlling costs and promoting operational
efficiencies, and we are recognized as one of the lowest cost drilling and completion operators in the Cleveland and
Woodford shale formations.
Second Quarter and Year-to-Date 2016 Highlights:
·                  Average daily net production for the second quarter 2016 of 18.6 MBoe/d, with oil
production of 4.4 MBbl/d
·                  Lease operating expense for the second quarter 2016 of $7.5 million, down 12% from
last quarter
·                  Entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 26,000 net acres in Anadarko Basin
for $27.1 million, which is expected to add 92 gross/68 net Cleveland locations in core footprint,
or approximately 1.5 years of drilling inventory at current rig pace
·                  Net loss for the second quarter of 2016 of $58.6 million and EBITDAX of $46.2 million
Pending Anadarko Acquisition
On August 3, 2016, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire producing and
undeveloped oil and gas assets in the Anadarko Basin (the “Pending Anadarko Acquisition”) for $27.1 million, subject
to customary closing adjustments.  The assets subject to the Pending Anadarko Acquisition include approximately
26,000 net acres in Lipscomb and Ochiltree Counties in the Texas Panhandle.  The Company expects to fund the
Pending Anadarko Acquisition with cash on hand, and anticipates the transaction will close by the end of August,
subject to completion of due diligence and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
Pending Anadarko Acquisition Highlights:
·                  Approximately 26,000 net acres in the Anadarko Basin
·                  Expected to add 92 gross/68 net locations in core Cleveland footprint
·                  Acreage is 98% held by production with no near-term lease expirations

·                  Daily net production expected to be approximately 850 Boe/d as of August 2016
Updated Capital Expenditures Outlook
In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we provided an overview of our 2016
capital expenditures budget, which was initially set at $25 million with the majority dedicated to capital well workovers
and field optimization activities. On May 4, 2016 the Company announced a revised 2016 capital expenditures
program of $100 million. The Company resumed drilling with one rig in the Cleveland in April 2016, followed by the
addition of a second and third rig in June 2016. On August 3, 2016, the Company announced a further revised 2016
capital expenditures program, lowering full year 2016 guidance (excluding acquisitions) by 10% to $90 million,
primarily due to better than expected execution on the Company’s Cleveland drilling program and maintenance
projects coming in below budget. The Company expects to fund its revised capital budget with cash flows from
operations.

EBITDAX is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our
consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.
We define EBITDAX as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization,
exploration expense, gains and losses from derivatives less the current period settlements of matured derivative
contracts and the other items described below. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income as determined by United
States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management believes EBITDAX is useful because it
allows them to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from
period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the
items listed above from net income in arriving at EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from
company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital
structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. EBITDAX has limitations as an analytical tool and
should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with
GAAP or as an indicator of our liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in
understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax
structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets. Our
Table of Contents

presentation of EBITDAX should not be construed as an inference that our results will be unaffected by unusual or
nonrecurring items. Our computations of EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to
EBITDAX for the periods indicated:

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used
by management and external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We define Adjusted Net
Income as net income excluding the impact of certain non-cash items including gains or losses on commodity
derivative instruments not yet settled, impairment of oil and gas properties, non-cash compensation expense, and the
other items described below. We define Adjusted Earnings per Share as earnings per share plus that portion of the
components of adjusted net income allocated to the controlling interests divided by weighted average shares
outstanding. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are useful to investors because they
provide readers with a more meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items for which the timing
or amount cannot be reasonably determined. However, these measures are provided in addition to, not as an
alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared
in accordance with GAAP. Our computations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share may not be
comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
The following tables provide a reconciliation of net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to adjusted
net income for the periods indicated:

Results of Operations - Three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to three months ended June 30, 2015
Operating revenues
Oil and gas sales. Oil and gas sales decreased $24.8 million, or 46.6%, to $28.4 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $53.2 million for the three months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease was attributable to the decline in commodity prices ($11.6 million), as well
as decreased production volumes ($13.2 million). The decrease in production volumes was
driven by the temporary suspension of our drilling program. The average realized oil price,
excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, decreased from $51.73 per Bbl for the
three months ended June 30, 2015 to $40.68 per Bbl for the three months ended June 30, 2016,
or 21.4%. The average realized natural gas price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative
instruments, decreased from $1.73 per Mcf for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $1.11
per Mcf for the three months ended June 30, 2016, or 35.8%. The average realized natural gas
liquids price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, decreased from $14.62
per Bbl for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $13.56 per Bbl for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, or 7.3%. Average daily production decreased 26.5% to 18,604 Boe per day for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 25,319 Boe per day for the three months
ended June 30, 2015.
Costs and expenses
Lease operating. Lease operating expenses decreased by $4.3 million, or 36.4%, to $7.5 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $11.8 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. The decrease was principally attributable to reduction in post-completion costs
driven by a temporary suspension of the drilling program, operational focus on reducing recurring
operating expenses, such as optimizing the usage of compressors and rental equipment, and
vendor price reductions. On a per unit basis, lease

33
operating expenses decreased $0.66 per Boe, or 12.9%, from $5.12 per Boe in the three months ended June 30, 2015
to $4.46 per Boe in the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Production and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased by $1.4 million, or
45.2%, to $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $3.1 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was driven by a $0.7 million (70.0%)
reduction in production taxes, which decreased in conjunction with the 46.6% decrease in oil and
gas revenue. Production tax rates vary between states, products, and production levels;
therefore, the overall blended rate is impacted by numerous factors and the mix of producing
wells at any given time. Additionally, estimated ad valorem taxes decreased $0.7 million from
$1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $0.3 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, reflecting lower property assessments due to lower commodity prices. The
average effective rate excluding the impact of ad valorem taxes increased from 3.8% for the three
months ended June 30, 2015 to 4.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Exploration. Exploration expense decreased from $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30,
2015 to $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Spending during the second
quarter of 2016 primarily related to geological data and seismic processing associated with
unproved acreage. No exploratory wells were drilled during either year.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased by $13.2
million, or 25.7%, to $38.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to
$51.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of
lower production caused by a reduction in capital spending driven by a temporary suspension of
the drilling program. On a per unit basis, depletion expense increased $0.26 per Boe or 1.2%
from $22.27 per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $22.53 per Boe
for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.3 million, or
13.8%, to $8.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $9.4 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expense
was primarily attributable to staff and other cost reductions. Non-cash compensation expense
increased $0.1 million from $1.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $2.0 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2016. On a per unit basis, general and administrative
expenses, excluding non-cash items, decreased from $3.10 per Boe for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 to $2.63 per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Other operating expense. Other operating expense decreased from $1.2 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 to none for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Expense for the three
months ended June 30, 2015 represents stand-by rig costs associated with the early termination
of drilling rig contracts. There were no similar charges during 2016.
Interest expense. Interest expense decreased by $3.9 million, or 23.4%, to $12.8 million for three
months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $16.7 million for the three months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease was driven by a reduction in the outstanding balance of the 2022 Notes and
the 2023 Notes as a result of our debt extinguishments. During the three months ended June 30,
2016, borrowings under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes bore interest at a
weighted average rate of 2.25%, 6.75% and 9.25%, respectively. Average outstanding balances
for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $185.0 million, $411.1 million and $150.0 million
under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes, respectively.
Gain on debt extinguishment. The gain on debt extinguishment of $8.9 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 was related to the purchase of an aggregate principal amount of $20.3
million of our senior unsecured notes for cash of $11.2 million. The company recognized
accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs of $0.3 million associated with the cancellation.
See Note 4, “Long-Term Debt,” for further details regarding the debt extinguishment. There were
no similar gains during 2015.
Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives. The net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives was a net loss of
$40.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to a net loss of
$25.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The loss was driven by higher average
crude oil and natural gas prices ($45.46 per barrel and $2.15 per Mcf, respectively) for the three
months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the crude oil and natural gas prices as of
March 31, 2016 ($33.35 per barrel and $1.99 per Mcf, respectively) as well as additional hedging
activity during 2016.
Other income (expense). Other income (expense) decreased by $1.0 million to net expense of $0.3
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to a net income of $0.7 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2015. Other income (expense) for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 related to a reduction of the TRA valuation allowance which resulted in expense
of $0.3 million. Other income (expense) for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was income of
$0.7 million related to the receipt of dividend income from our investment in Monarch Natural Gas
Holdings, LLC.
Income taxes. The provision for federal and state income taxes for the three months ended June 30,
2016 was a benefit of $12.4 million resulting in an 17.4% effective tax rate as a percentage of our
pre-tax book income for the quarter as compared to a benefit of
Table of Contents
34
$13.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our effective tax rate is based on the statutory rate
applicable to the U.S. and the blended rate of the states in which we conduct business and is adjusted from the
enacted rates for the share of net income allocated to the non-controlling interest. See Note 9, “Income Taxes,” for
further details.
Results of Operations - Six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to six months ended June 30, 2015
Operating revenues
Oil and gas sales. Oil and gas sales decreased $57.0 million, or 51.6%, to $53.5 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $110.5 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease was attributable to the decline in commodity prices ($34.1 million), as well
as decreased production volumes ($22.9 million). The decrease in production volumes was
driven by the temporary suspension of our drilling program. The average realized oil price,
excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, decreased from $47.62 per Bbl for the
six months ended June 30, 2015 to $33.63 per Bbl for the six months ended June 30, 2016, or
29.4%. The average realized natural gas price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative
instruments, decreased from $2.07 per Mcf for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $1.22 per
Mcf for the six months ended June 30, 2016, or 41.1%. The average realized natural gas liquids
price, excluding the effects of commodity derivative instruments, decreased from $14.78 per Bbl
for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $11.44 per Bbl for the six months ended June 30,
2016, or 22.6%. Average daily production decreased 24.6% to 19,489 Boe per day for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to 25,862 Boe per day for the six months ended
June 30, 2015.
Costs and expenses
Lease operating. Lease operating expenses decreased by $7.9 million, or 32.8%, to $16.2 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $24.1 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The decrease was principally attributable to reduction in post-completion costs
driven by a temporary suspension of the drilling program, operational focus on reducing recurring
operating expenses, such as optimizing the usage of compressors and rental equipment, and
vendor price reductions. On a per unit basis, lease operating expenses decreased $0.58 per
Boe, or 11.3%, from $5.14 per Boe in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $4.56 per Boe in the
six months ended June 30, 2016.
Production and ad valorem taxes. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased by $3.5 million, or
51.5%, to $3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $6.8 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was driven by a $2.4 million (48.0%)
reduction in production taxes, which decreased in conjunction with the 51.6% decrease in oil and
gas revenue. Production tax rates vary between states, products, and production levels;
therefore, the overall blended rate is impacted by numerous factors and the mix of producing
wells at any given time. Additionally, estimated ad valorem taxes decreased $1.1 million from
$1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $0.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, reflecting lower property assessments due to lower commodity prices. The
average effective rate excluding the impact of ad valorem taxes increased from 4.5% for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 to 4.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Exploration. Exploration expense decreased from $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015 to $0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Spending during 2016 primarily
related to geological data and seismic processing associated with unproved acreage. No
exploratory wells were drilled during either year.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased by $23.5
million, or 22.7%, to $79.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to
$103.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of
lower production caused by a reduction in capital spending driven by a temporary suspension of
the drilling program. On a per unit basis, depletion expense increased $0.44 per Boe or 2.0%
from $22.09 per Boe for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $22.53 per Boe for
the six months ended June 30, 2016.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by $2.3 million, or
12.8%, to $15.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $17.9 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expense was
primarily attributable to staff and other cost reductions. Non-cash compensation expense
remained consistent at $3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. On a per
unit basis, general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash items, increased from $2.87
per Boe for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $3.11 per Boe for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 primarily due to production declines.
Other operating expense. Other operating expense decreased from $4.2 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015 to none for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Expense for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 represents stand-by rig costs associated with the early termination
of drilling rig contracts. There were no similar charges during 2016.

Interest expense. Interest expense decreased by $3.2 million, or 10.4%, to $27.6 million for six
months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $30.8 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease was driven by a reduction in the outstanding balance of the 2022 Notes and
the 2023 Notes as a result of our debt extinguishments. During the six months ended June 30,
2016, borrowings under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes bore interest at a
weighted average rate of 2.43%, 6.75% and 9.25%, respectively. Average outstanding balances
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $164.0 million, $431.5 million and $182.8 million
under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes, respectively.
Gain on debt extinguishment. The gain on debt extinguishment of $99.5 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 was related to the purchase of an aggregate principal amount of $190.9
million of our senior unsecured notes for cash of $84.6 million. The company recognized
accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs of $6.7 million associated with the cancellation.
See Note 4, “Long-Term Debt,” for further details regarding the debt extinguishment. There were
no similar gains during 2015.
Net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives. The net gain (loss) on commodity derivatives was a net loss of
$22.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to a net gain of $21.2 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The loss was driven by higher average crude oil prices
($39.55 per barrel) for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the crude oil prices
as of December 31, 2015 ($37.13 per barrel) as well as additional hedging activity during 2016.
Other income (expense). Other income (expense) increased by $1.5 million to net expense of $0.1
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to a net expense of $1.6 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2015. Other income (expense) for the six months ended June 30,
2016 related to an increase in the TRA valuation allowance which resulted in income of $0.2
million, partially offset by financing costs which resulted in expenses of $0.3 million. Other
income (expense) for the six months ended June 30, 2015 related to financing costs which
resulted in expenses of $2.3 million, partially offset by the receipt of dividend income of $0.7
million from our investment in Monarch Natural Gas Holdings, LLC.
Income taxes. The provision for federal and state income taxes for the six months ended June 30,
2016 was a benefit of $1.7 million resulting in an 14.3% effective tax rate as a percentage of our
pre-tax book income year-to-date as compared to a benefit of $11.1 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. Our effective tax rate is based on the statutory rate applicable to the U.S.
and the blended rate of the states in which we conduct business and is adjusted from the
enacted rates for the share of net income allocated to the non-controlling interest. The change in
effective tax rate was due primarily to the percentage of income allocated to the non-controlling
interest. See Note 9, “Income Taxes,” for further details.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been private and public sales of our debt and equity, borrowings
under bank credit facilities and cash flows from operations. Our primary use of capital has been for the exploration,
development and acquisition of oil and gas properties. As we pursue reserves and production growth, we continually
consider which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to meet our future financial
obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. Our ability to grow proved reserves and
production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. We strive to maintain financial flexibility
in order to maintain substantial borrowing capacity under our Revolver (as defined below), facilitate drilling on our
undeveloped acreage positions and permit us to selectively expand our acreage positions. Depending on the timing
and concentration of the development of our non-proved locations, we may be required to generate or raise significant
amounts of capital to develop all of our potential drilling locations should we endeavor to do so. In the event our cash
flows are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on
acceptable terms, we may curtail our capital spending. Our balance sheet at June 30, 2016 reflects a positive working
capital balance largely due to the value of our current commodity derivative assets as of this date. We have
historically and in the future expect to maintain a negative working capital balance, and we use our Revolver to help
manage our working capital.
Availability under the Revolver is subject to a borrowing base. Our borrowing base at June 30, 2016 was $510 million
of which $185.0 million was utilized leaving an unused capacity of $325.0 million. The borrowing base will be re-
determined at least semi-annually on or about April 1 and October 1 of each year, with such re-determination based
primarily on reserve reports using lender commodity price expectations at such time. Any reduction in the borrowing
base will reduce our liquidity, and, if the reduction results in the outstanding amount under our Revolver exceeding the
borrowing base, we will be required to repay the deficiency within a short period of time. The borrowing base was
reduced to $410.0 million effective August 1, 2016, with an increase to $425.0 million upon closing of the Pending
Anadarko Acquisition. See Note 14, “Subsequent Events” for further details.
The Revolver also contains a covenant which restricts the ability of Jones Energy, Inc. to (i) hold any assets,
(ii) incur, create, assume, or suffer to exist any debt or any other liability or obligation, (iii) create, make or enter into
any investment or (iv) engage in any other activity or operation other than, among other exceptions described therein,
its ownership of equity interests in JEH and the activities of a passive holding company and assets and operations
incidental thereto (including the maintenance of cash and reserves for the payment of operational costs and
expenses).

Jones Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are also required under the Revolver to maintain the following
financial ratios:
·                  a total leverage ratio, consisting of consolidated debt to EBITDAX, of not greater than
4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter; and
·                  a current ratio, consisting of consolidated current assets, including the unused amounts
of the total commitments, to consolidated current liabilities, of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last
day of any fiscal quarter.
As of June 30, 2016, our total leverage ratio is approximately 3.2 and our current ratio is approximately 6.2, as
calculated based on the requirements in our covenants. We are in compliance with all terms of our Revolver at
June 30, 2016, and we expect to maintain compliance throughout 2016. However, factors including those outside of
our control, such as commodity price declines, may prevent us from maintaining compliance with these covenants, at
future measurement dates in 2016 and beyond. In the event it were to become necessary, we believe we have the
ability to take actions that would prevent us from failing to comply with our covenants, such as hedge restructuring. If
an event of default exists under the Revolver, the lenders will be able to accelerate the obligations outstanding under
the Revolver and exercise other rights and remedies. Our Revolver contains customary events of default, including
the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the Revolver.
Our capital budget is primarily focused on the development of the Cleveland formation through exploitation and
development. The amount of capital we expend may fluctuate materially based on the market
conditions for commodity prices and costs of drilling and completing wells, the economic returns
being realized and the success of our drilling results as the year progresses.
On May 24, 2016, the Company and Jones Energy Holdings, LLC entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (each, a “Manager” and collectively, the “Managers”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company may sell from time to time through the
Managers, as the Company’s sales agents, the Company’s Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price
of up to $73.0 million (the “Class A Shares”). Under the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company may
also sell Class A Shares from time to time to any Manager as principal for its own account at a price to be agreed
upon at the time of sale. Any sale of Class A Shares to a Manager as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a
separate terms agreement between the Company and such Manager. Sales of the Class A Shares, if any, will be
made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions, to or through a market maker or directly on or through an electronic
communication network, a “dark pool” or any similar market venue, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and one
or more of the Managers.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company sold approximately 0.3 million Class A Shares under the
Equity Distribution Agreement for net proceeds of approximately $1.1 million ($1.3 million gross proceeds, net of
approximately $0.2 million in commissions and professional services expenses). The Company used the net proceeds
for general corporate purposes. At June 30, 2016, approximately $71.7 million in aggregate offering price remained
available to be issued and sold under the Equity Distribution Agreement.
The amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within management’s control. If
oil and gas prices decline to levels below our acceptable levels or costs increase to levels above our acceptable
levels, we may choose to defer a portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods in order to achieve
the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity and to prioritize capital projects that we believe have the
highest expected returns and potential to generate near-term cash flow. We may also increase our capital
expenditures significantly to take advantage of opportunities we consider to be attractive. We continuously monitor
and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities, changes
in prices, availability of financing, drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the availability of rigs, contractual
obligations, internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control.
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:

Cash flow provided by operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to
net cash provided by operating activities of $73.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The
decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to the $57.0 million decrease in oil and gas
revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six months ended June 30,
2015, driven by declines in production volumes as a result of the temporary suspension of the
drilling program, as well as declines in commodity prices.
Cash flow provided by / (used in) investing activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $50.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared
to net cash used in investing activities of $161.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in
investing cash flow was primarily driven by the reduction in capital spending, resulting from a temporary suspension of
the drilling program.
Cash flow (used in) / provided by financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $18.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to net
cash provided by financing activities of $97.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in
financing cash flows was primarily due to the purchase of an aggregate principal amount of $190.9 million of our
senior unsecured notes for cash of $84.6 million. The Company used cash on hand and borrowings from its Revolver
to fund the note purchases. Additionally, we paid cash tax distributions of approximately $10.1 million to Pre-IPO
Owners. Borrowings under the Revolver totaled $75.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Cash
flows from financing activities were modestly impacted by sales of Class A Shares under the
Equity Distribution Agreement. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we sold
approximately 0.3 million Class A Shares for net proceeds of approximately $1.1 million ($1.3
million gross proceeds, net of approximately $0.2 million in commissions and professional
services expenses).
Contractual Obligations
The holders of JEH Units, including Jones Energy, Inc., incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their
share of any taxable income of JEH. Under the terms of its operating agreement, JEH is generally required to make
quarterly pro-rata cash tax distributions to its unitholders (including us) based on income allocated to its unitholders
through the end of each relevant quarter, as adjusted to take into account good faith projections by the Company of
taxable income or loss for the remainder of the calendar year, to the extent JEH has cash available for such
distributions and subject to certain other restrictions. This tax distribution is computed based on the estimate of net
taxable income of JEH allocated to the holders of JEH Units multiplied by the highest marginal effective rate of
federal, state and local income tax applicable to an individual resident in New York, New York, without regard for the
federal benefit of the deduction for any state taxes.
Based on our 2016 capital budget, debt extinguishment through July 29, 2016, and other information available as of
this filing, we estimate that the total amount of tax distributions to JEH unitholders in 2016 would be approximately
$42.4 million, including the approximately $20.0 million that has been paid to date. The distributions are to be made
pro-rata to all members, and would result in a $22.6 million payment to the Company, and a $19.8 million payment to
Pre-IPO Owners. The 2016 tax distributions are the result of taxable income generated by our operations and debt
extinguishment, and our current projections do not currently lead us to anticipate payment of such tax distribution
obligations beyond the current year
There have been no other material changes in our contractual obligations as reported in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those set forth in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The following market risk disclosures should be read in conjunction with the quantitative and qualitative disclosures
about market risk contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as
with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes included in this Quarterly Report.

We are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial statements that arise in the normal course of
business. We may enter into derivative instruments to manage or reduce market risk, but do not enter into derivative
agreements for speculative purposes. We do not designate these or future derivative instruments as hedges for
accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized currently in
earnings.
Potential Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties
Oil and natural gas prices are inherently volatile and have decreased significantly since 2014. Depressed commodity
prices have continued into 2016, and historically low commodity prices may exist for an extended period. In applying
the prescribed impairment test under the successful efforts method at June 30, 2016, no impairment charge was
indicated.
Our revenues and net income are sensitive to crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices which have been and are
expected to continue to be highly volatile. The recent volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices increases the
uncertainty as to the impact of commodity prices on our estimated proved reserves. Although we are unable to predict
future commodity prices, a prolonged period of depressed commodity prices may have a significant impact on the
volumetric quantities of our proved reserves. The impact of commodity prices on our estimated proved reserves can
be illustrated as follows: if the prices used for our December 31, 2015 Reserve Report had been replaced with the
unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for the applicable commodity for the trailing 12-
month period ended June 30, 2016 (without regard to our commodity derivative positions and without assuming any
change in development plans, costs, or other variables), then estimated proved reserves volumes as of December 31,
2015 would have decreased by approximately 2.2%. The use of this pricing example is for illustration purposes only,
and does not indicate management’s view on future commodity prices, costs or other variables, or represent a
forecast or estimate of the actual amount by which our proved reserves may fluctuate when a full assessment of our
reserves is completed as of December 31, 2016.
Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and related future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number
of factors, including changes in oil and natural gas prices, reservoir performance, new drilling and completion,
purchases, sales and terminations of leases, drilling and operating cost changes, technological advances, new
geological or geophysical data or other economic factors. All of these factors are inherently estimates and are inter
dependent. While each variable carries its own degree of uncertainty, some factors, such as oil and natural gas
prices, have historically been highly volatile and may be highly volatile in the future. This high degree of volatility
causes a high degree of uncertainty associated with the estimation of reserve quantities and estimated future cash
flows. Therefore, future results are highly uncertain and subject to potentially significant revisions. Accordingly,
reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. We
cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions, as such revisions could be negatively impacted by:
·                  Declines in commodity prices or actual realized prices below those assumed for future
years;
·                  Increases in service costs;
·                  Increases in future global or regional production or decreases in demand;
·                  Increases in operating costs;
·                  Reductions in availability of drilling, completion, or other equipment.
If such revisions are significant, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in an
impairment of assets that may be material. Any future impairments are difficult to predict, and although it is not
reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments at this time, such impairments may be
significant.
Commodity price risk and hedges
Our principal market risk exposure is to oil, natural gas and NGL prices, which are inherently volatile. As such, future
earnings are subject to change due to fluctuations in such prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by the prevailing
prices for oil and regional spot prices for natural gas and NGLs. We have used, and expect to continue to use, oil,
natural gas and NGL derivative contracts to reduce our risk of price fluctuations of these commodities. Pursuant to
our risk management policy, we engage in these activities as a hedging mechanism against price volatility associated
with projected production levels. The fair value of our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts at June 30, 2016
was a net asset of $120.6 million.

Interest rate risk
We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness. The
terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to prime,
LIBOR or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 0.50% to 2.50% depending on the base rate used and the
amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. The base rate margins under the terminated term
loan were 6.0% to 7.0% depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding. The terms of our
senior notes provide for a fixed interest rate through their respective maturity dates. During the three months ended
June 30, 2016, borrowings under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes bore interest at a weighted
average rate of 2.25%, 6.75% and 9.25%, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2016,
borrowings under the Revolver, the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes bore interest at a weighted
average rate of 2.43%, 6.75% and 9.25%, respectively.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in
reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016 because of the material weakness in internal control
over financial reporting described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Management’s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, adopted rules requiring every public company that
files reports with the SEC to include a management report on such company’s internal control over financial reporting
in its annual report. Pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), our independent
registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for up to five years or through such earlier date
that we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015 included a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over
financial reporting.
