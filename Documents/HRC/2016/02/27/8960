</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Brazil has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, with over 48,000 people killed 
each year. Murders by gangs, inmates, the police, death squads and hired killers regularly make 
headlines in Brazil and around the world. Extrajudicial executions and vigilante justice are 
supported by a sizable proportion of the population, who fear high crime rates and who perceive 
that the criminal justice system is too slow to prosecute criminals effectively. Many politicians, 
keen to curry favour with a fearful electorate, have failed to demonstrate the political will 
necessary to curb executions by the police. 
</p>
<p> This attitude must change. States have an obligation to protect their citizens by preventing 
and punishing criminal violence. This obligation, however, goes together with the State&#8217;s duty to 
ensure respect for the right to life of all citizens, including that of criminal suspects. There is no 
conflict between the right of all Brazilians to security and freedom from criminal violence and 
the right not to be arbitrarily shot by the police. Murder is not an acceptable or effective 
crime-control technique. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions argues for a new approach and recommends reforms directed at the civil police, the 
military police, police internal affairs, forensics, ombudsmen, public prosecutors, the judiciary 
and the prison administration. The scope of the reforms required is daunting, but reform is both 
possible and necessary. 
</p>
<p> The people of Brazil did not struggle valiantly against 20 years of dictatorship or adopt a 
federal Constitution dedicated to restoring respect for human rights to make Brazil free for police 
officers to kill with impunity in the name of security. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Extrajudicial executions are rampant in certain parts of Brazil. The problems include 
executions by on-duty police, executions by off-duty police operating in death squads, militias or 
as hired killers, and killings of inmates in prisons. This report analyses the forms, causes and 
dynamics of those executions and reviews the role of the criminal justice system and police 
oversight mechanisms in permitting impunity for executions. The report proposes concrete and 
specific measures to reduce the incidence of executions, and to promote accountability when 
executions do take place. 
</p>
<p>2. I visited Brazil from 4 to 14 November 2007, and traveled to S&#227;o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, 
Pernambuco, and Brasilia. I met with a very wide range of actors - witnesses to human rights 
violations, families of victims, civil society representatives, and many federal and state 
Government officials.<b>1</b> The success of my mission owes much to the full cooperation extended to 
me by the Government, especially the Federal authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  BACKGROUND AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>3. From 1965 to 1985 Brazil was under a military dictatorship. Basic rights were suspended 
and real or perceived opponents of the regime were subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, 
disappearance, or extrajudicial execution.<b>2</b> In 1988, a new federal constitution established 
democratic rule, and entrenched the rights to life, liberty, equality and security.<b>3</b> Soon after, 
Brazil became a party to most of the international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).<b>4</b> The ICCPR and other applicable 
treaties require the State to both &#8220;respect and ensure&#8221; the right of each person not to be 
&#8220;arbitrarily deprived&#8221; of life.<b>5</b>

</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  After transition, Brazil became a party to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights (CESCR), the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the 
Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (CAT), and the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Since January 2007, Brazil has been a party to the Optional 
Protocol to the CAT. Brazil is not yet a party to the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR, and should 
begin the process of acceding to the Protocol so that the UN Human Rights Committee may 
receive and consider communications from individual Brazilians with respect to violations of the 
rights protected by the ICCPR.

</p>
<p>In other words, human rights law both <i>prohibits </i>governments from committing extrajudicial 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.2

</p>
<p>4. All Brazilians are concerned with the threats to human security brought by criminality, 
but a clear understanding of the legal framework illustrates that human security is a part of, and 
not in competition with, human rights. In the Brazilian context in particular, my findings show 
that the issues of ending human rights abuses by the police and ensuring effective crime 
prevention by the police are tightly linked. A key reason for the ineffectiveness of the police in 
protecting citizens from these gangs is that they too often engage in excessive and counter-
productive violence while on-duty and participate in what amounts to organized crime while 
off-duty. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS BY POLICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Overview 
</b></p>
<p>5. Members of the police forces too often contribute to the problem of extrajudicial 
executions rather than to its solution. In part, there is a significant problem with on-duty police 
using excessive force and committing extrajudicial executions in illegal and counterproductive 
efforts to combat crime. But there is also a problem with off-duty police themselves forming 
criminal organizations which also engage in killings. 
</p>
<p>6. Policing responsibilities are divided between the federal and state Governments.<b>6</b> While the 
Federal Police are responsible for preventing and investigating crimes against indigenous 
peoples and, in some instances, crimes constituting human rights violations, state police forces 
are the key actors in issues arising under my mandate. In each state, the Governor commands 
two police forces. The Military Police are responsible for patrolling the streets, and arresting 
those caught committing a crime. The Civil Police are responsible for conducting criminal 
investigations. Governors typically exercise their command powers through a Public Security 
Secretariat which coordinates the efforts of the two forces. 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>executions and <i>requires </i>them to protect their people from killers. On the one hand, human rights 
law is violated when agents of the State - such as police officers or soldiers - arbitrarily deprive 
individuals of their lives. Police officers may shoot to kill only when it is clear that an individual 
is about to kill someone (making lethal force proportionate) and there is no other available means 
of detaining him or her (making lethal force necessary). (A/61/311, paras. 33-45; see also 
Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, Principle 9; 
Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, Art. 3.) On the other hand, murders by private 
persons will, in most situations, constitute simple crimes and not give rise to any State 
responsibility. Nevertheless, the State is obligated to exercise due diligence in preventing such 
crimes. (E/CN.4/2005/7, paras. 65-76.) To meet that obligation, the State must effectively 
investigate, prosecute, and punish perpetrators. When such efforts prove ineffective, the State 
must take whatever measures are necessary to make them effective.

</p>
<p><b>B.  Background:  high crime and homicide rates 
</b></p>
<p>7. Policing in Brazil takes place within a context of significant organized crime, gang control 
of entire communities, drug and weapons trafficking, and high levels of violent street crime.<b>7</b> 
Gangs and traffickers have become so powerful that in large cities such as Rio de Janeiro, 
S&#227;o Paulo and Recife, they exercise control over favelas, threatening and extorting residents and 
businesses, imposing their own &#8220;laws&#8221;, and requiring residents to protect them from police. 
Gangs engage in lethal violence against enemy factions, making everyday security for favela 
residents volatile. In some areas of Rio de Janeiro, gang control is so absolute, and legitimate 
state presence so absent, that police can only enter under threat of armed confrontation with 
traffickers. In S&#227;o Paulo, one gang, First Command of the Capital<b> </b>(<i>Primeiro Comando da 
Capital</i>, PCC) was able to bring the state to a standstill in May 2006, organizing prison riots, 
attacks and murders across the state. The May 2006 violence caused widespread fear across 
Brazil, and drew international attention to the country&#8217;s need for more effective crime control. 
</p>
<p>8. Brazil has notoriously high homicide rates. Homicide is the leading cause of death for 
persons aged 15 to 44 years, and the victims are overwhelmingly young, male, black, and poor. 
Between 1980 and 2002, the homicide rate (per 100,000 residents) nearly tripled - to a peak in 
2002 of 30.4. The figures dropped slightly the following years, to 28.3 in 2004, 27 in 2005, 
and 25 in 2006, but remain well above the world average.<b>8</b> Nationwide, nearly 70% of murders 
involve firearms. In response, Brazil passed stricter gun control laws in 2003,<b>9</b> which have been 
credited with reducing firearm deaths in the subsequent years.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  For example, rates of robberies per 100,000 have also been rising steadily in Rio de Janeiro 
</p>
<p>since 1991, (under 600 per 100,000 in 1991, to over 1,200 per 100,000 in 2006). 
<b>8
</b>  The World Health Organisation estimated that in 2000 the world homicide rate was 8.8 
</p>
<p>per 100,000: World Health Organization, <i>World Report on Violence and Health </i>(2002), p. 10. 
(This rate excluded war-related deaths). 
<b>9
</b>  Disarmament Statute, Law No 10, 826/03. The law made it an offence to carry a gun without a 
</p>
<p>permit, raised the age to 25 at which a permit could be obtained, and required all guns to be 
registered. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  The homicide rates for Rio de Janeiro, 40.7 in 2006, and Pernambuco, 53 in 2005, are 
markedly higher than the national average. (It is important to note that official homicide statistics 
do not include all deaths. In Rio de Janeiro, for example, on-duty killings by on-duty police 
officers are not included in the state &#8220;homicide&#8221; rates. If they were, the homicide rates in Rio de 
Janeiro and Pernambuco (where such killings are included) would be on par with each other: 
Governo do Estado de Pernambuco, Secretaria de Defesa Social, Ger&#234;ncia de An&#225;lise Criminal e 
Estat&#237;cia, Relat&#243;rio No 366/2007/GACE/SDS-PE, &#8220;Informa&#231;&#245;es Sobre Viol&#234;ncia Envolvendo 
Policiais em Pernambuco&#8221;, Recife, 30 de novembre de 2007, p. 4. The number of persons who 
have &#8220;disappeared&#8221; is also not included in the homicide statistics. In Rio de Janeiro, 
4,562 persons were recorded to have disappeared in 2006. While some of these people are 
doubtless alive, a significant proportion were presumably killed and their bodies disposed of.) 
In contrast, the homicide rate in S&#227;o Paulo has fallen over the last 6 years by over 50%. (The

</p>
<p><b>C.  Extrajudicial executions by on-duty police 
</b>9. On-duty police are responsible for a significant proportion of all killings in Brazil.<b>11</b> While 
S&#227;o Paulo&#8217;s official homicide rate has reduced in recent years, the number of killings by police 
has actually increased over the last three years, with on-duty police in 2007 killing one person a 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>reported homicides in S&#227;o Paulo are as follows: 2000 (12,638); 2001 (12,475); 2002 (11,854); 
2003 (10,953); 2004 (8,753); 2005 (7,076); 2006 (6,057.) See Government of S&#227;o Paulo, 
&#8220;Resposta &#224; ONU - Homic&#237;dio doloso&#8221;, p. 2.) Senior Government officials and civil society have 
attributed this reduction to a number of factors. One of these is increased investment in police 
intelligence and resulting increased arrests. (To September 2007, for example, there were 
77,000 arrests, 10,000 more than the same period in the prior year. The state invested in a 
communications network to link Military and Civil Police information, a geographic information 
system so that crimes could be tracked by area, criminal photographs database, computer 
software linking police report information with bank records, telephone records, and residence.) 
Another factor is new gun control legislation. (In S&#227;o Paulo, confiscations of illegal weapons 
rose from 6,539 in the first quarter of 1996 to 11,670 in 1999. From 2003-2004, firearm deaths 
dropped by 19% in S&#227;o Paulo.) Other factors include Government and civil society investment in 
social programs and services to communities; reduction of bar opening hours; retraining for 
police; and increased use of alternative justice measures. While the trend is promising, 
S&#227;o Paulo&#8217;s homicide rate still remains well above early 1990s levels. 
</p>
<p> High crime and homicide rates affect the entire populace, but they disproportionately affect 
the poorer classes, particularly those in favelas. There is a strong negative correlation between 
average income and the homicide rate in an area. In some cities the homicide rate in poor areas is 
4.5 times that of wealthy areas. (In the city of Rio de Janeiro, for example, the poor areas of 
Zona Norte 2 and Baixada had homicide rates per 100,000 between 2000-2005 of 56.8 and 55.2 
respectively, while the wealthy area of Zona Sul had a rate of 12.6 per 100,000. See Instituto de 
Seguran&#231;a P&#250;blica (ISP-RJ).) While the middle and upper classes can seek to protect themselves 
through gated communities and private security guards, favela residents live in areas largely 
devoid of state power, and face daily violence. Favela residents are then further disadvantaged 
socially and when seeking employment. They are tainted with the crime associated with their 
area of residence. This &#8220;criminalization of poverty&#8221; is so pervasive that even Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s 
Secretary for Public Security publicly expressed the view that &#8220;a gunshot in Copacabana [a 
wealthy neighborhood] is one thing&#8221; but &#8220;a gunshot in Cor&#233;ia, in the Complexo do Alem&#227;o 
[favelas] is another&#8221;. (Italo Nogueira, &#8220;Para secret&#225;rio, tiro em Copacabana &#8216;&#233; uma coisa&#8217; e, no 
Alem&#227;o, &#8216;&#233; outra&#8217;&#8221;, <i>Folha de S&#227;o Paulo</i> (24 October 2007).) This attitude permeates the state 
response to criminal violence, which has often been to adopt aggressive military style policing of 
poor neighborhoods, or to fail to take serious action against police who kill suspected criminals 
and other citizens. In many areas, as detailed below, police are themselves a major cause of 
insecurity for residents, and are responsible for many killings. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  In fact, the real homicide rate for many states in Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro and 
S&#227;o Paulo, is significantly higher than official statistics suggest because on-duty killings by 
police are excluded from the homicide statistics. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>day.<b>12</b> In Rio de Janeiro, on-duty police are responsible for nearly 18% of the total killings,<b>13</b> and 
kill three people every day. Extrajudicial executions are committed by police who murder rather 
than arrest criminal suspects, and also during large-scale confrontational &#8220;war&#8221; style policing, in 
which excessive use of force results in the deaths of suspected criminals and bystanders. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  May 2006 violence in S&#227;o Paulo 
</b></p>
<p>10. The 12-20 May 2006 violence began when the PCC gang organized simultaneous prison 
riots across S&#227;o Paulo.<b>14</b> The gang held inmates&#8217; families hostage at the prisons, and extended 
the violence beyond the prison system and across the state, spreading fear throughout S&#227;o Paulo. 
The PCC attacked public buildings, burned buses, and murdered over 40 law enforcement 
officials and prison guards. Police responded by killing 124 suspected gang members and 
criminals.

</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  In 2005, there were 278 cases of &#8220;resistance followed by death&#8221;. In 2006, there were 495 
</p>
<p>(the increase is largely accounted for by the large numbers of resistance cases recorded in May). 
In 2007, up to October, 311 cases were recorded. See: Government of S&#227;o Paulo, &#8220;Resposta &#224; 
ONU - resist&#234;ncia seguida de morta&#8221;, p. 1. 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  According to official statistics, there were 6,133 murders (not including killings by police) in 
Rio de Janeiro in 2007. There were 1,330 citizens killed by police. The total number of killings 
was 7,463. In 2006, the percentage of killings by police was 14% (there were 6,323 murders, and 
1,063 citizens killed by police (7,386 total)). See: Rio de Janeiro, Public Security Institute 
(Instituto de Seguran&#231;a P&#250;blica), 19 March 2008. 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  The PCC was formed in 1993, originally presenting itself as a prisoners&#8217; rights group, in 
response to poor prison conditions and particularly the killing of 111 prisoners by S&#227;o Paulo 
Military Police on 2 October 1992 in what has become known as the &#8220;Carandiru Massacre&#8221;. 
Over time, the gang became increasingly violent, engaging in armed confrontation with rival 
gangs (particularly the Third Capital Command), drug and weapons trafficking, and organized 
prison rebellions. At the time of the May 2006 violence, it was widely reported in the press that 
the PCC violence was organised to protest the planned transfer of key PCC members to solitary 
confinement in the Presidente Venceslau prison, although the reasons for the violence have never 
been clearly determined. 
</p>
<p> Government officials acknowledged that the use of mobile phones by prisoners continues 
to be widespread due to corruption and the failure to adequately search visitors. Mobile phone 
use by inmates allows state-wide riots to be coordinated, and for incarcerated organized crime 
leaders to continue their activities. State authorities have acknowledged the importance of 
curbing mobile phone use, have introduced metal detectors, and have made it a criminal offence 
for a public official to smuggle a phone into prison. However, given the continuing availability 
of mobile phones in prisons, additional measures should be considered. Notably, the government 
should continue to increase the numbers of detectors available, and consider purchasing 
technology that would block mobile phone signals within prisons. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>11. The 124 killings were not registered and investigated as homicides, but each was instead 
registered by the police as a &#8220;resistance followed by death&#8221; (<i>resist&#234;ncia seguida de morte</i>).<b>15</b> The 
practice of recording killings by police in this way was increasingly adopted by police during the 
1990s and, although not mandated by law, is now standard practice across Brazil. The resistance 
classification is intended to indicate that the person was killed while committing the crime of 
resisting arrest or resisting other lawful orders of police.<b>16</b> As explained to me by police and 
Government representatives, it is intended to indicate that police had to use necessary and 
proportionate lethal force in response to an attack or threat from the person killed. 
</p>
<p>12. However, the classification of whether a killing is lawful or not is generally determined by 
the police officer who submits a form declaring the case to be one of resistance. A detective at 
the appropriate Civil Police station makes the first formal classification, relying primarily on the 
report of the involved policeman. In the May 2006 cases, a number of resistance deaths were 
reported to the wrong precinct, suggesting collusion in impunity between specific Military Police 
battalions and Civil Police stations.<b>17</b> I received many credible allegations that police often failed 
to secure the scene of the incident adequately, making the gathering and assessment of reliable 
evidence very difficult. This was strongly denied by the police.<b>18</b> However, I received extensive 
evidence that crime scenes were routinely tampered with. This evidence included detailed 
accounts of police taking corpses to hospital, ostensibly for the purposes of &#8220;first aid&#8221;, but in 
circumstances in which the victim was clearly already deceased. 
</p>
<p>13. The killing is supposed to be investigated by the Civil Police, but limited resources, and a 
strong <i>esprit-de-corps</i> mean that such investigations are rarely carried out properly or at all. The 
policeman involved in the killing is often the only witness from whom a statement is taken. 
Reconstruction of the crime scene by detectives rarely takes place. Poor evidence gathering by 
police then makes it nearly impossible for public prosecutors to obtain sufficient information to 
challenge the resistance classification. In practice, use of the resistance category makes the

</b>  &#8220;Resistance followed by death&#8221; (<i>resist&#234;ncia seguida de morte</i>) is the term used in S&#227;o Paulo. 
</p>
<p>The same concept is employed throughout Brazil, though sometimes it is expressed in slightly 
different words. In Rio de Janeiro, the authorities refer to &#8220;acts of resistance&#8221; (<i>autos de

<b>16
</b></p>
<p>  The crime of &#8220;resistance&#8221; (<i>resist&#234;ncia</i>) is to &#8220;oppose the execution of a legal act, through 
violence or threats against an official competent to execute [the legal act] or one assisting [such 
an official]&#8221; (Penal Code, Art. 329). It is normally punishable with between 2 months and 
2 years of imprisonment. If the resistance effectively prevents the execution of the legal act, then 
it is punishable with 1-3 years imprisonment.

by the police. However, the starting point for serious reform must be to abolish the police 
practice of registering killings as &#8220;acts of resistance&#8221;. Any killing by the police should be 
registered in the same way as any other killing, and thoroughly investigated. The present system 
constitutes a <i>carte blanche</i> for police killings.

<p><b>2.  &#8220;War&#8221; on crime and large-scale police operations in Rio de Janeiro 
</b></p>
<p>16. Senior state Government officials and law enforcement authorities in Rio de Janeiro 
discuss policing as a &#8220;war&#8221; against gangs and drug traffickers. During 2007 and early 2008, 
police mounted a number of large-scale operations involving hundreds of men supported by 
armoured vehicles and attack helicopters, to &#8220;invade&#8221; and take back favelas controlled by 
gangs.<b>20</b> One of these operations, the police invasion of the Complexo do Alem&#227;o area of 
Rio de Janeiro on 27 June 2007, illustrates why such an approach might be tempting in theory 
but in practice is murderous and self-defeating. 
</p>
<p>17. The absence of the state in favelas like the Complexo<b>21</b> has allowed gangs to take over 
neighborhoods, acting as what some refer to as a &#8220;parallel state power&#8221; - controlling or providing

</b>  The report documents multiple shots fired from a close distance, a high proportion of shots 
</p>
<p>to the head and vital organs, and entry wounds on a downward trajectory, indicating that the 
victim was kneeling or lying when shot. Additionally, no police were killed during any of the 
resistance deaths, further suggesting that violent confrontations with criminals did not occur. 
Ricardo Molina de Figueiredo, &#8220;Relat&#243;rio Preliminar&#8221; (13 Julho 2006). 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  The state of Rio de Janeiro reported to me that 4 large-scale operations were mounted in 2007 
(numbers of police involved in each operation were: 120; 230; 460; 1,280). In total, 6 police 
were wounded in the 4 operations, and 2 killed. A total of 36 residents were killed, 78 wounded, 
and 36 traffickers arrested. 
<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  Like many favelas, the Complexo has largely been left without state services, a fact frankly 
acknowledged to me by representatives from the state Government. For a population of 180,000, 
the Complexo has only three city schools, 60 teachers, and three health centres. Just 13 public 
officials work there. There are no government-run cultural institutions, no police stations and no 
community policing programs. The absence of the state is brought into sharp relief when one 
compares these numbers with those of other Rio de Janeiro areas. In the municipality of Japeri 
for example, although it has just 96,200 residents, there are 10 health centres, 27 city schools, 
1,918 public officials, and 1,092 teachers. (Governo do Rio de Janeiro, &#8220;Programa de 
Urbaniza&#231;&#227;o de Favelas&#8221; (November, 2007).) </p>

<p>basic services such as transport, gas and cable, hosting festivals and parties, taxing residents, and 
punishing rule-breakers. Gang violence is often motivated by economic interests. If a monopoly 
on criminal activity and a near monopoly on violence can be established within a particular area, 
an organization can: (a) effectively demand protection fees from businesses and &#8220;taxes&#8221; from 
residents; (b) prevent residents from informing the police of their activities, and thereby safely 
hide themselves, drugs, and ammunition; and (c) impose on the residents any other rules that will 
facilitate their criminal activities. The Red Command (<i>Comando Vermelho</i>) gang has controlled 
the Complexo for many years, and is an unusually extreme case of the substitution of gang 
control for legitimate government authority. The rules set by the gang are repressive, and their 
enforcement brutal - punishment for residents can involve being incinerated in what is known as 
the &#8220;microwave&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. In an attempt to take back the Complexo from gang control, on 27 June 2007, the state 
Government mounted a large-scale invasion of the area, involving 1,280 Civil and Military 
Police and 170 National Public Security Force (FNSP)<b>22</b> members. The invasion began in the 
morning, led by members of the Special Police Operations Battalion<b>23</b> in armoured vehicles. 
Other Civil and Military Police followed, while police attempted to remove barriers - concrete 
pipes, abandoned cars, etc. - that had been placed at key entrances to the neighbourhood. The 
area is composed of 17 favelas spread across steep hills, and police attempted to take the higher 
ground, eventually occupying approximately 60% of the area. But police moved slowly through 
the area over the course of the day - the Secretary for Public Security told me that in the first 
four hours they were only able to move forward 400 metres due to barriers and confrontation. 
Residents with whom I spoke described hearing gun shots and observing the gradual approach of 
police to their own streets. Many told me that they were unable to leave their homes all day for 
fear of being caught in the shooting. Meanwhile, the FNSP forces had assumed positions on the 
edges of the favela to act as a &#8220;suffocation&#8221; force, responsible for preventing gang members 
from escaping the favela and for preventing gangs from neighboring areas entering and joining 
the fight. At the time of my visit, the FNSP continued to maintain checkpoints on the perimeter, 
but the only law enforcement presence within the community consisted of a few small outposts 
of members of the Military Police. 
</p>
<p>19. I questioned the Rio de Janeiro Secretary of Public Security and senior members of the 
Civil and Military Police as to the purpose of this huge confrontation. I was informed that the 
Complexo was one of 19 centres of criminality in Rio de Janeiro, a place from which drugs

</b>  The <i>For&#231;a Nacional de Seguran&#231;a P&#250;blica</i> (FNSP) was created by presidential decree 5.289

<p>on 29 November 2004. The National Secretariat for Public Security, which is part of the federal 
Ministry of Justice, is responsible for coordinating the force, which is composed of police from 
around the country, and which can only be deployed in a state at the express request of that 
state&#8217;s governor.

</p>
<p>and guns were distributed to gang members operating in other neighborhoods. The primary 
motivation was said to be to seize those arms and drugs, and to arrest key gang members. A 
secondary motivation was to open the way for the establishment of government services to the 
community. Other sources suggested that a possible motivation may have been to capture key 
gang members who were reportedly meeting in the Complexo that morning; or that the operation 
was designed to ensure safety ahead of the Pan-American Games, which opened two weeks later. 
I asked numerous state Government officials and police why the neighborhood was invaded at 
that particular time, but I was simply told that &#8220;intelligence&#8221; dictated the timing and manner of 
the operation. 
</p>
<p>20. In evaluating the operation in Complexo do Alem&#227;o, two questions stand out. First, what 
were the crime prevention benefits of the operation - did the operation in fact seize weapons and 
drugs, arrest gang leaders, and open the community to state services? Second, did the operation 
harm the community&#8217;s residents? These questions are especially important because most state 
Government officials with whom I spoke in Rio de Janeiro considered the operation a success, 
and a model for future police action.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>21. In fact, from a crime control perspective, the operation was a failure. Police 
confiscated 2 machine guns, 6 handguns, 3 rifles, 1 sub-machine gun, 2,000 cartridges, 
300 kilograms of drugs, and unspecified amount of explosives. Thus there were more people 
killed than guns confiscated. And the day after the operation, there was only a <i>de</i> <i>minimis</i> police 
presence inside the favela. The gang was still there and still in control. It is not surprising that a 
one-day long, large, slow sweep through a neighborhood long neglected by the state failed to 
result in significant arrests or seizures, much less in the end of gang control. Large operations 
over large areas are difficult to keep secret in advance and are immediately exposed as they enter 
a community. This gives criminals great opportunity to escape, along with their weapons and

</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  In fact, after my visit, I was informed of a number of other large-scale police operations 
</p>
<p>involving deaths. On 30 January 2008, an operation was mounted in Jacarezinho and Mangueira 
neighborhoods, and involved approximately 200 police, two helicopters and two armoured cars. 
Six people were killed, six arrested, and a small amount of drugs and weapons were seized. On 
April 3 2008, an operation took place in the Cor&#233;ia and Vila Alian&#231;a favelas. Two hundred 
police were used, supported by armored vehicles and one helicopter. Eleven civilians were 
killed, including three killed from shots fired from the helicopter. Seven suspected criminals 
were arrested. Another large scale operation took place on 15 April 2008, by 180 police in the 
Vila Cruzeiro and other favelas in the Complexo da Penha area. Nine civilians were killed, and 
7 bystanders wounded by stray bullets. Fourteen men were arrested. After this operation, military 
police commander Colonel Marcus Jardim was reported in the press as comparing the dead men 
to insects: &#8220;The [police are] the best remedy against dengue. Not a single fly resists &#8230; it&#8217;s the 
best social bug spray&#8221; (&#8220;A&#231;&#227;o do Bope deixa 9 mortos e 7 feridos&#8221;, <i>O Estado do S. Paulo</i>, 
16 April 2008). Security Secretary of Rio de Janeiro, Mr Jos&#233; Beltrame was reported as stating 
that the two April operations were a success (&#8220;Opera&#231;&#227;o na Vila Cruzeiro termina com nove 
mortos, seis feridos e 14 presos&#8221;, <i>O Globo</i>, 15 April 2008). </p>

</p>
<p>drugs. The combined effects of poor intelligence - which was inevitable given the absence of a 
police presence in the area - and enormous advance warning to the members of criminal 
organizations are obvious in the paucity of arrests and the failure to seize large quantities of 
firearms or drugs.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>22. Nineteen were killed and at least 9 wounded during the 8 hour operation. All 19 deaths 
were recorded as &#8220;resistance&#8221; deaths.<b>26</b> But there is compelling evidence that at least some of 
those killed were extrajudicially executed. I received credible accounts from residents and 
family members of victims that victims were shot in the back whilst walking away from 
police, or dragged out of homes unarmed and executed, or disarmed and then shot in the head. 
Residents and families also testified that police invaded their homes, threatened them, damaged 
and stole property, and were physically abusive. Some of those subsequently independently 
investigating allegations of police abuse - including members of the Brazilian Bar Association<b>27</b> 
as well as victims&#8217; families - reported receiving death threats and warnings to cease their 
investigations.<b>28</b>

executions. One was by the Human Rights Commission of the Brazilian Bar Association

</b>  The state of Rio de Janeiro reported that the total drug and weapons confiscated for 
</p>
<p>all 4 large-scale operations in 2007 were:<b> </b>107 weapons (including antiaircraft machine guns, 
pistols); 43 explosive devices; 20,016 ammunition cartridges; 2,730 kg of cannabis; 441 kg of 
cocaine. And more broadly, despite the aggressive state-wide policies and a dramatic rise in the 
numbers of people killed in 2007 by police in Rio de Janeiro (25.1% more than in 2006), there 
was a 5.7% reduction in drug seizures, a 16.9% reduction in arms confiscations by police, and a 
13.2% reduction in arrests from 2006 to 2007. (Rio de Janeiro, Public Security Institute (Instituto 
de Seguran&#231;a P&#250;blica), 19 March 2008. The numbers reported by the State of Rio de Janeiro are: 
drug seizures (10,793 in 2006; 10,176 in 2007); arms confiscations (13,312 in 2006; 11,062 
in 2007); arrests (16,543 in 2006; 14,355 in 2007).)

<p>(Rio de Janeiro division)<b>29</b> and the other by experts appointed by the Human Rights Special 
Secretary of the Federal Government.<b>30</b> Both found that the original autopsy reports contained 
serious deficiencies and had not been carried out in accordance with international standards.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>24. The expert reports found strong evidence of extrajudicial executions. Of 19 killed, 14 
showed signs of 25 gunshot entry wounds in the back of their bodies. Six victims showed signs 
of 8 entry wounds in the head and face. Five victims showed signs of point-blank shots.<b>32</b> This 
information, together with the high number of shots per victim (over 3), the fact that different 
guns were used to shoot the same victim, and analysis of the sequence and trajectory of shots, led 
the experts to infer that a number of the victims had been executed. But, given the many 
deficiencies in the original forensic analysis, both reports stated that it was impossible to 
conclude definitively whether the victims were executed. 
</p>
<p>25. I asked Rio de Janeiro officials to respond to these findings. They attacked the experts&#8217; 
credentials, and told me that the experts lacked the constitutional authority to carry out such 
investigations. I requested, but did not receive, a scientifically based state response to the 
experts&#8217; report. I also asked the responsible Civil Police what investigations had been carried out 
to ascertain whether each killing was in fact the result of justifiable and necessary use of force. 
But they were unable to provide me with any evidence that they had conducted serious 
investigations into any of the killings. In fact, I was told that they assume that Military Police 
officers registering a resistance case are telling the truth. The principal response I was given was 
that each of the 19 deceased had criminal records. It is difficult to understand how this could 
have been known by the police when they killed the individuals. Moreover, the claims were

prepared, and failed to describe injuries adequately. The victims had arrived at the forensics 
institute naked. Thus their clothing could not be examined nor gun powder analysis carried out. 
X-rays had not been taken to locate the bullets still in victims&#8217; bodies, and the crime scenes were 
not preserved.

<p>firmly denied by families of several victims, including that of a 14 year old boy, David Souza 
de Lima, who was shot 4 times in the back. The assertion by police of victims&#8217; criminality is an 
extremely telling and worrying &#8220;justification&#8221; for killings. A victim&#8217;s criminal record says 
absolutely nothing about whether they were killed in self-defence, or whether the police used 
justifiable force. The appropriate response to a criminal act is arrest, not execution. 
26. The degree to which the killing of &#8220;criminals&#8221; is tolerated and even publicly encouraged by 
high level Government officials goes a long way to explaining why the numbers of killings by 
police are so high, and why they are so inadequately investigated. Current Secretary for Public 
Security Jos&#233; Mariano Beltrame commented that, while police did their best to avoid casualties, 
one could not &#8220;make an omelet without breaking some eggs&#8221;.<b>33</b> Such public statements, and the 
military-style methods used in mega-operations, have led favela residents to become increasingly 
cynical about the police. The view that police operations are planned for the very purpose of 
killing poor, black, young men is surprisingly mainstream. The official rhetoric of &#8220;war&#8221;, the 
acquisition of military hardware, and violent police symbols only make these views more 
broadly acceptable.<b>34</b>

<p>Carta Mayor, 25 July 2007. These views have considerable public support, because many people 
have little faith in the normal work of the police and other components of the criminal justice 
system. Fifty percent of Brazilians state that they do not even report crimes to the police because 
it would be a &#8220;waste of time&#8221;. (See William C Prillaman, &#8220;Crime, Democracy, and Development 
in Latin America&#8221;, Centre for Strategic and International Studies, Policy Papers on the Americas, 
Volume XIV, Study 6 (June 2003), p. 9. A Brazilian Judges&#8217; Association surveys show that 
citizens lack faith in the judiciary and consider it corrupt, slow, and mysterious. (AMB, Pesquisa 
qualitativa &#8220;Imagem do Poder Judici&#225;rio&#8221;, Bras&#237;lia, 2004, p. 61.) In a context of soaring crime 
rates, widespread citizen fear and insecurity, lack of faith in the police, and lack of trust in the 
judicial system, it is perhaps not surprising that many Brazilians support &#8216;tough&#8221; law and order 
approaches and the extrajudicial execution of suspected criminals: a 2002 Rio de Janeiro survey 
found that 47% supported the killing of murderers and thieves by police. See William C. 
Prillaman, &#8220;Crime, Democracy, and Development in Latin America&#8221;, Centre for Strategic and

<p>  In 2002, police acquired a military-style armoured vehicle, known colloquially as the 
<i>caveir&#227;o</i>, or &#8220;big skull&#8221;, so named because the BOPE&#8217;s emblem - a skull impaled on a sword, 
backed by two pistols - is displayed on the side of the vehicle. It can carry 12 armed officers, and 
has a modified turret and rows of firing positions along each side of the vehicle. By 2006, Rio 
had 10 of the vehicles. The vehicle is equipped with loudspeakers, and I received testimony from 
favela residents and civil society that police used the loudspeakers to threaten residents. The 
<i>caveir&#227;o</i> causes significant fear in the community. Given the intensity of criminal violence in 
Rio de Janeiro, armoured vehicles may be useful policing tools in the short-term since police 
should not be required to work at undue risk to their own lives. Armoured vehicles - when used 
properly - can improve police safety. However, their use should be restricted to circumstances in 
which it is indispensable in order to protect the lives of police. To reduce abuse their use should 
be monitored, and each deployment carefully recorded with audio and visual equipment installed 
on the inside and outside of the vehicle. </p>

<p><b>3. Policing gang controlled areas:  lessons learned from the 
Complexo do Alem&#227;o operation 
</b></p>
<p>27. The large operations of 2007 were ineffective in most respects. They endangered the 
residents of the communities in which the operations took place, failed to contribute to 
dismantling criminal organizations, and had a very limited effect on the quantity of drugs, 
weapons, and other contraband in the city or state at large. Given the striking failure of the &#8220;war&#8221; 
approach, the primary motivation for such policies seems to be the state Government&#8217;s wish to 
appear &#8220;tough on crime&#8221;. Some senior police officers, parliamentarians, and civil society 
advocates are highly critical of this &#8220;war&#8221; approach to policing. But they have largely been 
silenced by apparently strong middle class approval of confrontation tactics. Fortunately, more 
effective and less militaristic policing in Rio de Janeiro is possible. 
</p>
<p>28. An acceptable policing strategy cannot ignore or discount the need to protect individuals 
living within the communities controlled by criminal organizations. A clear lesson from the 
Complexo operation is that police operations to remove a criminal organization from a particular 
area must be followed by a sustained police presence. If the police withdraw, many of the very 
same gang members will return, as operations are unlikely to arrest the entirety of the local 
criminal organization. Even if the operation did arrest all or most of the gang members within 
that community, failure to maintain a police presence will permit members of the gang from 
other areas, or members of other gangs, to move in. If control returns to the gangs, the operation 
is likely to have left residents in great danger. One of the key reasons that people are killed by 
criminal organizations is that they are believed to be collaborating with the police or rival gangs. 
In many communities in Brazil, being labeled a &#8220;snitch&#8221; is tantamount to being sentenced to 
death. When one gang controls a community over time, its residents at least know the rules and 
how to act to survive. But when control changes hands, the residents face an impossible 
challenge: they must conduct themselves in a manner that will not be perceived as resistant to the 
current group&#8217;s control (which will likely result in death today), but they must also conduct 
themselves in a manner that will not be perceived as collaborating with that group when control 
subsequently swings to another group (which would likely result in death tomorrow). The police 
should not gratuitously inflict this further punishment on the residents already so unfortunate as 
to have their communities be controlled by criminal organizations. 
</p>
<p>29. By attempting to re-establish government control over a large area almost instantaneously, 
large-scale operations are not only too ambitious but contain the seeds of their own failure. 
Police dashing through a community are unable to develop a sufficient understanding of the local 
criminal structures as to be able to reliably identify and arrest the organization&#8217;s members. This 
is certainly the case when the level of government presence and thus of reliable intelligence was 
previously very low, as in the Complexo. This ignorance engenders fear and frustration and is 
likely to lead some policemen and units to commit acts of indiscriminate violence. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Extrajudicial executions by off-duty police:  death squads, 
extermination groups and militias 
</b></p>
<p>30. In addition to killings by on-duty police, there are a significant number of groups 
throughout Brazil, composed largely of off-duty government agents who engage in a range </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>of criminal activities, including extrajudicial executions. Some of these groups (militias or 
para-policing operations) are similar to gangs in that they seek to control entire favelas through 
extortion and the use of force. Others (death squads, extermination groups) act as vigilantes, 
using executions as an off-duty &#8220;crime control&#8221; technique, or act as hired killers to supplement 
their low salaries. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Second jobs and corruption:  a pathway to organized crime 
</b>31. Participation in organized criminal groups should be seen as the most extreme end of a 
continuum of illegal police actions that begins with corruption and the holding of second jobs. It 
is openly acknowledged by senior Government officials, police, and police commanders that the 
prohibited practice of police working second jobs<b>35</b> - primarily as security guards - is 
widespread. 
</p>
<p>32. While efforts are being made in Pernambuco, in S&#227;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, it was clear 
to me that nothing at all was being done to address this problem.<b>36</b> In fact, the head of a military 
battalion in Rio de Janeiro frankly admitted to me that he not only knew that his officers were 
taking illegal second jobs, but that he encouraged them to do so.<b>37</b> The motivation for working 
second jobs is straightforward: police are very poorly paid.<b>38</b> Working a second job is also 
facilitated by the policing shift structure in which police may work for 12 to 24 hours, and then 
take 24 hours to several days off. Unregulated private security jobs, especially in the context of 
high rates of organized crime and violence, means that working as a security guard can easily 
involve police using force in their second job, or being hired to &#8220;collect&#8221; money for an employer, 
or to protect an illegal gambling or trafficking racket. A telling statistic is that, in Rio de Janeiro 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>35
</b>  The relevant regulations are state-specific. In Rio de Janeiro, it is a disciplinary infraction for 
</p>
<p>a member of the Military Police to have other paid employment. <i>Regulamento Disciplinar da 
Pol&#237;cia Militar do Estado do Rio De Janeiro</i>, Decreto No. 6.579 (5 March 1983), Art. 14(1); 
Annex I, para. 120. 
<b>36
</b></p>
<p>  In Pernambuco, the Governor told me that when he took office in January 2007, he discovered 
that the police were overly entangled with private interests and that there were even written 
contracts between police and shopping centers and stores to provide security. His Government 
was taking steps to break these contracts. 
<b>37
</b></p>
<p>  In Rio de Janeiro, the numbers of police disciplined for holding second jobs is virtually 
nil: 2005 - 1 corporal arrested; 2006 - 3 corporals, 4 privates, and 1 sergeant reprimanded;  
2007 - 1 inspector of police suspended. 
<b>38
</b></p>
<p>  Rio de Janeiro Military Police have the lowest rate of police pay in the country. In 2006, 
entry-level Military Police in Rio de Janeiro received just $ 718 Reais per month (approximately 
$ 450 USD). The Federal Government has in part attempted to address low remuneration by 
offering training scholarships (Bolsa Forma&#231;&#227;o) to qualifying police earning under $ 1,400 Reais 
per month. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>in 2007, nearly four times as many police were killed while off-duty as while on-duty.<b>39</b> The 
evidence I saw pointed not to the explanation proffered by some security officials to the effect 
that police are targeted because of their on-duty activities, but rather to the conclusion that they 
are killed because of the dangerous and often illegal nature of their second jobs. 
33. Many police are also engaged in corruption and extortion to varying degrees.<b>40</b> Corruption 
and second jobs cause harm in themselves, but high-level tolerance of them also contributes to a 
culture of impunity in which police know they can operate outside the law. Importantly, it also 
creates a context in which police can choose to collaborate or compete with organized crime 
groups, thereby increasing the likelihood that police will become involved in militia and death 
squad activity. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Militias and para-policing 
</b></p>
<p>34. As reported to me by police investigators, public prosecutors, civil society, and residents of 
militia-controlled areas, militias are groups composed of police, ex-police, firefighters, prison 
guards, and private citizens, who attempt to &#8220;take over&#8221; geographical areas, and engage in 
extra-state &#8220;policing&#8221;. Like gangs, their motivations for such control are often economic - 
militias extort shop owners, and control the supply of gas, cable and transport services. Militias 
also seek to justify their control by contending that they are &#8220;protecting&#8221; residents from violent 
gangs and traffickers. However, for residents, rule under a militia is often just as violent and 
insecure as rule under a gang. Militias extrajudicially execute suspected traffickers while forcing 
them out of the area, execute other suspected criminals, intimidate residents, and threaten and 
kill those who speak out against the militia or are perceived to have allegiances to other groups 
vying for control. 
</p>
<p>35. Militias operate throughout Brazil but have become a particular problem in Rio de Janeiro 
over the last 3 years, where it is estimated that approximately 92 of the 500 Rio de Janeiro city 
favelas are now controlled by such groups. In particular, I received detailed information on the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>39
</b>  According to official statistics, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 2007, 119 members of the 
</p>
<p>police were killed while off-duty while 32 were killed while on-duty. (In 2006, the numbers were 
93 off-duty and 29 on-duty.) See: Rio de Janeiro, Public Security Institute (Instituto de 
Seguran&#231;a P&#250;blica), 19 March 2008. 
<b>40
</b></p>
<p>  In Pernambuco, I was given detailed information about the relationship between police and 
gangs in a number of communities. In one favela, every weekend police would come to the 
community to collect money from the traffickers. The leader of each gang generally has a 
number of &#8220;directors&#8221; in charge of the different types of trafficked drugs. The police would come 
to negotiate with &#8220;directors&#8221; (who in turn negotiate with their leader) on payments. Refusals to 
pay the police are met with death threats and murder. The weapons and drugs confiscated by 
police are regularly fed back into the trafficking system. Police &#8220;arrest&#8221; traffickers for the 
purposes of making money - demanding a bribe in return for the criminal&#8217;s freedom. When the 
gangs do not have sufficient funds to pay for one of their members, the gangs collect small sums 
from each resident to pay the police fee. </p>

</p>
<p>militia activities in the Kelson&#8217;s community, a neighborhood of 6,000. My sources included 
long-term residents, local NGOs, Civil Police responsible for investigating the Kelson&#8217;s militia, 
and the head of the Military Police battalion from which 4 police militia members had been 
arrested. For many years prior to 2006, the area was dominated by the drug traffickers from the 
Red Command gang (<i>Comando Vermelho</i>). In November 2006, a militia involving men from the 
14th, 16th and 22nd Military Police battalions invaded Kelson&#8217;s using police vehicles and 
equipment, and expelled the gang. The militia &#8220;policed&#8221; the area 24 hours a day, and extorted 
local businesses, restricted the ability of independent local shops to sell gasoline (only 
militia-run shops could do so), and required bus owners to pay the militia 600 Reais per week. 
</p>
<p>36. Jorge da Silva Siqueira Neto, who residents and police informed me had been installed as 
President of the Kelson&#8217;s Residents&#8217; Association with militia cooperation, subsequently fell out 
with the militia and was expelled from the area. He then made public denunciations against the 
militia, which were covered by the press on 29 August 2007. The next day, police arrested 
certain police who Jorge had accused of belonging to the militia. They were released from 
administrative detention within several days. On 1 September 2007, with the militia&#8217;s control 
undermined, the gang attempted to retake control of the area, but was kept out by police after 
heavy fighting. Jorge was kidnapped and murdered on 7 September 2007. Civil Police 
investigating the militia informed me that 6 members of the Military Police had been arrested for 
militia involvement, and a further 13 arrest warrants had been issued for non-police militia 
members. They stated that their investigations were ongoing but near completion. The head of 
the Military Police battalion told me that they were re-establishing control of the area, that police 
corruption and militia involvement by police in his battalion had already been investigated, and 
that the guilty officers had been arrested. However, I received credible accounts from residents 
and NGOs working in Kelson&#8217;s that on 8 October 2007, some members of the Military Police 
received payments from the Red Command gang, allowing them to re-enter the community and 
that, at the time of my mission, the gang continued to operate in Kelson&#8217;s. 
</p>
<p>37. Each time the control of the community changes hands, residents&#8217; lives are endangered. 
Those residents aligned with the group that was previously in control live in fear of retaliation 
from the new group, or are forced to leave.<b>41</b> The constant shifting of control makes it nearly 
impossible for residents to act in a way that will keep them safe in the present as well as when 
control changes hands in the future. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Death squads and extermination groups 
</b></p>
<p>38. Death squads, extermination groups, and vigilante groups are groups formed by police and 
others whose purpose is to kill, primarily for profit.<b>42</b> Such groups sometimes also justify their 
actions as an extralegal &#8220;crime-fighting&#8221; tool. In circumstances where the groups are hired for 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>41
</b>  I was informed that since the militia first took control, approximately 35 families  
</p>
<p>(200-250 people) have been forced to abandon their homes and leave the area. 
<b>42
</b></p>
<p>  In Pernambuco, hired killers earn $ 1,000 to $ 5,000 Reais per killing. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>profit, those who hire them are sometimes members of other criminal organizations, traffickers, 
or corrupt politicians, seeking to control a perceived threat, gain an advantage over a rival group, 
or exact revenge. Killers are also hired by those who believe that the police and the criminal 
justice system are unable to effectively combat crime, and so &#8220;vigilante justice&#8221; is necessary 
when they, or a family member, have been the victim of a crime. 
</p>
<p>39. The public prosecution service in Pernambuco estimated that approximately 70% of the 
homicides in Pernambuco are committed by death squads. A federal parliamentary commission 
of inquiry found that extermination groups are mostly composed of Government agents (police 
and prison guards), and that 80% of the crimes caused by extermination groups involve police or 
ex-police.<b>43</b> The Governor of Pernambuco also told me that his Government is aware that 
members of the Military Police are involved in most death squads. As the commission of inquiry 
report notes, it is police who have the power, information, resources, weapons, and training to 
most effectively run such groups.<b>44</b> The Pernambuco Government, which took office in 2007, 
appears committed to ending this phenomenon and has undertaken a number of promising 
initiatives.<b>45</b>

<p>  As the commission of inquiry&#8217;s report explains: &#8220;The extermination groups are composed 
mostly of government agents - civil and military police, penitentiary agents, in short, by 
personnel that are very powerful and possess the information, arms and circumstances to act. 
However, their composition varies: ex-police expelled from the corps owing to their participation 
in illegal activities; police on active-duty who use these groups as a means to augment their 
salaries; individuals contracted as private security; groups that participate in criminal 
organizations linked to drug-trafficking and other illegal activities; and groups that do not 
maintain specific relationships with organized crime but that exercise control over particular 
areas with the excuse of guaranteeing the &#8216;security&#8217; of its residents - this type is very common in 
the outlying neighborhoods in the big cities. There are also organizations that contract with

<p>  Working with Federal Police and drawing on information gathered by a new integrated 
intelligence unit within the Public Security Secretariat, police arrested 197 people for death 
squad involvement during 2007. (During my visit, 34 people (police, lawyers, businessmen) 
were arrested and charged with participating in death squads, killing 35 people during the 
previous 5 month period, and suspected of killing several hundred victims over the years. One 
of the death squad groups was led by a former member of the Military Police. In April 2007, 
members of another death squad were arrested in Pernambuco, and charged with killing 
200 people.) In addition, many police were suspended from duties during 2007, and charges 
were also laid against senior members of the Civil Police. (In 2007, 600 Military Police were

<p>40. Extermination groups are also responsible for the murders of landless workers and 
indigenous persons in rural areas, generally in the context of disputes over land. While the 
numbers of landless workers or indigenous persons executed each year does not form a large 
proportion of Brazil&#8217;s total homicides, the killings that take place serve to reinforce a broader 
system of repression by demonstrating the lethal consequences of defying powerful actors. The 
Pastoral Land Commission reports on average approximately 40 murders per year of landless 
workers.<b>46</b> In the state of Par&#225; alone, over 770 landless workers and other human rights defenders 
have been killed since 1971.<b>47</b> These killings generally occur in retribution for the activism of 
landless workers or during violent evictions from land settled by landless workers.<b>48</b> The 
<i>Conselho Indigenista Mission&#225;rio</i> (CIMI) informed me that they estimate that about 10 summary 
executions of indigenous persons occur each year.<b>49</b> While individual killings are a result of 
structural land conflict issues, complex and long-term land use and ownership issues should not

confiscate, and over 6,000 were confiscated in 2007. Pay rates, and health and education services 
for police have also been increased, and training for intelligence techniques has been provided. 
These efforts in Pernambuco need to continue, and other states should pursue similar initiatives. 
<b>46
</b></p>
<p>  See Comiss&#227;o Pastoral da Terra, &#8220;Assassinatos&#8221; at www.cptnac.com.br. In 2007, the most 
recent year for which there are homicide statistics, the number of homicides (28) was lower than 
the previous years&#8217; averages. (However, in 2007, the number of states in which murders took 
place increased from 8 to 14).

<p>  For example, I received reports that on 21 October 2007, a few weeks prior to my visit, an 
armed militia group shot and killed Valmir Mota de Oliveira (42 years old), a leader of the 
<i>Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra</i> (MST), at the Via Campesina encampment at 
the GMO field of Syngenta Seeds, Santa Tereza do Oeste, Paran&#225;. Five other farmers were also 
shot and seriously wounded. The MST leaders had been threatened for the previous 6 months by 
the militia, who were believed to have been employed by Syngenta.

<p>  These killings either occur in the context of disputes over land that has already been 
demarcated to indigenous groups pursuant to the requirements of Article 231 of the 
1988 Constitution, but on which others trespass for the purposes of resource exploitation, or the 
killings occur over land which is not yet demarcated but which an indigenous group chooses to 
begin to reclaim. The National Foundation for Indians (<i>Funda&#231;&#227;o Nacional do &#205;ndio</i>, FUNAI) 
has responsibility for indigenous policies, and policing of indigenous areas is largely the 
responsibility of the Federal Police. I was told by NGOs and indigenous representatives that 
Federal Police presence was often non-existent or minimal. In indigenous areas known to have 
serious land conflicts, Federal Police presence should be increased, and police who work in and 
near indigenous areas should receive specialist training to sensitize them to the land issues and 
indigenous culture. </p>

<p>be used as an excuse for failing to take immediate action to prevent, prosecute and punish 
extrajudicial executions in this context. Land conflicts form the context in which these murders 
take place. But it is not the case that executions inevitably follow from conflicts over land. 
Executions occur because those who order and carry out the murders know that they will get 
away with it. Brazil must ensure that reported death threats are investigated and the perpetrators 
punished. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  PRISONS AND EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS IN DETENTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>41. Killings in state detention facilities in Brazil occur primarily in the context of prison riots 
and gang-related inmate violence, during which the perpetrators are inmates, prison guards, or 
police sent in to quell the disturbance or rebellion.<b>50</b> While the precise trigger for each killing is 
unique,<b>51</b> there are a number of general factors which facilitate excessive violence throughout the 
prison system. Significantly, these factors not only lead to inmate unrest but have encouraged the 
growth of a parallel gang power in prisons. The failure of the state to meet basic inmate needs 
and security encourages the growth of gangs by creating a power vacuum in which gangs are 
able to present themselves as securing benefits for inmates. This not only results in excessive 
prison violence, but as the events of May 2006 in S&#227;o Paulo clearly demonstrate, has effects far 
beyond the prison walls. Broader crime control efforts must take into account the key role played 
by prisons in gang growth, and the failure of the prison system to curb the activities of organized 
crime. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Analysis of the factors facilitating prison violence 
</b></p>
<p>42. Brazil&#8217;s poor prison conditions and severe overcrowding are well-documented.<b>52</b> The 
national prison population has risen sharply over the last decade, and the incarceration rate has

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>50
</b>  Major prison riots include: In October 1992, 111 prisoners were killed when Military Police 
</p>
<p>attempted to regain control of the Carandiru prison in S&#227;o Paulo following a riot; one person was 
convicted in relation to these deaths, but his conviction was overturned in Feburary 2006. In 
2001, there were riots in 29 separate facilities simultaneously in S&#227;o Paulo. In 2002, 10 died and 
60 escaped from the Embu das Artes jail in S&#227;o Paulo. In 2003, 84 prisoners escaped from the 
Silvio Porto prison in Para&#237;ba. In 2004, 14 inmates were killed and some were mutilated during 
an uprising at the Urso Branco prison in Rond&#244;nia. In 2004, 34 inmates died during a riot at 
Benfica prison in Rio de Janeiro. In 2007, 25 inmates were burned to death by other inmates at 
the Ponte Nova prison in Minas Gerais. 
<b>51
</b></p>
<p>  For the genesis of the May 2006 riots in S&#227;o Paulo, see Part III(C)(1). For another example, 
the August 2007 violence in Minas Gerais was reportedly a result of conflict between gangs. 
<b>52
</b></p>
<p>  See, for example: Report of the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights on the question of 
torture (20/8 - 12/9/2000), report E/CN.4/2001/66/Add.2. </p>

<p>more than doubled.<b>53</b> The dramatic rise - caused by the slowness of the judicial system, poor 
monitoring of inmate status and release entitlement, increased crime rates, high recidivism rates, 
and the popularity of tougher law and order approaches favouring longer prison terms over 
alternative sentences - has resulted in severely overcrowded prisons. The prison system was 
designed to hold only 60% of the inmates actually detained nationwide,<b>54</b> and many individual 
prisons are two or three times over capacity.<b>55</b> 
</p>
<p>43. Senior Government officials responsible for prison administration affirmed that there are 
problems with physical abuse and corruption by prison guards. While I was informed by officials 
at one prison I visited that there were no mistreatment issues and thus no guards had been 
punished, this picture contrasts with that presented by those with legal authority to monitor the 
prison, by civil society groups, and by inmates whom I interviewed. The Judge of Penal 
Execution, for example, has been involved in various legal actions relating to beatings by groups

</p>
<p><b>53
</b>  In 1995, the inmate population was 148,760, or 93 per 100,000. By 2006, it had jumped 
</p>
<p>to 401,236, or 213.8 per 100,000: See Minist&#233;rio da Justi&#231;a; Centro de Estudos de Seguran&#231;a e

<b>55
</b></p>
<p>  The problem in the state of S&#227;o Paulo is especially acute. S&#227;o Paulo contains 20% of the 
nation&#8217;s population but 40% of its prison population. As of 30 October 2007 there were 
140,680 inmates in 143 penitentiaries (currently beyond capacity by 44,807 inmates), and a 
further 11,073 in police lock-ups. (See Secretaria da Administra&#231;&#227;o Penitenci&#225;ria Gabinete do 
Secret&#225;rio.<b>)</b> A prison I visited in S&#227;o Paulo which is a provisional detention centre for those 
awaiting trial or conviction is currently at three times its capacity. At 9 August 2007, it held 
1,438 inmates, with a capacity for 512. (See &#8220;Relat&#243;rio referente &#224; visita realizada prisional 
Centro de Deten&#231;&#227;o Provis&#243;ria II de Pinheiros em 9 de agosto de 2007 pelo Conselho da 
Comunidade da Comarca de S&#227;o Paulo&#8221;.) On the day I visited, 6 November 2007, it was holding 
1,520 inmates. Cells equipped for eight regularly hold up to 25 inmates, who take turns sleeping 
on beds or the floor. Although the law provides for access to work and education, nationally, as 
of December 2004, only about 18% of the total number of those in prison were involved in any 
form of education. (UNESCO Office (Brazil), <i>Education for Freedom: Trajectory, Debates and 
Proposals of a Project for Education in Brazilian Prisons, </i>(March 2007), p. 34; Constitution of 
Brazil, Art. 208; Law no 9.394/96 (Bases and Directives for Education - Art 37 &#167; 1), CEB 
Technical Opinion no 11/2000, Law no 10.172/2001 (National Education Plan), Law no 7.21-/84 
(Law of Penal Execution), and CNPCP Resolution no 14/94 (Basic Regulations for the 
Treatment of Prisoners).) Rates in S&#227;o Paulo in 2007 remained low: 17.21% of inmates had 
access to education; 42.34% to work; and 40.45% were involved in no activity whatsoever. 
(See Secretaria da Administra&#231;&#227;o Penitenci&#225;ria Gabinete do Secret&#225;rio.) Given that the inmate 
population is largely young (over 50% are under 30), poor (95%), and uneducated (over 65% 
have less than an eighth grade education, 12% are illiterate), the lack of education and work fails 
to provide inmates with alternatives to crime upon release, and helps to ensure that prisons are a 
training ground for future criminal activity. </p>

<p>of prison officials against inmates at this facility.<b>56</b> Inmates with whom I spoke had witnessed 
and received beatings. It is telling that the threat of retaliation for making a complaint against a 
prison official is so serious that prison monitors consider any such complaints likely to be true. 
The inmates who I interviewed were afraid to even have it known that they had spoken with me, 
fearing reprisals from other inmates and prison officials. 
</p>
<p>44. Delays in processing transfers, together with warden violence and poor general conditions 
encourage the growth of gangs in prisons, which can justify their existence to the prison 
population at large by purporting to act on behalf of prisoners to obtain benefits and prevent 
violence. Poor prison administration and conditions thus facilitate not only riots, but directly 
contributes to the growth of criminal gangs.<b>57</b> 
</p>
<p>45. In most prisons, the state fails to exert sufficient control over inmates, and lets gangs (or 
other prisoners in &#8220;neutral prisons&#8221;) sort out amongst themselves matters of internal prison 
security. Selected inmates are often given more power over other prisoners&#8217; daily lives than 
guards. They assume control of (sometimes brutal) internal discipline and the distribution of 
food, medicine, and hygiene kits.<b>58</b> This practice often results in allowing gang-leaders to run 
prisons. 
</p>
<p>46. Many prisons throughout Brazil require inmates to designate which gang they belong to 
when they enter the prison system for the first time. Prison administrations adopted this practice 
as a way to better control prison populations and to reduce inter-gang conflict in prisons - one

<b>57
</b></p>
<p>  The movement of inmates through the prison system - from police lock-ups, to provisional 
detention centres awaiting trial or conviction, to closed prisons, to open prisons, and eventual 
release - is largely not recorded electronically. (Brazil&#8217;s National Penitentiary Department 
(<i>Departamento Penitenci&#225;rio Nacional</i>) has created software called &#8220;Infopen Management&#8221;, 
through which inmates&#8217; details can be electronically stored. At present, approximately 
28,000 inmates (about 7% of the total prison population) have been registered in this way.) 
Together with inadequate monitoring of each inmate&#8217;s status, this means that inmates are 
frequently held in the incorrect facility. For example, inmates can be held in closed detention 
when the inmate is already entitled to be held in open detention and thus able to work in the 
community during the day. Prison monitors with whom I spoke noted that it was not uncommon 
for inmates to be held one year beyond the time they should have been moved or released. 
One inmate whom I interviewed had been detained over a year, and had already been tried, but 
knew nothing about his proceedings, or why he was still in provisional detention. Another 
inmate, arrested in late 2005, had had various hearings but was unaware of the status of the 
proceedings. 
<b>58
</b></p>
<p>  These prisoners are known by various euphemisms, including &#8220;<i>faxinas</i>&#8221; (janitors) and 
&#8220;<i>chaveiros</i>&#8221; (key-holders). </p>

</p>
<p>particular prison or prison wing will, for example, only hold members of the Red Command 
gang, while another will only hold members of the Friends of Friends gang. In Rio de Janeiro, 
even when a new inmate has no gang affiliation whatsoever, he may be required by prison 
administrators to pick a gang with which to be affiliated. A prisoner who refuses is simply 
assigned to a gang by the prison administration. The state practice of requiring gang 
identification essentially amounts to the state recruiting prisoners into gangs. Ultimately, this 
contributes to the growth of gangs outside prison and elevates crime rates more generally. Given 
the power that gangs have now established in the prison system, rival gangs must clearly remain 
separated to avoid prison riots and deaths. But it is important to take all available steps to avoid 
turning common criminals into committed gang members. While in theory some states have 
&#8220;neutral&#8221; prisons in which prisoners without any gang affiliation may be placed, there need to be 
more of these, and their neutrality needs to be better preserved in practice. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Prison oversight 
</b></p>
<p>47. There are many bodies with the legal authority to investigate prison conditions, but they 
have not provided adequate oversight in practice. This lack of external oversight has permitted 
poor prison conditions and abuses of power to continue. The law provides for a number of 
organs to inspect and monitor prisons.<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p>48. However, inmates I interviewed had rarely seen or even heard of a visit by an external 
prison monitor. They were aware of rare visits by prison internal affairs, but no inmate with 
whom I spoke knew of a visit by a judge, prison council, or other prison oversight body. It is 
essential for the effectiveness of complaint mechanisms that monitoring is not only done 
regularly, but also that it is visible to inmates. The mere existence of an internal oversight office 
is grossly inadequate in a context where prisoners are too afraid to make any complaint. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  COMBATING IMPUNITY:  THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Overview 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Civil Police have primary responsibility for homicide investigations. This is true 
whether the suspected perpetrator is a private citizen or a member of either police force. The 
Civil Police then refer the case to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, which may initiate criminal 
proceedings. In homicide cases, it is a jury that pronounces the verdict and the judge who 
decides on the sentence. Two other institutions help to ensure the quality of the investigation and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>59
</b>  Lei de Execu&#231;&#227;o Penal, Lei No. 7.210 (adopted 11 July 1984). In practice, the key actors are 
</p>
<p>the Judges of Penal Execution and the Community Councils. Judges of Penal Execution are 
required to inspect prisons monthly and have the power to &#8220;interdict, in all or in part, any penal 
establishment that is functioning under inadequate conditions or infringing the provisions of 
[the law]&#8221;. The number of such judges is, however, insufficient to meet their extensive 
responsibilities. In S&#227;o Paulo, for example, there is just one Judge of Penal Execution for the 
capital, who is responsible for monitoring 10,000 inmates in nine prisons. This makes it 
impossible for the Judge to adequately monitor inmate status and prison conditions. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
 page 27 
 
</p>
<p>the integrity of the subsequent process. A state Institute of Forensic Medicine may support the 
investigation by conducting an autopsy. And witness protection programs may be used to 
prevent suspects from intimidating witnesses. 
</p>
<p>50. While each of these institutions performs well some of the time, obtaining a conviction 
requires them all to work well at the same time, and this happens infrequently. For example, in 
Rio de Janeiro and S&#227;o Paulo, only about 10% of homicides end up being tried in the courts; in 
Pernambuco the rate is about 3%. Of the 10% tried in S&#227;o Paulo, it is estimated that about half 
are actually convicted. These rates are even lower for cases implicating police. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Criminal investigations by the civil police 
</b></p>
<p>51. I received many allegations that Civil Police investigations, particularly of killings by 
police, are often grossly inadequate. I was informed by prosecutors that police investigations are 
often not recorded properly, and sometimes the only evidence would be a crime scene 
description and a police statement. The use of DNA and ballistics evidence is rare and technical 
and human resources are lacking. 
</p>
<p>52. These problems are exacerbated when the case is one in which members of the Military 
Police report the killing as a &#8220;resistance&#8221; death. As detailed above in Part III (C) a strong 
<i>esprit-de-corps </i>results in Civil Police poorly investigating such cases.<b>60</b> I was repeatedly told by 
Civil Police that when a resistance case occurs, they assume that the Military Police were dealing 
with criminals, and acting in self-defence. 
</p>
<p>53. I was also given examples of police negligently or intentionally allowing cases to sit in 
police precincts, without passing them to prosecutors. For example, in Pernambuco, prosecutors 
found 2,000 cases where files had been left in police precincts and not passed on to the 
prosecution service. The files had been left for over 20 years - well past the period of 
prescription - so prosecutions are now impossible. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Forensic evidence and State institutes of forensic medicine 
</b></p>
<p>54. The state Institutes of Forensic Medicine in Brazil suffer from a lack of basic resources 
and are not sufficiently independent from police.<b>61</b> For example, in Rio de Janeiro, the 
independent expert reports on the deaths during the Complexo do Alem&#227;o operation found, 
upon reviewing the relevant autopsy reports prepared by the state institutes, that they were 
grossly deficient: basic x-ray, blood, and gun powder analysis had simply not been carried out. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>60
</b>  Although the Civil Police and Military Police are independent institutions, members of the 
</p>
<p>respective forces in a given area will routinely cooperate on ordinary cases. The relationships 
that develop can impede effective investigations implicating the Military Police. This problem is 
ameliorated when a specialized Civil Police unit with broader geographical coverage, such as the 
Department of Homicides and Protection of the Person (Departamento de Homic&#237;dios e Prote&#231;&#227;o 
&#224; Pessoa (DHPP)) in S&#227;o Paulo, takes over a case involving a killing by police. 
<b>61
</b></p>
<p>  Positively, Brazil invested $ 12,000,000 Reais in 2007 in equipment. However, there remains 
a serious lack of basic resources in many state institutes. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>55. The use of forensic evidence is critical in some cases, especially when there are no 
witnesses or when those that exist are afraid to testify. For these reasons, forensic evidence is 
especially important in killings alleged by the police to have been proportionate responses to 
&#8220;resistance&#8221;. The only testimony available may be that of the police officer responsible for the 
shooting, but where reliable physical evidence is available, it may nevertheless be possible to 
determine that a particular shooting was an extrajudicial execution. 
</p><p>56. Presently, in most states, the Institute of Forensic Medicine is responsible to the state 
Public Security Secretariat. Given that Institutes of Forensic Medicine are intended to provide 
expert advice rather than to carry out government policy, their institutional autonomy and 
independence and the tenure of their staff should be guaranteed. Doing so would, moreover, 
ensure that their reports on police killings would be - and appear to be - impartial, expert 
determinations. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (<i>Minist&#233;rio P&#250;blico</i>) is a widely-respected institution in 
Brazil, and I was told of many examples of prosecutors who had taken action to hold to account 
offending police officers. The independence of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office from both the 
executive and the judiciary is provided by the Constitution, and the employment guarantees 
provided to individual prosecutors ensure that they have a high-level of independence in 
practice.<b>62</b> 
</p>
<p>58. In areas in which progress has been made against police impunity, prosecutors have 
generally played a key role both in pursuing criminal proceedings and ensuring evidence 
gathering. In some instances, prosecutors have cooperated closely with Civil Police 
investigations; in others, prosecutors have re-interviewed witnesses and gathered evidence on 
their own initiative. 
</p>
<p>59. In practice, the prosecutors&#8217; investigative role has often been discouraged by Civil Police 
and impeded by legal controversy over prosecutorial powers. First, Civil Police show little 
awareness of the value of consulting with prosecutors to make sure that the evidence they are 
gathering will suffice to sustain criminal charges. For this reason, they seldom inform 
prosecutors until they reach a stage at which the law requires them to do so. This will typically 
not be until 30 days after the crime took place, by when the crime scene will almost certainly be 
destroyed, bodies are likely to have been buried, and witnesses may have fled. Second, some 
have challenged the legal power of prosecutors to gather evidence, arguing that only the Civil 
Police have the right to conduct investigations. While this argument appears to be motivated 
more by institutional jealousies than constitutional analysis, the courts have not provided a 
definitive answer, meaning that prosecutors who gather evidence cannot be certain that it will 
prove admissible at trial. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>62
</b>  It is also worth noting that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has a broad range of other, 
</p>
<p>non-prosecutorial powers and responsibilities with respect to protecting individual rights and 
exercising external control over police activities: Constitution of Brazil, Arts. 127-129. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
 page 29 
 
</p>
<p>60. From the perspective of combating impunity for violations of the right to life, it would be a 
significant step forward if Civil Police routinely consulted with prosecutors from the beginning 
of homicide investigations. Moreover - while it goes without saying that the Civil Police will and 
should remain the main institution carrying out criminal investigations - in cases in which the 
police are implicated, prosecutors should routinely conduct their own independent inquiries to 
ensure the appearance and reality of justice. The practice of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in 
S&#227;o Paulo of having all &#8220;resistance&#8221; cases handled by a specialist prosecutor is notable in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Witness protection 
</b></p>
<p>61. The high number of homicides in Brazil, together with significant levels of organized 
crime and police corruption and violence, means that an effective and comprehensive witness 
protection program is essential in order to protect particularly vulnerable witnesses and to ensure 
that impunity does not result from widespread witness intimidation. I interviewed many victims&#8217; 
relatives who told me they had spoken with witnesses to the victim&#8217;s death. But in many cases 
the witnesses feared police reprisals and refused to come forward publicly. I also spoke to a 
number of family members taking action to investigate the circumstances of the victim&#8217;s death 
who had received death threats. 
</p>
<p>62. Brazil has recognized the importance of witness protection and has taken positive steps 
over the past decade to improve its programs. The most important of its witness protection 
programs, the <i>Programa de Assist&#234;ncia a V&#237;timas e a</i> <i>Testemunhas Amea&#231;adas<b></b></i><b>63</b> (PROVITA), 
currently operates in 16 states and the federal district.<b>64</b> Between 1998 and 2006, it protected a 
total of 2265 people (870 witnesses and 1395 family members).<b>65</b> Between 2003 and 2007, 
355 people were protected in relation to executions. PROVITA&#8217;s structure is defined by federal 
legislation, it receives a combination of federal and state funding, and is administered at the state 
level. In each state, a committee that includes judges, prosecutors, and others, provides policy 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>63
</b>  Law No. 9.807, of the 13th of July, 1999. PROVITA was started in 1996 in Pernambuco by

</p>
<p> In addition to PROVITA, the National Special Secretariat for Human Rights developed the 
National Programme for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders. However, it currently only 
operates in a few states, and does not protect many human rights defenders. According to SDDH, 
the National Program for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders has a list of 90 human rights 
defenders in Par&#225; threatened with execution, but only 10% of these are under protection.

<p>direction and makes final decisions on the admission and expulsion of witnesses.<b>66</b> Day-to-day 
operations are conducted by the state&#8217;s secretariat for justice in tandem with an NGO. The NGO 
receives government funds to relocate witnesses and help them integrate into a new community. 
This innovative structure, in which government officials are not actually informed of the 
witness&#8217;s location, has provided witnesses to crimes committed by Government agents a much 
higher level of protection than most systems that rely solely on the Government to provide 
protection. However, some of the NGOs providing protection services to witnesses reported 
dissatisfaction with the structure of the program and questioned the long-term viability of a 
program that relies so extensively on NGO implementing partners. 
</p>
<p>63. In practice, some State Governments have not fulfilled their PROVITA obligations. At the 
time of my visit, the program in Rio de Janeiro had been operating for over a year without state 
funding,<b>67</b> and the program in Pernambuco had been doing so for 5 months. Another problem 
identified by officials and NGO representatives responsible for PROVITA was that they face 
problems when there is a need to escort witnesses to court (the most dangerous time for a witness 
under protection), and when there is a need for emergency transportation. These services are to 
be provided by state police forces, but this provides an opportunity for obstruction and 
intimidation. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  The judiciary and court processes 
</b>64. All intentional homicides are tried by juries in regular, civilian courts.<b>68</b> But few 
convictions against police are achieved. I received many complaints from victims, families, 
police, prosecutors, and Government officials that the judicial system in Brazil is overburdened 
and slow.

</p>
<p>(9 November 2007). This has had obvious effects on the numbers of people that can be protected 
by the program. In Rio de Janeiro, at November 2007, 41 people were being protected, while 
numbers in prior years were notably higher (2000 (70), 2001 (76), 2002 (66), 2003 (78),  
2004 (68), 2005 (58), 2006 (75)). 
<b>68
</b></p>
<p>  This represents significant progress: Prior to a 1996 statute, homicide cases against members 
of the Military Police were tried by special military courts. Now, jury trials are used, but only in 
cases involving intentional crimes against life. Law 9.299 (adopted 7 August 1996) amended 
Art. 9 of the C&#243;digo Penal Militar and Art. 82 of the C&#243;digo de Processo Penal Militar so as to 
remove &#8220;intentional crimes against life committed against a civilian&#8221; from the military justice 
system. The system used for jury selection is not designed to produce a &#8220;jury of one&#8217;s peers&#8221; as 
in common law systems. Instead, each year, a judge selects several hundred individuals to 
compose the jury pool based on his &#8220;personal knowledge or reliable information&#8221; with the 
assistance of lists provided by local authorities and professional guilds. The jury for a particular 
trial is chosen at random from this list. (C&#243;digo de Processo Penal, Arts. 74, 427, 439.) </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
 page 31 
 
</p>
<p>65. The period of prescription for intentional homicide is, depending on whether there are 
aggravating factors, either 12 or 20 years.<b>69</b> The period of prescription continues to run until all 
appeals have been completed. (Appeals may be made to higher state courts, to the federal 
<i>Superior Tribunal de Justi&#231;a</i> and, if there is a constitutional issue, ultimately to the <i>Supremo 
Tribunal Federal</i>.) In the context of a very slow justice system, this creates impunity for serious 
crimes. This problem is exacerbated by the tendency of some judges to put off dealing with cases 
implicating the police and other powerful actors, and to manage their dockets so as to prioritize 
civil cases over criminal cases. 
</p>
<p>66. Recent reforms have allowed crimes implicating the State&#8217;s international human rights 
obligations to be investigated by the Federal Police and, at the request of the Prosecutor-General, 
transferred from the state to the federal courts.<b>70</b> While these reforms hold promise,<b>71</b> the criteria 
for jurisdiction to be transferred have been narrowly construed by the courts, and, up to the time 
of my visit, only one case has actually been transferred. 
</p>
<p>67. The National Council of Justice was recently established to provide external oversight of 
the judiciary, and it has the power to propose reforms, monitor judicial activity, and to remove a 
judge or impose other sanctions. The Council should consider how its rulemaking powers could 
be used to improve the judiciary&#8217;s response to impunity. Useful measures would include 
designating judges who would handle solely cases involving killings by on- or off-duty police 
and promulgating a protocol for prison inspections by Judges of Penal Execution. 
</p>
<p><b>VI. POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY:  INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL 
OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS 
</b></p>
<p>68. An effective system of police accountability requires both internal and external oversight 
mechanisms. In Brazil, both sets of mechanisms should be improved so that they might better 
play their complementary roles.

</p>
<p><b>A.  Police internal affairs 
</b></p>
<p>69. In each state, the Military Police and the Civil Police each have an Internal Affairs 
Department (<i>Corregedoria</i>) responsible for conducting administrative proceedings and 
recommending disciplinary sanctions. (In some states, the two police forces share a single 
Internal Affairs Department.) In the case of a crime, such as homicide, this internal affairs 
process will run in parallel to the criminal investigation. However, few police are sanctioned or 
disciplined, even for serious crimes. And many police accused of serious crimes not only remain 
free from detention during the course of an investigation but remain on active duty. This permits 
police to intimidate witnesses and increases community perceptions that impunity exists for 
police murderers, in turn decreasing the willingness of witnesses to report crimes. 
</p>
<p>70. According to prosecutors and other informed interlocutors, the quality of work done by 
Internal Affairs Departments varies widely. Some conduct careful investigations and recommend 
appropriate sanctions. Others uncritically accept the accounts given by implicated police or 
simply stall the process. When the new government took office in Pernambuco they found over 
300 proceedings against police stalled in Internal Affairs - waiting for the head of department to 
authorize the continuance of proceedings. 
</p>
<p>71. One factor contributing to poor performance is that Internal Affairs Departments are not 
independent of the police chain of command. Thus their effectiveness largely depends on the 
individual head of department. Reforms are, however, complicated. After all, the principal role 
of an internal affairs service is to ensure the accountability of police to their chain of command. 
Nevertheless, such departments should conduct investigations and recommend sanctions in an 
autonomous and professional manner. Various interlocutors proposed a separate career path for 
those working in internal affairs. Presently, officers can work in internal affairs investigating 
allegations of police misconduct and then return to work alongside the officers whom they had 
previously investigated. Clear procedures and time limits for investigations should also be 
followed. Another key step would be for the disciplinary sanctions recommended by internal 
affairs services, including recommendations of expulsion which require the governor&#8217;s consent 
to take effect, be fully accessible to Ombudsman Offices and made public by them. 
</p>
<p>72. In addition, those police implicated in crimes constituting extrajudicial executions must be 
removed from active duty for the entire period of all internal affairs and criminal 
investigations.<b>72</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Ombudsman offices 
</b></p>
<p>73. Police Ombudsman Offices (<i>Ouvidorias</i>) are a relatively new institution in Brazil - the first 
was set up in 1995 in S&#227;o Paulo.<b>73</b> Their precise role and powers differ slightly between the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>72
</b>  Principle 15, Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, 
</p>
<p>Arbitrary and Summary Executions. 
<b>73
</b></p>
<p>  Decree n&#186; 39,900, of 1 January 1995; Complementary Law n&#186; 826, of 20 June 1997. There are 
now ombudsmen in 14 states, including Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco. </p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.2

</p>
<p>states, but in general they are empowered to receive complaints about police from the public, and 
may forward complaints to police Internal Affairs Departments or the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. 
They can also monitor ongoing police investigations and provide information to the public on the 
progress of investigations.<b>74</b> 
</p>
<p>74. The existence of Ombudsman Offices has made it possible for many people to make 
complaints about police behavior who otherwise would not have done so for fear of having to 
report such complaints directly to police.<b>75</b> However, the effectiveness of these offices is 
hampered by their lack of independence, resources, and investigative powers. Ombudsman 
Offices are unable to conduct their own investigations and thus rely almost entirely on 
information provided by the internal affairs services of the police. Both factors undermine the 
ability of Ombudsman Offices to provide genuinely <i>external</i> oversight. 
</p>
<p>75. Efforts to strengthen the institution of the Ombudsman should keep in mind its place 
within the overall system of police accountability. It does not need more teeth: The Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office already has the power to prosecute police and, more broadly, to &#8220;exercise 
external control over police conduct&#8221;.<b>76</b> But to provide <i>external</i> accountability, it should report 
directly to the governor rather than to the state secretary of public security.<b>77</b> In addition, it needs 
to be better equipped to gather its own information on individual cases and on broad trends and 
patterns of police abuse. And to provide external <i>accountability</i> it does need to better 
communicate the information it gathers to the general public. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>74
</b>  For example, the Ombudsman in S&#227;o Paulo has been tracking 54 (at least 11 with suspected 
</p>
<p>police involvement) cases involving 89 victims of crimes from May 2006 in which the 
perpetrator was unknown, and making public the progress of police investigations into each 
killing. 
<b>75
</b></p>
<p>  In S&#227;o Paulo, the Ombudsman received 3668 complaints in 2006. Of these, 476 concerned 
murders, of which 20% implicated the Civil Police and 68% implicated the Military Police (with 
the residual implicating either or both). A number of states have also created telephone hotlines 
(<i>disque-den&#250;ncia</i>), which have made it easier for anonymous complaints to be made. In 
S&#227;o Paulo, for instance, 34% of complaints received in 2006 were made by telephone, with 
another 15% made by email. The existence of the hotline has also played an important role in 
information gathering on death squads in Pernambuco.

<p>  Additional measures for further ensuring the independence of Ombudsman Offices 
recommended by the parliamentary commission of inquiry into extermination groups in the 
Northeast should also be given careful consideration. <i>See</i> <i>Relat&#243;rio Final da Comiss&#227;o 
Parlamentar de Inqu&#233;rito do Exterm&#237;nio no Nordeste. </i>Criada por meio do Requerimento

<p><b>VII.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Brazilian Government has, in the past, been very responsive to the 
recommendations offered by special rapporteurs. It is to be hoped that the following 
recommendations are seen as constructive and feasible. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Policing strategies 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>State Governors, Secretaries for Public Security, and Police Chiefs and Commanders 
should take the lead to make publicly clear that there will be zero tolerance for the use of 
excessive force and the execution of suspected criminals by police. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The State Government of Rio de Janeiro should eschew large-scale, or &#8220;mega&#8221;, 
operations in favor of systematic and planned progress in reasserting a sustained police 
presence and government authority in gang-controlled areas. Present policies are killing 
large numbers of people, alienating those whose support is needed for potential success, 
wasting precious resources, and failing to achieve the stated objectives. Designing policing 
strategies solely with electoral objectives in mind does a disservice to the police, the 
communities affected, and society at large. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The use of armoured vehicles should be monitored by equipping them with audio and 
visual recording equipment. The results should be regularly monitored in cooperation with 
community groups. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>In the longer term the Government should work towards abolishing the separate 
system of military police. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The federal Government should implement more effective measures to tie state 
funding to compliance with measures aimed at reducing the incidence of extrajudicial 
executions by police. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Police involvement in organized crime 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>In each State, the State Secretariat for Public Security should establish a reliable 
specialized unit to investigate and prosecute police involvement in militias and 
extermination groups. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Off-duty police should under no circumstances be permitted to work for private 
security firms. To facilitate such changes: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Police should be paid significantly higher salaries; 
 (b) The shift structure of police work should be reformed so that police cannot 
regularly work for large blocks of time and then receive multiple days off. 
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  Police accountability 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Systems for tracking the use of firearms should be established in all states, and where 
some procedures already exist, they must be improved, and the Government must ensure </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
 page 35 
 
</p>
<p><b>they are followed. The weapon and the quantity of ammunition provided to each policeman 
should be recorded, and every bullet should regularly be accounted for. Every instance in 
which a policeman fires his or her weapon should be investigated by internal affairs and 
recorded in a database. This database should be accessible by police Ombudsman Offices 
and used by police chiefs and commanders to identify police in need of closer supervision. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The current practice of classifying police killings as &#8220;acts of resistance&#8221; or &#8220;resistance 
followed by death&#8221; provides a <i>carte blanche</i> for police killing and must be abolished. 
Without prejudicing the outcome of criminal trials, such killings should be included in each 
state&#8217;s homicide statistics. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The federal Secretariat for Human Rights should keep a detailed database of human 
rights violations by police. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The integrity of work by the internal affairs services of the police should be ensured 
by: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Establishing a separate career path for those working in internal affairs; 
 (b) Establishing clear procedures and time limits for investigations; 
 (c) Making all information regarding investigations and recommended disciplinary 
sanctions freely accessible to Ombudsman Offices. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In cases involving police killings and other allegations of serious abuse, internal 
affairs services should publicly provide information on the status of individual cases, 
including the measures recommended to police chiefs and commanders. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Police under investigation for crimes constituting extrajudicial executions should be 
removed from active duty. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Offices of police Ombudsman, as they exist in most states, should be reformed so as to 
be better able to provide external oversight: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>They should report directly to the state governor rather than to the state 
secretary of public security; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) They should be provided with the resources and legal powers necessary to 
reduce dependence on information from the internal affairs services of the police forces; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) They should issue regular public reports providing accessible information on 
patterns of police abuse and on the effectiveness of disciplinary and criminal proceedings. 
This information should be compiled so as to enable meaningful comparisons across time 
and geographical areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) In order for them to provide more reliable information on the strengths and 
weaknesses of existing policing strategies in terms of both respecting and protecting rights, 
they should be provided resources to conduct or commission surveys on citizen experiences 
with crime and the police. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Forensic evidence 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The routine failure of police to preserve crime scenes must end; should problems 
persist, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office should use its authority to exercise external control 
of the police so as to ensure the integrity of its prosecutions. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Hospitals should be required to report to police precincts and police internal affairs 
all cases where the police bring a deceased criminal suspect to hospital.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>State Institutes of Forensic Medicine should be made fully independent from public 
security secretariats, and expert staff should receive employment guarantees that ensure 
the impartiality of their investigations. Additional resources and technical training should 
also be provided. 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  Witness protection 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>In many respects, the existing witness protection programs constitute a model, but 
reforms are also needed: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) State governments should provide adequate, timely, and reliable funding; 
 (b) State governments should ensure that police cooperate in escorting witnesses to 
court appearances in a safe and non-threatening manner; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The federal government should conduct a study on whether there are ways to 
protect witnesses who are unwilling to comply with the current programs&#8217; strict 
requirements, and on whether the use of NGOs as implementing partners should be phased 
out or restructured. 
</b></p>
<p><b>F.  Public prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The involvement of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in building criminal cases must be 
strengthened: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) State governments should ensure that Civil Police notify public prosecutors at 
the onset of their investigations so that prosecutors can provide timely guidance on what 
evidence must be gathered in order to obtain a conviction; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The legal authority of public prosecutors to independently gather evidence 
admissible in court should be unequivocally affirmed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Public prosecutors should routinely conduct their own investigations into the 
lawfulness of killings by the police. 
</b></p>
<p><b>G.  Judiciary and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The period of prescription (statutory period of limitation) for intentional crimes 
against life should be abolished. </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/11/2/Add.2 
 page 37 
 
</p>
<p>97. <b>Recognizing that permitting persons convicted of murder by a trial court to remain 
free while their appeal is ongoing facilitates the intimidation of witnesses and fosters a 
sense of impunity, judges should give careful consideration to alternative interpretations of 
the norm guaranteeing the &#8220;presumption of innocence&#8221; found in foreign and international 
jurisprudence. 
</b>98. <b>The National Council of Justice and other appropriate bodies should take measures 
to ensure that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) In making docket management decisions, judges do not put off dealing with 
cases involving killings by powerful actors, including the police, or prioritize civil above 
criminal cases; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Judges of penal execution conduct prison inspections pursuant to a written 
protocol which requires private interviews with prisoners randomly selected by the judge. 
</b></p>
<p><b>H.  Prisons 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>While avoiding steps that would further endanger inmates, the government should 
take steps to end gang-control of prisons, including: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) All practices that encourage or require new prison inmates to choose a gang 
affiliation should be discontinued. Inmates should be able to identify as &#8220;neutral&#8221; and be 
placed in truly neutral prisons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Mobile phones should be eliminated from prisons through the more rigorous 
use of metal detectors and through the installation of technology that blocks mobile phone 
signals; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Prison authorities should reassert day-to-day control of internal prison 
administration so that prison guards, not inmates, are responsible for internal discipline; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) All inmates&#8217; benefits and location in the prison system should be recorded 
electronically, and prisoners moved from one type of detention to another when they are so 
entitled. Inmates and judges of penal execution should be able to access the digital record 
of prisoner entitlements; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Overcrowding should be reduced through more use of alternative sentences, 
open prison regimes, and the construction of new prisons. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Government should ensure that this report is disseminated widely to officials at 
all levels. The federal Secretariat for Human Rights should take responsibility for 
monitoring the progress of the implementation of these recommendations. </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p> During my 4-14 November 2007 mission to Brazil, I traveled to S&#227;o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, 
Pernambuco and Brasilia. I visited a landless workers&#8217; settlement in Pernambuco, a prison in 
S&#227;o Paulo (Centro de Deten&#231;&#227;o Provis&#243;ria II de Pinheiros), a favela in Rio de Janeiro, and a 
Military Police battalion and Civil Police precinct in Rio de Janeiro. 
</p>
<p> At the federal government level, I met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Director 
of the Human Rights Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Special Secretary of the 
National Human Rights Secretariat and many staff from the Secretariat, the Commander of the 
For&#231;a Nacional de Seguran&#231;a (FNS), Federal Police, the Prosecutor-General of the Republic and 
federal public prosecutors, the Ministry of Justice, and the Commission of Human Rights and 
Minorities of the Federal House of Representatives. I also met with Judges from the Supremo 
Tribunal Federal and the Superior Tribunal de Justi&#231;a, representatives from the National Council 
of Justice, and I participated in a working meeting of the Council for the Defence of Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p> In each of the states, I met with the State Secretaries for Public Security, Prisons, and 
Justice, the heads of the Civil and Military Police and heads of specialist police departments, the 
head of the Technical-Scientific Police, the head of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the head 
of Police Internal Affairs, and the police and prisons Ombudsmen. I also met with state Appeal 
Court Judges, Penitentiary Councils, Judges of Penal Execution, Community Councils, Public 
Prosecutors, Public Defenders, and coordinators of the witness protection programs. In 
Pernambuco, I also met with the state Governor, and in Rio de Janeiro I met with the Human 
Rights Commission of the State Legislative Assembly. 
</p>
<p> I met with<b> </b>the UN county team, and representatives of<b> </b>29 civil society organizations. I 
received personal testimony from 46<b> </b>witnesses, including<b> </b>inmates, indigenous Brazilians, 
landless workers, victims of death threats and gang or police extortion or violence, and families 
of people killed during large-scale police operations, or by death squads, militias, police or 
gangs. These witnesses spoke with me about personal and traumatic incidents in their lives, 
sometimes at great risk to their own security, and to them I am deeply grateful.
