Devon Energy Announces Pricing of Maximum Tender Offers
OKLAHOMA CITY—(BUSINESS WIRE)—Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE: DVN) (the “Company” or “Devon
Energy”) today announced the consideration payable in connection with its previously announced tender offers (the
“Maximum Tender Offers”) to purchase for cash up to an aggregate principal amount of the debt securities listed in
the table below (collectively, the “Notes”) that would not result in the aggregate amount that all holders of the Notes
are entitled to receive, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, for their Notes that are validly tendered and accepted
for purchase in the Maximum Tender Offers, exceeding the Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount (as defined
below). In addition, the Company has amended the Maximum Tender Offers to increase the previously announced
Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount from approximately $535.4 million (which gives effect to the Company’s
purchase of certain of the 8.250% notes due 2018, issued by Devon OEI Operating, L.L.C., and the 6.300% notes
due 2019, issued by the Company, for total consideration of approximately $664.6 million in the Company’s
previously consummated tender offers (the “Any and All Offers”) for such notes) to such aggregate amount necessary
to pay the Total Consideration (as defined below) for all of the 2.250% notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Maximum Tender Offers as of the Early Tender Date (as defined below),
which Total Consideration is equal to approximately $652.1 million (as amended, the “Aggregate Maximum
Repurchase Amount”). All other terms of the Maximum Tender Offers, as previously announced, remain unchanged.
The Maximum Tender Offers were made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated
August 4, 2016, and the related letter of transmittal (the “Tender Offer Documents”).
The table below sets forth the Total Consideration for the 2018 Notes that will be accepted for purchase.

(a) Per $1,000 principal amount.
(b) The Total Consideration was calculated on the basis of pricing for the U.S. Treasury Reference Security as of
2:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 18, 2016, and is inclusive of the Early Tender Payment set forth in the
table above.
(c) Issuer: Devon Energy Corporation.
(d) Issuer: Devon OEI Operating, L.L.C.
(e) Issuer: Devon Financing Company, L.L.C.
(f) Notes from such series will not be accepted for purchase by the Company.
The “Total Consideration” listed in the table above for each $1,000 principal amount of the 2018 Notes was
determined at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 18, 2016. Only holders of the 2018 Notes who validly
tendered and did not validly withdraw such 2018 Notes at or prior to the previously announced early tender date and
time of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 17, 2016 (the “Early Tender Date”) are eligible to receive the Total
Consideration for such 2018 Notes accepted for purchase.
The Company will accept for purchase all of the 2018 Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn. Since the Total Consideration payable with respect to such 2018 Notes will equal the Aggregate
Maximum Repurchase Amount, none of the tendered Notes from any other series will be accepted for purchase
pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offers. Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on the 2018 Notes
validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the date the
Company makes payment for such 2018 Notes, which date is anticipated to be August 19, 2016.
The Maximum Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on August 31, 2016, unless extended or
earlier terminated. Because the Maximum Tender Offers have been fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date,
holders who tender Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any of their Notes accepted for purchase. Any
Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date, together with all Notes (other than the 2018 Notes) tendered at or prior
to the Early Tender Date, will be returned to the holders thereof as described in the Tender Offer Documents.
Devon Energy will fund the Maximum Tender Offers with the net proceeds from previously completed asset sales
and financing transactions. The Maximum Tender Offers are being made to reduce the Company’s outstanding debt,
including the debt of its subsidiaries. After giving effect to the purchase by the Company of the Notes validly
tendered and accepted for purchase in the Maximum Tender Offers, as well as the Company’s previously
consummated Any and All Offers, the Company estimates that its total cash interest expense will be reduced by
approximately $54 million on an annualized basis.
