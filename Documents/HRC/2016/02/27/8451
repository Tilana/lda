</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
</p>
<p>attainable standard of physical and mental health visited Guatemala from 12 to 18 May 
</p><p>2010. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with Government representatives, civil society 
organizations, health professionals and representatives of indigenous communities in 
Guatemala City, Malacantacito, Huehuetenango and Ixtahuac&#225;n. 
</p>
<p>During the mission, the Special Rapporteur noted that the health sector in 
Guatemala is severely under-resourced and concentrated in urban areas. Furthermore, 
substantial inequalities exist in the enjoyment of the right to health for indigenous 
communities and women, particularly in the areas of sexual and reproductive health. He 
also expressed concern over Government policies that restrict access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>The report has six sections. In section I, the Special Rapporteur introduces the 
report. In section II, the historical context of the long-standing inequalities and 
discrimination in Guatemalan society is summarized, and the international and national 
legal frameworks of the right to health are outlined. In section III, the Special Rapporteur 
explores issues surrounding indigenous health, including the historical circumstances that 
led to the challenges currently being faced by these communities. These challenges largely

</p>
<p>relate to deep-seated inequalities and discrimination, which have had detrimental effects on 
the underlying determinants of health as well as access to health care. The concentration of 
health services in urban areas, insufficient funding and substantial language barriers were 
noted as key barriers to indigenous peoples&#8217; access to health care, in addition to the lack of 
a comprehensive policy or national plan regarding the health care of indigenous peoples. In 
section IV, he discusses the right to health of women, particularly sexual and reproductive 
health. He notes that rural indigenous women remain a marginalized group and severe 
disparities exist in relation to contraceptive uptake and access to obstetric care. He also 
expresses concern over the status of abortion laws in Guatemala, and the resulting high rate 
of procurement of unsafe abortions, as well as the increasing prevalence of violence against 
women. 
</p>
<p>In section V, access to medicines is discussed, particularly Government policies 
concerning drug procurement and the intellectual property provisions of the Central 
American Free Trade Agreement, both of which curtail access to medicine. In section VI, 
the Special Rapporteur offers some recommendations pertaining to each of the areas 
considered throughout the mission.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone 
to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health visited 
Guatemala from 12 to 18 May 2010. The purpose of the mission was to understand, in a 
spirit of co-operation and dialogue, how Guatemala endeavours to implement the right to 
health, the measures taken for its successful realization and the obstacles encountered both 
at the national and international level. 
</p>
<p>2. The focus of the mission was on the right to health of indigenous peoples; the right 
to health of women, specifically considering sexual and reproductive health; and access to 
medicines. Additionally, the mission generally examined the impact of poverty, 
discrimination and inequalities on the enjoyment of the right to health. During the mission, 
the Special Rapporteur travelled to Guatemala City, Malacantacito, Huehuetenango and 
Ixtahuac&#225;n, and had the opportunity to visit indigenous communities and meet with their 
representatives. 
</p>
<p>3. Throughout the mission, all levels of Government and other relevant actors were 
open and constructive. The Special Rapporteur had the pleasure of meeting the Vice- 
President, Rafael Espada; the Minister of Finance, Juan Alberto Fuentes; the Minister of 
Health, Ludwig Ovalle; the First Vice-President of Congress, Gabriel Heredia; the 
President of the Health Commission, V&#237;ctor Manuel Guti&#233;rrez Longo; as well as a number 
of other senior Government officials. 
</p>
<p>4. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur also held meetings with the Human 
Rights Ombudsman (Procurador de los derechos humanos) and his staff; with magistrates 
of the Constitutional Court, including its President; and with members of the Congress, 
including its President. The Special Rapporteur also had exchanges with representatives of 
the Presidential Commission on Discrimination and Racism against Indigenous Peoples in 
Guatemala and the Office for the Defence of Indigenous Women. In addition, the Special 
Rapporteur met with members of the international community in Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to meet with representatives of civil 
society organizations and communities, academics and health professionals, and would like 
to thank all those who have given their time and extended co-operation to him.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. Guatemalan society is marked by long-standing inequalities and discrimination that 
can be traced back to the dispossession and social exclusion of its original inhabitants 
resulting from the Spanish conquest and colonization of Central America. The country 
recently experienced a brutal, 36-year-long civil war, which ended only 14 years ago. The 
1996 Peace Accord, along with the 1985 Constitution, set the groundwork for the 
contemporary Guatemalan State.  
</p>
<p>7. Today, Guatemala is classified as a middle-income country with a strong exports 
sector, particularly related to agriculture. This income level, however, has not adequately 
translated into equal, sustainable development; the country ranked 116 of 169 countries in 
the Human Development Index in 2010.1 The colonial impact continues to profoundly

<p>affect the majority indigenous peoples, the Maya, Xinca and Garifuna, of whom nearly 75 
per cent live in poverty.2 The most apparent manifestation of the colonial legacy in 
Guatemala is the extremely unequal distribution of both land and wealth between persons 
of European ancestry (criollos) and the indigenous peoples. Fifty-four per cent of all farms 
occupy only four per cent of the total area of agricultural land, while 2.6 per cent of larger 
farms account for nearly two thirds of total arable land.3 The wealthiest 20 per cent of the 
population consumes 57.8 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).4 
</p>
<p>8. The 2010 per capita gross national income converted into purchasing power parity is 
$4,694, and yet approximately 51 per cent of the population live below the national poverty 
line.5 By an internationally accepted measure of inequality (the Gini coefficient) Guatemala 
ranks as one of the most internally unequal countries in Central America and, indeed, the 
world.6  Although this situation resulted from particular historic events and policies, the 
inability of the State to generate revenue is now primarily a result of its inability to levy 
sufficient taxes.  The tax rate, at 11.3 per cent of GDP in 2008, is one of the lowest in the 
world.7 This has limited State resources, and allowed capital to remain largely in the hands 
of a few, generally landed, criollos.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The right to health in Guatemala: an overview 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (Ministerio de Salud P&#250;blica y 
Asistencia Social de Guatemala, or MSPAS) is the primary health-care services and goods 
provider in Guatemala, constituting around 70 per cent of all health-care provision. This, 
however, does not mean that all receive the same kind or level of services; the majority of 
this percentage only receive a basic package of services through subcontracted non-
governmental organizations that visit communities once a month. Permanent services are 
absent in most rural areas.   
</p>
<p>10. It is complemented by the social security system (Instituto Guatemalteco de 
Seguridad Social or IGSS), which covers approximately 10 per cent of the population 
through work-based health-care insurance. Finally, the Ministry of Defence provides 
health-care services to the armed forces.  These three institutions comprise the bulk of the 
public health system.  
</p>
<p>11. Public, private and social security expenditures on health comprise approximately 
7.3 per cent of GDP, on a par with other parts of Latin America.8  Yet, in comparison, 
health indicators in Guatemala are amongst the lowest in the region. Total health 
expenditure is the primary difference between Guatemala and other countries in the region; 
public expenditure comprises a much smaller proportion of the aggregate percentage in

<p>Guatemala.9 The experience of other similarly situated countries suggests that even the 
limited resources available for health in Guatemala can be allocated more efficiently to 
improve the overall health outcomes of its citizens. 
</p>
<p>12. Unfortunately, the recent trend in Guatemala has not been to increase investment in 
health or promote more efficient allocation of resources. Public investment in health has 
declined over the last two decades, and the little investment made is largely at the tertiary 
level. For the most vulnerable communities &#8211; rural indigenous peoples and women &#8211; the 
greatest area of need is in primary care, as will be discussed. Various attempts to address 
this deficiency are being made, but much more will need to be done.  
</p>
<p>13. The health sector is severely under-resourced and concentrated in urban areas, 
despite a reported increase in budget allocation to the Ministry of Health for the period 
2007-2010. For the first time in nearly 20 years, health-care spending significantly 
decreased in absolute terms in the 2010 budget; previously, there were at least nominal 
increases intended to cover for the cost of inflation. Policies promoting increased 
privatization of health services, along with a lack of public expenditure, have resulted in a 
fragmented health-care system in which private primary and secondary level care is 
frequently unavailable in rural areas, and the public system is unable to fill the gap. These 
rural communities require access to comprehensive primary health services, goods and 
facilities but often cannot afford to pay the high prices of private health care. Private 
expenditure on health is estimated to total 72 per cent of the total health expenditure.10 
</p>
<p>14. Moreover, the trauma of the civil war has added to the burden of mental illness and 
disability in the population, particularly in rural indigenous communities that were 
disproportionately affected by violence during the war. This issue is not being adequately 
addressed by the Government; only one per cent of the current health budget is allocated to 
mental health care, and community mental health services do not exist. The only mental 
health institution in Guatemala is overcrowded and under-resourced. Much of its resources 
are utilized to detain unsentenced prisoners and persons with mental disabilities &#8211; groups 
that should be housed separately. Although the scope of the problem was not further 
assessed throughout the mission, the Special Rapporteur believes this to be a critical area 
requiring significant improvements. 
</p>
<p>15. In addition to increased resource allocation to rural health-care services, concerted 
efforts are needed to comprehensively incorporate rural health training into the curricula of 
medical professionals. Many doctors and other health workers are not trained to address the 
particular problems faced in rural communities, one reason among several for their 
reluctance to work in remote areas. Moreover, those that receive rural health training must 
be supported adequately in meeting the challenges of serving such communities. 
</p>
<p>16. Like many other countries in Latin America, Guatemala has initiated a conditional 
cash transfer programme. The Mi Familia Progresa programme was started by the 
Government of Alvaro Colom and operates under the umbrella of the Consejo de Cohesi&#243;n 
Social, a set of social welfare programmes. The programme services over 30 municipalities, 
and links cash transfers to educational and health/nutritional requirements. The programme, 
however, must be re-evaluated to ensure implementation within a right to health perspective 
and in a non-discriminatory manner, as will be discussed further.  </p>
<p>17. To their credit, some senior Government leaders attach priority to human rights, 
including the right to health, and recognize the issues faced by the country. There is a

</b></p>
<p>constitutional right to health guaranteed to the citizens of Guatemala, but it is not being 
realized. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International, regional and national legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>18. Guatemala has ratified numerous international treaties that explicitly provide for the 
right to health: the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and its 
Optional Protocol (signed, but not yet ratified); the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families; and  
Convention No. 169 of the International Labour Organization. 
</p>
<p>19. In Guatemala international treaties take immediate domestic effect upon ratification. 
Moreover, the Guatemalan Constitution gives pre-eminence to human rights treaties ratified 
by the Government over juridical order and domestic law.11 Consequently, all international 
treaties that include the right to health &#8211; or any other human rights norm &#8211; take priority 
status in Guatemala over domestic law.  
</p>
<p>20. Guatemala has affirmed the right of indigenous peoples to access all social and 
health services without discrimination through the endorsement of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Having the third largest indigenous 
population in Latin America,12 Guatemala is committed to improving the economic and 
social conditions of indigenous peoples, including the rights to education, work, housing 
and health. 
</p>
<p>21. Guatemala also has regional human rights obligations that include the right to health. 
As a member of the Organization of American States, Guatemala is a party to the American 
Convention on Human Rights, which calls for the progressive realization of all rights 
implicit in the economic, social, educational, scientific and cultural standards set forth in 
the Charter of the Organization. Furthermore, it has ratified and acceded to the Additional 
Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights on economic, social and cultural 
rights, known as the Protocol of San Salvador, in which the right to health is set out in 
article 10.   
</p>
<p>22. The Guatemalan Constitution explicitly recognizes the right to health in articles 93 
to 96 in a section that establishes various economic, social and cultural rights. Moreover, as 
stated earlier, priority is given to international human rights instruments over domestic law 
through article 46 of the Constitution.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The right to health framework 
</b></p>
<p>23. The analysis in this report is grounded in article 12 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which recognizes &#8220;the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.&#8221; This implies 
ensuring that health facilities, goods and services are available, accessible and acceptable to 
everyone and are of good quality.

</p>
<p>24. Availability requires a functioning public health system and health-care facilities, 
goods and service in sufficient quantity within a State. Accessibility has four overlapping 
dimensions: (a) non-discrimination, requiring that health facilities, goods and services be 
accessible to all, especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, 
in law and in fact, without discrimination on any prohibited grounds; (b) physical 
accessibility, requiring that health facilities, goods and services are within safe physical 
reach for all sections of the population, including women, children, indigenous peoples, 
older persons or persons with disabilities; (c) economic accessibility, requiring that health 
facilities, goods and services are affordable for all; and (d) information accessibility, which 
includes the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas concerning health 
issues. Acceptability requires that health facilities, goods and services are medically and 
culturally acceptable. Finally, as well as being culturally acceptable, health facilities, goods 
and services must also be scientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality. 
</p>
<p>25. The right to health is an inclusive right, extending not only to timely and appropriate 
health care but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and 
potable water and adequate sanitation, safe food and adequate nutrition, adequate housing, 
and healthy occupational and environmental conditions, inter alia. The underlying 
determinants of health extend beyond just material rights, and include social determinants 
such as inequality. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The right to health and its underlying determinants 
</b></p>
<p>26. Access to basic health facilities, goods and services is highly inequitable for the 
most vulnerable and marginalized, and this has consequences for an individual&#8217;s health, 
often placing a tremendous burden on the health-care system. The combination of limited 
primary care facilities, difficulties in physical accessibility to health care for rural 
populations, and diminished access to underlying determinants of health, including food, 
water and sanitation, has created an environment in which people are at increased risk of 
morbidity and mortality resulting from readily preventable or treatable illnesses.   
</p>
<p>27. Some of the most acute deprivations concern access to an adequate supply of 
nutritious food, and general food insecurity. The prevalence of chronic malnutrition in 
Guatemala places it fourth in the world, and first in Latin America, at 43.4 per cent.13 
Disaggregated data reveals the severity of the situation, especially concerning indigenous 
peoples and children. Some estimates indicate that 58.6 per cent of indigenous children 
under five are malnourished.14 Even though indigenous peoples comprise the majority of 
the population, most policy decisions are taken without any input from the indigenous 
community, especially when many of these relate to land development.15 
</p>
<p>28. Deficiencies with respect to access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation 
also demonstrate profound geographic and ethnic disparities. In 2006, although 78.6 per 
cent of all households had access to a water supply, 91.2 per cent of urban households 
compared to 64.2 per cent of rural households had access.16 Similar disparities exist with 
respect to sanitation: only 17 per cent of rural households have access to adequate 
sanitation facilities. The Special Rapporteur, however, notes with commendation that a

<p>2009 World Bank report shows a significant improvement in access to sanitation for the 
period 2000-2006, one of the greatest in the last 25 years.17 
</p>
<p>29. Lack of access to both health care and other basic services in these areas reveals the 
disparities in treatment between the urban/rural and criollo/indigenous communities, of 
which the latter two are often unable to access the most basic material necessities of life. It 
should be noted that &#8220;rural&#8221; is often a proxy descriptor for indigenous communities, as the 
rural population is about three-quarters indigenous. On a deeper level, it is an expression of 
discriminatory practices, and an affront to the dignity of the rural and indigenous 
populations. Such practices have manifested in otherwise preventable health conditions, 
and this disease burden will persist in the coming years should the Government not take 
adequate steps to address deficiencies in access to basic services.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Right to health of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>30. Due to a confluence of factors, including historical repression and prejudice, and the 
civil war, indigenous peoples have faced significant barriers in realizing the right to health. 
Indigenous peoples have the right to specific measures to improve their access to health-
care facilities, goods and services that are culturally appropriate. The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted that States should provide resources for 
indigenous peoples to design, deliver and control such services.18 Unfortunately, the 
indigenous peoples in Guatemala have been systematically excluded from health-related 
decision-making, which has contributed to major gaps between indigenous and non-
indigenous health outcomes.  
</p>
<p>31. The Committee also notes that, in indigenous communities, individual health is 
often linked to the health of the society as a whole, and has a collective or community 
dimension.19 As mentioned previously, a number of underlying determinants of health 
directly contribute to whether a community progressively realizes the right to health (see 
para. 25). In many communities basic services are absent, resulting in widespread 
deprivation and poor health. The basic needs, including the provision of health-care 
services, of indigenous peoples must be met to effectively realize the right to health of this 
group. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Historical background 
</b></p>
<p>32. The indigenous peoples of Guatemala include the Maya, Xinca and Garifuna; in 
total, there are 25 socio-linguistic groups, 23 of which are of Mayan descent.20 Guatemala is 
the only republic in Central America in which indigenous people comprise a majority; 
currently, 51 per cent of the population is estimated to be Mayan.21 Although outside the 
scope of this report, the historical circumstances leading to the persistent repression of 
indigenous peoples elucidate the disadvantage and health-related barriers experienced by 
these people today.

<p>33. Events from the Spanish Invasion in 1524, to the division of the population into 
indigenous and criollo groups in 1880, to subsequent forcible acquisition of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; lands by the elite,22 all contributed to the social and economic dispossession 
experienced by the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. Although this eased during the 
Government reforms of 1944-1954, the 1954 coup and subsequent internal conflict had a 
devastating effect on the indigenous population.23 The Truth Commission of Guatemala 
determined that significant political mobilization occurred among indigenous people during 
the civil war, particularly in the early 1980s, but it was widely suppressed by the State to 
maintain social control. 
</p>
<p>34. Despite the continuation of the armed conflict until 1996, indigenous identity 
became increasingly acknowledged by law during this time. Article 66 of the Constitution 
provides for protection of indigenous communities, acknowledging that Guatemala is made 
up of diverse ethnic groups &#8211; including indigenous groups of Mayan descent &#8211; and that the 
State recognizes, respects and promotes their ways of life, customs, traditions, forms of 
social organization, and use of traditional dress, languages and dialects. Articles 67 to 69 
outline specific areas in which protection is required: protection of land and indigenous 
agricultural cooperatives, and of the health and safety of migrant workers within the State. 
</p>
<p>35. Since 1982 Guatemala has ratified several international declarations and treaties 
concerning the rights of indigenous peoples. For instance, in 1996 Guatemala ratified the 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention of the International Labour Organization (ILO), 
which was subsequently deemed compatible with domestic law by the Constitutional 
Court.24 The provisions of ILO Convention 169, along with various constitutional 
provisions, have since been applied in various cases. These include, inter alia, petitions 
allowing indigenous prison inmates to wear traditional dress,25 and the application of 
customary Mayan law to movement of protected objects for use in Mayan rituals.26 
Guatemala has also ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>36. Despite this recent progress and the constitutional protection of indigenous groups, 
there has been a clear and consistent failure to adequately address the situation of 
indigenous peoples within Guatemala. In the March 1995 Agreement on the identity and 
rights of indigenous peoples, concluded as part of the Peace Accords, it was acknowledged 
that the indigenous peoples had been subject to discrimination, exploitation and injustice, 
and had endured unequal and unjust treatment and conditions on account of their economic 
and social status. It further acknowledged that this &#8220;historical reality&#8221; continues to affect 
these peoples profoundly, denying them the full exercise of their rights and political 
participation. It is encouraging to see that some steps have been taken to enshrine and 
protect the rights of the indigenous peoples of Guatemala, but more practical steps must be 
taken to secure equality in respect of health outcomes.

<p><b> B. Health status of indigenous populations 
</b></p>
<p>37. The continuing reverberations of the civil war, together with marked structural and 
de facto discrimination and inequality have led to a stark contrast in health outcomes 
between the indigenous and criollo communities. Where disaggregated data is available, 
clear gaps between these communities are seen. For instance, 68 per cent of indigenous 
children under the age of five suffer from chronic malnutrition, compared to 49 per cent of 
children in the general population.27 Between 1987 and 2002 negligible gains were made in 
redressing malnutrition in the indigenous population generally: it was reduced from 71.7 
per cent to 69.5 per cent, in comparison with an 8 per cent reduction in the general 
population.28 Similar figures are seen when indicators of the underlying determinants of 
health are examined. For instance, approximately 29 per cent of the indigenous people live 
in extreme poverty, in contrast to 15 per cent of non-indigenous people.29,30 
</p>
<p>38. Although there have been encouraging increases in reproductive health-related 
indicators at the national level &#8211; 41 per cent of births are attended by skilled health 
personnel and contraceptive prevalence is recorded at 43.3 per cent31 &#8211; these changes do not 
appear to have a substantial effect within indigenous communities. Of the births attended 
by skilled personnel, 70 per cent of those were deliveries of non-indigenous pregnant 
women, whilst only 30 per cent were of indigenous women. Similarly, only 40 per cent of 
those who utilized contraceptives were of indigenous descent.32 
</p>
<p>39. Development-related activities that displace indigenous peoples from their 
traditional lands have been noted to negatively affect health outcomes.33 The consequences 
from this cultural disconnection notwithstanding, removing indigenous peoples from their 
land also contributes to poverty and food insecurity and alienation from mainstream 
society. Land ownership remains highly inequitable in Guatemala. The holdings of the 
largely indigenous poor are noted to be small, untitled, isolated and of poor quality; indeed, 
the main reason identified for welfare disparity between indigenous and non-indigenous 
households is low asset holdings.34 
</p>
<p>40. Educational attainment is also significantly lower among indigenous peoples due to 
the many barriers indigenous children face in entering and completing schooling. Although 
educational coverage has increased significantly, with net primary school enrolment rates 
rising from around 50 per cent in the 1970s to approximately 80 per cent by 2000, 
approximately one-third of indigenous girls are not enrolled.35 Illiteracy poses a major 
problem throughout Guatemala, and is most marked among indigenous peoples: 38 per cent 
of indigenous women are illiterate.36 This directly affects health outcomes, as use of 
planned methods of contraception is significantly lower in illiterate populations.

<p>41. The above factors combined paint a bleak picture of indigenous living standards. 
There are difficult, systemic challenges for the Government, but this does not excuse it 
from taking steps that could immediately improve health outcomes and equality. Prompt 
implementation and enforcement of policies prohibiting discrimination &#8211; a core component 
of the right to health &#8211; is readily achievable, and adoption of this approach would do a great 
deal to address the plight of indigenous peoples immediately. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Barriers to improving indigenous health outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>42. A major omission identified by the Special Rapporteur during the mission was the 
lack of a comprehensive policy or plan as related to the health care of indigenous peoples, 
particularly in rural and remote areas. A core obligation of the right to health is the adoption 
and implementation of a national public health strategy and plan of action that &#8220;shall give 
particular attention to all vulnerable or marginalized groups&#8221;.37  There has also been little or 
no attempt to recognize and protect traditional medicine within indigenous communities &#8211; 
for instance, Guatemala has no specific legislation to protect or recognize indigenous 
medicines.38 
</p>
<p>43. It is promising that an Indigenous Peoples Unit in the Ministry of Health (Unidad de 
Atenci&#243;n de la Salud de los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas e Interculturalidad) has recently been 
established in an attempt to redress the inequality inherent in the health system vis-&#224;-vis 
indigenous peoples. Discrimination against persons of indigenous origin is a nationwide, 
multifaceted problem that clearly extends to the health system. The formulation of this Unit 
is a welcome initiative but, irrespective of this, until Government health programmes are 
completely restructured with cultural diversity at the forefront, there is unlikely to be a 
significant change in the health status of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>44. There is a clear need to actively recruit persons of indigenous descent into national 
medical training courses, to redress the cultural imbalance in staffing of health centres in 
Guatemala. Targeted training of indigenous doctors and nurses would improve quality and 
acceptability of care for indigenous patients, and potentially redress staffing shortages in 
rural and remote areas throughout the country. There is also a major paucity in respect of 
cultural training for medical professionals, as health-care workers are not required to 
undergo any formal cultural training component as part of their tertiary education.  
</p>
<p>45. Mainstream doctors also do not speak the local native languages. At the health-care 
centres visited on the mission no interpretation service was available. Instead, patients 
relied on ad hoc and informal interpretation performed by bilingual nursing staff. This 
situation is clearly unacceptable in light of the proportion of the population who do not 
speak Spanish. In consultations with indigenous community members, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed of instances where people were turned away from medical 
facilities because they could not adequately explain their symptoms to the Spanish-speaking 
medical professional. One indigenous family was denied access to treatment for their child, 
who later died en route to the nearest public hospital; the family could not convey the 
length or severity of the child&#8217;s febrile illness to the doctor in question, and no translator 
was available. 
</p>
<p>46. A stronger impetus is needed for medical professionals to become familiar with the 
dominant indigenous dialect in their operational catchment. Emphasis on language skills in

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>recruitment of medical professionals may promote cultural change in the profession, 
whereby it is no longer acceptable to work within a community without having the ability 
to communicate with its indigenous members. In the interim period, this gap could be 
cheaply and quickly redressed through implementation of a central telephone interpreter 
service.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Health-care services delivery to indigenous communities 
</b></p>
<p>47. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur observed significant disparities between 
urban and rural health-care service delivery, which disproportionately affects indigenous 
people. Currently, 53 per cent of the workforce of the Ministry of Health is based in the 
department of Guatemala, and 80 per cent of the staff of the Instituto Guatemalteco de 
Seguridad Social is based in the metropolitan region,39 which indicates how centralized 
health-care service delivery is in Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>48. There are significant barriers to overcome in improving access to quality health-care 
services for indigenous people, in addition to the discrimination and language barriers 
addressed previously. Part of the difficulty encountered is the topography of Guatemala, 
and the remote location of certain communities. Over 70 per cent of households in the 
lowest two quintiles of the <i>Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida, </i>the national survey 
of living conditions, lacked access to a surfaced road, and 13 per cent of households could 
not access any motorable road at all.40 This directly affects health-care service delivery: 
lack of paved roads puts health-care services out of reach according to the WHO definition 
of access, which is less than 60 minutes.  
</p>
<p>49. Such obstacles, however, are not insurmountable, and it has largely been a result of a 
lack of political will and insufficient funding which has resulted in substandard delivery of 
health-care services in these locations. For instance, the Special Rapporteur visited 
Ixtahuacan, and was informed that a health centre in the locality had not been functioning 
for months. In many remote areas, non-government organizations have largely assumed 
control over health-care service provision. Although such efforts are admirable, this is not a 
sustainable substitute for State action. 
</p>
<p>50. The Mi Familia Progresa programme has had an observable impact, delivering funds 
to some of the most impoverished indigenous communities. This is commendable, but this 
conditional cash transfer programme simply cannot address fundamental issues concerning 
equitable access to health care. An indigenous woman noted that the 300 Quetzales 
(approximately $37) required to purchase medication for her child consumed almost the 
entire cash grant she received under the scheme. Routine use of these funds for various out-
of-pocket expenditures further demonstrates the urgent need for the development of health 
infrastructure that ensures universal access to basic services. Moreover, the proportion of 
the grants being spent on health-related items is uncertain, and further monitoring and 
evaluation is necessary.  
</p>
<p>51. The development and implementation of a comprehensive national policy and plan 
addressing the health status of all Guatemalans, including indigenous people, in a 
participatory, transparent and inclusive process, will not only satisfy a core obligation of the 
right to health, but is also the first step to redress the long-standing inequalities. This, along 
with targeted assistance programmes and capacity building in the most disadvantaged areas

<p>of the nation, preferably driven by the Indigenous Peoples Unit within the Ministry of 
Health, will hopefully affect the changes necessary to achieve this goal.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Right to health of women: right to sexual and reproductive 
health 
</b></p>
<p>52. As previously mentioned, accessibility is a core component of the right to health. 
General comment No. 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights notes 
that, in order to eliminate discrimination against women, a comprehensive national strategy 
for promoting women&#8217;s right to health throughout their lives is necessary. Major goals 
associated with such a plan should include strategies to reduce maternal mortality and 
protect women from domestic violence.41 States are also obliged to refrain from imposing 
discriminatory practices relating to women&#8217;s health status and needs, and to take measures 
to protect all vulnerable or marginalized groups &#8211; in particular women.42 As such, it is clear 
that the Government is under an immediate obligation to address these issues more fully. 
</p>
<p>53. The status of women&#8217;s health in Guatemala has lagged behind other countries in the 
region &#8211; and worldwide &#8211; for many decades. The prevalence of contraceptive use remains 
at 43 per cent, with an adolescent fertility rate of 92 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19.43 Some 
progress has been achieved, albeit slowly; only 41 per cent of births are attended by skilled 
health personnel, but around 84 per cent of women now receive at least one antenatal 
episode of care, although this remains below the regional average.44 
</p>
<p>54. Insufficient family planning services accessible to all poses a significant challenge. 
Currently, 27.6 per cent of fertile, sexually active women are not using any form of 
contraception, despite expressing a desire to delay or prevent subsequent births. 
Furthermore, certain health conditions are increasingly and disproportionately affecting 
women. The cases of HIV/AIDS in the 15-24 age group were approximately equal for men 
and women in 2002 (at approximately 8 cases per 100,000 people), yet by 2008 around 
19.5 per 100,000 females were infected compared to 14.9 per 100,000 men.45 There is also 
a significant problem concerning violence against women, which remains to be adequately 
addressed by the Government.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The right to sexual and reproductive health for women 
</b></p>
<p>55. Maternal mortality rates dropped to 136 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2010, from 
a previous rate of 153 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000. Nevertheless, the rate is not 
decreasing quickly enough to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of 55 deaths per 
100,000 births set for 2015.46 Moreover, these gains disguise the failure to make progress in 
certain populations. In 2006, eight departments in Guatemala had rates higher than the 
national average; in each of these departments, the majority of the population was of 
indigenous descent and recorded low levels of educational attainment. Indeed, maternal

<p>mortality has been recorded as up to three times higher amongst indigenous than amongst 
non-indigenous women.47 The Government informed the Special Rapporteur of its efforts to 
strengthen local service networks in order to reduce maternal mortality in heavily affected 
areas. In that context, the Multisectoral Committee for Safe Motherhood (Comisi&#243;n 
Multisectorial para la Maternidad Saludable) was created on 7 December with a view to 
monitoring and evaluating a strategy to reduce maternal mortality. 
</p>
<p>56. Rural, indigenous women are among the most marginalized members of Guatemalan 
society. This is reflected in many indicators relating to reproductive health, such as 
contraceptive uptake and access to skilled birth attendants, as previously discussed. 
Throughout the mission, indigenous women informed the Special Rapporteur that they 
perceived judgment from non-indigenous medical professionals for having too many 
children, or for their preference for &#8220;natural&#8221; birth control methods or &#8220;vertical&#8221; delivery of 
children. There is also a clear tension between modern medical treatment and traditional 
healing methods, including utilization of traditional midwives, whose role is highly valued 
by many indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur was informed that previous attempts to integrate traditional 
midwives into a Western-style medical structure had largely failed, and that midwives had, 
on occasion, been made to undertake menial tasks when working in hospitals or health-care 
centres. Simply attempting to employ traditional midwives is not acceptable to either 
midwives or indigenous women, and alternative steps can be taken to address this.48 
Education of medical professionals regarding service delivery which is acceptable to 
indigenous women is essential, particularly vis-&#224;-vis obstetric care.  
</p>
<p><b>  Obstetric care 
</b></p>
<p>58. Ethnicity is a strong predictor of use of medical care during pregnancy. It has been 
suggested that lower rates of uptake of medical care result from traditional cultural beliefs, 
alongside past negative experiences within the health-care system in Guatemala.49 It has 
also been demonstrated that men in Guatemala are more likely to be considered primary 
decision-makers in emergency situations relating to pregnancy and birth, often because of 
higher economic costs.50 
</p>
<p>59. The difficulties associated with delivering services that are culturally acceptable, 
particularly in remote locations, to expectant indigenous women should not be dismissed as 
insurmountable. In rural Nepal, for instance, interventions from women&#8217;s groups addressing 
perinatal problems with local facilitators within villages was shown to reduce neonatal 
mortality by 30 per cent.51 As such, outcomes can be improved in remote areas even 
without skilled birth attendants, and participation is powerful in resolving seemingly 
intractable problems. Similar interventions could readily be adapted to the most remote 
villages in Guatemala, and utilize traditional midwives in their implementation.  
</p>
<p>60. The role of traditional midwives in modern Guatemalan society has become 
uncertain. There appears to have been, at best, a lack of understanding of the importance of

</p>
<p>their role in certain communities, and, at worst, a lack of respect and rejection of their 
practices altogether by mainstream health-care providers. Legitimate concerns, however, 
were also expressed regarding the inconsistency in skills and training between traditional 
midwives. 
</p>
<p>61. Traditional midwives could be more appropriately utilized to facilitate interaction 
between indigenous communities and Government health services. This does not 
necessarily have to occur through integration into existing hospitals; rather capacity-
building should be undertaken with these professionals, and formal opportunities for 
information exchange between midwives and other health professionals be facilitated by the 
Government. A model that only involves provision of information to midwives, and not 
vice-versa, is not appropriate: cooperation and respect must be fostered, rather than simply 
attempting to train traditional midwives in Western methods of health-care delivery. 
</p>
<p>62. As accommodation around hospitals is often prohibitively expensive for families, 
women often delay attending facilities until they are actually in labour, which creates 
enormous health risks for both mother and child. As such, the Special Rapporteur was 
pleased to see the introduction of facilities such as Casa Materna in Huehuetanango, created 
to provide accommodation for residents of remote areas prior to delivery of their children. 
Establishment of facilities such as these in every department would be a welcome 
development. It is, however, very important that such facilities take care to respect 
indigenous traditions and to consult with indigenous people in this regard. Additionally, 
many women interviewed on the mission noted that they simply could not afford to attend 
centralized health-care services, even if they considered them culturally acceptable.  
</p>
<p><b>  Family planning 
</b></p>
<p>63. The fertility rate remains high in Guatemala &#8211; 3.6 children per woman &#8211; and 
represents an independent risk factor for women&#8217;s health.52 The low rate of contraceptive 
uptake, particularly amongst indigenous women, is an important determinant of the fertility 
rate and, in turn, increases risk of maternal and infant mortality. The Special Rapporteur 
was pleased to note the passage of the Universal and Equitable Access to Family Planning 
Services Law, and the Government&#8217;s efforts to provide for free universal family planning 
services through other agencies.  
</p>
<p>64. Historically, it has been noted that it is difficult to implement a &#8220;Western&#8221; model of 
birth control in rural Guatemala, as such a model ignores beliefs of indigenous Mayans; 
namely, preference for a larger family size and childbirth being a God-given attribute, as 
well as suspicion of Western contraceptive methods.53 More culturally acceptable options 
for these communities include promotion of birth spacing, and postpartum abstinence. 
&#8220;Responsible parenthood&#8221; could also form a key aspect of education programmes: having 
fewer children in order to provide better for them.   
</p>
<p>65. It is clear that contraceptive use in Guatemala correlates with socio-economic status 
and ethnicity, but socio-economic status does not appear to serve as the barrier to 
contraceptive use among criollo women that it does for indigenous women.54 Low socio-
economic status, however, has proved a less definitive predictor of contraceptive use over 
time: this suggests that an ideational shift in indigenous communities may be occurring.55

<p>Contraceptive use and intent has increased for indigenous women despite no corresponding 
increase in adoption of Spanish, which suggests that economic and educational changes &#8211; 
rather than language &#8211; are responsible for any ideational change.56 
</p>
<p>66. Ethnicity, however, remains a strong predictor of low contraceptive use and intent, 
and as such programmes which specifically target indigenous women and families are 
necessary in any global family planning strategy for the country, they must include 
culturally appropriate birth control options alongside more novel methods. In any event, 
any initiative that promotes family planning in indigenous communities must necessarily 
utilize community and religious leaders to ensure adequate engagement of communities. 
The Special Rapporteur also recommends the increasing inclusion of men in family 
planning decisions, although care must be taken to ensure that gender equality and 
empowerment of women is at the forefront of any initiative.  
</p>
<p><b>  Access to abortion 
</b></p>
<p>67. The illegality of abortion in Guatemala, except in very limited medical 
circumstances, raises concerns. Currently, abortion is only permitted in cases where the life 
of a pregnant woman is endangered,57 known as &#8220;therapeutic abortion&#8221;. Abortion remains 
illegal even in instances of rape or sexual violence, unless it is considered medically 
necessary. Additionally, there are no guidelines concerning the interpretation of the penal 
code provisions that permit therapeutic abortion. As such, inconsistent interpretations by 
different institutions create uncertainty for a woman who seeks an abortion, as the outcome 
is entirely dependent on the discretion of those from whom treatment is sought.   
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the high rate of unsafe abortions 
throughout the country, generally resulting from these restrictive laws. Although the data in 
this area is lacking, unsafe abortions have been cited as a critical factor in maternal 
morbidity and mortality, and represent an area of significant and disproportionate health 
expenditure. On average, it is estimated that one woman is hospitalized for every three who 
obtain induced abortions,58 and abortion is variously cited as the third or fourth most 
important cause of maternal deaths.59 
</p>
<p>69. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes that the Programme of Action of the 
International Conference on Population and Development urges Governments and relevant 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to strengthen their commitment to

health concern and to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded and improved 
family-planning services. The Programme of Action also specifies that reproductive health 
care in the context of primary health care should, inter alia, include: family planning 
counselling, information, education, communication and services; abortion as specified in 
the Programme of Action, including prevention of abortion and the management of the 
consequences of abortion; and information, education and counselling, as appropriate, on 
human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Referral for family 
planning services and further diagnosis and treatment for complications of pregnancy, 
delivery and abortion, infertility, inter alia, should always be available, as required. In 
circumstances where abortion is not against the law, such abortion should be safe. In all

<p>cases, women should have access to quality services for the management of complications 
arising from abortion. Post-abortion counselling, education and family planning services 
should be offered promptly, which will also help to avoid repeat abortions. In light of the 
Programme of Action, the Beijing +5 Outcome Document encourages States to consider 
reviewing laws containing punitive measures against women who have undergone illegal 
abortions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur was alarmed to discover the extremely high incidence of 
femicide and violence against women throughout Guatemala. This problem appears 
endemic, and difficult to combat in a society where violence seems to be accepted as a 
norm. From 2001-2009, 4,602 violent deaths were recorded, and it has been estimated that, 
throughout Guatemala, 45 per cent of women have been victims of some type of violence.60 
</p>
<p>71. In her 2005 visit to Guatemala, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women 
concluded that violence against women would only be eradicated by acting on fundamental 
issues including ending impunity, systematically eradicating extreme inequality, and 
engaging in &#8220;serious reform&#8221; to rebuild the State.61 Unfortunately, insufficient progress has 
been made in the interim period, and no noticeable decrease in violence against women has 
resulted. 
</p>
<p>72. Some steps, however, have been taken to combat this problem. In 2000, the 
Coordinadora Nacional para la Prevenci&#243;n de la Violencia Intrafamiliar y contra las 
Mujeres (CONAPREVI) was established to prevent, punish and eradicate violence against 
women. Its mandate is based on the Inter-American &#8220;Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;&#8221;, and 
article 17 of the Act against Femicide and other Forms of Violence against Women. There 
is also a National Plan for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence against 
Women (PLANOVI) 2004-2014, which clearly indicates that the Guatemalan Government 
has recognized that these issues need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  
</p>
<p>73. These initiatives, however, have not resulted in a reversal of femicide rates. On 17 
September 2010, the head of the office of the Human Rights Ombudsman announced that a 
formal case would be brought against the Government of Guatemala at the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights for lack of attention to femicides,62 noting that femicide has 
increased 79 per cent in the last six years.63 When the Special Rapporteur visited San Juan 
de Dios Hospital, he was informed that a clinic had been established by M&#233;decins Sans 
Fronti&#232;res in 2007 to treat victims of sexual violence. This is a welcome development, and 
one which is clearly necessary in light of the high prevalence of such incidents, but more 
training for medical professionals is clearly required in this area.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Access to medicines 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Government has made numerous efforts to ensure a continuous and adequate 
supply of affordable medicines to its people through its national procurement procedure and

<p>the provision of medications at Government hospitals. These efforts are admirable. 
Nevertheless, two major Government policies, drug procurement and the intellectual 
property provisions of the Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade 
Agreement, have had the effect of severely curtailing access to medicines. 
</p>
<p>75. The Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance of Guatemala is responsible for 
the provision of medicines and other health services to the population. Due to budget 
constraints, however, the Ministry often does not have adequate resources to meet its 
mandate and guarantee access. Consequently, families often contribute out of pocket for 
goods and services. Furthermore, poor procurement policies and price-inflating intellectual 
property protections unnecessarily drain an already limited health budget for the 
Government, families and individuals.  
</p>
<p>76. Access to essential medicines is a core obligation of the right to health.64 States 
parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have an 
obligation to provide safe, efficacious and affordable medicines and, in particular, to ensure 
access for marginalized populations, such as the rural poor. The right to health requires that 
health goods and services must be accessible, available, acceptable, and of good quality.  
Furthermore, the State is responsible to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health, which 
includes policy, legislative and regulatory changes that may take near immediate effect.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Government procurement policies and their implications on access to 
medicines 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance of Guatemala coordinates the 
public drug procurement policy of the Government through an open-contract system. The 
basis for the system was created in October 2004 under article 46 of the Law of State 
Procurement, and was expanded to include the open-contract system in 2005, under a 
number of resolutions.65 In this system, the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance 
selects quantities and varieties of drugs to be procured for the next year and then asks 
suppliers to submit bids. Formerly, there was a direct purchase system in place in which, as 
the name implies, drugs were directly purchased from the suppliers.  
</p>
<p>78. The procurement process is opaque, with regulations and administrative procedures 
that work against the selection of bids from generic drug companies. The existing bases for 
contracts under the open bidding system severely limit the free collection of offers.66 Other 
requirements result in the exclusion of generic drugs that have to obtain special commercial 
registration conforming to the enacted legislation. These requirements and hurdles 
constitute barriers to equal access to the market and free competition to the benefit of 
branded drug companies and against generic drugs.  
</p>
<p>79. Procurement prices in the open-bidding system are subject to legal challenge. Often 
these challenges have intentionally been used by multinational pharmaceutical 
manufacturers to delay Government procurement, thereby limiting the supply of essential 
medicines. Furthermore, these points were brought to the attention of the Government, and 
changes were made, but multinational pharmaceutical companies actively lobbied against 
the changing of regulations to ensure free competition and brought actions known as

<p><i>amparos</i> against relevant ministries for attempt to change the contract criteria.67 At present, 
the guidelines procedures remain as they were prior to any changes, with considerable 
detriment to free competition and access to drugs.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade 
Agreement and its impact on drug prices 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Central America-Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade Agreement 
(CAFTA/DR) is an agreement expanding trade relations between the United States and 
Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.68 
Within its remit are a number of areas: trade in goods, services, intellectual property and 
others. The object of this agreement, as with similar agreements, is the reduction of trade 
barriers, in the hope of ultimately eliminating them entirely, to drive development and 
economic growth between the parties. Trade agreements affect nearly all parts of an 
economy and have ramifications well beyond trade.     
</p>
<p>81. Often these agreements are negotiated without public consultation and transparency, 
the result being that key stakeholders are left out of the process. Claims such as these were 
made about CAFTA/DR.69 The standing of the United States as the largest and primary 
trading partner of nearly all the countries in the region resulted in a significant imbalance in 
the negotiations for the agreement. Moreover, many countries in the region did not possess 
the same legal expertise on intellectual property matters to address concerns adequately. In 
the case of access to medicines, this meant erosion of critical safeguards included in the 
World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights to protect public health and the public good.70 These and many other access-
restricting implications are discussed in greater detail in an earlier report of the Special 
Rapporteur.71 
</p>
<p>82. The net negative effect of the United States, European Union and other free trade 
agreements on access to medicines and their intellectual property expanding provisions is 
well documented.72 Recent iterations of such agreements have almost always included 
provisions that raise the floor set by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS-plus) so as to require greater intellectual property 
protections as the new minimum. They have also often restricted flexibilities found in

<p>TRIPS and reaffirmed by the Doha Declaration. These effects are not limited to medicines, 
but also extend to access to food, work, etc. 
</p>
<p>83. The accession of Guatemala to the Central America-Dominican Republic-United 
States Free Trade Agreement has required it to put in place intellectual property polices that 
curtail access to medicines. Increased intellectual property protections, such as data 
exclusivity, that prevent generic drugs from reaching the public market as quickly as 
possible, allow branded drug companies to retain monopolies on drugs. This results in 
much higher prices for medicines as has been seen elsewhere. In a country where 60 per 
cent of all medical expenditures are out of pocket and the majority of people live in 
poverty, this is a worrying outcome.  
</p>
<p>84. In many instances, there have been documented generic drug price increases as a 
result of provisions in the Agreement. In some cases, drugs have been prevented from 
entering the market entirely. For example, many generic versions of branded drugs used for 
major causes of mortality and morbidity cannot enter the market because they effectively 
cannot receive marketing approval. Many drugs have even been denied market entry 
because of data exclusivity requirements of up to 15 years in accordance with articles 
15.10.1(a) and 15.10.1(b). In a country like Guatemala, which has a moderately sized 
domestic generics industry, this not only reduces access but also directly harms the local 
economy.   
</p>
<p>85. Along with data exclusivity requirements of five years, the Agreement also obliges 
States parties to grant mandatory patent term extensions in article 15.9.6(b) and link 
marketing approval of drugs to their patent status in article 15.10.2(a). In aggregate, these 
extensions result in market monopoly by branded drug manufacturers for periods well 
beyond the patent term. Consequently, prices for certain drugs will remain artificially 
inflated due to a lack of participation and market pressure. This unfortunately dovetails 
with a drug procurement process that favours procurement of branded medicines over 
generics, even where generic drugs cost less. In the final calculation this results in a 
compound dysfunction, leaving drugs in short supply and priced far above market value.   
</p>
<p>86. In negotiating free trade agreements, States bear responsibility for ensuring 
compliance with pre-existing legal obligations, such as their international human rights 
treaty commitments. Guatemala, as a party to the agreement and numerous international 
instruments that ensure the right to health, must take all the necessary steps to ensure that 
the right is respected, protected and fulfilled.  
</p>
<p>87. The Government has an obligation under the right to health to investigate its policies 
affecting access to medicines, especially the two discussed here. Although there are aspects 
of the right to health that may be &#8220;progressively realized,&#8221; there are many more 
immediately actionable changes that can be made to address pressing right to health 
problems. In any event there can be no retrogression. Adequate safeguards must be kept in 
place and/or created to ensure equal access to quality medicines, many of which can be 
immediately implemented.

<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Guatemala to consider the following 
recommendations in the area of the health of indigenous peoples: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Adopt a comprehensive health strategy for the promotion of rights of 
indigenous people, focused on non-discrimination, and increase investments from the 
national budget to improve accessibility to health-care facilities, goods and services in 
rural communities and increased quality of services and information. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(b) Incorporate and ensure the consultation and participation of indigenous 
community members in the development of policies and programmes related to the 
delivery of health services and goods into indigenous communities.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Increase the number of rural primary care facilities and health 
professionals and accessibility of these facilities. In cases where such facilities cannot 
be immediately provided by the Government, extension of services provided by non-
governmental actors should be facilitated.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that all health service institutions have adequate language 
support for indigenous community members. Ensure that over a period of time 
medical staff deployed to rural areas learn indigenous languages. Immediately 
develop a system of interpretation via telephone or an alternative method, if on-site 
interpreters are not available in all health-care facilities.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Analyze the effectiveness of conditional cash transfers in improving 
health and other social indicators. If appropriate, expand and refine conditional cash 
transfer programmes in order to cover more municipalities and create greater 
incentives for impoverished indigenous households to spend their money on the health 
and education of their children. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Introduce a voucher system for the purpose of transport to health 
services, in order to improve health outcomes for rural indigenous people, especially 
women. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Guatemala to consider the following 
recommendations in the area of women&#8217;s health, with a focus on sexual and 
reproductive health rights: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Build the capacity of traditional midwives along with health-care 
professionals through human rights and other relevant training, and provide formal 
opportunities for information exchange between midwives and other health 
professionals, which can be facilitated by the Government. Allow traditional midwives 
to practise without undue interference or discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Provide sensitivity training for health-care workers to enable them to 
recognize the importance of midwives in Mayan culture, as part of a larger 
programme to develop the sensitivity of health-care workers to indigenous peoples 
and their traditions more generally. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Develop training and sensitivity programmes for health-care workers to 
assist them in recognizing and appropriately treating victims of domestic violence. 
Complement such programmes with targeted, culturally appropriate community 
awareness and education programmes to combat domestic violence. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Improve information and counselling on contraception within the public 
health-care system, including promotion of all forms of family planning and modern 
methods of contraception, and ensuring cultural appropriateness. Improve 
accessibility and affordability of all forms of contraception by providing 
contraceptives to underserved groups. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Guarantee women&#8217;s effective exercise of their right to the highest 
attainable standard of health, including access to safe, acceptable and affordable 
abortion services (at least in cases of medical emergency or sexual assault) and review 
the laws containing punitive measures against women who have undergone illegal 
abortions.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure that access to justice is available to women who have been 
subject to violence through law, administrative and other measures. </b></p>

<p><b>(a) Simplify the drug procurement system and eliminate regulatory barriers 
that discriminate against the purchasing of generic drugs. Increase transparency and 
independence of actors in the drug procurement process. A modified open-bidding 
system, in which all bidders were given equal credence, would be ideal. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Increase drug procurement from regional drug purchasing programmes, 
such as those provided by PAHO, in order to increase access to low cost, high quality 
mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Make use of the available TRIPS flexibilities, such as compulsory 
licensing and others, in order to increase competition and thereby reduce drug prices.
