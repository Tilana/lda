</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> all relevant resolutions that, inter alia, condemn any State that 
</p>
<p>permits or tolerates the recruitment, financing, training, assembly, transit or use of 
</p>
<p>mercenaries with the objective of overthrowing the Governments of States Members of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, especially those of developing countries, or of fighting against national 
</p>
<p>liberation movements, and recalling also the relevant resolutions and international 
</p>
<p>instruments adopted by the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and 
</p>
<p>Social Council, the African Union and the Organization of African Unity, inter alia, the 
</p>
<p>Organization of African Unity Convention for the Elimination of Mercenarism in Africa, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations concerning the strict observance of the principles of sovereign equality, political 
</p>
<p>independence, the territorial integrity of States, the self-determination of peoples, the non-
</p>
<p>  
 
</p>
<p>* Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>use of force or threat of use of force in international relations and non-interference in affairs 
</p>
<p>within the domestic jurisdiction of States, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that, by virtue of the principle of self-determination, all peoples 
</p>
<p>have the right to determine freely their political status and to pursue freely their economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural development, and that every State has the duty to respect this right in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the provisions of the Charter, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming further</i> the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning 
</p>
<p>Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> <i>and concerned</i> about the threat posed by the activities of mercenaries to 
</p>
<p>peace and security in developing countries in various parts of the world, in particular in 
</p>
<p>areas of conflict, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the loss of life, the substantial damage to property and the 
</p>
<p>negative effects on the policies and economies of affected countries resulting from 
</p>
<p>international criminal mercenary activities, 
</p>
<p><i>Extremely alarmed</i> <i>and concerned</i> about recent mercenary activities in developing 
</p>
<p>countries in various parts of the world, in particular in areas of conflict, and the threat they 
</p>
<p>pose to the integrity of and respect for the constitutional order of the affected countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the holding of regional consultations in all five regions from 2007 to 2011, 
</p>
<p>in which participants noted that the enjoyment and exercise of human rights were 
</p>
<p>increasingly impeded by the emergence of several new challenges and trends relating to 
</p>
<p>mercenaries or their activities and by the role played by private military and security 
</p>
<p>companies registered, operating or recruiting personnel in each region, and expressing its 
</p>
<p>appreciation to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for 
</p>
<p>its support for the holding of those consultations, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that, notwithstanding the way in which mercenaries or mercenary-related 
</p>
<p>activities are used or the form they take to acquire a semblance of legitimacy, they are a 
</p>
<p>threat to peace, security and the self-determination of peoples and an obstacle to the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights by peoples, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the use of mercenaries and their recruitment, financing, 
</p>
<p>protection and training are causes for grave concern to all States and violate the purposes 
</p>
<p>and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recognizes</i> that armed conflicts, terrorism, arms trafficking and covert 
</p>
<p>operations by third Powers encourage, inter alia, the demand for mercenaries on the global 
</p>
<p>market; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges </i>once again all States to take the necessary steps and to exercise the 
</p>
<p>utmost vigilance against the threat posed by the activities of mercenaries, and to take 
</p>
<p>legislative measures to ensure that their territories and other territories under their control, 
</p>
<p>as well as their nationals, are not used for the recruitment, assembly, financing, training, 
</p>
<p>protection and transit of mercenaries for the planning of activities designed to impede the 
</p>
<p>right to self-determination, to overthrow the Government of any State or to dismember or 
</p>
<p>impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign and 
</p>
<p>independent States conducting themselves in compliance with the right of peoples to self-
</p>
<p>determination; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests</i> all States to exercise the utmost vigilance against any kind of 
</p>
<p>recruitment, training, hiring or financing of mercenaries by private companies offering 
</p>
<p>international military consultancy and security services, and to impose a specific ban on </p>


<p>such companies intervening in armed conflicts or actions to destabilize constitutional 
</p>
<p>regimes; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Encourages</i> States that import the military assistance, consultancy and 
</p>
<p>security services provided by private companies to establish regulatory national 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for the registering and licensing of those companies in order to ensure that 
</p>
<p>imported services provided by those private companies neither impede the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights nor violate human rights in the recipient country; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Emphasizes</i> its utmost concern about the impact of the activities of private 
</p>
<p>military and security companies on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular when 
</p>
<p>operating in armed conflicts, and notes that private military and security companies and 
</p>
<p>their personnel are rarely held accountable for violations of human rights; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet become parties to the International 
</p>
<p>Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries to 
</p>
<p>consider taking the necessary action to do so; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Welcomes</i> the cooperation extended by those countries that received a visit by 
</p>
<p>the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
</p>
<p>impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, and the adoption by 
</p>
<p>some States of national legislation that restricts the recruitment, assembly, financing, 
</p>
<p>training and transit of mercenaries; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Invites</i> States to investigate the possibility of mercenary involvement 
</p>
<p>whenever and wherever criminal acts of a terrorist nature occur; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Condemns</i> mercenary activities in developing countries in various parts of the 
</p>
<p>world, in particular in areas of conflict, and the threat they pose to the integrity of and 
</p>
<p>respect for the constitutional order of these countries and the exercise of the right to self-
</p>
<p>determination of their peoples, and stresses the importance for the Working Group of 
</p>
<p>looking into sources and root causes, as well as the political motivations of mercenaries and 
</p>
<p>for mercenary-related activities; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community and all States, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>their obligations under international law, to cooperate with and assist the judicial 
</p>
<p>prosecution of those accused of mercenary activities in transparent, open and fair trials; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Acknowledges</i> <i>with appreciation</i> the work and contributions made by the 
</p>
<p>Working Group, including its research activities, and takes note of its latest report;1 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Decides</i> to renew, for a period of three years, the mandate of the Working

</p>
<p>7/21 of 28 March 2008 and in all other relevant resolutions on the subject; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Recalls</i> the holding of the second session of the open-ended 
</p>

<p>already done by previous mandate holders on the strengthening of the international legal 
</p>
<p>framework for the prevention and sanction of the recruitment, use, financing and training of 
</p>
<p>mercenaries, taking into account the proposal for a new legal definition of a mercenary

</p>
<p>rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination in his report

<p>the activities of mercenaries and private companies offering military assistance,
