In this report, we use terms to discuss oil and gas producing activities as defined in Rule 4-10(a) of
Regulation S-X.  We express quantities of natural gas in terms of thousand cubic feet (Mcf), million cubic feet
(MMcf) or billion cubic feet (Bcf). Oil is quantified in terms of barrels (Bbls), thousands of barrels (MBbls) and
millions of barrels (MMBbls). Oil is compared to natural gas in terms of equivalent thousand cubic feet (Mcfe)
or equivalent million cubic feet (MMcfe).  One barrel of oil is the energy equivalent of six Mcf of natural gas.
 Information relating to our working interest in wells or acreage, “net” oil and gas wells or acreage is
determined by multiplying gross wells or acreage by our working interest therein. Unless otherwise specified,
all references to wells and acres are gross.

CIMAREX ENERGY CO.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
September 30, 2005
(Unaudited)
1.                                                  Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements are unaudited and were prepared from the records of Cimarex Energy Co.
(Cimarex or the Company).  We believe these financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of our financial position and results of operations.  We prepared these statements on a basis consistent
with the annual audited statements and Regulation S-X. Regulation S-X allows us to omit some of the footnote and
policy disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and normally
included in annual reports on Form 10-K.  These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Cimarex was formed in February 2002 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Helmerich & Payne, Inc.
(H&P).  As a result of a dividend declared and paid by H&P on September 30, 2002, in the form
of Cimarex common stock, Cimarex was spun-off and became a stand-alone company.  Also on
September 30, 2002, Cimarex acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of Key
Production Company, Inc. (Key) in a tax-free exchange.
In June 2005, Cimarex acquired Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc.  Terms of the merger agreement provided that
Magnum Hunter stockholders receive 0.415 shares of Cimarex common stock for each share of Magnum Hunter
common stock.  As a result of the merger, Cimarex issued 39.7 million common shares to Magnum Hunter’s common
stockholders (excluding 2.5 million shares held in treasury).  At September 30, 2005, the combined company had 82.4
million shares outstanding. The merger was accounted for as a purchase of Magnum Hunter by Cimarex.
The accounts of Cimarex and its subsidiaries are presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
All intercompany accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation.
We make certain estimates and assumptions to prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and
in disclosures of commitments and contingencies.  Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised
estimates and actual results could differ from those estimates.
The more significant areas requiring the use of management’s estimates and judgments relate to the estimation of
proved oil and gas reserves, the use of these oil and gas reserves in calculating depletion, depreciation and
amortization, the use of the estimates of future net revenues in computing ceiling test limitations and estimates of
future abandonment obligations used in recording asset retirement obligations.  Estimates and judgments are also
required in determining reserves for bad debt, impairments of undeveloped properties, the purchase price allocation,
assessment of goodwill and valuation of deferred tax assets.
Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.

2.                                      Business Combination
On June 7, 2005, Cimarex completed the acquisition of Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc, an independent oil and gas
exploration and production company with operations concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New
Mexico and in the Gulf of Mexico.  Terms of the merger agreement provided that Magnum Hunter stockholders
receive 0.415 shares of Cimarex common stock for each share of Magnum Hunter common stock.  As a result of the
merger, Cimarex issued 39.7 million common shares to Magnum Hunter’s common stockholders (excluding 2.5 million
shares held in treasury).
We believe that the merger provides the opportunity to expand our existing core areas and to add new projects,
without jeopardizing our strong financial position; a substantial footprint in the Permian Basin from which we can grow;
complementary operations in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast areas; measured exposure to high potential projects in
the Gulf of Mexico; and the ability to greatly expand our balanced-risk drilling program underpinned by a strong
balance sheet.
The consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2005, includes the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities of
Magnum Hunter on June 7, 2005, as well as the adjustments required to record the acquisition in accordance with the
purchase method of accounting.  The results of operations of Magnum Hunter are included in our consolidated
statements of operations for the period since the acquisition on June 7, 2005.
The purchase price of Magnum Hunter’s assets was based on the value of Cimarex common stock issued to the
Magnum Hunter stockholders and the fair value of assumed liabilities.  The value of the common stock issued is
based on the weighted average price of Cimarex’s common stock for the period beginning two days before and ending
two days after the announcement of the merger, or $37.66 per share.  The purchase price also includes merger costs
incurred, which include employee severance costs, investment banking expenses, legal and accounting fees, printing
expenses and other related costs.

The allocation of the purchase price to oil and gas properties utilized prevailing oil and gas prices at the time of
negotiations and announcement of the merger.  The overall allocation of the purchase price is preliminary because
certain items such as the determination of the final fair value of certain assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date
have not been finalized. The goodwill amount related to the purchase as of September 30, 2005 has been adjusted to
$671.9 million, as the finalization process continues.
Included in current assets on the acquisition date of June 7, 2005 were assets available for sale of approximately $8.4
million acquired in the Magnum Hunter merger.  These assets were sold in the third quarter for approximately $8.1
million.
The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared to give effect to the Magnum Hunter acquisition as if
it had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.  The unaudited pro forma data is presented for illustrative
purposes only, based on estimates and assumptions deemed appropriate by management, and should not be relied
upon as an indication of the operating results that Cimarex would have achieved if the transaction had occurred on
January 1, 2004.  The pro forma information also should not be used as an indication of future results or trends.

3.                                                  Derivatives
SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging activities, requires that all derivatives be recorded
on the balance sheet at fair value.  We generally determine the fair value of commodity futures and swap contracts
based on the difference between the fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date. 
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded as an
expense. In connection with the Magnum Hunter merger, Cimarex recognized a $39.3 million liability associated with
Magnum Hunter’s existing commodity derivatives at the merger date (June 7, 2005).  These derivative instruments
have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment.  As a result, Cimarex recognized a net loss during the third
quarter of $82 million.  The charge includes both non-cash mark-to-market derivative losses as well as cash
settlements.  Cash payments related to these contracts that settled in the third quarter totaled $15.6 million.  The
derivative liability at September 30, 2005 equals $106.5 million. Cimarex will continue to recognize gains and losses in
future earnings as the remaining derivative instruments expire through December 31, 2006.  Actual gains and losses
to be recognized may differ materially from current fair value estimates. The following is a summary of the company’s
open derivative contracts as of September 30, 2005:

Of the $106.5 million of total derivative liabilities, $94.1 million is classified as current and $12.4 million is included in
other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2005.  The weighted average NYMEX
prices at September 30 for fourth quarter 2005 approximate $14.09 per Mcf of gas and $66.33 per barrel of oil. 
Weighted average NYMEX prices at September 30, 2005 for the year 2006 approximate $11.71 per Mcf of gas and
$66.83 per barrel of oil.

4.                                                  Stock Options
Cimarex’s 2002 Stock Incentive Plan reserves 12.7 million shares of common stock for issuance to directors and
employees, including officers.  Options granted under the plan after December 5, 2002, expire ten years from the
grant date and vest in one-fifth increments on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date.  All grants are
made at the average of the high and low prices of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
on the date of grant.
Upon the exercise of the options for shares of common stock, the employee is required to hold at least 50 percent of
the profit shares, as defined in the plan, until the eighth anniversary of the grant date.  The incentive plan provides for
accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the plan).
For periods prior to January 1, 2005, we applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations to account for all stock option grants.  No compensation cost had
been recognized for stock options granted, as the option prices were equal to the market price of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant.
Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 123R, Share Based Payment on a prospective basis.   SFAS No. 123R requires companies to recognize in the
income statement the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation to employees.  For
the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2005 amortization of compensation expense related to stock
options was approximately $0.5 million and $1.9 million or $0.3 million and $1.2 million after tax ($.01 and $.02 per
diluted share respectively).
As discussed more fully in the notes to the financial statements of our annual report on form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2004, the merger with Magnum Hunter constituted a “change of control event” under the incentive plan.
 As a result, all participants became entitled to acceleration of vesting of their options.  Cimarex obtained waivers of
the accelerated vesting from certain option holders including the company’s CEO and other senior officers.  Option
holders who were not requested to or did not choose to execute a waiver became fully vested in their options on
June 7, 2005. Compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of options was approximately $1.1 million or
$.7 million after tax.
The fair value of each option award was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model.  Expected volatilities were based on the historical volatility of our common stock.    The risk free interest rate
is based on U.S. Treasury Securities at a constant five year fixed maturity in effect at the date of the grant.  Historical
data was also used to estimate the probability of option exercise, expected years until exercise and employee
termination within the valuation model.
Had compensation cost for the plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards to
employees under the plan, consistent with the methodology of SFAS No. 123R for the quarter and nine months ended
September 30, 2004, such compensation expense would have been approximately $0.9 million and $2.6 million,
respectively.  Pro forma net income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 would have been as

As of September 30, 2005 there was $4.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
share-based compensation arrangements granted under our incentive plan.  That cost is expected to be recognized
pro rata over a weighted-average period of 7.2 years.  Generally, options vest on the anniversary of the grant date. 
However, as noted above, the merger with Magnum Hunter resulted in certain option holders becoming fully vested in
their options as of June 7, 2005.  The fair value attributable to such vested shares was approximately $1.1 million.
Cash received from option exercises during the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 was approximately
$8.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively.  The tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises
totaled approximately $6.1 million and $3.3 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
5.                                                  Asset Retirement Obligations
On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.  This Statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and the associated asset retirement costs.  The Statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made, and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived
asset.  Oil and gas producing companies incur this liability upon acquiring or drilling a well.
The following table reflects the components of the change in the carrying amount of the asset retirement obligation for
the nine months ended September 30, 2005 (in thousands):

We have the capability to borrow on a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.  On June 13, 2005, Cimarex entered
into a new Revolving Credit Facility that provides for $500 million of long-term committed credit.  The new facility is
scheduled to mature on July 1, 2010 and is secured by mortgages on certain oil and gas properties and the stock of
certain wholly-owned operating subsidiaries.
The Credit Facility agreement contains both financial and non-financial covenants, including limitations on share
repurchases, dividends and other restricted payments.  The financial covenants require Cimarex to maintain a
minimum ratio of funded indebtedness to trailing twelve-month EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes and DD&A
adjusted for non-cash items associated with mark-to-market accounting, stock-based compensation and impairment
of goodwill) of less than three times and a ratio of current assets plus unused commitments to current liabilities of
greater than one.  Cimarex continues to comply with these covenants and does not view them as materially
restrictive.
At the Company’s option, advances under the Credit Facility bear interest based upon a Base rate or a Eurodollar
rate.  The Base rate means the greater of (a) the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate plus
one-half of one percent.   The Eurodollar rate means the applicable British Bankers’ Association London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 1.00-1.75 percent and depending on borrowing base usage.  The
interest rate at September 30, 2005 equaled 4.46 percent. Unused
13
commitments under the agreement are subject to a commitment fee ranging from 0.225-0.375 percent, also depending
on borrowing base usage.  At September 30, 2005 Cimarex’s borrowing base was $825 million.  Effective
November 1, 2005 Cimarex’s borrowing base, as determined by its lenders in accordance with certain provisions
under the credit agreement, was increased to $1 billion.
Cimarex currently has a letter of credit posted against its borrowing base of $2.5 million that reduces funds available
under the Credit Facility.  The letter of credit is un-drawn and was posted to cover future plugging and abandonment
costs and potential environmental remediation costs associated with a certain producing property located in New
Mexico.
The 9.6% notes assumed in the Magnum Hunter merger have a face value of $195 million and are due March 15,
2012.  The notes are unsecured and are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Cimarex’s option, on and after
March 15, 2007 at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount), plus accrued
interest, if any, thereon to the date of redemption.

The floating rate convertible senior notes were assumed in the Magnum Hunter merger and mature on December 15,
2023.  The notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR,
reset quarterly.  On September 30, 2005, the interest rate was reset to 3.87%.
Holders of the convertible notes may surrender their notes for conversion into a combination of cash and shares of our
common stock upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, including if the price of our common stock has been
trading above the fixed conversion price of $28.99 per share.  On September 30, 2005, the closing price of our
common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange was $45.33.
If any holders of the notes elect to tender their notes for conversion, they are entitled to receive a conversion value
approximately equal to the ten-day average closing value of our common stock times 34.5.  We would then deliver the
conversion value as follows:   (1) an amount of cash equal to the lesser of (a) the conversion value or (b) the principal
amount of the notes and (2) an amount of common shares equal in value to the conversion value less the principal
amount of the notes (net shares).  At September 30, 2005, the maximum total net shares that the holders would be
entitled to if they all elected to tender their notes was 1.25 million.  At September 30, 2005 the conversion value
equaled $177.4 million (or $1,419 per bond) and the fair value of the notes equaled $183.8 million (or $1,470 per bond).
In addition to the holders right to redeem the notes if our common stock price is above the conversion price, the
holders also have the right to require Cimarex to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a repurchase price equal to
100% of the principal amount (plus accrued interest) on December 15, 2008, 2013 and 2018.   The indenture
agreement also provides Cimarex with an option to redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount (plus accrued interest) anytime after December 22, 2008.
14
All long-term debt is guaranteed by Cimarex and all of its subsidiaries, except Canvasback.  Total assets held by
Canvasback equal $1.6 million.
On February 18, 2005, Magnum Hunter’s 40% owned subsidiary, Apple Tree Holdings, LLC (“Apple Tree”), entered
into a $20.6 million construction loan agreement (“Construction Loan”).  The Construction Loan provides financing for
the construction of a processing plant, natural gas lateral, carbon dioxide line and related infrastructure in Huerfano
County, Colorado.  The Construction Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.25% or a base rate plus 1.25%, and will
mature no later than July 31, 2006.  Total borrowings under this loan at September 30, 2005 were $14.3 million, of
which our share was $5.7 million.  Magnum Hunter also provided a guarantee to the lender for 100% of the loan.  In
return for the guarantee, Magnum Hunter received an up-front fee and the rights to receive 55% of distributable cash
flows from Apple Tree until certain financial tests are met.  In the merger, Cimarex assumed Magnum Hunter’s
obligation.  In the event that the Construction Loan goes into default and we have to perform under the guarantee, we
will have recourse against the project and related subsidiaries.  We have included $162 thousand in other liabilities on
our condensed consolidated balance sheet to represent the fair value of our guarantee for the Construction Loan.

10.                                           Segment Information
We have two reportable segments.  The Exploration and Production segment is engaged in exploratory and
developmental drilling, production and sale of crude oil, condensate, and natural gas, and acquisitions.  The Gas
Gathering, Marketing, and Processing segment is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas from the
wellhead, the purchase and resale of natural gas that it gathers, and the processing of natural gas liquids. The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the company as a whole.

11.                                           Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
A liability for $6.5 million for estimated future litigation settlements has been recorded in the third quarter.  The
proposed settlement will be reviewed by the court in the fourth quarter of 2005 for approval.
Cimarex has other various litigation related matters in the normal course of business, none of which are material,
individually or in aggregate.
Gas Deliveries
At September 30, 2005, we had a firm sales contract to deliver approximately 1.2 Bcf of natural gas over the next
eight months.  If this gas is not delivered, our financial commitment would be approximately $8.0 million.  This
commitment will fluctuate due to price volatility and actual volumes delivered.  However, we believe no financial
commitment will be due based on our reserves and current production levels.
Cimarex has other various delivery commitments in the normal course of business, none of which are individually
material.  In aggregate these commitments have a maximum amount that would be payable, if no gas is delivered, of
approximately $4.9 million.
18
Drilling Commitments
The Company has contractual commitments on oil and gas wells approved for drilling or in the process of being drilled
at September 30, 2005 of approximately $102 million. All of the noted commitments were routine and made in the
normal course of our business.
Tax Sharing Agreement
On September 30, 2002, Cimarex entered into an agreement with H&P that provides indemnification of H&P in
connection with any future tax claims that may be made relating to the oil and gas exploration and production assets
contributed to Cimarex by H&P.
12.       Property Sales
Various interests in oil and gas properties were sold during the third quarter, with net proceeds equaling $61.3 million. 
Current income taxes payable include $22.6 million related to this sale. These proceeds were recorded as a reduction
to oil and gas properties, as prescribed under the full cost method of accounting.  We anticipate overall sales of oil
and gas properties in 2005 to total over $90.0 million.  Proved reserves associated with these properties approximates
21 billion cubic feet equivalent, and related production is 7.3 MMcf equivalent per day.
19
ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
Throughout this Form 10-Q, we make statements that may be deemed “forward-looking” statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934.  These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements concerning Cimarex’s outlook
with regard to timing and amount of future production of oil and gas, price realizations, amounts, nature and
timing of capital expenditures for exploration and development, plans for funding operations and capital
expenditures, drilling of wells, operating costs and other expenses, marketing of oil and gas and other
statements of expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends, and similar
expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.  The forward-looking statements in this report are
subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in
or implied by the statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in the price we receive for our oil
and gas production, reductions in the quantity of oil and gas sold due to decreased industry-wide demand
and/or curtailments in production from specific properties due to mechanical, marketing or other problems,
operating and capital expenditures that are either significantly higher or lower than anticipated because the
actual cost of identified projects varied from original estimates and/or from the number of exploration and
development opportunities being greater or fewer than currently anticipated, and increased financing costs
due to a significant increase in interest rates. In addition, exploration and development opportunities pursued
by Cimarex may not result in productive oil and gas properties.  There are also numerous uncertainties
inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, projecting future rates of production and the timing of
development expenditures.  These and other risks and uncertainties affecting Cimarex are discussed in
greater detail in this report and in other filings by Cimarex with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
Cimarex Energy Co. is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Our operations are presently
focused in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Kansas and Louisiana. Our primary focus is to explore for and discover
new reserves. To supplement our growth, we also consider acquisitions and mergers, such as the acquisition of
Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc.  On June 7, 2005, Cimarex completed its acquisition of Magnum Hunter Resources,
Inc, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations concentrated in the Permian
Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and in the Gulf of Mexico. Terms of the merger agreement provided that
Magnum Hunter stockholders receive 0.415 shares of Cimarex common stock for each owned share of Magnum
Hunter common stock.  As a result of the merger transaction, Cimarex issued 39.7 million common shares to
Magnum Hunter’s common stockholders (excluding 2.5 million shares held in treasury). At September 30, 2005, the
combined company had 82.4 million shares outstanding. The merger was accounted for as a purchase of Magnum
Hunter by Cimarex. The results of operations of Magnum Hunter are included in our consolidated statements of
operations for the period since the acquisition on June 7, 2005.
We believe that the merger provides: the opportunity to expand our existing core areas and to add new projects,
without jeopardizing our strong financial position; a substantial footprint in the Permian Basin from which we can grow;
complementary operations in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast areas; measured exposure to high potential projects in
the Gulf of Mexico; and the ability to greatly expand our balanced-risk drilling program underpinned by a strong
balance sheet.
20
Industry and Economic Factors
In managing our business, we must deal with many factors inherent in our industry.  First and foremost is wide
fluctuation of oil and gas prices. Historically, oil and gas markets have been cyclical and volatile, with future price
movements difficult to predict.  While our revenues are a function of both production and prices, it is wide swings in
prices that have most often had the greatest impact on our results of operations.
Our operations entail significant complexities.  Advanced technologies requiring highly trained personnel are utilized in
both exploration and production.  Even when the technology is properly used, the interpreter still may not know
conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present or the rate at which they will be produced.  Exploration is a high-risk
activity, often times resulting in no commercially productive reservoirs being discovered.  Moreover, costs associated
with operating within the industry are substantial.
The oil and gas industry is highly competitive.  We compete with major and diversified energy companies,
independent oil and gas businesses, and individual operators.  In addition, the industry as a whole competes with
other businesses that supply energy to industrial and commercial end users.
Extensive Federal, state and local regulation of the industry significantly affects our operations.  In particular, our
activities are subject to stringent environmental regulations.  These regulations have increased the costs of planning,
designing, drilling, installing, operating, and abandoning oil and gas wells and related facilities.  These regulations may
become more demanding in the future.
Approach to the Business
Profitable growth of our assets will largely depend upon our ability to successfully find and develop new proved
reserves. To accommodate an overall acceptable rate of growth, we maintain a blended portfolio of low, moderate and
higher risk exploration and development projects.  We believe that this approach allows for consistent increases in our
oil and gas reserves, while minimizing the chance of failure. To further mitigate risk, we have chosen to seek geologic
and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins. We may also consider the use of transaction-specific
hedging of oil and gas prices to reduce price risk.  To date the use of hedging has not been implemented by Cimarex. 
However, in connection with the acquisition of Magnum Hunter, we acquired existing commodity derivatives as
discussed more fully below.
Implementation of our business approach relies on our ability to fund ongoing exploration and development projects
with cash flow provided by operating activities, periodic sales of non-strategic properties and external sources of
capital.
For the full-year 2005, we project that 2005 exploration and development expenditures will range from $575 million to
$625 million, of which fourth quarter expenditures will range from $150 million to $200 million. The anticipated
expenditures for 2005 are up from the $296 million spent in 2004. Our 2005 exploration and development expenditures
pro forma on a full year basis for Magnum Hunter are expected to range from $720 million to $770 million.
Approximately 30 percent of the expenditures will be spent in our Mid-Continent program, 25 percent in the Gulf of
Mexico, 19 percent in the Permian Basin and 13 percent in our onshore Gulf Coast program.
Exploration and development expenditures during the third quarter of 2005 totaled $192.9 million, up from $58.5 million
for the third quarter of 2004.  Capital expenditures for exploration and development during the nine months of 2005
were $426.6 million, up from $208.8 million during the nine months of 2004. In the third quarter of 2005, we
participated in drilling 97 gross (51 net) wells, with an overall success rate of 94 percent.  We drilled 300 gross (156
net) wells during the nine months of 2005, realizing a success rate of 86 percent.
Various interests in oil and gas properties were sold during the third quarter, with net proceeds equaling $61.3 million. 
Current income taxes payable include $22.6 million related to this sale. These proceeds were recorded as a reduction
to oil and gas properties, as prescribed under the full cost method
21
of accounting.  We anticipate overall sales of oil and gas properties in 2005 to total over $90.0 million.  Proved
reserves associated with these properties approximates 21 billion cubic feet equivalent, and related production is 7.3
MMcf equivalent per day.
Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 totaled $417.5 million, helping to
fund our exploration and development expenditure program.  Due to positive drilling results during 2004 and 2005,
approximately nine percent of our year-to-date oil and gas production contributing to this cash flow was generated
from new wells going on line during 2005.
Based on expected cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from sales of non-strategic oil and gas properties
and monies available under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, we believe we are well positioned to fund the
projects identified for the remainder of 2005 and beyond.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, or GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  Our significant accounting
policies are described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2004.  In response to SEC Release No. 33-8040, “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure about
Critical Accounting Policies,” we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the
portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by
our management.  We analyze our estimates, including those related to oil and gas revenues, reserves and
properties, as well as goodwill and contingencies, and base our estimates on historical experience and various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues from oil and gas sales are recognized based on the sales method, with revenue recognized on actual
volumes sold to purchasers.  There is a ready market for oil and gas, with sales occurring soon after production.
Oil and Gas Reserves
The process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the
evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data.  The data for a given field may
also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional
development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under
varying economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to
time.  Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most
accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make
these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures. For 2004,
revisions of reserve estimates (excluding Magnum Hunter reserves) resulted in an increase of 1.2 MMBbls of oil and
an increase of 20.1 Bcf of gas, representing eight percent and five percent of proved oil and gas reserves,
respectively, as of December 31, 2004.
We use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties.  Changes in reserve quantities will
cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision or, in some cases,
a full cost ceiling limitation charge in the period of the revision.  To date, changes in expense resulting from changes
in previous estimates of reserves have not been material.
22
Derivatives
SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging activities, requires that all derivatives be recorded
on the balance sheet at fair value.  We generally determine the fair value of futures contracts and swap contracts
based on the difference between the derivative’s fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the
determination date.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges are
recorded as an expense. In connection with the Magnum Hunter merger, Cimarex recognized a $39.3 million net
liability associated with Magnum Hunter’s existing commodity derivatives at the merger date (June 7, 2005).  These
derivative instruments have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment.  As a result, Cimarex recognized in
earnings during the third quarter a net loss of $82.0 million.  This charge includes both non-cash mark-to-market
derivative losses as well as cash settlements.  Cash payments related to these contracts that settled in the third
quarter totaled $15.6 million.  The net derivative liability at September 30, 2005 equals $106.5 million. Cimarex will
continue to recognize gains and losses in future earnings until the derivative instruments mature.
Full Cost Accounting
We use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations.  All costs associated with property
acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. Exploration and development costs include dry
hole costs, geological and geophysical costs, direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and
other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves. Salaries and benefits paid to employees directly
involved in the exploration and development of properties, as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified
with acquisition, exploration and development activities, are also capitalized.
Under full cost accounting rules, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes,
may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value discounted at 10 percent of estimated future net
revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any
related income tax effects.  Cash flows used in the calculation of the full cost ceiling limitation are determined based
upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves, future prices, and the costs to extract these reserves.  Downward
revisions in estimated reserve quantities, increases in future cost estimates or depressed oil and gas prices could
cause us to reduce the carrying value of our oil and gas properties.  If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess
must be charged to expense.  This is referred to as the “full cost ceiling limitation.”  The expense may not be reversed
in future periods, even if higher oil and gas prices subsequently increase the full cost ceiling limitation.  At the end of
each quarter, a full cost ceiling limitation calculation is made.
Goodwill
We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.  SFAS No. 142 requires an annual impairment assessment.  A more frequent
assessment is required if certain events occur that reasonably indicate an impairment may have occurred.  The
volatility of oil and gas prices may cause more frequent assessments.   The impairment assessment requires us to
make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit.  The estimated fair value is based on numerous factors,
including future net cash flows of our estimates of proved reserves as well as the success of future exploration for
and development of unproved reserves. These factors are each individually weighted to estimate the total fair value of
the reporting unit.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the unit is
considered not impaired.  If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, then a measurement of the loss
must be performed, with any deficiency recorded as an impairment.  We recorded $45.0 million of goodwill in the
purchase of Key on September 30, 2002 and $685.4 million of goodwill in the purchase of Magnum Hunter on June 7,
2005.  The allocation of the Magnum Hunter purchase price to oil and gas properties utilized prevailing oil and gas
prices at the time of negotiations and announcement of the merger.  The overall allocation of the purchase price is
preliminary because
23
certain items such as the determination of the final fair value of certain assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date
have not been finalized.  The goodwill amount related to the Magnum Hunter purchase as of September 30, 2005 has
been adjusted downward to $671.9 million from the original estimate of $685.4 million, as the finalization process
continues.  To date, no related impairment has been recorded.
Contingencies
A provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably
estimated.  Determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for
accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment.  In many cases, this judgment is based
on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and/or courts of law.  We
closely monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and periodically determine when we
should record losses for these items based on information available to us.  As of September 30, 2005, we have
accrued for a mediated $6.5 million litigation settlement pertaining to post-production deductions on properties
operated by Cimarex.  The proposed settlement will be reviewed by the court in the fourth quarter of 2005 for approval.
See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Asset Retirement Obligations
On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.  This Statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and the associated asset retirement costs.  The Statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made, and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived
asset.  Oil and gas producing companies incur this liability upon acquiring or drilling a well.
Stock Options
For periods prior to January 1, 2005, we applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations to account for all stock option grants.  No compensation cost had
been recognized for stock options granted, as the option prices were equal to the market price of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant.
Effective January 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 123R, Share Based Payment on a prospective basis.   SFAS No. 123R requires companies to recognize in the
income statement the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation to employees.
The fair value of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 
Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock.  Historical data is also used to
estimate option exercise, expected years until exercise and employee termination within the valuation model.  The
risk free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury Securities at a constant five year fixed maturity in effect at the date
of the grant.
Recent Accounting Developments
In September 2005, the SEC gave public companies that are not “accelerated filers” an additional year to comply with
the requirements that implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act’s Section 404 mandates on internal control over financial
reporting.  In a separate action, the SEC proposed amendments that would create a new category of “accelerated filer”
and would change the final phase-in of accelerated-filing deadlines.  As it pertains to Cimarex, which would be
deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the proposals, the filing deadline for annual reports on Form 10-K would
be 60 days following year end for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2005, and would remain 40 days
following the fiscal quarter-end for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
24
Also in September 2005, the FASB proposed new Staff Positions on applying Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123R, Share –Based Payment.  The proposed rules establish that determining the grant date
of a share-based payment is presumed to be satisfied at the date the award is approved under relevant corporate
governance requirements, as long as the recipient is unable to negotiate the key terms and conditions of the award,
and the award’s key terms are expected to be communicated to the recipient within a relatively short period of time
after the date of approval.  The new rule would become effective when an entity adopts 123R, or, if already adopted,
in the first reporting period beginning after the Staff Position is finalized.  The FASB also proposed a simpler
alternative to the calculation of the amount of excess tax benefits available in additional-paid-in capital (“APIC”) to
absorb tax deficiencies that occur after adopting 123R.  Companies would have up to one year after adopting 123R to
decide whether to elect the alternative computation method.
On September 30, 2005 the FASB issued a proposed statement, “Earnings per Share, an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 128”, that would clarify guidance for the computation of earnings per share relative to mandatory
convertible instruments, contingently issuable shares, contracts that may be settled in cash or shares, and use of the
treasury stock method. The proposal would be effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2006.
Overview
Our results of operations are impacted by oil and gas prices, which are volatile.  Realized oil and gas prices increased
from $41.81 per barrel and $5.63 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2004 to $59.45 per barrel and $7.88 per Mcf in the third
quarter of 2005. The majority of our revenues are from oil and gas sales, so price fluctuations can significantly affect
our financial results.
Gas gathering, marketing and processing revenues net of related costs pertain to activities with third parties
conducted by our marketing group.  Natural gas sales transactions are conducted with various purchasers under a
variety of terms and conditions and supplied by purchasing gas from other producers and marketing companies.  For
the sales transactions in which the gas is supplied by our own production, related sales and costs are reflected in
Cimarex’s gas sales and transportation expense.
We also own interests in gas gathering systems and gas processing plants that are largely incidental to our production
operations, which also transport and process third party gas.
Transportation expenses are comprised of costs paid to carry and deliver oil and gas to a specified delivery point.  In
some cases we receive a payment from purchasers, which is net of transportation costs, and in other instances we
separately pay for transportation.  If costs are netted in the proceeds received, both the revenues and costs are
shown gross in sales and expenses, respectively.
Production costs are composed of lease operating expenses, which generally consist of pumpers’ salaries, utilities,
maintenance and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties.
Taxes other than income are taxes assessed by applicable taxing authorities pertaining to production, revenues or the
value of our properties.  These typically include production severance, ad valorem and excise taxes.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of our producing properties is computed using the unit-of-production method. 
Because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for production, fluctuations in oil
and gas prices may impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation.  Higher prices generally have the
effect of increasing reserves, which reduces depletion, while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing
reserves, which increases depletion.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, office rent, legal fees,
consultants, systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices.   While we expect such costs to
increase with our growth, we expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth. 
Expenses related to the merger are costs associated with the Magnum Hunter transaction.
25
Stock compensation expense consists of non-cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock and
restricted stock units to certain employees and the expensing of stock options resulting from the adoption of SFAS
No. 123R.
Basis of Presentation
Cimarex was formed in February 2002 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (H&P).  As a result of
a dividend declared and paid by H&P on September 30, 2002, in the form of Cimarex common stock, Cimarex was
spun-off and became a stand-alone company.  Also on September 30, 2002, Cimarex acquired 100 percent of the
outstanding common stock of Key Production Company, Inc. (Key) in a tax-free exchange.
In June 2005, Cimarex acquired Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc, by issuing 0.415 shares of Cimarex common stock
for each share of outstanding Magnum Hunter common stock, resulting in the issuance of 39.7 million Cimarex
common shares.  At September 30, 2005, the combined company had 82.4 million shares outstanding (excluding 2.5
million shares held in treasury). The merger was accounted for as a purchase of Magnum Hunter by Cimarex.  The
results of operations of Magnum Hunter are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period since
the acquisition on June 7, 2005.

Net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $64.1 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to net income of
$39.2 million, or $0.91 per diluted share for the same period in 2004.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2005,
net income was $159.9 million, or $2.63 per diluted share, compared to net income of $105.5 million, or $2.47 per
diluted share, for the same period in 2004. The change in net income results from the effect of changes in revenues
and costs, as discussed further.  The results of operations of Magnum Hunter are included in our consolidated
statements of operations only for the period since the acquisition on June 7, 2005.
Oil and gas sales for third quarter of 2005 totaled $343.5 million, compared to $119.6 million for the third quarter of
2004.  The $223.9 million increase in sales between the two periods results from $124.7 million due to higher
production volumes (due primarily to increased production resulting from the acquisition of Magnum Hunter) and $99.2
million related to higher commodity prices.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, oil and gas sales
increased by $335.4 million, or 102 percent, to $665.9 million from $330.5 million during the nine months of 2004. 
Higher production volumes increased sales by $178.9 million and higher commodity prices contributed $156.5 million
to the increase between the two nine-month periods.
Realized gas prices averaged $7.88 per Mcf for the three months ended September 30, 2005, compared to $5.63 per
Mcf for the third quarter of 2004.  This 40 percent change increased sales by $70.0 million between the two periods.
Realized oil prices averaged $59.45 per barrel for the third quarter of 2005, compared to $41.81 per barrel for the same
period in 2004.  The increase in sales between periods resulting from this 42 percent improvement in oil prices totaled
$29.2 million.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, realized gas prices increased to $6.99 per Mcf from $5.52 per Mcf
realized in the nine months of 2004.  This price increase contributed $102.2 million to the increase in sales between
the two nine-month periods.  Realized oil prices averaged $54.40 per barrel for the nine months of 2005, compared to
$37.77 per barrel for the same period in 2004, resulting in a $54.3 million increase in sales between periods.  Changes
in realized prices were the direct result of overall market conditions.
Sales also benefited from higher production volumes.  Average gas volumes rose 161.6 MMcf per day in the third
quarter of 2005 to 337.8 MMcf per day from 176.2 MMcf per day in the third quarter of 2004, resulting in $83.8 million
of incremental revenues.  Oil volumes averaged 18,002 barrels per day for the three months of 2005, compared to
7,358 barrels per day in the same period of 2004, resulting in increased revenues of $40.9 million.  For the nine
months of 2005, gas volumes averaged 255.9 MMcf per day and oil volumes equaled 11,975 barrels per day,
compared to the nine-month 2004 volumes of 169.5 MMcf per day and 7,143 barrels per day.  The higher gas volumes
increased sales between the two periods by $129.4 million, and higher oil volumes resulted in $49.5 million of
additional revenues. The increase in sales volumes between the periods of 2005 and 2004 is due to positive drilling
results during 2004 and 2005, and the inclusion of production from Magnum Hunter operations from June 7, 2005. 
Production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast area were negatively
impacted during the third quarter of 2005 as a result of various hurricanes.  As much as 125 MMcf of gas equivalent
Company production per day had been shut in.  A large portion of the production has been placed back on line.  The
timetable to restore full production is uncertain and will largely depend on the startup of refineries, gas processing
plants, platforms, facilities and pipelines owned and operated by others.  No oil and gas reserves have been lost as a
result of the storms and essentially all associated repair costs will be covered by insurance.
Gas gathering, marketing and processing revenues net of related costs equaled $5.9 million in the third quarter of
2005 compared to $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2004.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004,
such revenues net of related costs totaled $7.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively.  These net revenues relate to
activities with outside parties.  Such revenues and costs related to our own production are eliminated in consolidation.
28
Other net revenues and expenses equaled a net expense of $1.1 million for the nine months of 2005, consisting of a
mediated $6.5 million litigation settlement expense, offset by gains on sale of miscellaneous equipment. Other
revenues for the nine months of 2004 equaled $6.0 million consisting of $3.5 million of settlements related to litigation
for which we were plaintiffs, and the remaining $2.5 million pertaining to gains on the sale of miscellaneous
equipment.
Costs and Expenses
Costs and expenses (not including gas gathering, marketing and processing costs) were $245.3 million in the third
quarter of 2005 compared to $59.4 million in the same period of 2004.  For the nine months of 2005 and 2004, these
overall costs and expenses equaled $421.8 million and $169.7 million, respectively.
The largest component of these increases between periods was the loss on derivative instruments.  Prior to the
acquisition of Magnum Hunter, Cimarex did not use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price changes. In
connection with the merger, we recognized a $39.3 million net liability associated with Magnum Hunter’s existing
commodity derivatives at the merger date (June 7, 2005).  These derivative instruments have not been designated for
hedge accounting treatment.  As a result, Cimarex recognized in earnings during the third quarter a net loss of $82.0
million ($84 million year to date).  The charge includes both non-cash mark-to-market derivative losses as well as
cash settlements.  Cash payments related to these contracts that settled in the third quarter totaled $15.6 million. The
net derivative liability at September 30, 2005 equals $106.5 million.  Cimarex will continue to recognize mark-to-
market gains and losses as well as amortization of these contracts in future earnings until the derivative instruments
mature.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) was the next largest component of the increases between periods.
DD&A equaled $82.8 million in the third quarter of 2005 compared to $32.0 million in the same period of 2004. For the
nine months of 2005 and 2004, DD&A totaled $172.5 million and $89.2 million, respectively. On a unit of production
basis, DD&A was $2.02 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2005 compared to $1.58 per Mcfe for the third quarter of
2004.  For the nine months of 2005 and 2004, DD&A on a unit of production basis equaled $1.93 per Mcfe and $1.53
per Mcfe, respectively. The increases largely stem from costs associated with Magnum Hunter operations and higher
costs for reserves added during 2004.
Production costs rose $31.9 million from $8.6 million ($0.43 per Mcfe) in the third quarter of 2004 to $40.5 million
($0.99 per Mcfe) in the third quarter of 2005.  For the nine months of 2005 and 2004, production costs equaled $68.1
million ($0.76 per Mcfe) and $27.5 million ($0.47 per Mcfe), respectively.  The higher costs in 2005 resulted primarily
from the inclusion for the quarter of costs associated with Magnum Hunter operations, higher field operating expenses
from an expanded number of properties, and higher maintenance costs.
Transportation costs increased from $2.7 million, or $0.13 per Mcfe, in the third quarter of 2004 to $4.2 million, or
$0.10 per Mcfe, in the third quarter of 2005.  Transportation costs for the nine months of 2005 equaled $10.3 million
compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2004.  The increase is the result of expiring contracts being renewed
with increased current market rates, and the inclusion for the quarter of transportation costs associated with Magnum
Hunter operations.
Taxes other than income were $11.7 million greater, rising from $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2004 to $21.4 million
in the same period of 2005.  For the nine months of 2005 and 2004, these costs totaled $45.9 million and $27.6
million, respectively.  The increases between periods resulted from increases in oil and gas sales stemming from
inclusion of Magnum Hunter operations, higher production volumes and commodity prices.
General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased $3.0 million from $5.4 million in the third quarter of 2004 to
$8.4 million in the third quarter of 2005.  G&A expenses for the nine months of
29
2005 equaled $24.0 million compared to $15.0 million for the same period of 2004.  The increases between periods are
due to an expansion of staff and higher employee-benefit costs.
As of September 30, 2005, expenses associated with the Magnum Hunter merger totaled $8.1 million. Of the $8.1
million, $3.6 million is due to the acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock units resulting from
change of control provisions under our stock incentive plan becoming effective due to the Magnum Hunter merger. 
The remaining $4.5 million consists of $3.0 million of general integration costs, $1.0 million for retention bonuses, and
$0.5 million of related financing costs.
Stock compensation increased from $1.5 million in the nine months of 2004 to $3.7 million in the nine months of 2005
due primarily to the $1.9 million expensing of stock options resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.  As of
September 30, 2005, there was $4.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-
based compensation arrangements granted under our stock incentive plan.  That cost is expected to be recognized
pro rata over a weighted-average period of 7.2 years.
Net interest increased from $0.4 million in the nine months of 2004 to $3.1 million in the nine months of 2005.  The
increase results from the incurrence of interest expense associated with the debt assumed in the Magnum Hunter
merger.  Prior to the Magnum Hunter merger, Cimarex had no outstanding debt.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense totaled $36.0 million for the third quarter of 2005 versus $23.2 million for the third quarter of
2004.  Tax expense equaled a combined Federal and state effective income tax rate of 36.0 percent and 37.2 percent
in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Income tax expense for the nine months of 2005 equaled $90.6
million compared to $63.1 million for the same period of 2004, equating to combined Federal and state effective
income tax rates of 36.2 percent and 37.4 percent, respectively.  We estimate that $58.0 million of our nine-month
2005 income tax expense is current.
30
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows
Our primary source of capital is cash flow generated from operating activities. Prices we receive for oil and gas sales
and our level of production will impact these future cash flows.  No prediction can be made as to the prices we will
receive.  Production volumes will in large part be dependent upon the amount and results of future capital
expenditures.  In turn, actual levels of capital expenditures may vary due to many factors, including drilling results, oil
and gas prices, industry conditions, prices and availability of goods and services, and the extent to which proved
properties are acquired.
Cash flow provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $417.5 million,
compared to $255.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The increase in 2005 from the earlier
period results primarily from higher oil and gas production and prices.
Higher revenues from oil and gas sales facilitated the funding of our exploration and development expenditure program
for the first half of 2005.
Cash flow used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $328.4 million, compared to
$213.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The increase in 2005 stems from a larger exploration
and development program.
Cash flow used in financing activities in the first nine months of 2005 was $177.4 million versus $10.0 million provided
in the first nine months of 2004.  The cash used in financing activities in 2005 resulted primarily from the payment of
$188.4 million on debt assumed in the Magnum Hunter acquisition, offset by proceeds from issuance of common
stock.
Financial Condition
As of September 30, 2005, stockholders’ equity totaled $2.4 billion, up from $700.7 million at December 31, 2004. 
The increase resulted primarily from $1.5 billion of common stock issued in connection with the Magnum Hunter
acquisition, and nine-month 2005 net income of $159.9 million, and $49.6 million of fair value of common stock
associated with the convertible debt assumed in the Magnum Hunter merger.  At September 30, 2005 our cash
balance equaled $27.5 million.
Working Capital
Working capital at September 30, 2005 totaled a negative $76.1 million, compared to a positive $93.4 million at
December 31, 2004.  The decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in cash and an increase in current derivative
liability. Our receivables are from a diverse group of companies including major energy companies, pipeline
companies, local distribution companies and end-users in various industries.  The collection of receivables during the
period presented has been timely.  Historically, losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been
significant.

We have the capability to borrow on a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.  On June 13, 2005, Cimarex entered
into a new Revolving Credit Facility that provides for $500 million of long-term committed credit.  At September 30,
2005 Cimarex’s borrowing base was $825 million.  Effective November 1, 2005 Cimarex’s borrowing base, as
determined by its lenders in accordance with certain provisions under the credit agreement, was increased to $1
billion.  The new facility is scheduled to mature on July 1, 2010 and is secured by mortgages on certain oil and gas
properties and the stock of certain wholly-owned operating subsidiaries.
The Credit Facility agreement contains both financial and non-financial covenants, including limitations on share
repurchases, dividends and other restricted payments.  The financial covenants require Cimarex to maintain a
minimum ratio of funded indebtedness to trailing twelve-month EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes and DD&A
adjusted for non-cash items associated with mark-to-market accounting, stock-based compensation and impairment
of goodwill) of less than three times and a ratio of current assets plus unused commitments to current liabilities of
greater than one.  Cimarex continues to comply with these covenants and does not view them as materially
restrictive.
At the Company’s option, advances under the Credit Facility bear interest based upon a Base rate or a Eurodollar
rate.  The Base rate means the greater of (a) the JP Morgan Chase Bank prime rate or (b) the federal funds rate plus
one-half of one percent.   The Eurodollar rate means the applicable British Bankers’ Association London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 1.00-1.75
32
percent and depending on borrowing base usage. The interest rate at September 30, 2005 equaled 4.46 percent.
Unused commitments under the agreement are subject to a commitment fee ranging from 0.225-0.375 percent, also
depending on borrowing base usage.
Cimarex currently has a letter of credit posted against its borrowing base of $2.5 million that reduces funds available
under the Credit Facility.  The letter of credit is un-drawn and was posted to cover future plugging and abandonment
costs and potential environmental remediation costs associated with a certain producing property located in New
Mexico.
The 9.6% notes assumed in the Magnum Hunter merger have a face value of $195 million and are due March 15,
2012.  The notes are unsecured and are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at Cimarex’s option, on and after
March 15, 2007 at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount), plus accrued
interest, if any, thereon to the date of redemption.

The floating rate convertible senior notes were assumed in the Magnum Hunter merger and mature on December 15,
2023.  The notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR,
reset quarterly.  On September 30, 2005, the interest rate was reset to 3.87%.
Holders of the convertible notes may surrender their notes for conversion into a combination of cash and shares of our
common stock upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, including if the price of our common stock has been
trading above the fixed conversion price of $28.99 per share.  On September 30, 2005, the closing price of our
common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange was $45.33.
If any holders of the notes elect to tender their notes for conversion, they are entitled to receive a conversion value
approximately equal to the ten-day average closing value of our common stock times 34.5.  We would then deliver the
conversion value as follows:   (1) an amount of cash equal to the lesser of (a) the conversion value or (b) the principal
amount of the notes and (2) an amount of common shares equal in value to the conversion value less the principal
amount of the notes (net shares).  At September 30, 2005, the maximum total net shares that the holders would be
entitled to if they all elected to tender their notes was 1.25 million.  At September 30, 2005 the conversion value
equaled $177.4 million (or $1,419 per bond) and the fair value of the notes equaled $183.8 million (or $1,470 per bond).
In addition to the holders right to redeem the notes if our common stock price is above the conversion price, the
holders also have the right to require Cimarex to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a repurchase price equal to
100% of the principal amount (plus accrued interest) on December 15, 2008, 2013 and 2018.   The indenture
agreement also provides Cimarex with an option to redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount (plus accrued interest) anytime after December 22, 2008.
All long-term debt is guaranteed by Cimarex and all of its subsidiaries, except Canvasback.  Total assets held by
Canvasback equal $1.6 million.
33
On February 18, 2005, Magnum Hunter’s 40% owned subsidiary, Apple Tree Holdings, LLC (“Apple Tree”), entered
into a $20.6 million construction loan agreement (“Construction Loan”).  The Construction Loan provides financing for
the construction of a processing plant, natural gas lateral, carbon dioxide line and related infrastructure in Huerfano
County, Colorado.  The Construction Loan bears interest at either LIBOR plus 2.25% or a base rate plus 1.25% and
will mature no later than July 31, 2006.  Total borrowings under this loan at September 30, 2005 were $14.3 million, of
which our share was $5.7 million.   We have provided a guarantee to the lender for this Construction Loan.  In return
for our guarantee, we received an up-front fee as well as the right to receive 55% of distributable cash flows from
Apple Tree until certain financial tests are met.  In the event that the Construction Loan goes into default and we have
to perform under the guarantee, we will have recourse against the project and related subsidiaries.  We have included
$162 thousand in other liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet to represent the fair value of our
guarantee issued for the Construction Loan.

At September 30, 2005, we had a firm sales contract to deliver approximately 1.2 Bcf of natural gas over the next
eight months.  If this gas is not delivered, our financial commitment would be approximately $8.0 million.  This
commitment will fluctuate due to price volatility and actual volumes delivered.  However, we believe no financial
commitment will be due based on our reserves and current production levels.
Cimarex has other various delivery commitments in the normal course of business, none of which are individually
material.  In aggregate these commitments have a maximum amount that would be payable, if no gas is delivered, of
approximately $4.9 million.
All of the commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of our business.
Based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production, we believe that the estimated net cash
generated from operations, coupled with the cash on hand and amounts available under our existing line of credit will
be adequate to meet future liquidity needs, including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operations and
exploration and development activities.
34
2005 Outlook
Our projected 2005 exploration and development expenditure program of $575 million to $625 million will require a
great deal of coordination and effort.  Though there are a variety of factors that could curtail, delay or even cancel
some of our drilling operations, we believe our projected program has a high degree of occurrence.  The majority of
projects are in hand, drilling rigs are being scheduled, and the historical results of our drilling efforts in these areas
warrant pursuit of the projects.
Costs of operations on a per Mcfe basis for 2005 are estimated to approximate levels realized in 2004.  Should
factors beyond our control fluctuate, our program and realized costs will vary from current projections.  These factors
could include volatility in commodity prices, changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, weather conditions,
governmental regulations and more.
Production for the nine months of 2005 averaged 327.7 MMcfe per day. Fourth quarter estimates of production levels
range between 420 to 450 MMcfe per day. The revenues to be realized from the sale of this production will be
dependent not only on the level of oil and gas actually produced, but also the prices that will be realized from the
sales.  During 2005, the average price realized from our gas sales was $6.99 per Mcf and $54.40 per barrel from our
oil sales.  Current indications are that anticipated prices for 2005 will exceed 2004 levels.  Prices can be highly
volatile and the possibility of realized prices for 2005 to vary from current estimates is high.
ITEM 3.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Price Fluctuations
Our results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for oil and gas production, and those prices
are constantly changing in response to market forces.  Nearly all of our revenue is from the sale of oil and gas, so
these fluctuations, positive and negative, can have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
Monthly gas price realizations during the third quarter of 2005 ranged from $6.77 per Mcf to $9.58 per Mcf.  Oil prices
ranged from $55.43 per barrel to $61.81 per barrel, and for the nine months of 2005, monthly realized gas prices
ranged from $5.95 per Mcf to $9.58 per Mcf, with realized monthly oil prices for the period ranging from $45.24 per
barrel to $61.81 per barrel. It is impossible to predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty.
SFAS No.133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging activities, requires that all derivatives be recorded
on the balance sheet at fair value.  We generally determine the fair value of futures contracts and swap contracts
based on the difference between the derivative’s fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the
determination date.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges are
recorded as an expense. In connection with the Magnum Hunter merger, Cimarex recognized a $39.3 million net
liability associated with Magnum Hunter’s existing commodity derivatives at the merger date (June 7, 2005).  These
derivative instruments have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment.  As a result, Cimarex recognized in
earnings during the third quarter a net loss of $82 million.  This charge includes both non-cash mark-to-market
derivative losses as well as cash settlements.  Cash payments related to these contracts that settled in the third
quarter totaled $15.6 million.  The net derivative liability at September 30, 2005 equals $106.5 million. Actual gains
and losses to be recognized in the future may differ materially, arising from movements in the prices of oil and natural
gas.  Cimarex will continue to recognize gains and losses in future earnings until the derivative instruments mature. 
Actual gains and losses to be recognized may differ materially from current fair value estimates.

The weighted average NYMEX prices at September 30 for fourth quarter 2005 approximate $14.09 per Mcf of gas and
$66.33 per barrel of oil.  Weighted average NYMEX prices at September 30, 2005 for the year 2006 approximate
$11.71 per Mcf of gas and $66.83 per barrel of oil.
Any sustained weakness in prices may affect our financial condition and results of operations, and may also reduce
the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically.  Any reduction in reserves, including
reductions due to price fluctuations, can have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and
development activities and could cause us to record a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties.

Interest Rate Risk
Fixed and Variable Rate Debt.  Cimarex assumed fixed and variable rate debt as part of the acquisition
of Magnum Hunter.  These agreements expose the company to market risk related to changes in
interest rates.
The following table presents the carrying and fair value of the company’s debt along with average interest rates as of
September 30, 2005.  Fair values are calculated as the net present value of the expected cash flows of the financial
instruments, except for the fixed rate Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes, which are valued at their last traded
value before September 30, 2005.

The average interest rate on the Facility is 4.46%.
The interest rate on the convertible notes is 3.87%. The rate on these notes is equal to the three month
LIBOR, adjusted quarterly. A holder of these notes has the right to require us to repurchase all or a
portion of these notes on December 15, 2008, 2013, and 2018. The repurchase will be equal to the face
value of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of repurchase. Included in Paid in
Capital is $49.6 million related to the fair value of common stock associated with the convertible debt.
The interest rate on the senior notes due 2012 is a fixed 9.6%.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Cimarex’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the
effectiveness of Cimarex’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e)) (Disclosure Controls Evaluation) and concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that all material information required to be filed in this
quarterly report has been made known to them in a timely fashion. The required information was effectively recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time period necessary to prepare this quarterly report. Cimarex’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in Cimarex’s
reports under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
37
events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that
each registrant’s controls will succeed in achieving their intended result.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Cimarex management considers the acquisition of Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc. on June 7, 2005, to be material to
the results of operations, financial position and cash flows from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2005
and considers the internal controls and procedures of Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc. to have a material affect on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Management is currently executing post merger integration plans
which include converting accounting information systems and ongoing internal control evaluation.  Cimarex intends to
extend its Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 compliance program to include Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc. and its
subsidiaries with an effective date no later than March 31, 2006.
Except as set forth above, we have identified no other significant changes in Cimarex’s internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the Company’s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  As a result, no corrective actions were required or
undertaken.
