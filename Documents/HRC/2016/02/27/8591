<p><b>  Operational Guidelines on the protection of persons in situations of 
Natural Disasters</b>&#8727; 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Operational Guidelines on the Protection of Persons in Situations of Natural 
Disasters, (revised) were developed in response to a need for more practical guidance on 
the application and protection of the human rights of persons affected by situations of 
natural disaster.  The Operational Guidelines aim primarily to support international and 
non- government humanitarian organisations in their efforts to ensure that disaster relief 
and recovery efforts are conducted within a framework that protects and furthers the human 
rights of affected persons. This includes ensuring that human rights principles are 
integrated into disaster response from the earliest stages, and that measures are taken to 
facilitate the consultation and participation of affected persons and communities in relevant 
processes and decisions. They may also be useful for governmental actors, in particular 
disaster management institutions, which are primarily responsible for providing protection 
and humanitarian assistance to affected persons. 
</p>
<p> The Operational Guidelines detail the key principles which should guide 
humanitarian action in the context of natural disasters, and complements them with a 
number of possible activities and concrete examples on how the principles can be 
implemented in practice. Activities in situations of natural disasters should aim, <i>inter alia</i>, 
at preventing or stopping harm, ensuring that affected persons have access to relevant 
goods, services and opportunities, ensuring that they can claim their rights and avoiding or 
combating discrimination.

</p>
<p> For ease of reference, the Operational Guidelines are divided into four sets of rights 
including: rights related to protection of life and physical security; rights related to the 
essentials of life such as food, shelter, education, and health; rights related to housing, land, 
property and livelihoods; and civil and political rights such as freedom of movement, and 
expression. 
</p>
<p> These Operational Guidelines merge and improve the original Guidelines developed 
in 2006 by the Representative of the Secretary-General on the Human Rights of Internally 
Displaced persons, and the accompanying Manual developed in 2008. These revised 
Guidelines also draw on input received from field operations of humanitarian agencies as 
well as the feedback gathered in a series of workshops conducted in various regions of the 
world, and which were attended by some 300 Government officials, humanitarian 
organizations and other actors. They were developed in the context of the mandate&#8217;s 
mainstreaming activities, and have been endorsed by the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee.

<p><b>Part I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. How do natural disasters affect human rights? 
</b></p>
<p>1. Natural disasters1 are traditionally seen as situations creating challenges mainly 
related to the provision of humanitarian assistance. Less attention has been devoted to the 
need for human rights protection in this particular context. 
</p>
<p>2. In particular, the tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes, which hit parts of Asia and 
the Americas in 2004 and 2005, as well as the Haiti earthquake of 2010, highlighted the 
fact that affected persons may face multiple human rights challenges in the aftermath of 
natural disasters, such as: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of safety and security (e.g. rampant crime, secondary impacts of natural 
disasters, etc.); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Gender-based violence; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Unequal access to assistance, basic goods and services and discrimination in aid 
provision; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Abuse, neglect and exploitation of children; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Family separation, particularly for children, older persons, persons with disabilities 
and other individuals who may rely on family support for their survival; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Loss/destruction of personal documentation and difficulties to replace it, in 
particular due to inadequate birth registration mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Inadequate law enforcement mechanisms and restricted access to a fair and efficient 
justice system; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of ineffective feedback and complaint mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Unequal access to employment and livelihood opportunities; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Forced relocation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Unsafe or involuntary return or resettlement of persons displaced by the disaster; or 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of property restitution and access to land. 
</p>
<p>3. Experience has shown that, while patterns of discrimination and disregard for human 
rights may already emerge during the emergency phase of a disaster, the longer the effects 
of the disaster last, the greater the risk of human rights violations becomes. Experience has 
also shown that pre-existing vulnerabilities and patterns of discrimination usually become 
exacerbated in situations of natural disasters. 
</p>
<p>4. Particularly at risk are those among the affected populations who are forced to leave 
their homes or places of habitual residence because of the disaster and who, as a result, 
become internally displaced persons2 and should be treated in accordance with the 1998 
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>5. Often, negative impacts on the human rights concerns after a natural disaster do not 
arise from purposeful policies but are the result of inadequate planning and disaster 
preparedness, inappropriate policies and measures to respond to the disasters, or simple 
neglect. 
</p>
<p>6. As stated by the Secretary General &quot;(...) the risks and potential for disasters 
associated with natural hazards are largely shaped by the prevailing levels of vulnerability 
and the effectiveness of measures taken to prevent, mitigate and prepare for disasters.&quot;3 
</p>
<p>7. These challenges could be mitigated or avoided altogether if the relevant human 
rights guarantees were taken into account by national and international actors, in all phases 
of the disaster response: preparedness, relief and recovery. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Why does a human rights based approach help protect persons in 
situations of natural disasters? 
</b></p>
<p>8. A protection perspective can bring a strategic dimension to humanitarian assistance 
programmes, namely one of promoting and securing the fulfilment of human rights. 
Experience shows that assistance cannot simply be assumed to be a neutral activity 
affecting everyone equally and in a positive way. The manner in which assistance is 
delivered, used and appropriated, as well as the context in which it is taking place, has an 
important impact on whether the needs and human rights of affected persons are being 
respected or fulfilled. A human rights-based approach provides the framework, and 
necessary standards for humanitarian assistance activities. It grounds the basis for 
humanitarian action in universal principles, such as human dignity and non-discrimination, 
as well as a set of universally accepted human rights. Those affected by the disaster thus 
become individual rights holders who can claim rights from particular duty bearers rather 
than simply being passive beneficiaries and recipients of charity. 
</p>
<p>9. In addition, a human rights-based approach can enhance the protection value of 
assistance activities: If, e.g., authorities provide women and children with sufficient food 
and adequate housing in a secure environment without discrimination, these persons are 
less exposed to the risks of sexual exploitation, child labour and violence than they would 
be if they were excluded from such assistance. 
</p>
<p>10. If humanitarian assistance is not based on a human rights framework, it risks having 
too narrow a focus, and not all the basic needs of the victims will be integrated into a 
holistic planning and delivery process. Factors that are important to recovery later on may 
also be overlooked. Furthermore, people affected by natural disasters do not live in a legal 
vacuum. They belong to the population of countries that have ratified international and 
regional human rights instruments and enacted constitutions, laws, rules and institutions 
that should protect these rights. Therefore, States are directly responsible for respecting, 
protecting and fulfilling the human rights of their citizens and other persons under their 
jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>11. Thus, human rights remain important as norms underpinning humanitarian work in 
natural disasters. Despite the existence of national disaster management laws in many 
countries and certain international provisions on specific aspects of disaster response, 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Report of the Secretary General to the General Assembly &quot;On international cooperation on 
</p>
<p>humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development&quot;, A/60/227 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>human rights law provides an important and comprehensive international legal framework 
to guide humanitarian response activities.4 
</p>
<p>12. Most international &#8211; and many national &#8211; humanitarian organizations, while not 
directly bound by international human rights treaties, accept that human rights should 
underpin their actions. In the interest of the affected people, they should ensure that these 
rights are respected and protected &#8211; even beyond the strict wording of their mandates &#8211; and, 
at a minimum, refrain from promoting, actively participating in, or in any other manner 
endorsing policies or activities, which do or can lead to human rights violations by States. 
</p>
<p>13. The challenge often is how to apply human rights in an operational context, given 
the many potential humanitarian and human rights dilemmas arising in situations of natural 
disasters, among other challenges. At the operational level, a human rights framework helps 
to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Identify relevant needs and interests of affected persons :</i>  
Example: Human rights law provides for the freedom of movement and the right to 
choose one&#8217;s place of residence, thus protecting internally displaced persons&#8217; choice 
to return to their homes or settle elsewhere in the country. Human rights law in 
contrast does not provide for a right to credit, thus leaving it to a large extent to the 
discretion of agencies and authorities whether or not to set up a micro-credit 
program for affected persons. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Identify rights holders and duty bearers</i>:  
Examples: (1) According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, children are 
entitled to have their best interests given paramount consideration and are therefore 
right-holders. (2) According to many human rights conventions, the State as the 
main duty bearer has a duty to provide police protection in camps and collective 
centres. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Identify the limitations of what people can demand</i>:  
Example: As the freedom of movement is not an absolute right, forced evacuations 
or relocations are permissible in certain exceptional cases (see below guidelines 
A.1.4 and D.2.4). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Ensure that humanitarian action meets human rights standards</i>:  
Example: The human rights standard that food, shelter or health services must be 
accessible for persons with special needs requires for example to organize 
humanitarian action in a way addressing the specific access problems of female 
headed households, older people, persons with disabilities or others with particular 
vulnerabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. What is protection? 
</b></p>
<p><b>  A definition 
</b></p>
<p>14. According to the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) protection is defined as: 
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&#8230;all activities aimed at obtaining full respect for the rights of the individual in  
</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>  
 4 In the context of natural disasters, international humanitarian law as a branch of law applicable in 
</p>
<p>situations of armed conflicts is not applicable in natural disaster settings unless in an armed conflict 
civilians under the control of a party to the conflict are affected. This exceptional situation is not 
addressed in these Operational Guidelines. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><i>accordance with the letter and the spirit of the relevant bodies of law (i.e. HR law, IHL, 
refugee law)&#8221;.5</i> 
</p>
<p>15. Such activities can be <i>responsive</i>, i.e. aiming to prevent imminent or stop on-going 
violations, <i>remedial</i>, i.e. aiming to provide redress (e.g. access to justice, reparation or 
rehabilitation) for past violations, or <i>environment-building</i>, i.e. aiming at creating the 
necessary legal and institutional framework, capacity and awareness that is necessary to 
promote respect for human rights and prevent future violations.6 
</p>
<p><b>  Protection actors and their obligations 
</b></p>
<p>16. This definition of protection has to be seen in the context of fourfold obligations that 
international human rights law imposes on States to <i>respect</i> human rights, i.e. to refrain 
from actively violating them; to <i>protect</i> such rights, i.e. to intervene and take protective 
action on behalf of the victim against threats by others or stemming from a situation; to 
<i>fulfil</i> them, i.e. to provide goods and services necessary to allow people to fully enjoy their 
rights; and to discharge these obligations <i>without discrimination</i>. 
</p>
<p>17. In a temporal perspective, these duties mean that States have, in particular: (a) to 
<i>prevent</i> <i>violations</i> of human rights from occurring or from re-occurring; (b) to <i>stop</i> <i>them</i> 
while they are happening by making sure that State organs and authorities respect the rights 
concerned and protect victims against threats by third parties or stemming from situations 
including natural disasters; and (c) to <i>ensure reparation and full rehabilitation</i> once a 
violation has happened. 
</p>
<p>18. Where the capacity and/or willingness of the authorities to fulfil their responsibilities 
is/are insufficient, the international community plays an important role in supporting and 
complementing the efforts of the State. The scope and complexity of many natural disasters 
call for the active involvement of organizations both within and outside the UN system 
which possess special expertise and resources. 
</p>
<p>19. Humanitarian and development actors are committed to respect human rights 
guarantees, in particular civil and political rights, a commitment embodied in the principle 
of &#8220;do no harm&#8221;7. They also play an important role in fulfilling especially economic, social 
and cultural rights by providing humanitarian assistance including food, water and 
sanitation, shelter, health services and education. However, distributing humanitarian goods 
and providing humanitarian services, while greatly contributing to the enjoyment of human 
rights by affected persons, are not as such protection activities. They become so insofar as 
they specifically aim at preventing future, stopping on-going and redressing past violations 
of such rights. 
</p>
<p>20. Thus, the concept of protection in the context of humanitarian action can be 
understood as the role humanitarian and (in the context of recovery) development actors 
play with regard to ensuring that the rights of affected persons under international human 
rights law are respected, protected and fulfilled without discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>  Protection in practice 
</b></p>
<p>21. Protection is about securing human rights. To make this abstract notion more 
tangible, it is useful to draw from the experience that key protection challenges typically 
</p>
<p>  
 5 IASC IDP Protection Policy 1999. The definition was originally adopted by a 1999 Workshop of the 
</p>
<p>International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Protection.

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>consist of situations where people are harmed or neglected, where access to available 
humanitarian goods and services is curtailed, where people whose rights are disregarded or 
have been violated do not have the possibility or are impeded from asserting these rights, 
and where they face discrimination. For practical purposes, protection activities can be 
classified in the following way: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Harm</b>: Activities addressing (past, present or future) harm inflicted on or caused by 
neglect of people in contravention of human rights guarantees. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Lack of access</b>: Activities aimed at ensuring that people in need have access to 
goods and services protected by human rights such as adequate food, water and 
sanitation, shelter, health services, education, etc., and that obstacles impeding or 
hindering access are removed. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Incapacity and obstacles to claim one&#8217;s rights</b>: Activities aimed at ensuring that 
people can exercise their rights themselves and assert them in case of violations, as 
well as activities strengthening their capacities in this respect, in particular in cases 
of: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of information, consultation and participation regarding decisions 
affecting the persons concerned and their rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of documentation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of effective remedies against violations, including access to courts and 
reparation for violations of their rights; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lack of accountability for violations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Discrimination</b>: Activities aimed at ensuring that people are not singled out for 
harm, denied access, unable to assert their rights, or otherwise disadvantaged on the 
basis of their race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national 
or social origin, property, disability, birth, age or other status, i.e. discriminated 
against. 
</p>
<p>22. What exactly such protection activities are comprised of depends to a large degree 
on the actual circumstances and the opportunities as well as the constraints. However, 
protection tools typically comprise the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Monitoring</b> of situations and identification of relevant protection issues; 
prioritization of protection activities on the basis of needs; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Advocacy</b> with relevant stakeholders (confidentially or publicly); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Capacity building</b> of relevant stakeholders as well as affected persons and 
communities; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Direct protection delivery</b> for affected persons, e.g. transportation of persons who 
want to evacuate from disaster-affected areas; lighting of water points and sanitation 
areas in camps and collective centres to prevent or reduce instances of gender-based 
violence; provision of legal aid to victims of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> D. What are the purpose and scope of these Operational Guidelines? 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Audience and purpose  
</b></p>
<p>23. These Operational Guidelines primarily aim to help international and non-
governmental humanitarian organizations, members of the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee, to ensure that disaster relief and recovery efforts are conducted within a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>framework that protects and furthers human rights of affected persons. Specifically, they 
aim to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that human rights principles and protection standards &#8211; including the 
fundamental principle of non-discrimination &#8211; are integrated into all disaster 
response and recovery efforts from the earliest stage possible; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identify relevant measures to ensure that affected persons and their communities are 
fully consulted and can actively participate, to the extent possible, in all stages of the 
disaster response in accordance with their human rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Complement (but not replace) existing guidelines on humanitarian standards in 
situations of natural disasters; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Provide a basis for humanitarian actors when entering into dialogue with 
governments about their obligations towards affected people under human rights 
law. 
</p>
<p>24. The Operational Guidelines may also be useful for those governmental actors, in 
particular disaster management institutions, who are primarily responsible for providing 
protection and humanitarian assistance to affected persons. Furthermore, they may also 
inform national laws and policies. 
</p>
<p>25. These Operation Guidelines may also be useful for civil society in countries affected 
by natural disasters. 
</p>
<p><b>  Scope 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Operational Guidelines cover response and recovery in situations of natural 
disasters. While they do not deal with preparedness and risk reduction as such, references to 
possible measures for preparedness are included where appropriate. Furthermore, these 
Guidelines can be used for inserting protection issues in disaster preparedness policies and 
strategies, namely at national and regional levels, through promotion of training activities 
and capacity building of entities involved in the disaster management as well as human 
rights activities; improvement of legal and institutional frameworks; and contingency plans. 
</p>
<p>27. The Operational Guidelines spell out key principles which should guide 
humanitarian action in situations of natural disasters and are accompanied by possible 
activities, which are concrete and real-life examples of how the key principles could be 
implemented in a given context. Indicated activities are illustrative, <i>not exhaustive</i> and 
therefore do not replace more detailed guidance as referenced in Appendix III. Activities 
included in these Guidelines aim at: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Preventing or stopping <i>harm</i>; or 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that affected persons have <i>access</i> to relevant goods, services and 
opportunities; or 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that affected persons can <i>claim their rights</i>; or  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Avoiding or combating <i>discrimination</i>. 
</p>
<p>28. The Operational Guidelines are informed by and draw on relevant international 
human rights law, existing standards and policies pertaining to humanitarian action, and 
human rights guidelines on humanitarian standards in situations of natural disaster.8 
</p>
<p>  
 8 The Guidelines are based on the full spectrum of the universal human rights instruments, as far as 
</p>
<p>appropriate, as well as on relevant regional human rights conventions and other standards, such as the 
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Sphere Project&#8217;s Humanitarian Charter and 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>However, the Operational Guidelines do not list the rights of persons as enshrined in 
international law. Rather, they focus on what operational standards humanitarian actors 
may be guided by in order to implement a rights-based approach to humanitarian action in 
the context of natural disasters.9 While these Guidelines have been drafted with the 
consequences of quick-onset natural disasters in mind, most of them are also relevant in 
preparation for or after other kinds of disasters, such as slow-onset disasters. 
</p>
<p><b>  Structure 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Guidelines first set out some general principles. For practical reasons, the 
presentation of key principles relevant for the protection of the human rights of affected 
persons is divided into four chapters, namely: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protection of rights related to <i>protection of life; security and physical integrity; and 
the protection of family ties in the context of evacuations</i>. These guarantees are civil 
and political rights10 particularly relevant already during and immediately after the 
disaster occurs. Some of them, in particular the right to security and physical 
integrity remain important throughout the disaster response, e.g. in the context of 
gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protection of rights related to the provision of <i>food; health; shelter; and education</i>. 
These social rights11 help to ensure that survivors of the disaster receive life-saving 
humanitarian assistance, particularly during the emergency phase and, to the extent 
necessary, also at later stages. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protection of rights related to <i>housing, land and property; and livelihoods</i>. These are 
economic, social and cultural rights that start becoming particularly relevant once 
the emergency phase is over and recovery efforts commence. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Protection of rights related to documentation, free movement in the context of 
durable solutions for internally displaced persons; re-establishment of family ties, 
expression and opinion; and elections. These are civil and political rights that may 
become more important the longer the recovery phase lasts. 
</p>
<p>30. Thus, users may limit themselves to consult categories A and B during the 
immediate emergency phase and turn to C and D at a later stage. However, only the full 
respect of all rights mentioned in these chapters can ensure adequate protection of the 
human rights of those affected by natural disasters. All human rights are universal, 
indivisible and interdependent and interrelated.12 The structure of these Guidelines thus 
does not suggest any hierarchy among relevant rights but rather helps to quickly identify 
those rights that are primarily relevant during a given phase of a disaster. 
</p>
<p>  
Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (the Sphere Handbook), and the IFRC Code of Conduct. 
The Operational Guidelines should be seen as complementing these standards and policies and 
interpreted so as to be consistent with them. 
</p>
<p> 9 Currently the UN&#8217;s International Law Commission is in the process of preparing standards addressing 
additional State responsibilities in the context of natural disaster relief, which run parallel to the 
immediate need of the humanitarian agencies for guidance. 
</p>
<p> 10 At the international level, these rights are primarily enshrined in the 1966 International Covenant on

<p><b>  Operational Guidelines on the protection of persons in 
situations of Natural Disasters</b>13<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. General principles 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General guarantees for persons affected by natural disasters 
</b></p>
<p><i>I.1. Persons affected by natural disasters (affected persons) should be recognized and 
treated as persons entitled to enjoy the same rights and freedoms under international 
human rights law as others in their country and to not be discriminated against on the basis 
of their race, colour, sex, disability, language, religion, political and other opinion, 
national or social origin, property, birth, age or other status. Targeted measures to address 
specific assistance and protection needs of women and children and particular categories 
of affected populations, including but not limited to older persons, persons with disabilities, 
persons living with HIV/AIDS, single heads of households and child-headed households, 
internally displaced persons or members of ethnic or religious communities and indigenous 
peoples, do not constitute discrimination if, and to the extent that, they are based on 
differing needs. 
</i></p>
<p><i>I.2. Persons affected by a natural disaster or facing an imminent risk of being affected 
should be provided with easily accessible information in a language they understand 
concerning: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>The nature and level of disaster they are facing; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>The possible disaster risk and vulnerability reduction measures that can be taken; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Ongoing or planned humanitarian assistance, recovery efforts and their respective 
entitlements; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Their rights under international and domestic law. 
</i></p>
<p><i>I.3. Affected persons<b> </b>should be informed and consulted on measures taken on their 
behalf and given the opportunity to take charge of their own affairs to the maximum extent 
and as early as possible. They should be able to participate in the planning and 
implementation of the various stages of the disaster response. Targeted measures should be 
taken to include those who are traditionally marginalized from participation in decision-
making. 
</i></p>
<p><i>I.4. Affected persons should be entitled to and supported in claiming and exercising 
their rights and provided with effective remedies, including unimpeded access to the justice 
system, in case of violations. 
</i></p>
<p><i>I.5. In all decisions and actions concerning children, the best interest of the child should 
be a primary consideration. 
</i></p>
<p><i>I.6. Persons who have been ordered or forced to flee or to leave their homes or places of 
habitual residence or who have been evacuated as a result of a natural disaster or its 
effects, or were obliged or forced to leave in order to avoid them, and have not crossed an 
internationally recognized State border are internally displaced persons in accordance

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><i>with the 1998 Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and should be treated 
accordingly. 
</i></p>
<p><i>I.7. The human rights of the affected persons and the impact of humanitarian activities 
on these rights should be regularly monitored. To this effect existing monitoring 
mechanisms should be strengthened or new mechanisms established. Monitors should be 
given access to areas where humanitarian operations take place as well as to all affected 
persons. 
</i></p>
<p><i>I.8. Protection activities should be undertaken and prioritized on the basis of identified 
needs of affected persons. Such needs should be identified and assessed on the basis of non-
discriminatory and objective criteria, and in consultation with the affected population. 
Collected data should be disaggregated by age and gender. 
</i></p>
<p><i>I.9. Protection activities should be carried out in a manner that respects the cultural 
sensitivities prevailing in areas affected by the disaster, providing that they do not 
contravene existing international human rights standards. 
</i></p>
<p><b> B. Role of States and other actors contributing to the humanitarian 
response 
</b></p>
<p><i>II.1. States have the primary duty and responsibility to provide assistance and protection 
to persons affected by natural disasters. In doing so, they are obliged to respect the human 
rights of affected persons and to protect them from violations of their rights by private 
actors (e.g. individuals and groups committing crimes) as well as from dangers arising 
from the disaster (e.g. secondary impacts of natural disasters). 
</i></p>
<p><i>II.2. International humanitarian organizations and agencies and non-governmental 
organizations contributing to the humanitarian response: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Offer their services in support of persons affected by natural disasters and in need of 
protection and humanitarian assistance when and to the extent that the authorities 
concerned are unable or unwilling to provide the required humanitarian assistance. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Accept that human rights underpin humanitarian action. In situations of natural 
disasters they should therefore respect the human rights of persons affected by 
disasters at all times and advocate for their promotion and protection to the fullest 
extent. Such organizations should not promote, actively participate in, or in any 
other manner endorse policies or activities leading or likely to lead to human rights 
violations or abuses. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Are guided by these Operational Guidelines in their activities, in particular when 
monitoring and assessing the situation and needs of affected persons, when 
planning, programming and implementing their own activities as well as when 
entering into a dialogue with governmental authorities on the State&#8217;s duties and 
responsibilities vis-&#224;-vis affected persons under international law, and supporting 
their activities. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Carry out their activities in accordance with the principles of humanity, 
independence, impartiality and neutrality. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Remain accountable to all relevant stakeholders, including to the affected persons. 
</i></p>
<p><i>II.3. All relevant humanitarian actors should ensure coordination of their protection 
activities among themselves and with national and local authorities while respecting and 
taking into account respective mandates. </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13

risks in disaster response. 
</p>
<p><i>A.4.5. If the natural disaster occurs in a region of armed conflict, appropriate preventive 
measures should immediately be taken or already existing measures reinforced to protect 
children affected by the natural disaster against recruitment and use by armed forces or 
armed groups, including by local defense forces, in line with international standards and 
procedures (see Appendix III). 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Organizing awareness-raising campaigns on the risks of child recruitment by armed 
forces and armed groups and their use in armed conflict, as well as on the fact that 
recruiting or using them to participate actively in hostilities may amount to war 
crimes.

disaster-affected areas, with appropriate referral mechanisms, and conduct capacity 
building as required. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring children who flee from the disaster affected country to another country to 
escape recruitment or use by armed forces or groups can effectively exercise their 
right to seek asylum. Confirm that the refugee determination takes into account the 
particular forms of persecution experienced by boys and girls, including recruitment 
or deployment in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Systematic monitoring of the occurrence and trends of recruitment and use of 
children by armed forces and armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> A.5. Security in host families and communities, or in collective shelters: 
</b></p>
<p><i>A.5.1. Appropriate monitoring and ombuds-mechanisms should be put into place when

the gender and age composition of the population (see also A.4.1 above). 
</p>
<p><i>A.5.3. Once the immediate emergency phase is over, camps or collective centres set up by 
armed forces or groups should be managed by civilian authorities or organizations. The 
role of police and security forces should be limited to providing security. 
</i></p>
<p><b> A.6. Dealing with mortal remains 
</b></p>
<p><i>A.6.1. The mortal remains of those deceased should be collected and identified, to prevent 
their despoliation or mutilation, and to facilitate the return of the remains to the next of kin. 
</i></p>
<p><i>A.6.2. If remains cannot be returned &#8211; for example, when the next of kin cannot be 
identified or contacted &#8211; they should be disposed of in a manner which will facilitate their 
future recovery and identification. Cremation of unidentified bodies should be avoided. 
Instead, they should be stored or buried temporarily, pending future identification and 
return to families. 
</i></p>
<p><i>A.6.3. Local religious and cultural practices and beliefs on the disposal of bodies should 
be taken into account from the outset. Such disposals should be conducted in a manner that 
respects the dignity and privacy of the dead and of their family members. Measures should 
be taken to protect funerary sites and monuments from desecration or disturbance. 
</i></p>
<p><i>A.6.4. Family members should be fully informed about the location of grave sites or places 
where the bodies have been disposed of, and should have full access to them. They should 
be given the opportunity to recover the human remains for reburial or cremation according 
to their own religious and cultural beliefs and practices, as well as to erect memorials and 
conduct religious ceremonies as needed.

the identification process, in order to facilitate the identification of the dead. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that the bodies are numbered and photographed and details of the deceased 
(e.g. clothes) are identified or recorded before mass burials or other forms of 
disposal are undertaken. In addition to photographs, personal effects and documents 
of the deceased, methods of forensic human identification that are based on 
matching ante-mortem data (AMD) of the deceased with post-mortem data (PMD) 
obtained from the remains (e.g. fingerprints, dental records, unique medical traits, 
general physical characteristics, DNA, etc.) may be used. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In cases of mass disposal: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Carrying out a public information campaign to inform affected communities 
in a language and manner they understand about the procedures for 
identifying the bodies. The information provided should, in particular, 
indicate where photographic and other documentation of the dead can be 
viewed, where personal effects and documents are being kept, and where 
forensic examinations are being carried out.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Putting in place emergency legal and administrative measures to issue death 
certificates expeditiously, if and when requested by surviving relatives, to 
allow families to resolve legal and civil matters related to the disappearance

<p><b>  Group B. 
Protection of rights related to the provision of food, health, shelter and 
education 
</b></p>
<p><b> B.1. Access to and provision of humanitarian goods and services &#8211; general principles 
</b></p>
<p><i>B.1.1. Humanitarian goods and services should be provided on the basis of assessed needs, 
without any distinction of any kind other than that of differing needs and without any 
discrimination as to race, colour, sex, language, disability, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, age, or other status. All affected persons 
should have safe, unimpeded and non-discriminatory access to goods and services 
necessary to respond to their basic needs. Specific measures such as priority access or 
separate distribution systems should be taken to the extent necessary to ensure that persons 
with specific needs have adequate access to humanitarian goods and services. 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Use of proven assessment tools that include all categories of persons with special 
needs and allow objective identification of needs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Specific monitoring whether persons with special needs, older persons, persons with 
disabilities, sick persons or female-headed households with infants and young 
children have equal access to food, water, health and other humanitarian services 
and, if not, giving them priority access, or setting up separate distribution 
points/separate hours for distribution of goods and for services, etc. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Systematic inclusion of female-headed households, unaccompanied children, older 
persons, persons with disabilities and other persons with special needs in the 
distribution of humanitarian goods. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Securing distribution points against rioters or others ready to use violence. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Monitoring of risks for beneficiaries after distributions. </p>

<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p><i>  Preparedness measures: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Preparation of assessment tools prior to the disaster. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Analysis of safety routes and sites for distribution; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Planning for particular distribution means for people with specific needs. 
</p>
<p><i>B.1.2. Humanitarian goods and services provided to affected persons should be adequate. 
Adequacy of such goods and services requires that they are (i) available, (ii) accessible, 
(iii) acceptable, and (iv) adaptable: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Availability means that these goods and services are provided to the affected 
population in sufficient quantity and quality. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Accessibility requires that these goods and services (a) are provided to all according 
to their needs and without discrimination, (b) are within safe reach and can be 
physically accessed by everyone, including persons with specific needs, and (c) are 
known to the beneficiaries. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Acceptability refers to the requirement that goods and services provided are 
respectful of the culture of individuals, minorities, peoples and communities, and 
sensitive to gender and age requirements. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Adaptability requires that these goods and services be provided in ways flexible 
enough to adapt to the change of needs in the different phases of emergency relief, 
recovery and, in the case of internally displaced persons, return, local integration or 
settlement elsewhere in the country. 
</p>
<p><i>Actors contributing to the humanitarian response should strive to achieve all elements of 
these criteria as soon as feasible. During the immediate emergency phase, food, water and 
sanitation, shelter, clothing, and health services are considered adequate if they respond to 
what is needed for survival and meet internationally recognized standards (see Appendix 
III). 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regarding availability: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Using pre-positioned food and non-food items in disaster-prone areas. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring, to the extent possible, that quantities (e.g. of food) and 
specifications (e.g. size of tents or cooking pots) correspond to people&#8217;s 
differing needs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regarding accessibility without discrimination: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identifying as soon as possible persons and groups with a history of being 
discriminated against prior to the disaster, or with special needs, and 
monitoring ongoing humanitarian action to avoid that they are discriminated 
against and intervene if this happens. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Involving members of the affected populations, including those with 
particular needs, in the humanitarian response, for example in distribution of 
food and non-food items. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Monitoring and intervening in cases where affected persons have to pay 
bribes or exchange sex for humanitarian goods and services.

clothing : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are culturally acceptable to affected persons, particularly if they are members 
of indigenous peoples or belong to particular ethnic or religious communities. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Correspond to the specific needs of older persons, pregnant and lactating 
mothers, infants, persons with disabilities, sick persons, and others with 
special needs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regarding adaptability: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that food, water and sanitation, non-food items, shelter, health and 
other services meet minimum standards in the emergency phase, improve 
once the emergency phase is over and are adapted to changing needs over 
time. 
</p>
<p><i>  Preparedness measures: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Mapping of cultural needs in terms of food, shelter, clothing, etc. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Use of disaggregated data to gauge what the needs will be in terms of age, gender, 
disabilities or chronic illnesses or other factors. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Pre-positioning of goods &#8211; also to more remote areas. 
</p>
<p><i>B.1.3. In case of displacement caused by the disaster, the specific needs of internally 
displaced persons as well as the needs that host communities experience as a consequence 
of the influx of such persons should be addressed on the basis of non-discriminatory and 
objective criteria when providing humanitarian assistance. 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing humanitarian assistance to persons from among the host community who 
have the same or similar needs as the internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Using a community-based approach to strengthen the absorption capacities and 
resilience of host communities as needed, e.g. through provision of additional water 
and sanitation facilities, enhancement of school and health services to the 
community, school feeding to strengthen the nutritional basis of the community, 
provision of building materials for host families to enlarge dwellings, or cash grants 
for internally displaced persons staying with host families. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing for analysis, assessment and awareness-raising among humanitarian actors 
of potential ethnic, political or other tensions between displaced communities, or 
between displaced and host communities, and ensuring that this analysis is 
incorporated into planning the response. 
</p>
<p><i>  Preparedness measures: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Anticipate the needs that host communities experience as a consequence of the 
influx of internally displaced persons.

limit women&#8217;s mobility in public spaces. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Identification and monitoring of cases of discrimination against women or men in 
the distribution of and access to goods and services by their communities and 
families and raising such cases with community leaders and heads of family. 
</p>
<p><b> B.2. Provision of specific goods, such as adequate food, water and sanitation, shelter, 
clothing; essential health services, and education 
</b></p>
<p><i>B.2.1. The <b>right to food</b> should be respected and protected. It should be understood as the 
right to have physical and affordable access without discrimination to adequate food in 
sufficient quantities or the means for its procurement. Food related interventions should be 
planned accordingly. 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring the maximum participation of affected communities, in particular women, 
in the planning, design and implementation of food distribution activities, e.g. by 
organizing focus group discussions, and using community organizers to identify 
women representatives. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that persons with specific needs &#8211; e.g. unaccompanied children, older 
persons, persons with disabilities in need of support or persons living with long-term 
or chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS who have lost their caregivers during the 
disaster  &#8211;  have unimpeded access to food. In particular: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Clear and accessible information for all beneficiaries, including those with 
special needs, about the frequency, timing and quantity of food distributions 
and what quantities will be supplied. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Direct distribution of food to women or unaccompanied children if, 
traditionally, women and children receive less than men in times of scarcity 
or if there is a risk that food may be diverted for other purposes. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Distribution and assistance in a way that avoids the need for older persons, 
persons living with HIV/AIDS or other particular illnesses, pregnant women, 
persons with disabilities, and unaccompanied children to stand in line for 
long periods of time, or to carry heavy loads from the distribution point to 
their dwellings (portioning of food bags so that they can be carried by such 
persons). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Linking persons with specific needs to support families for the joint 
preparation of meals when these persons are unable to do so themselves. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Incorporating strategies to prevent sexual violence in food and nutrition 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Including food items into deliveries that correspond to the specific needs of pregnant 
and lactating mothers, infants, children, older people or persons living with long-
term or chronic illnesses. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that the food distributed, whether cooked meals or dry rations, meets 
international nutritional standards and is culturally acceptable to the population. If it </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>is available, food to which the affected persons are accustomed should be provided. 
Cultural food practices should be included into initial rapid assessments. 
</p>
<p><i>B.2.2. The <b>right to water and sanitation</b> should be respected and protected. It should be 
understood as the right to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable 
water for personal and domestic use without discrimination. Water and sanitation related 
interventions should be planned accordingly. At a minimum, safe water should be provided 
in a quantity that is necessary to prevent dehydration; and to provide for consumption, 
cooking, and personal and hygienic requirements necessary for a life in dignity. 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that in temporary camps and collective shelters as well as permanent 
relocation sites, there are adequate water and sanitation facilities, including water 
pumps, toilets and bathing facilities: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are accessible to persons with disabilities and older persons and are easy to 
use. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are safe, e.g. because there is sufficient lighting at night.

for men and women and for single-parent households. 
</p>
<p><i>See also measures suggested under A.4 for the protection against gender-based violence. 
</i></p>
<p><i>B.2.3. The <b>right to shelter</b> should be respected and protected. It should be understood as 
the right to have an accommodation allowing persons to live there in security, peace and 
dignity. Shelter related interventions should be planned accordingly. Camps and collective 
centres should be a last resort and should only be established when, and as long as, the 
possibility of host family arrangements, self-sustainability, or rapid rehabilitation does not</i> 
<i>exist. Where collective shelters exist, the following principles should be respected: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Affected persons should be allowed to move freely in and out of camps and 
collective centres. Such movement should not be restricted or prohibited unless it is 
necessary for the protection of the security or health of the residents, or that of the 
population in the vicinity. If there are restrictions, they should not remain in force 
any longer than absolutely necessary. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In order to maintain their civilian character at all times, the presence of armed 
elements in camps and collective centers should not be tolerated, unless where 
necessary to provide security through armed guards or police. Where armed 
elements are present, they should be separated from the civilian population. Should 
they be members of families resident in such camps and centres, they should not be 
allowed to bring arms or wear uniforms or distinguishing insignia in such locations. 
</p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; As regards internally displaced persons, giving priority to living arrangements with 
host families (supported by cash for shelter programs, or provision of non-food 
items including building materials to expand dwellings, if appropriate), or, in 
consultation with relevant local authorities, the use of community or unused 
buildings, or allowing the displaced offset up informal but adequate accommodation 
on public land. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Creating specific areas where women, whether alone or with children, feel safe and 
secure.

</p>
<p><i>B.2.4. Internally displaced persons should be allowed to occupy unused private property, 
land and possessions only if they do not have access to alternative accommodation and no 
longer than absolutely necessary. Owners of affected private property should be adequately 
compensated for such use. Due process guarantees and access to fair and impartial legal 
procedures should be assured for all parties. 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establishing objective criteria and official mechanisms to allocate unused public or 
private property, land and possessions to internally displaced persons for temporary

<p><i>  Preparedness measures: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Clear understanding of property issues in areas that are prone to disasters: Who are 
the owners? What is public or communal land? What categories of property and 
ownership exist? Who can take decisions if owners are not present or represented? 
</p>
<p><i>B.2.5. The <b>right to health</b> should be respected and protected. It should be understood as 
the right to timely and appropriate, accessible, culturally acceptable and gender sensitive 
health care without discrimination as well as to the underlying determinants of health (such 
as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe 
food, nutrition and housing), healthy occupational and environmental conditions, and 
access to health-related education and information, including on sexual and reproductive 
health. Health interventions should be planned accordingly. In particular, special attention 
should be given:

<p>&#8226; Organizing assistance in a manner that avoids incentives to separate families in the 
hope of better assistance benefits. In particular distributing food- and non-food items 
in quantities appropriate for large families<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing access to education in areas where internally displaced persons leave. </p>

</p>
<p><i>  Preparedness measures: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Foresee family sizes when preparing relief and contingency planning. 
</p>
<p><i>D.3.2. Affected persons should be assisted in learning about the fate and whereabouts of 
missing relatives. The next of kin should be informed on the progress of the investigation 
and results obtained through the use of tracing services or mechanisms. The reunification 
of families, should they so desire, should be facilitated, particularly when children or older 
persons are involved. 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establishing rapid family tracing and reunification procedures from the onset of the 
emergency and identifying a lead agency or organisation responsible for family 
tracing and reunification. In most instances this would be the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or national Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Societies. Promoting coordination with the lead agency and setting up of compatible 
systems and formats for transmitting copies of registration details and tracing 
requests to the lead agency or organisation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Conducting comprehensive census or registration exercises to determine the persons 
who are looking for missing relatives or friends in the disaster as well as the exact 
numbers, age and gender of missing persons. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Collecting all available photographic and video records to assist families who are 
searching for missing relatives. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Developing public communication strategies to disseminate information about 
separated family members with due regard to the protection of sensitive personal 
data, in particular relating to unaccompanied children and their whereabouts. These 
could include: posting photos on bulletin boards; camp and community meetings; 
TV and radio broadcasts and newspaper advertisements; preparing tracing bulletins 
or leaflets with photos of family members for wide circulation; or the distribution of 
cell-phones to receive text messages. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Using a wide variety of tracing methods. In addition to the above strategies, these 
may include: interviewing adults who have lost children; taking children to locations 
they have described; and organizing family messaging services in a language and 
manner that is understood by the affected populations. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Once family members have been identified, reunifying families to the extent desired 
by the family as smoothly and efficiently as possible, avoiding unnecessary 
bureaucratic delays and obstacles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In the case of children, ensuring that family relationships are valid and that the child 
and family members have given their consent before proceeding with reunification is 
essential. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Providing psycho-social and material support to reunified families as necessary, as 
well as to family members that are still separated. 
</p>
<p><i>D.3.3. Separated and unaccompanied children should be taken care of until they can be 
reunited with their families. All interim care arrangements should be in the best interest of 
the child. Children should be kept fully informed about interim care arrangements and their 
rights, and their opinions regarding caretakers should be taken into consideration. Siblings 
should be kept together when arranging for interim care. </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/43/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Conducting rapid assessments in the immediate aftermath of the disaster to identify 
the number of separated and unaccompanied children and their specific needs, and to 
assess existing care arrangements. Details about unaccompanied and separated 
children should be included in registration exercises. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establishing rapid registration, family tracing and reunification procedures from the 
onset of the emergency to reunite separated and unaccompanied children with family 
members. Emphasis should be placed on triaging cases to facilitate appropriate and 
timely action on a case by case basis. Particular attention should be placed on 
identifying child-headed households, as well as separated or unaccompanied 
children who may already have been subjected to a grave violation (e.g. recruitment, 
abduction, gender-based violence). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Including questions relevant for identifying unaccompanied and separated children 
in other registration exercises. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring appropriate documentation, care and tracking of separated and 
unaccompanied children who are medically evacuated. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Where no surviving family members can be traced, making arrangements for 
separated and unaccompanied children to be cared for by friends or neighbours from 
their own community whenever possible, taking into consideration children&#8217;s 
preferences for caretakers. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Conducting regular and close monitoring and review of interim care arrangements to 
ensure that separated and unaccompanied children are well cared for and protected 
from all forms of physical, psychological and sexual abuse and exploitation. 
Children should be interviewed in private to allow them to reveal incidents of abuse. 
Immediate action should be taken to remove children from abusive or exploitative 
interim care situations and to find alternative solutions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Avoiding the placement of separated or unaccompanied children in orphanages or 
children&#8217;s homes. Such placement, if necessary, should only be used as a temporary 
measure while more sustainable, community-based solutions are sought, or as a last 
resort when all other options have been exhausted. Careful monitoring and record-
keeping of each individual case regarding the placement of children is critical. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that separated and unaccompanied children are provided with necessary 
documentation in their names, including registration, personal identity, birth 
certificates, health, education, and land ownership. Establishment of rapid 
documentation procedures. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that separated and unaccompanied children have equal access to the 
material, financial and legal assistance to which they are entitled in the aftermath of 
a disaster. In particular, separated and unaccompanied children, or their legal 
guardians, should be provided with the possibility to claim government benefits for 
dead, missing or injured family members; resettlement and housing allowances; land 
entitlements and compensation. 
</p>
<p><i>D.3.4. Adoption should only be envisaged once it has been established that all efforts with 
regard to tracing and family reunification have failed, or that the parents have consented to 
the adoption in conformity with the standards set up in the Hague Adoption Convention.</i>19 </p>

<p><i>The consent of parents and the consent of other persons, institutions and authorities that 
are necessary for adoption must be free and informed. Priority should be given to adoption 
by relatives in their country of residence. Where this is not an option, preference should be 
given to adoption within the community from which the child came or at least within his or 
her own culture. 
</i></p>
<p><i>  Preparedness measures: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Establishment of legal or administrative procedures to formalize interim care 
arrangements within the community, including foster care, and to provide additional 
material, financial and social support as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Pre-identification of alternative arrangements either with host families or 
institutions, as well as pre-identification of monitoring mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> D.4. Expression, assembly and association, and religion 
</b></p>
<p><i>D.4.1. Affected persons and communities should be allowed and enabled to give feedback 
and raise complaints or grievances on the disaster relief and recovery response. They 
should be protected against adverse reaction to such expression of their opinion. 
Opportunities should be provided for affected persons to conduct peaceful assemblies or to 
form associations for this purpose. 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
&#8226; Establishing mechanisms and building capacity to enable affected persons including 
</p>
<p>women, children and youth as well as members of marginalized or minority groups 
to voice their concerns and opinions regarding the relief and recovery efforts. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establishing specific mechanisms to monitor, to report on and to investigate 
incidents where the rights of individuals to freedom of thought, expression and 
assembly are curtailed and where individuals are punished or ill-treated for the 
exercise of these fundamental rights. Ensuring appropriate action by law 
enforcement bodies in such cases. 
</p>
<p><i>D.4.2. Religious beliefs and cultural traditions should be respected to the extent possible, 
when planning and implementing humanitarian assistance, in particular in the context of 
food assistance, health care services, and living and sanitary arrangements. 
</i></p>
<p>Amongst others the following activities can be considered: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consulting with religious leaders and elders on religious and cultural traditions and 
beliefs that need to be respected to the extent possible during the humanitarian 
response. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Avoiding inclusion of culturally non-acceptable food- and non-food items into 
distribution packages<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring that arrangements and provision of services are gender-sensitive where the 
genders are traditionally separated. 
</p>
<p><i>D.4.3. Affected persons should be allowed and provided with opportunities for the exercise 
of their religious faith and cultural traditions in a manner that respects the rights and 
beliefs of others and does not incite discrimination, hostility or violence.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Glossary 
</b></p>
<p>For the purposes of the Operational Guidelines the following terms are used: 
</p>
<p><i>  Actors contributing to the humanitarian response: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Intergovernmental and (international or national/local) non-governmental 
organizations and agencies or governmental or para-governmental disaster 
responders providing protection and assistance to affected persons during and after 
the emergency phase. 
</p>
<p><i>  Affected persons: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Those who suffer the negative consequences of a particular disaster, whether they 
are displaced or not, for instance if they have sustained injuries, loss of property and 
livelihoods and other damages due to the disaster. 
</p>
<p><i>  Camps: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Newly erected sites with non-permanent shelters (e.g. tents) used for the collective 
and communal accommodation of evacuated/displaced persons in the event of a 
disaster. Camps can be planned (i.e. purposely-built sites, completed before or 
during the influx) or self-settled (i.e. set up spontaneously without the support of the 
government or the humanitarian community). Camps are a type of collective shelter 
(see below). 
</p>
<p><i>  Collective centres: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Pre-existing buildings and structures used for the collective and communal non-
permanent accommodation of evacuated/displaced persons in the event of a disaster. 
Types of buildings and structures used as evacuation centres vary widely. They 
include schools, hotels, community centres, town halls, hotels, sport infrastructures, 
hospitals, religious monuments, police posts, military barracks, warehouses, disused 
factories, and unfinished buildings, etc. Collective centres are a type of collective 
shelter (see below). 
</p>
<p><i>  Collective shelters: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Camps and collective centres as defined above. 
</p>
<p><i>  Disaster: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society causing 
widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the 
ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.20

</b></p>
<p><i>  Disaster/Emergency management: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Organization and management of resources and responsibilities for addressing all 
aspects of an emergency, in particular preparedness, response and initial recovery 
steps.21 
</p>
<p><i>  Discrimination: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Disadvantageous distinctions that are based on race, colour, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, age, disability or 
other status of a person. To advantage someone on the basis of objective and serious 
reasons (e.g. particular vulnerability; specific needs not shared by others) rather than 
these criteria does not amount to discrimination even if the person concerned 
possesses them. 
</p>
<p><i>  Displacement affected communities: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Communities that bear the negative consequences of displacement, either because 
they have to flee or leave their homes and places of habitual residence themselves, 
or because they have had to host internally displaced persons, or because they have 
to receive and integrate formerly displaced persons who return to their homes and 
places of habitual residence or settle permanently elsewhere in the country. 
</p>
<p><i>  Durable solutions: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; In the context of internal displacement, a situation where internally displaced 
persons no longer have any specific assistance and protection needs that are linked 
to their displacement and can enjoy their human rights without discrimination on 
account of their displacement. It can be achieved through: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sustainable reintegration at the place of origin (hereinafter referred to as 
&#8220;return&#8221;); 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sustainable local integration in areas where internally displacement persons 
take refuge (local integration); or 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sustainable integration in another part of the country (settlement elsewhere in 
the country). This can be applied to disaster affected persons as well. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; According to international standards (the right to liberty of movement and freedom 
to choose one&#8217;s place of residence; the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement) 
all solutions must be voluntary, i.e. based on an informed decision and free choice 
by the persons concerned. 
</p>
<p><i>  Evacuation: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Facilitation or organization of transfer of individuals or groups from one 
area/locality to another in order to ensure their security, safety and well-being.&#8221;22 
Evacuations are forced if they are ordered and/or enforced by authorities. A forced 
evacuation is not considered arbitrary or unlawful and thus permissible if it is done 
in accordance with the law, absolutely necessary under the circumstances, to protect 
life, health or the physical integrity of the affected persons, and to the extent the 
emergency allows, in proper consultation with the affected population.

<p><i>  Evacuation centres: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Collective shelters (see above) used for temporarily accommodating evacuated 
persons. 
</p>
<p><i>  Eviction (forced): 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; The permanent or temporary removal of individuals, families and/or communities 
against their will from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the 
provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection.23 The 
notion of forced evictions does not apply to evictions carried out both in accordance 
with the law and in conformity with the provisions of international human rights 
treaties.24 Forced eviction does not automatically mean arbitrary displacement, but 
can be the first step leading to it. 
</p>
<p><i>  Family reunification 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;The process of bringing together families, particularly children and older 
dependants, with their family or previous care-provider for the purpose of 
establishing or re-establishing long-term care.&#8221;25

</i></p>
<p>&#8226; See &#8220;Eviction (forced)&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><i>  Gender Based Violence (GBV)  
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Violence &#8220;that is directed against a person on the basis of their gender or sex, 
including acts that inflict physical, mental or sexual harm or suffering, threats of 
such acts, coercion and other arbitrary deprivation of liberty. It includes physical, 
sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned within the family, the 
general community or by the State and its institutions&#8221;.26 
</p>
<p><i>  Host community 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; A community that hosts considerable numbers of internally displaced persons, 
typically in camps, collective centres, informal settlements or directly integrated into 
households.27 </p>
<p><i>  Internally displaced persons: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave

internationally recognised border.&#8221;28 
</p>
<p><i>  Livelihoods 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;The combination of the resources used and the activities undertaken in order to 
live. The resources might consist of individual skills and abilities (human capital), 
land, savings and equipment (natural, financial and physical capital, respectively), 
and formal support groups or informal networks that assist in the activities being 
undertaken (social capital).&#8221;29 
</p>
<p><i>  Natural disaster: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;Disasters&#8221; (see above) that are caused by sudden-onset natural hazards. The term 
&#8220;natural&#8221; disaster is used for ease although the magnitude of the consequences of 
sudden natural hazards is a direct result of the way individuals and societies relate to 
threats originating from natural hazards. The magnitude of the consequences is, 
therefore determined by human action, or the lack thereof. The Operational 
Guidelines are written with sudden-onset disasters in mind, but they can also be 
applied to other kinds of disasters. 
</p>
<p><i>  Persons with specific needs 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Persons exposed to risks going beyond those of the general population because, 
among others, of their gender, age, health status, disability, belonging to a minority, 
particular social status, or indigenous origin, or internal displacement and other 
specific circumstances they find themselves in. 
</p>
<p><i>  Protection: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; A concept that encompasses all activities aimed at obtaining full respect for the 
rights of the individual in accordance with the letter and spirit of international 
human rights [and where applicable], refugee and humanitarian law. Protection 
involves creating an environment conducive to respect for human beings, preventing 
and/or alleviating the immediate effects of a specific pattern of abuse, and restoring 
dignified conditions of life through reparation, restitution and rehabilitation.30 
</p>
<p><i>  Relocation: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Temporary relocation: The act of moving evacuated people to a place where they 
stay until return or settlement elsewhere in the country becomes possible; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Permanent relocation: The act of moving people to another location in the country 
and settling them there when they no longer can return to their homes or place of 
habitual residence. Relocations can be voluntary, i.e. with the consent of affected 
persons, or forced, i.e. against the will of such persons. Relocation is only successful 
if it leads to a durable solution (see above) in the sense of sustainable settlement 
elsewhere in the country.

</p>
<p><i>  Reparation: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-
repetition for victims of human rights violations. Reparation is full and effective 
when it is proportional to the gravity of the violations and the harm suffered and 
victims have relevant information concerning reparation mechanisms and equal and 
effective access to them.31 
</p>
<p><i>  Secondary impacts of natural disasters: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; Secondary impacts of natural disasters can include natural or physical impacts such 
as landslides caused by heavy rainfall or seismic activity. They could also 
encompass impacts by the initial disaster on industrial installations and 
infrastructure, e.g. damage to hydro dams or damage to pipelines and chemical 
factories that may cause spills of hazardous materials which pose a threat to human 
health and lives. 
</p>
<p>  
 31 Arguably, under present international customary law, reparation is only due for gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations (See Principles and guidelines on the right to a remedy and reparation for victims of gross 
violations of international human rights law and serious violations of humanitarian law&#8217; 
A/Res/60/147, 21 March 2006). Obligations to provide reparation in less serious cases may flow from 
international human rights conventions. </p>
