<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, visited the United States of America from 
16 to 25 May 2007, during which he met with senior officials of the Government, members of 
Congress and their staff, academics and non-governmental organizations, as well as with the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The objective of the visit was to undertake a 
fact-finding exercise and a legal assessment of United States law and practice in the fight against 
terrorism, measured against international law. His visit also aimed at identifying and 
disseminating best practice in the countering of terrorism. 
</p>
<p> Chapter I of this report considers the role of the United States in countering terrorism, 
concluding that it has a special responsibility in the protection of human rights while countering 
terrorism. The Special Rapporteur identifies his visit to the United States as one step in the 
process of restoring its role as a positive example for respecting human rights, even in the 
context of the fight against terrorism. He also strongly encourages the United States to take a 
strong role in and give support for the United Nations led effort in countering terrorism and 
implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The Special Rapporteur 
concludes that the international fight against terrorism is not a &#8220;war&#8221; in the true sense of the 
word, and reminds the United States that even during an armed conflict triggering the application 
of international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply. He 
reiterates that international human rights law is also binding upon a State in respect of any 
person subject to its jurisdiction, even when it acts outside its territory. 
 Military detention facilities are considered in Chapter II. In the context of detainees at 
Guant&#225;namo Bay, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the categorization of detainees as 
&#8220;unlawful enemy combatants&#8221; is a term of convenience without legal effect. He expresses grave 
concern about the inability of detainees to seek full judicial review of determinations as to their 
combatant status, which amounts to non-compliance with the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights&#8217; prohibitions against arbitrary detention, the right to judicial review capable 
of ordering release, and the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. Noted also is the 
purported exclusion of habeas corpus rights under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. He 
urges continued and determined action towards the expressed wish of the United States to move 
towards closure of Guant&#225;namo Bay. The Special Rapporteur also reminds the United States and 
other States responsible for the detention of persons in Afghanistan and Iraq that these detainees 
also have the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time if suspected of a crime or, failing this, 
to release. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur considers, in chapter III, the use of military commissions to try 
terrorist suspects. He identifies jurisdictional problems regarding certain offences (terrorism, 
providing material support for terrorism, wrongfully aiding the enemy, spying, and conspiracy) 
which do not form part of the laws of war and, to the extent that applicable offence provisions 
were not in force at the time of the commission of conduct in respect of which detainees might 
be charged, involve the retrospective application of criminal law. He further notes that the 
Government&#8217;s justification for military commissions is incorrect as a matter of fact because 
ordinary courts martial have had the jurisdiction to try violations of the laws of armed conflict 
since 1916 under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and that the nexus between the events 
of 11 September and United States citizens would allow ordinary courts to try other offences </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p>such as conspiracy and terrorism. As to the composition and operation of military commissions, 
the Special Rapporteur next considers issues surrounding the independence of the commissions, 
their potential use to try civilians, and their lack of appearance of impartiality. He also addresses 
various matters concerning the use and availability of evidence in proceedings before military 
commissions, their ability to impose the death penalty, and the consequences of acquittal or 
completion of sentence following conviction. 
</p>
<p> Chapter IV first turns to the question of the interrogation of terrorist suspects, considering 
both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) programme of &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221; 
and interrogation methods outlined in the revised United States Army Field Manual. The Special 
Rapporteur addresses the &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221; of terrorist suspects, and their detention in 
&#8220;classified locations&#8221;, and the accountability of those responsible for conducting interrogation by 
techniques amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur considers, in chapters V and VI, issues relating to the definitions 
of terrorism under United States law, the alleged targeted killings of terrorist suspects by 
United States agents, the provision of compensation to victims of terrorism, profiling, 
community outreach, and immigration and refugee status. Privacy and surveillance are matters 
examined in chapter VII, including consideration of a programme of secret surveillance by the 
National Security Agency, authorized by an Executive Order of the President of the 
United States, and the use by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence services 
of National Security Letters to expedite access to private records. 
</p>
<p> Finally, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his conclusions and formulates recommendations 
for consideration by the Government. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/80, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism, Mr. Martin Scheinin, conducted an official visit to the United States of America 
from 16 to 25 May 2007, at the invitation of the Government.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur had meaningful meetings on a specialist level with the Department 
of State, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and Department of Justice. 
He also met with members of Congress and their staff, academics and non-governmental 
organizations, as well as with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. He travelled to 
Miami to observe a day of the trial against Jose Padilla and others. It was disappointing that 
the Special Rapporteur was not provided access to places of detention, including at 
Guant&#225;namo Bay, with guarantees permitting private interviews of detainees. It is a part of the 
Standard Terms of Reference of all United Nations Special Rapporteurs that any visits to 
detention centres involve unmonitored interviews with detained persons. This is a universally 
applied term of reference, which in many parts of the world is essential for the protection of 
individuals against abuse. It would give a wrong message to the world if the Special Rapporteur 
were to deviate from this standard condition in respect of the United States. The Special 
Rapporteur therefore hopes that he is able to visit the United States again for the purpose of 
visiting places of detention, including Guant&#225;namo Bay, prior to the consideration of this report 
by the Human Rights Council. Such a visit should also include observing military commission 
hearings at Guant&#225;namo Bay. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Role of the United States in countering terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>3. In a world community which has adopted global measures to counter terrorism, the 
United States is a leader. This position carries with it a special responsibility to also take 
leadership in the protection of human rights while countering terrorism. The example of the 
United States will have its followers, in good and in bad. The Special Rapporteur has a deep 
respect for the long traditions in the United States of respect for individual rights, the rule of law, 
and a strong level of judicial protection. Despite the existence of a tradition in the United States 
of respect for the rule of law, and the presence of self-correcting mechanisms under the 
United States Constitution, it is most regretful that a number of important mechanisms for the 
protection of rights have been removed or obfuscated under law and practice since the events 
of 11 September, including under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Detainee Treatment Act 
of 2005, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, and under Executive Orders and classified 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The Special Rapporteur conducted his mission assisted by the Office of the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights and Dr. Alex Conte of the University of Southampton. 
A draft mission report was sent to the Government on 28 June and extensive comments 
received on 2 August 2007. </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur saw his visit as one step in the process of restoring the role of the 
United States as a positive example for respecting human rights, including in the context of the 
fight against terrorism. He dismisses the perception that the United States has become an enemy 
of human rights. It is a country which still has a great deal to be proud of. 
</p>
<p>5. In September 2006, the General Assembly adopted the first-ever Global Counter-Terrorism 
Strategy. The Strategy treats human rights as a central part of all aspects of effective global 
action to counter international terrorism and seeks, in part, to enhance cooperation between the 
growing number of international and regional bodies, with often overlapping mandates, 
pertaining to counter-terrorism. The United States has been strategic in the establishment of an 
international counter-terrorism machinery, including the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the 
Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council. An effective and well 
coordinated United Nations led effort in countering terrorism will be one of the keys to the 
successful implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and the Special Rapporteur 
strongly encourages continued involvement in and support for this by the United States.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The framework of public international law 
</b></p>
<p>6. During high-level meetings with Government officials, it was repeated that the 
United States sees itself as being engaged in an armed conflict with Al-Qaida and the Taliban, 
commencing prior to the events of 11 September. This position has been reaffirmed by the 
President of the United States in his Executive Order of 20 July 2007.<b>3</b> The Department of 
Defense described this &#8220;war&#8221; as continuing until the capabilities of Al-Qaida are so degraded 
that their conduct can be dealt with through regular law enforcement mechanisms. The 
United States consequently identifies humanitarian law as the applicable international law to 
the apprehension, detention and trial of persons detained at Guant&#225;namo Bay. However, these 
statements do not suggest that any form of terrorism would amount to armed conflict or that the 
international fight against terrorism would as a whole be governed by the law of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur reminds the United States of the well-established principle that 
regardless of issues of classification, international human rights law continues to apply in armed 
conflict. This is a point made clear, for example, by the Human Rights Committee in its 
general comment No. 31, and confirmed by the International Court of Justice.<b>4</b> As further 
explained in its advisory opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
</i>

</p>
<p><i>Occupied Palestinian Territories</i>, the International Court stated that &#8220;&#8230; the protection offered 
by human rights conventions does not cease in case of armed conflict, save through the effect of 
provisions for derogation of the kind to be found in Article 4 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights&#8221;.<b>5</b> The conduct of the United States must therefore comply not only 
with international humanitarian law, but also with applicable international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>8. The Human Rights Committee and the International Court of Justice have confirmed as 
well that human rights, including those enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR), are legally binding upon a State when it acts outside its internationally 
recognized territory.<b>6</b> This means that the United States is obliged to respect and ensure the 
rights guaranteed by the Covenant binding upon it, such as the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and customary international law - including the 
absolute prohibition of torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment - to 
anyone within its power or effective control, even if not situated within the territory of the 
United States. The fact that the United States more than 50 years ago, when the ICCPR was 
being drafted, expressed that it could not be expected to &#8220;legislate&#8221; for occupied countries<b>7</b> was 
not meant as a justification to engage extraterritorially in outright human rights violations such 
as arbitrary detention, torture, or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur accepts that the United States was engaged in an international 
armed conflict from the commencement of &#8220;Operation Enduring Freedom&#8221;, proclaimed as an 
exercise of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, and until the fall 
of the Taliban regime as the de facto government of Afghanistan. He further accepts in principle 
that a non-State armed group, including one called a &#8220;terrorist organization&#8221;, if organized as an 
armed force, is capable of being engaged in a transborder armed conflict, albeit technically a

rights law and international humanitarian law to the armed conflict between the Congo and 
Uganda - see: <i>Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic 
Republic of the Congo v.</i> <i>Uganda), Merits </i>(2005), ICJ Rep. (paras. 216-220, and 345 (3)).

<b>7
</b>  As quoted in the combined second and third periodic reports of the United States under the 
</p>
<p>ICCPR, Eleanor Roosevelt, the then United States representative and Chairman of the 
Commission on Human Rights, defended the inclusion of the double requirement of territory and 
jurisdiction by stating that &#8220;without such an addition the draft Covenant might be construed as 
obliging the contracting States to enact legislation concerning persons, who although outside its 
territory were technically within its jurisdiction for certain purposes&#8221;: see Human Rights 
Committee, Consideration of Reports Submitted by States parties under article 40 of the 
Covenant: United States of America, CCPR/C/USA/3, annex I, &#8220;Territorial Application of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&#8221;. </p>

</p>
<p>non-international one (one which is not between two States). Furthermore, although some acts of 
terrorism may constitute a threat to international peace and security, this does not mean that any 
act of terrorism would amount to a threat to peace and security, or would create an armed 
conflict.<b>8</b> These matters must be determined separately and upon the particular circumstances of 
each case. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the reservations and declarations entered by the 
United States upon its ratification of the ICCPR and the Convention against Torture. Under 
international law, reservations that are contrary to the object and purpose of a treaty are 
impermissible. The relevant treaty bodies - the Human Rights Committee and the Committee 
against Torture - have in this context requested that the United States withdraw its reservations 
and declarations.<b>9</b> While supporting the competence of the respective treaty bodies to address the 
permissibility and legal effect of the reservations in question, the Special Rapporteur sees his 
own mandate as requiring him to address the law and practice of the United States with reference 
to international treaty standards, without making an assessment of whether its reservations and 
declarations are permissible. Further, many human rights norms are binding as customary law 
and even as peremptory norms of international law (jus cogens). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  MILITARY DETENTION FACILITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees as &#8220;unlawful enemy combatants&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>11. The persons detained at the military facility at Guant&#225;namo Bay have been categorized by 
the United States as alien &#8220;unlawful enemy combatants&#8221;, regardless of the circumstances of their 
capture. The adjective &#8220;unlawful&#8221; was used together with the noun &#8220;combatant&#8221; by Allan Rosas, 
in his treatise <i>The</i> <i>Legal Status of Prisoners of War</i> to describe persons who commit hostile acts 
in international conflicts without authorization to do so under the law of war.<b>10</b> &#8220;Unprivileged 
belligerent&#8221; would be a synonymous expression. While such persons may not be entitled to 
prisoner of war status, they nevertheless enjoy certain minimum protections in respect of 
detention and trial.<b>11</b> The Special Rapporteur wishes to make clear that the term &#8220;unlawful 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  In his separate opinion in <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
</i></p>
<p><i>Occupied Palestinian Territories, Advisory Opinion</i> (2004), ICJ Rep. 136, for example, 
Judge Kooijmans expressed doubt as to the accuracy of the Security Council&#8217;s description 
in resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) of acts of international terrorism as a threat to 
international peace and security, without further qualification: at 230 (para. 35).

</p>
<p>enemy combatant&#8221; is a description of convenience, meaningful only in international armed 
conflicts, and even then only denoting persons taking a direct part in hostilities while not being 
members of the regular armed forces or of assimilated units. 
</p>
<p>12. Privileged combatants apprehended during the course of an international armed conflict 
may be detained as prisoners of war and shall be released at the end of hostilities. This will 
however not be the case for persons who are held as persons suspected of war crimes. 
Furthermore, combatants in a non-international armed conflict may be held as security detainees 
for the duration of the hostilities, but also treated as criminal suspects for their use of violence. 
While acknowledging the need to ensure that there is no impunity for those who commit war 
crimes, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the chance of ensuring a fair trial diminishes 
over time. At the end of hostilities, persons captured during international or non-international 
armed conflict should be released, or tried if suspected of war crimes or other crimes. The 
Special Rapporteur considers that the detention of persons for a period of several years without 
charge fundamentally undermines the right of fair trial. The same conclusion applies, of course, 
to those detainees that never were engaged in an armed conflict. The right of persons to be tried 
without undue delay, as guaranteed by article 14, paragraph 3 (c), of the ICCPR is particularly 
relevant to this point, as the prolonged period of detention has placed the United States, by its 
own inaction, in a position of having to release many of these persons without charge. 
</p>
<p>13. There are serious concerns about the ability of detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay to seek a 
judicial determination of their status, and of their continuing detention. Upon the arrival of a 
detainee at Guant&#225;namo Bay, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) is convened to 
determine whether the detainee is an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; and whether that person should 
continue to be detained. This occurs once only, unless new evidence about the person&#8217;s status 
becomes available. Added to this, an Administrative Review Board (ARB) undertakes annual 
reviews of each detainee&#8217;s status to confirm whether continued detention is required. If a 
detainee declines to participate in proceedings before the ARB, he will be provided with the 
opportunity to be heard and to present information to the Review Board. When classified 
information is presented at such hearings, the detainee is excluded from proceedings.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>14. As confirmed by the Department of Defense, these are administrative processes rather than 
judicial ones. Detainees are not provided with a lawyer during the course of hearings. Even more 
problematic is the fact that the decisions of the CSRT and ARB are subject to limited judicial 
review only. The most that a reviewing court may do is to order reconsideration of a decision, 
not release. These restrictions result in non-compliance with the ICCPR, which prohibits 
arbitrary detention (art. 9 (1)), requires court review of any form of detention and entailing a 
possibility of release (art. 9 (4)), and provides a right to a fair trial within reasonable time for 
anyone held as a criminal suspect (arts. 9 (3) and 14 (3)). Article 9, paragraph 4, is also relevant 
to the removal of habeas corpus rights under section 7 of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, 
which purports to expressly deny the jurisdiction of ordinary courts to hear an application for 
habeas corpus. The Special Rapporteur reminds that according to the Human Rights Committee,

</p>
<p>article 9 (4) cannot be derogated from even during a state of emergency.<b>13</b> Hence, the right to 
judicial review of any form of detention does not depend on whether humanitarian law is also 
applicable. All Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees are entitled to this right, irrespective of whether they 
were involved in armed conflict or the status of proceedings against them. 
</p>
<p>15. Noting that persons brought to Guant&#225;namo Bay under the age of 15 have since been 
repatriated, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that this does not apply to all persons who were 
children at the material time of their alleged conduct. It is a matter of concern to the Special 
Rapporteur whether juvenile Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees have been segregated from adults and 
accorded treatment appropriate to their age and legal status in accordance with article 10, 
paragraphs 2 (b) and 3 of the Covenant, and that the Military Commissions Act does not, as it 
stands, make room for procedural adjustments that will take account of the age of juvenile 
defendants and the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation. Further, the Special Rapporteur 
received alarming reports that the young age of some of the detainees was only taken into 
account by applying interrogation methods that utilized their age-specific phobias and fears. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Closure of Guant&#225;namo Bay 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the announcement of the President of the 
United States that he wishes to move towards the closure of Guant&#225;namo Bay, and urges 
continued and determined action to that end. The Special Rapporteur has been advised that 
between 40 and 80 Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees are expected to be tried by military commissions, 
and that the United States wishes to return the remaining detainees to their countries of origin or, 
where necessary, to a surrogate country. He was advised that the Government is conducting 
negotiations with countries for this purpose. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur supports initiatives to return detainees to their countries of origin, 
but also concludes that although the United States has advised that it will not do so in breach of 
the principle of non-refoulement, the current United States standard applied under this principle 
fails to comply with international law. While international law (primarily ICCPR, article 7) 
requires that a person not be returned to a country where there is a &#8220;real risk&#8221; of torture, or any 
form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the United States applies a lower threshold of 
non-return only where it is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; that a person will be subject to torture as 
narrowly defined by the United States itself. The Special Rapporteur further underlines that 
diplomatic assurances sought from a receiving State to the effect that a person will not be 
subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment do not absolve the duty of the 
sending State to assess individually the existence of a &#8220;real risk&#8221;. Despite the fact that the 
United States has not yet abolished the death penalty, he emphasizes that the principle of 
non-refoulement is also applicable where a person is liable to the imposition of the death penalty 
in a jurisdiction where the standards of trial fall short of rigorous compliance with article 14 of 
the ICCPR on the right to a fair trial.<b>14</b> The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the United States 
has the primary responsibility to resettle any individuals among those detained in Guant&#225;namo 
Bay who are in need of international protection.

<p><b>C.  Detainees in Afghanistan and Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur is mindful of the fact that there are in Afghanistan some 700 and in 
Iraq around 18,000 persons detained under the control of the United States. Some of these 
detainees appear to be held for reasons related to the fight against terrorism, under a legal status 
analogous to that at Guant&#225;namo Bay. He reminds the United States and other States responsible 
for the detention of persons in Afghanistan and Iraq that these detainees also have a right to court 
review of the lawfulness of their detention. 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE USE OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS  
TO TRY TERRORIST SUSPECTS 
</b></p>
<p>19. By Military Order in 2001, the President of the United States established military 
commissions for the purpose of trying enemy combatants.<b>15</b> The Supreme Court ruled in 2006 
that military commissions established under the Military Order were unlawful, since they were 
not established under the express authority of Congress, and that the structure and procedures of 
the commissions violated both the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and 
the four Geneva Conventions.<b>16</b> Congress subsequently enacted the Military Commissions Act of 
2006 (MCA), which largely reflects the military commission structure under the 2001 Military 
Order. The establishment of military commissions is not restricted geographically, permitting 
any non-United States citizen, including those holding permanent resident status, to be subject to 
trial by military commission if designated as an enemy combatant. Various aspects relating to the 
jurisdiction and operation of military commissions raise significant human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Jurisdiction of military commissions 
</b></p>
<p>20. One of the principal reasons given by the Government for the establishment of military 
commissions rather than the use of ordinary courts has been that those courts would not have 
jurisdiction over certain crimes which some detainees are suspected to have committed. Three 
matters of concern are raised by this position. First, the MCA purports to be a piece of legislation 
which codifies the laws of war and establishes the jurisdiction of military commissions over war 
crimes. However, the offences listed in Section 950v (24)-(28) of the Act (terrorism, providing 
material support for terrorism, wrongfully aiding the enemy, spying, and conspiracy) go beyond 
offences under the laws of war. The establishment of these offences, and the way in which they 
are described, therefore means that the military commissions have been given jurisdiction over 
offences which do not in fact form part of the laws of war and thus, taken the indistinctive 
application of the notion of &#8220;unlawful enemy combatant&#8221;, may result in civilians being tried by 
military tribunals. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</i></p>

<p> A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>21. The second problem, concerning these same offences, is that to the extent they were not 
covered by the law applicable at the time of the commission of the actual acts, the military 
commissions will be applying criminal law retroactively, in breach of ICCPR, article 15, and 
universally acknowledged general principles of law. Finally, it appears that the Government&#8217;s 
justification for military commissions is incorrect as a matter of fact because the nexus between 
the events of 11 September and United States citizens would allow ordinary courts to try 
offences such as conspiracy and terrorism. This is borne out by the fact that the bombings of the 
United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 were prosecuted by ordinary 
United States courts, and that Osama bin Laden was indicted for his action in the attacks on the 
USS Cole by a Grand Jury in 2000. The ability of ordinary courts to hear charges of conspiracy 
and material support for terrorism is further borne out by the fact that those being prosecuted in 
<i>United States v. Padilla and others</i> in the District Court at Miami were charged with such 
offences.<b>17</b> In contrast, a suspected co-conspirator, who is an alien and currently detained at 
Guant&#225;namo Bay, is likely to face these charges before a military commission. 
</p>
<p>22. A separate matter concerning the jurisdiction of military commissions concerns 
determinations of the CSRT that a person is an &#8220;alien unlawful enemy combatant&#8221;. 
Section 948 (b) of the MCA specifically precludes military commissions from exercising 
jurisdiction over lawful enemy combatants, thus restricting the jurisdiction of these tribunals 
over unlawful enemy combatants. In a decision of the military commission, charges against 
Omar Khadr were dismissed without prejudice on the basis that determinations of the CSRT 
were separate to and insufficient for the purposes of proceedings before military commissions. 
This, combined with the fact that the MCA does not confer upon military commissions the 
ability to determine an accused person&#8217;s status, led the commission to conclude that it could not 
be satisfied that it had initial jurisdiction to try Mr. Khadr.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Composition of military commissions 
</b></p>
<p>23. As to the composition of military commissions, the Special Rapporteur has serious 
concerns about their independence and impartiality, their potential use to try civilians, and the 
lack of appearance of impartiality. As stated by the Human Rights Committee, the right to trial 
by an independent and impartial tribunal is so central to the due process of law that it is an 
absolute right that may suffer no exception.<b>19</b> In a long line of helpful jurisprudence on the 
</p>
<p>

</b>  <i>United States of America v. Adham Hassoun, Kifah Jayyousi, and Jose Padilla</i>, United States 
</p>
<p>District Court, Southern District of Florida, case No. 04-60001-CR-COOKE. On 16 August 2007 
a federal jury found Mr. Padilla and his co-defendants guilty as charged of conspiracy to commit 
illegal violent acts outside the United States, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists 
and providing material support to terrorists. The case is now pending appeal. 
<b>18
</b></p>
<p>  <i>United States of America v. Omar Ahmed Khadr</i>, Military Commission Order on Jurisdiction 
(4 June 2007). The Special Rapporteur is following further developments in this case. 
<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  See, for example, <i>Gonz&#225;lez del Rio v. Peru</i>, CCPR/C/46/D263/1987, para. 5.2. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>subject, the European Court of Human Rights has spoken of the need for a tribunal to be 
subjectively free of prejudice or personal bias, as well as having an appearance of impartiality 
from an objective viewpoint.<b>20</b> 
24. Whereas, in this regard, military judges in courts martial are appointed from a panel of 
judges by lottery, judges and members in a military commission are selected for each trial. 
Furthermore, although the current convening authority is a civilian and former judge, she is 
employed by the Department of Defense, so that, as a result, the appearance of impartial 
selection by the convening authority of members of individual commissions is undermined. 
Moreover, there is no prohibition against the selection of members of a commission who fall 
within the same chain of command; more junior members of a military commission, despite any 
advice to the contrary, may be directly or indirectly influenced in their consideration of the facts. 
</p>
<p>25. The ability of the convening authority to intervene in the conduct of trials before a military 
commission is also troubling. The plea agreement in the trial of David Hicks, for example, was 
negotiated between the convening authority and his counsel, without any reference to the 
prosecuting trial counsel. The involvement of the executive in such matters further adds to an 
appearance that military commissions are not independent. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Use and availability of evidence 
</b></p>
<p>26. The use and availability of evidence in proceedings before military commissions is also of 
concern to the Special Rapporteur. Certain evidence, due to its classified status, may not be 
disclosed to trial or defence counsel. This is problematic since such evidence may be exculpatory 
or otherwise beneficial to the defence case. Although this does not create an inequality of arms, 
since such evidence would not be provided to the prosecution, it has the potential to undermine 
the presumption of innocence. The protection given to classified information, while 
understandable, is of particular concern in the context of the security classification of 
interrogation techniques, as discussed below. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that although evidence which has been obtained by 
torture is categorically inadmissible, evidence obtained by other forms of coercion may, by 
determination of the military judge, be admitted into evidence. Three problems arise in this 
context. The first is that an accused may not be aware of the fact that evidence has been obtained 
by torture or coercion since the interrogation techniques used to obtain evidence subsequently 
presented at trial may themselves be classified and thereby outside the knowledge of the accused. 
A further problem is that the definition of torture for the purpose of proceedings before a military 
commission is restricted, not catching all forms of coercion that amount to torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment, equally prohibited in non-derogable terms by ICCPR article 7. 
The final issue of considerable concern is that the prohibition of admission of evidence obtained 
by torture is limited. Testimony obtained through abusive interrogation techniques that were 
used prior to the Detainee Act of 2005 may in fact be used if such evidence is found to be 
&#8220;reliable&#8221; and its use &#8220;in the interests of justice&#8221;. There may, however, be no circumstances in 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  See, for example, <i>Findlay v. United Kingdom</i>, [1997] ECHR 8, para. 75. </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>which the use of evidence obtained by torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment may be 
used for the purpose of trying and punishing a person. This is a clear and established principle of 
international law.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>28. This concern is further exacerbated by the preclusion of classified information and the fact 
that hearsay evidence may be admitted in proceedings before a military commission, in the form 
of a written summary of the evidence, if it is determined by the military judges to be &#8220;reliable&#8221; 
and &#8220;probative&#8221;. The admissibility of such evidence presents problems with the right to fair trial 
since it does not permit an accused to cross-examine the witness, and thereby undermines the 
guarantee to examine witnesses under ICCPR article 14, paragraph 3 (f). More importantly, if 
hearsay evidence was obtained through torture or coercion, and the interrogation techniques 
applied were themselves classified, an accused will never know whether the evidence was 
obtained by such methods and should therefore be challenged. It also means that if a military 
judge determines that hearsay evidence was obtained by coercion (rather than torture) but that 
the evidence should nevertheless be admitted, a federal judge would be unable to assess whether 
such a determination is valid, since the defence counsel would, owing to lack of knowledge of 
the circumstances by which the evidence was obtained, not be able to challenge such a decision. 
This means that a federal court judge would be unable to review a military judge&#8217;s determination 
of whether the hearsay evidence was obtained by torture or coercion and if the evidence is 
determined to have been obtained by coercion, whether it should have been admitted under the 
rules established under the Military Commissions Act. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Equality of arms 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at reports that the distribution of resources is such 
that military defence counsel are significantly under-resourced as compared to military trial 
counsel, i.e. the prosecuting party. The disproportionate aggregation of resources is a matter that 
strikes at the heart of the principle of the equality of arms required in the safeguarding of a fair 
trial. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Trial of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>30. In the case of persons who might be categorized by the United States as unlawful enemy 
combatants but who in fact were not involved as combatants in an armed conflict, the possibility 
arises that civilians be tried by a military commission. In its general comment No. 13, the 
Human Rights Committee emphasized that the trying of civilians by military courts should be 
very exceptional and should only take place under conditions which genuinely afford the full 
guarantees of a fair hearing stipulated in article 14.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>21
</b>  See, for example: article 15 of the Convention against Torture; and Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 7 (1982). 
<b>22
</b></p>
<p>  Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 13 (1984). For jurisprudence of the 
European Court of Human Rights on this point see, for example: <i>Ocalan v. Turkey</i> [2005] 
ECHR 282, (para. 115); and <i>Incal v. Turkey</i> [1998] ECHR 48, (para. 75). </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur is furthermore concerned at the ability of a military commission to 
determine charges in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed. It is well established 
that article 6 of the ICCPR requires that where a State seeks to impose the death penalty, it is 
obliged to ensure that fair trial rights under article 14 of the ICCPR are rigorously guaranteed.<b>23</b> 
Given that any appeal rights subsequent to conviction are limited to matters of law, coupled with 
the concerns pertaining to the lack of fair trial guarantees in proceedings before military 
commissions, the Special Rapporteur concludes that any imposition of the death penalty as a 
result of a conviction by a military commission is likely to be in violation of article 6. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Consequences of acquittal 
</b></p>
<p>32. Finally, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the acquittal of a person by a 
military commission or the completion of a term of imprisonment following conviction does not 
result in a right of release. This further undermines the principles of fair trial and would, if 
immediate release was not provided in an individual case, involve arbitrary detention in 
contravention of article 9 (1) of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. INTERROGATION, RENDITION, AND DETENTION IN  
SECRET LOCATIONS OF TERRORIST SUSPECTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  CIA programme of &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>33. As a result of an apparent internal leak from the CIA, the media in the United States 
learned and published information about &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221; used by the CIA in 
its interrogation of terrorist suspects and possibly other persons held because of their links with 
such suspects. Various sources have spoken of techniques involving physical and psychological 
means of coercion, including stress positions, extreme temperature changes, sleep deprivation, 
and &#8220;waterboarding&#8221; (means by which an interrogated person is made to feel as if drowning). 
With reference to the well-established practice of bodies such as the Human Rights Committee 
and the Committee against Torture, the Special Rapporteur concludes that these techniques 
involve conduct that amounts to a breach of the prohibition against torture and any form of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment. The Special Rapporteur notes that the United States 
understanding of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is what the United States Constitution 
prohibits as cruel and unusual punishment, not the relevant international standards as such. It is 
encouraging to see that the July 2007 Executive Order of the President now requires the Director 
of the CIA to ensure that interrogation practices are &#8220;safe for use&#8221;, based upon professional 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>23
</b>  See, for example, the views of the Human Rights Committee in <i>Hamilton v. Jamaica</i>, 
</p>
<p>communication No. 333/1989, <i>Reid v. Jamaica</i>, communication No. 353/1988, and <i>Champagnie 
and others v. Jamaica</i>, communication No. 445/1990. See also the Committee&#8217;s general 
comment No. 6 (1982). </p>

</p>
<p>advice, and that there is effective monitoring of the CIA interrogation programmes.<b>24</b> 
Nevertheless, the Executive Order retains the restrictive interpretations of &#8220;torture&#8221; and 
&#8220;cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment&#8221;.<b>25</b> The Special Rapporteur again reminds the 
United States that torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment are equally prohibited in 
non-derogable terms by ICCPR article 7. 
</p>
<p>34. In a meeting with the Special Rapporteur, the Acting General Counsel for the CIA refused 
to engage in any meaningful interaction aimed at clarifying the means of compliance with 
international standards of methods of interrogation and accountability in respect of possible 
abuses. Despite repeated requests on the part of the Special Rapporteur, the CIA did not make 
themselves available to meet again with him. In the light of this lack of cooperation and 
corroborating evidence from multiple sources, the Special Rapporteur can only conclude that the 
conduct of his country visit gives further support to the suspicion that the CIA had indeed been 
involved, and continued to be involved, in the use of enhanced interrogation techniques that 
violate international law. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  United States Army Field Manual 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the revision of the United States Army Field Manual in 
September 2006. Although this Manual clearly states that acts of violence or intimidation against 
detainees is prohibited, and that interrogation techniques must not expose a person to inhumane 
treatment, there are nevertheless aspects of the revised Manual (when compared to the earlier 
version) that cause concern. On the positive side, the revised Manual explicitly prohibits the use 
of waterboarding, something not expressly prohibited before. Nevertheless, a comparison of the 
two recent versions of the Army Field Manual could leave the impression that the present 
Manual neither authorizes nor prohibits, during the conduct of an interrogation, to slap a person 
being questioned, subject a person to extreme changes in temperature falling short of the medical 
state of hypothermia, isolate a detainee for prolonged periods, make use of stress positions, or 
subject a person to questioning for periods of up to 40 hours without sleep. The Special 
Rapporteur concludes that these techniques involve conduct that would amount to a breach of the 
prohibition against torture and any form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In order to 
remove any ambiguity, he expects the Government to make it clear that the enumeration of 
permitted interrogation techniques in the Manual is exhaustive.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Rendition and detention in &#8220;classified locations&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that there are various forms of rendition. The 
transfer of a person from one jurisdiction to another (or from the custody and control of one State 
to another) can occur by various means, including: rendition under established extradition rules; 
removal under immigration law; resettlement under refugee law; or &#8220;rendition to justice&#8221;, where 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  Executive Order of the President of the United States, <i>Interpretation of the Geneva 
</i></p>
<p><i>Conventions Common Article 3 as Applied to a Program of Detention and Interrogation 
Operated by the Central Intelligence Agency</i>, 20 July 2007, section 3 (b) (iii) and 3 (c) (iv). 
<b>25
</b></p>
<p>  Ibid., sections 2 (c) and section 3 (b) (i) (A). </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.3

</p>
<p>a person is outside formal extradition arrangements but is nevertheless handed to another State 
for the purpose of standing trial in that State. As long as there is full compliance with the 
obligation of non-refoulement, these mechanisms may be lawful, although it should be noted that 
the particular circumstances in which a person is &#8220;rendered to justice&#8221; may involve an unlawful 
detention. Impermissible under international law is the &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221; of a person to 
another State for the purpose of interrogation or detention without charge. Rendition in these 
circumstances also runs the risk of the detained person being made subject to torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment. Detention without charge or for prolonged periods even when 
charged, also amounts to a violation of articles 9 and 14 of the ICCPR and may constitute 
enforced disappearance. Furthermore, the removal of a person outside legally prescribed 
procedures amounts to an unlawful detention in violation of article 9 (1) of the ICCPR, and 
raises other human rights concerns if a detainee is not given a chance to challenge the transfer. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur is aware of various sources pointing to the rendition by the CIA of 
terrorist suspects or other persons to &#8220;classified locations&#8221; (also known as places of secret 
detention) and/or to a territory in which the detained person may be subjected to indefinite 
detention and/or interrogation techniques that amount to a violation of the prohibition against 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. These reports suggest that such interrogation 
techniques may have been used, either directly by CIA agents or by others while in CIA 
presence. The existence of classified locations was confirmed by the President of the 
United States on 6 September 2006, when he announced the transfer of 14 &#8220;high-value 
detainees&#8221; from these locations to Guant&#225;namo Bay. Although the President announced that at 
that time the CIA no longer held any persons in classified locations, he reserved the possibility of 
resuming this programme. Since then, one more &#8220;high-value detainee&#8221; has been transferred to 
Guant&#225;namo Bay, and the whereabouts of many others are unknown. 
</p>
<p>38. In addition, the use by the CIA of civil aircraft for the transportation of persons subjected 
to extraordinary rendition, whether by contract or by the establishment of airlines controlled by 
it, is in violation of the Convention on International Civil Aviation. Again due to the refusal of 
the Acting General Counsel for the CIA to engage in any meaningful interaction, and in the light 
of corroborating evidence, the Special Rapporteur concludes that his visit supports the 
suspicion that the CIA has been involved and continues to be involved in the extraordinary 
rendition of terrorism suspects and possibly other persons. This conclusion is corroborated by 
the recent findings of the Committee against Torture in the case of <i>Agiza v. Sweden</i> and by the 
Human Rights Committee in <i>Alzery v. Sweden</i>, in both of which Sweden was found to have 
violated its human rights treaty obligations by handing over Mr. Agiza and Mr. Alzery to 
CIA agents in the course of their rendition to Egypt.<b>26</b> The Special Rapporteur also 
concludes that it is unlikely that the CIA would be able to run a global programme of rendition 
and detention of terrorist suspects without at least logistical support by the United States military 
authorities.

<p><b>D. Accountability of those responsible for conducting  
interrogation by techniques amounting to torture  
or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Convention against Torture requires States parties to prevent, within their territory, 
any acts of torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.<b>27</b> By virtue of the extraterritorial 
application of the prohibition of such acts, considered earlier in this report, and the obligations 
under customary international law and Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter of the United Nations, 
States must also ensure that their officials do not undertake such practices overseas and that they 
are not complicit in such conduct by other persons.<b>28</b> It is thus essential that accountability is 
borne by those responsible (either directly, or by command responsibility) for conducting or 
colluding in interrogation techniques amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by reports indicating that while a number of 
military persons have been investigated or prosecuted for abuses, this has not happened in the 
case of CIA agents or persons higher up in the chain of command, and that the Department of 
Justice has not taken action to initiate prosecution in cases reported to it. 
</p>
<p><b>V. DEFINITIONS OF TERRORISM, TARGETED  
KILLINGS, AND VICTIMS OF TERRORISM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Definitions of terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>40. Terrorism is referred to within various items of United States legislation. Two particular 
aspects of this legislation are of concern to the Special Rapporteur. Title 18 of the US Code, in 
section 2331 (1), defines international terrorism as involving &#8220;violent acts or acts dangerous to 
human life&#8221; without making a link to the consequences intended by such acts. Security Council 
resolution 1566 (2004) describes conduct that is to be suppressed in the fight against terrorism 
and requires, as one of three cumulative elements, that such conduct is restricted to that which is 
committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury.<b>29</b> The definition of domestic 
terrorism, under section 2331 (5), equally lacks this link.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  Convention against Torture, articles 2, 4 and 16. 
</p>
<p><b>28
</b>  By virtue of Article 56 of the Charter, all members of the United Nations are obliged to take 
</p>
<p>joint and separate action in cooperation with the United Nations for the achievement of the 
purposes set out in Article 55 of the Charter, including the universal respect for, and observance 
of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, 
or religion (Article 55 (c)). 
<b>29
</b></p>
<p>  Security Council resolution 1566 (2004), para. 3. See, in this regard, the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism (E/CN.4/2006/98), chap. III. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>41. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is also of concern to the Special Rapporteur, which in its 
amendment of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) concerning persons &#8220;engaged in 
terrorist activities&#8221; includes the provision of material support to proscribed entities. While new 
section 212 (a) (3) (B) (iv) (VI) of the INA provides a list of forms of conduct that can amount to 
material support, the provision is expressed in terms that are not exclusive and thereby renders 
the expression &#8220;material support&#8221; too vague. This lack of precision is particularly problematic 
for communities, including Muslim ones, which are unable to determine whether the provision of 
funds by them to what they may believe are charities or humanitarian organizations abroad will 
be treated as material support to a terrorist entity. The Special Rapporteur observes that any 
determination of proscribed status of organizations, including purported charities, should be 
public, transparent, non-retroactive and reasoned. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Targeted killings 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, 
has reported on communications between himself and the United States concerning allegations 
of extrajudicial executions of various persons, including those suspected of having committed 
terrorist acts.<b>30</b> Such acts have occurred outside the territory of the United States and outside the 
context of actual hostilities related to an armed conflict. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that 
international human rights, including the rights to life and fair trial under articles 6 and 14 of 
ICCPR, apply extraterritorially to the conduct of State agents. He further emphasizes that while 
the targeting of a combatant directly participating in hostilities is permitted under the laws of 
war, there are no circumstances in which the targeting of any other person can be justified.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Victims of terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur is deeply mindful of the tragic events of 11 September 2001, as 
well as preceding acts of international terrorism against the United States, including the bombing 
of its Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He is also mindful of domestic acts of terrorism, 
including the Oklahoma City bombing. Addressing the situation of victims of terrorism with 
appropriate compensation and access to health care and rehabilitation is an important aspect of a 
comprehensive strategy against terrorism, and should be seen as a matter of best practice. The 
Special Rapporteur notes with encouragement the establishment, by the United States 
Government, of a process by which the victims of the terrorist attacks of 11 September have 
been able to seek compensation. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur notes with encouragement that following the catastrophic events in 
New Orleans in 2005, the Department of Homeland Security has taken steps to evaluate and 
consider the position of persons with disabilities and their care providers during relief efforts, 
which may also include events following a terrorist attack.

</p>
<p><b>VI. PROFILING, COMMUNITY OUTREACH, AND  
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE STATUS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Profiling 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur notes with encouragement, and as an element of best practice, that 
the Secretary of Homeland Security has clearly stated that his department is not, in law or 
practice, involved in racial or religious profiling. The Special Rapporteur nevertheless notes that 
the country of origin has been, or may be, used as a proxy for such profiling. It is a significant 
problem in certain regions of the world that the religious affiliation of persons is wrongly 
confused with the identification of such persons as potential terrorists.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Community outreach 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is very much encouraged by the initiation of community outreach 
programmes by various governmental agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security. 
Both at its own initiative, as well as in conjunction with civil society, the Department of 
Homeland Security has initiated a number of programmes aimed at creating a constructive 
dialogue with communities, including Muslims, and at explaining the Islamic faith and practice 
to members of the public and State employees. The alienation of segments of society, and the 
discriminatory treatment of groups in violation of their human rights, has been recognized by the 
international community as constituting conditions conducive to the emergence of terrorism or 
recruitment into terrorist organizations. The Special Rapporteur therefore identifies the efforts to 
reach out to the community as a best practice in the fight against terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Immigration and refugee status 
</b></p>
<p>47. There are a number of troubling developments in the law and practice of the United States 
concerning the treatment of immigrants, those applying for visas, and those claiming refugee 
status. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 amended provisions of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act, expanding the definition of terrorist activity beyond the bounds of conduct which is truly 
terrorist in nature, in particular in respect of the provision of &#8220;material support to terrorist 
organizations&#8221;. The definition captures, for example, the payment of a ransom to have a family 
member released by a terrorist organization, or the providing of funds to a charity organization 
which at the time was not classified as a terrorist organization. The PATRIOT Act provides for 
the mandatory detention of those suspected of such conduct and the refusal of refugee status for 
such persons. However, the Secretary of Homeland Security has announced a policy of &#8220;duress 
waiver&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by the lack of transparency and judicial remedies in 
the application of such a waiver to persons, some of whom may themselves be victims of 
terrorist conduct. 
</p>
<p>48. Furthermore, the REAL ID Act of 2005, an enactment which ostensibly aims to prevent 
the use of false identification and eliminate identity theft, contains provisions concerning 
the prevention of &#8220;terrorists&#8221; from obtaining relief from removal. The Act raises the 
threshold concerning the credibility of asylum claims, and modifies court review possibilities 
for asylum-seekers, which gives rise to concern regarding the general principle of 
providing a claimant with the benefit of the doubt as recommended by the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees and applied by many national jurisdictions in asylum cases. </p>

</p>
<p><b>VII.  PRIVACY AND SURVEILLANCE, AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Privacy and surveillance generally 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right of US 
citizens to privacy. International human rights law accommodates interference with privacy 
where necessary for legitimate purposes and implemented in a proportionate manner. In its 
1972 decision in <i>United States v. United States District Court</i>, the Supreme Court held that the 
Fourth Amendment prohibits the surveillance of &#8220;US persons&#8221; without a warrant, even if this 
surveillance is carried out for national security reasons.<b>31</b> Under United States law, the 
surveillance of &#8220;US persons&#8221; (citizens or permanent residents of the United States) can only 
occur when authorized by the Wiretap Act of 1968 or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
of 1978 (FISA). The PATRIOT Act of 2001 expanded the provisions of FISA so that 
applications for a surveillance warrant need only establish that foreign intelligence gathering is a 
significant purpose of the proposed surveillance rather than &#8220;the purpose&#8221; of surveillance, as 
previously required under FISA. This regime raises a number of concerns. Firstly, the low 
threshold in the availability of surveillance warrants leaves open the possibility for interference 
with privacy where this is not necessary for legitimate purposes. Next is the fact that the 
Attorney General&#8217;s guidelines on the availability of surveillance warrants for the investigation of 
terrorist and related offences, or the gathering of related intelligence, is classified, as are the 
&#8220;minimization procedures&#8221; required under Title 50 of the US Code to ensure that the 
surveillance of US persons is undertaken by the least intrusive means possible. Although the 
Special Rapporteur has been advised by the Department of Justice that these guidelines and 
procedures comply with international human rights law, there is no way of assessing the 
accuracy of this position, nor is there any transparency to guarantee compliance with the dual 
requirements of article 17 of the ICCPR to not interfere with privacy and to protect against the 
arbitrary interference with privacy. It is also relevant that the ICCPR obliges States parties to 
comply with these requirements not only in respect of citizens and permanent residents, but also 
in respect of all persons within the jurisdiction of the State. It is furthermore troubling that the 
use of FISA warrants, which have traditionally been treated as an exception to surveillance 
conducted under the Wiretap Act of 1968, has increased substantially since 11 September. 
Added to this is the almost universal granting of surveillance warrants by the Foreign 
Intelligence Security Court, which brings into question whether the Court acts as a genuine 
judicial check of executive power in this area. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  NSA programme of secret surveillance 
</b></p>
<p>50. The National Security Agency (NSA) operated a programme of secret surveillance without 
warrant outside the scope of FISA, authorized by an Executive Order of the President. The 
existence of this programme apparently came to light as a result of an internal leak. Whereas it is 
a crime under United States law to undertake surveillance without a court order, the NSA 
surveillance programme was said to have been established under an inherent right of the 
President to authorize warrantless surveillance under Article II of the United States Constitution. 
Whether or not this is correct, the use of surveillance techniques without a warrant amounts to an 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>31
</b>  <i>United States v. United States District Court</i>, 407 US 297 (1972). </p>

<p> A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p>interference with privacy not authorized by a &#8220;prescription by law&#8221; within the meaning of 
ICCPR article 17, thus rendering such surveillance unlawful within the terms of that article. 
Following media reports in 2005 exposing the existence of the NSA programme, the President 
acknowledged the existence of such a programme and stated that NSA surveillance would in the 
future be carried out under FISA. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  National Security Letters 
</b></p>
<p>51. A further development impacting upon privacy rights was the extended use of National 
Security Letters, a form of administrative subpoena facilitating expedited access by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence agencies to private records. Prior to the 
PATRIOT Act of 2001, the availability of National Security Letters was restricted to financial 
records, customer call records and consumer reports, with the requirement that a certifying 
officer be satisfied that the subject of investigation was acting on behalf of a foreign power. The 
Act broadened the type of records accessible under National Security Letters and extended the 
authority to counter-terrorism investigations. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the 
weakness of checks and balances in this authority, failing to properly ensure that there is no 
arbitrary interference with privacy, as required by ICCPR article 17. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>52. The exercise of freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democratic society and of 
ensuring accountable governance. It is evident that the freedom of the press, and its ability to 
bring executive action to light, has been a significant factor in raising public awareness and 
creating a debate on issues central to the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in the United States. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged, in that regard, 
by the fact that the Government of the United States has not acted to restrain media interest or 
publication. The free media of the United States itself has in the years following 11 September 
operated as a device for ensuring transparency and accountability in respect of the adverse 
consequences upon human rights of counter-terrorism measures undertaken by the Government. 
This is a feature of best practice which all countries should aspire to. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur has identified elements of best practice in the United States&#8217; fight 
against terrorism and the compliance of this with human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
including compensation for victims of terrorism, community outreach, and non-interference with 
the freedom of the press. He has, in contrast, also identified serious situations of incompatibility 
between international human rights obligations and the counter-terrorism law and practice of the 
United States. Such situations include the prohibition against torture, or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment; the right to life; and the right to a fair trial. He has also identified 
deficiencies in United States law and practice pertaining to the principle of non-refoulement; the 
rendition of persons to places of secret detention; the definition of terrorism; non-discrimination; 
checks in the application of immigration laws; and the obtaining of private records of persons 
and the unlawful surveillance of persons, including a lack of sufficient balances in that context. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The Special Rapporteur has described his visit to the United States as a step in the 
process of restoring the role of the United States as a positive example for respecting 
human rights, including in the context of the fight against terrorism, and he hopes that 
these steps continue to progress. He likewise recommends that the United States take a 
strong role in the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism 
Strategy. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the categorization of persons as &#8220;unlawful 
enemy combatants&#8221; be abandoned. He calls upon the United States to release or to put on 
trial those persons detained under that categorization. In the case of those suspected of war 
crimes, the international community has recognized the need to ensure that there is no 
impunity for such offending, but the Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about the 
increasing risks of an unfair trial as time continues to pass, and he therefore urges a 
determined effort to proceed with and conclude such prosecutions.  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The Special Rapporteur further recommends that legislative amendments be made to 
remove the denial of habeas corpus rights under the Military Commissions Act 2006 and 
the restrictions upon the ability of Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees to seek full judicial review of 
their combatant status, with the authority of the reviewing court to order release. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>Notwithstanding the primary responsibility of the United States to resettle any 
individuals among those detained in Guant&#225;namo Bay who are in need of international 
protection, the Special Rapporteur recommends that other States be willing to receive 
persons currently detained at Guant&#225;namo Bay. The United States and the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees should work together to establish a joint process by 
which detainees can be resettled in accordance with international law, including refugee 
law and the principle of non-refoulement.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>In particular, the Special Rapporteur urges the United States to invite the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to conduct confidential individual 
interviews with the detainees, in order to determine their qualification as refugees and to 
recommend their resettlement to other countries. He also urges the United States not to 
require from receiving countries the detention or monitoring of those returned in cases 
where such measures would not have basis in international and domestic law, and equally 
urges receiving States not to accept such conditions. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Due to the various concerns identified in this report pertaining to the composition 
and operation of military tribunals under the Military Commissions Act of 2006, involving 
multiple incompatibilities with the ICCPR, the Special Rapporteur recommends that these 
commissions be disestablished. Wherever possible, ordinary civilian courts should be used 
to try terrorist suspects. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b> In the case of persons charged with war crimes, being those crimes identified in the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, such persons may be tried by military 
courts martial provided that safeguards are in place to check against the exercise of bias or 
executive interference, including rights of appeal to civilian courts. In any such </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>proceedings, the security classification of information should not interfere with the 
presumption of innocence or the equality of arms, nor should evidence obtained by any 
form of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment be admitted in proceedings. The 
United States should take steps to ensure that any person acquitted of charges is released 
upon acquittal, or in the case of a person convicted of an offence, that release occurs upon 
completion of the sentence imposed. The Special Rapporteur further recommends that the 
imposition of the death penalty be excluded for military tribunals or courts martial. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Gravely concerned at the enhanced interrogation techniques reportedly used by the 
CIA, the Special Rapporteur urges the United States to ensure that all its officials and 
agencies comply with international standards, including article 7 of ICCPR, the 
Convention against Torture and, in the context of an armed conflict, common article 3 of 
the Geneva Conventions. Noting the United States understanding of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading punishment, he reminds the Government that there are no circumstances in 
which cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment may be justified, and recommends that steps 
be taken to reflect this in its domestic law. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Special Rapporteur has concluded that the interrogation techniques identified in 
this report, which are not explicitly prohibited in the United States Army Field Manual, 
involve conduct that may amount to a breach of the prohibition against torture and any 
form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. He recommends that the Manual be 
revised to expressly state that only enumerated techniques are permissible. As a practice 
which is not permissible in international law, and one that creates the real risk of torture or 
other ill-treatment of persons, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take 
transparent steps to ensure that the CIA practice of &#8220;extraordinary rendition&#8221; is 
completely discontinued and is not conducted in the future, and that CIA interrogation 
techniques are regulated in line with the position expressed above in respect of the Army 
Field Manual.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Special Rapporteur also calls on the United States to ensure that all detainees 
are held in accordance with international human rights standards, including the 
requirement that all detainees be held in regularized facilities, that they be registered, 
that they be allowed contact with the outside world (lawyers, International Committee of 
the Red Cross, where applicable, family), and that any form of detention is subject to 
accessible and effective court review, which entails the possibility of release. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to restrict definitions of 
&#8220;international terrorism&#8221;, &#8220;domestic terrorism&#8221; and &#8220;material support to terrorist 
organizations&#8221; in a way that is precise and restricted to the type of conduct identified by 
the Security Council as conduct to be suppressed in the fight against terrorism. He strongly 
urges the United States to ensure that it does not participate in the extrajudicial execution 
of any person, including terrorist suspects.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that all States, including the United States, do 
not use the country of origin of a person as a proxy for racial or religious profiling. He 
further urges all States not to act in a manner which might be seen as advocating the use of 
race and religion for the identification of persons as terrorists.  </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>66. <b>In the context of the compulsory detention of persons suspected of providing material 
support to terrorist organizations, the Special Rapporteur recommends that a transparent 
system be established for the application of the &#8220;duress waiver&#8221; established by the 
Department of Homeland Security, including the provision of judicial oversight. 
</b>67. <b>Due to the fact that the United States Attorney General&#8217;s guidelines on the 
availability of surveillance warrants under FISA, and the minimization procedures 
applicable to the surveillance of US persons are classified, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government introduce independent mechanisms, preferably 
involving the judiciary, to ensure that these guidelines and procedures are compliant with 
both the Constitution and the international obligations of the United States. The Special 
Rapporteur further urges the Government to extend these, and existing safeguards, to all 
persons within the jurisdiction and control of the United States, not simply those falling 
within the definition of &#8220;US persons&#8221;.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take steps to introduce independent 
checks and balances upon the authority of the FBI and other intelligence agencies to use 
National Security Letters.
