<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>Violence committed &#8220;in the name of religion&#8221;, that is, on the basis of or arrogated to 
</p>
<p>religious tenets of the perpetrator, can lead to massive violations of human rights, including 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur first provides a typological description 
</p>
<p>of various forms of violence carried out in the name of religion. He subsequently explores 
</p>
<p>root causes and relevant factors that underlie such violence. The main message is that 
</p>
<p>violence in the name of religion should not be misperceived as a &#8220;natural&#8221; outbreak of 
</p>
<p>collective acts of aggression that supposedly reflect sectarian hostilities existing since time 
</p>
<p>immemorial. Rather, it typically originates from contemporary factors and actors, including 
</p>
<p>political circumstances. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also recommends concerted actions by all relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including States, religious communities, interreligious dialogue initiatives, 
</p>
<p>civil society organizations and media representatives, in order to contain and eventually 
</p>
<p>eliminate the scourge of violence committed in the name of religion.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief was created 
</p>
<p>by the Commission on Human Rights pursuant to its resolution 1986/20 and renewed by the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council in its resolutions 6/37, 14/1 and 22/20.1 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 25/12, the Human Rights Council condemned &#8220;all forms of 
</p>
<p>violence, intolerance and discrimination based on or in the name of religion or belief, and 
</p>
<p>violations of the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, as well as any advocacy 
</p>
<p>of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, 
</p>
<p>whether it involves the use of print, audiovisual or electronic media or any other means&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Against that background, the present report, in its section II, focuses on preventing violence 
</p>
<p>committed in the name of religion and, in its section III, includes specific recommendations 
</p>
<p>addressed to all relevant stakeholders.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Preventing violence committed in the name of religion 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. A complex phenomenon 
</b></p>
<p>3. Violence committed &#8220;in the name of religion&#8221;, that is, on the basis of or arrogated to 
</p>
<p>religious tenets of the perpetrator,2 is a complex phenomenon in different parts of the world. 
</p>
<p>The brutality displayed in manifestations of such violence often renders observers 
</p>
<p>speechless. While in some countries violence in the name of religion remains a local or 
</p>
<p>regional phenomenon, acts of terrorism carried out intentionally to send global messages 
</p>
<p>have been increasingly prominent in recent years. In that context, prima facie &#8220;archaic&#8221; acts 
</p>
<p>of cruelty seem to be cynically &#8220;staged&#8221; in order to cater to modern media voyeurism, 
</p>
<p>which adds yet another dimension of humiliation to the suffering of victims and their 
</p>
<p>families.  
</p>
<p>4. Violence in the name of religion can be in the form of targeted attacks on individuals 
</p>
<p>or communities, communal violence, suicide attacks, terrorism, State repression, 
</p>
<p>discriminative policies or legislation and other types of violent behaviour. It can also be 
</p>
<p>embedded and perpetuated in the status quo in various forms of structural violence justified 
</p>
<p>in the name of religion. Perpetrators comprise different types of non-State actors, but also 
</p>
<p>State agencies or &#8212; quite often &#8212; a combination of both. In some countries, armed groups 
</p>
<p>invoke religion to justify atrocities such as targeted mass killings, extrajudicial and 
</p>
<p>summary executions, enforced disappearances, torture, sexual violence, indiscriminate 
</p>
<p>attacks against civilians, mass expulsions, enslavement or systematic destruction of certain 
</p>
<p>communities. In other countries, vigilante groups harass religious minorities by vandalizing 
</p>
<p>cemeteries and places of worship, grabbing lands or properties and threatening their 
</p>
<p>security.  
</p>
<p>5. The main problem in a number of countries stems from the State&#8217;s failure in 
</p>
<p>combating terrorism or violence of non-State actors, while certain State agencies in other 
</p>
<p>countries support such violence directly or indirectly, for example, by promoting hatred 
</p>
<p>against religious minorities or by turning a blind eye to violence, hence indulging a culture 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 For an overview of the activities of the Special Rapporteur between 1 August 2013 and 31 July 2014, 
</p>
<p>see A/69/261, paras. 4&#8211;22. 
</p>
<p> 2 By contrast, violence &#8220;on the grounds of religion or belief&#8221; is based on the religious affiliation of the 
</p>
<p>victim (see A/HRC/13/40, para. 33).  </p>


<p>of impunity. Human rights violations can even originate directly from the State apparatus 
</p>
<p>itself, for example, when a Government resorts to violent repression in order to &#8220;defend&#8221; a 
</p>
<p>State religion or existing religious hegemonies against perceived threats by religious 
</p>
<p>competitors or internal dissidents. The State&#8217;s involvement with violence in the name of 
</p>
<p>religion thus shows a broad variety of patterns, ranging from lack of capacity to indirect or 
</p>
<p>direct forms of complicity or deliberate policies of religious discrimination, sometimes 
</p>
<p>even culminating in formal endorsement or systematic orchestration of such violence by the 
</p>
<p>State.  
</p>
<p>6. Violence in the name of religion disproportionately targets religious dissidents, 
</p>
<p>members of religious minorities or converts.3 People suspected of undermining national 
</p>
<p>cohesion are also frequent targets of intolerant violence. Attacks will also likely increase 
</p>
<p>where there is a recognized &#8220;official&#8221; or State religion or when a religion is used as a 
</p>
<p>medium to define national identity. Moreover, vigilante groups, sometimes with the support 
</p>
<p>of law enforcement agencies, attack people, in particular women, whose ways of life are 
</p>
<p>deemed &#8220;immoral&#8221; from the standpoint of certain narrowly defined religious codes of 
</p>
<p>conduct.  
</p>
<p>7. However, violence in the name of religion also affects followers of the very same 
</p>
<p>religion, possibly also from a majority religion, in whose name such acts are perpetrated. 
</p>
<p>Voices of moderation or critics who actively oppose the abuse of their religion for the 
</p>
<p>justification of violence bear an increased risk of being accused of &#8220;betrayal&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;blasphemy&#8221; and having retaliatory penalties inflicted upon themselves. 
</p>
<p>8. The relevance of the issue with respect to freedom of religion or belief is obvious 
</p>
<p>since violence in the name of religion is a source of many of the most extreme violations of 
</p>
<p>this human right, usually in conjunction with other human rights violations as well. 
</p>
<p>Freedom of religion or belief, due to its nature as a human right, protects human beings 
</p>
<p>rather than religions. The starting point for any assessment of religious or belief pluralism 
</p>
<p>must therefore be the self-understandings of human beings in this area, which may be quite 
</p>
<p>diverse.  
</p>
<p>9. Victims of violence come from all religious or belief backgrounds. They comprise 
</p>
<p>adherents to large &#8220;traditional&#8221; communities and followers of small or new religious 
</p>
<p>movements, which are often stigmatized as &#8220;sects&#8221;. Furthermore, atheists and agnostics 
</p>
<p>suffer in many countries from a climate of intimidation, repression or violence. Another 
</p>
<p>frequently neglected group of people are the adherents to different indigenous beliefs, who 
</p>
<p>are also targets of violence carried out by State agencies and/or non-State actors.  
</p>
<p>10. Countless examples demonstrate that violence in the name of religion usually 
</p>
<p>displays a pronounced gender dimension.4 Many women and girls are victims of &#8220;honour&#8221; 
</p>
<p>killings, acid attacks, amputations or floggings, sometimes pursuant to penal codes that are 
</p>
<p>based on religious laws. Women and girls also disproportionately suffer from sexual 
</p>
<p>violence, such as rape, abduction, sexual enslavement, female genital mutilation, forced 
</p>
<p>marriage, often in conjunction with forced conversion, or other cruelties.  
</p>

<p>11. Furthermore, homophobic and transphobic violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual 
</p>
<p>and transgender (LGBT) persons may also be perpetrated in the name of religion. Those 
</p>
<p>perceived as LGBT may be targets of organized abuse, including by religious extremists.5 
</p>
<p>Violence against LGBT persons includes brutal gang rapes, so-called &#8220;curative&#8221; rapes and 
</p>
<p>family violence owing to their sexual orientation and gender identity.6 There is a strong 
</p>
<p>connection between discrimination in law and practice, and incitement to violence in the 
</p>
<p>name of religion and violence itself. Violence against women and against LGBT persons is 
</p>
<p>often justified and given legitimacy by discriminatory laws based on religious laws or 
</p>
<p>supported by religious authorities, such as laws criminalizing adultery, homosexuality or 
</p>
<p>cross-dressing. The Human Rights Committee has noted with concern hate speech and 
</p>
<p>manifestations of intolerance and prejudice by religious leaders against individuals on the 
</p>
<p>basis of their sexual orientation, in a broader context of acts of violence, including killings 
</p>
<p>of LGBT persons.7 There have also been reports of direct violence exercised by religious 
</p>
<p>authorities against LGBT persons, although many of them are religiously interested in 
</p>
<p>practising. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Overcoming simplistic interpretations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. I</b>nadequacy of isolating &#8220;religion&#8221; <b>as a factor in conflict descriptions 
</b></p>
<p>12. The experience that religion is invoked in civil wars, communal violence, terrorist 
</p>
<p>acts or other violent conflicts causes some observers to use the label &#8220;religion&#8221; broadly and 
</p>
<p>loosely when analysing those phenomena. Multidimensional violent conflicts are often 
</p>
<p>described along religious lines. Although such descriptions may capture some relevant 
</p>
<p>elements of the phenomena, they fail to understand the complexity of the issues. Headlines 
</p>
<p>such as &#8220;religious violence&#8221;, &#8220;religious civil war&#8221; or &#8220;sectarian conflicts&#8221; tend to obfuscate 
</p>
<p>the significance of non-religious factors, in particular political factors, for an adequate 
</p>
<p>understanding of the core problems.  
</p>
<p>13. Non-religious factors that deserve to be taken seriously may include intricate historic 
</p>
<p>legacies of a country, a climate of political authoritarianism, military interventions, extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty, social, cultural, economic and political discrimination, exclusion and 
</p>
<p>marginalization, inequalities, caste hierarchies, ethnic fragmentation, rapid demographic 
</p>
<p>changes, patriarchal values and a &#8220;macho&#8221; culture, migration processes, a widening gulf 
</p>
<p>between urban and rural areas, the breakdown of meaningful public discourse, lack of 
</p>
<p>intergroup communication, endemic corruption and political cronyism, widespread 
</p>
<p>disenchantment with politics, general loss of trust in weak or inexistent public institutions, 
</p>
<p>and a culture of impunity and denial for past serious violations of international human 
</p>
<p>rights and humanitarian law. Any specific incident of violence in the name of religion 
</p>
<p>warrants a careful, contextualized analysis of all relevant factors, including the broader 
</p>
<p>political environment. It will thereby become clear that religion is almost never an isolated 
</p>
<p>root cause of violent conflicts or attacks.  
</p>
<p>14. An isolated focus on religion in descriptions of violence, conflicts and civil wars 
</p>
<p>often creates the risk of nourishing fatalistic attitudes. The impression that seemingly 
</p>
<p>&#8220;perpetual&#8221; religious or denominational differences lie at the root of respective problems 
</p>
<p>can exacerbate feelings of helplessness and lead to inaction. However, if it is wrongly 
</p>
<p>assumed that certain violent conflicts have their decisive root causes in religious strife that 
</p>
<p>allegedly started centuries or even millennia ago, this will likely distract attention from the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 See A/HRC/19/41, para. 21. 
</p>
<p> 6 See A/HRC/14/22/Add.2, paras. 38 and 89. 
</p>
<p> 7 See CCPR/C/RUS/CO/6, para. 27. </p>


<p>responsibilities that Governments, community leaders, media representatives, civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and international agencies have today.  
</p>
<p>15. Moreover, it is important to avoid &#8220;essentialist&#8221; views that falsely ascribe violence 
</p>
<p>to the essence of certain religions or to religion in general. The formulation &#8220;violence in the 
</p>
<p>name of religion&#8221; in the present report is deliberately chosen to emphasize the fact that the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of violent crimes are always human beings, not religions as such. It is human 
</p>
<p>beings &#8212; individuals, groups, community leaders, State representatives, non-State actors 
</p>
<p>and others &#8212; who invoke religion or specific religious tenets for the purposes of 
</p>
<p>legitimizing, stoking, spreading or escalating violence. In other words, the relationship 
</p>
<p>between religion and violence can never be an immediate one; it always presupposes 
</p>
<p>human agency, that is, individuals or groups who actively bring about that connection &#8212; or 
</p>
<p>who challenge that connection. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Inadequacy of the instrumentalization thesis  
</b></p>
<p>16. Whereas an isolated focus on religion ignores the relevance of political and other 
</p>
<p>non-religious factors, the &#8220;instrumentalization thesis&#8221;, by contrast, from the outset denies 
</p>
<p>that religious motives can play a genuine role in incidents of violence. Instead, it is assumed 
</p>
<p>that perpetrators of such violence merely &#8220;instrumentalize&#8221; religion for political, economic 
</p>
<p>or other mundane purposes. The term &#8220;instrumentalization&#8221; conveys the impression that 
</p>
<p>religious persuasions themselves have little, if anything, to do with the acts of violence 
</p>
<p>perpetrated in their name.  
</p>
<p>17. However, downplaying the significance of religious motives, fears and obsessions in 
</p>
<p>this context would be factually wrong and conceptually inappropriate in many cases. It 
</p>
<p>would furthermore mean that religious communities and their leaderships are from the 
</p>
<p>outset excluded from taking any genuine responsibility for violence in the name of religion 
</p>
<p>and, by implication, cannot contribute meaningfully towards tackling the problem.  
</p>
<p>18. It remains true that acts of violence cannot be attributed to religions per se or to any 
</p>
<p>particular religion, as these acts are always carried out by human beings pursuing certain 
</p>
<p>aims in particular social, economic, political and historical contexts. Yet it is equally true 
</p>
<p>that human agency comprises a broad range of motives, including religious ones. While in 
</p>
<p>some cases violent attacks may be orchestrated by Machiavellian strategists who whip up 
</p>
<p>religious sentiments, there are obviously religious fanatics who seem to believe that, by 
</p>
<p>torturing or killing fellow human beings, they actually perform a service to God. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>it is a disturbing reality that religious fanatics may find some admirers and supporters 
</p>
<p>within their broader communities who mistakenly resort to violence as a manifestation of 
</p>
<p>strong religious commitment. Religious communities and their leaders, including 
</p>
<p>theologians of various denominations, have a responsibility to tackle this problem on the 
</p>
<p>basis of a clear analysis of its various root causes, including narrow-minded and polarizing 
</p>
<p>interpretations of religious messages. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. A broad range of factors and actors 
</b></p>
<p>19. The two above-mentioned simplistic interpretations often appear in discussions 
</p>
<p>about violence in the name of religion. What both interpretations have in common is that, 
</p>
<p>albeit in different ways, they ignore relevant factors and actors. The isolated focus on 
</p>
<p>religion neglects the significance of human agency in general, political and other non-
</p>
<p>religious factors in particular, thus possibly leading to fatalism in the face of seemingly 
</p>
<p>perpetual sectarian strife. By contrast, the instrumentalization thesis trivializes the role that 
</p>
<p>religious motives may play in committing and supporting acts of violence, leading to 
</p>
<p>inadequate responses from religious communities and their leaders.  </p>


<p>20. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that policies aimed at overcoming violence in 
</p>
<p>the name of religion must be based on a comprehensive understanding of all underlying 
</p>
<p>factors and responsible actors. This is the sine qua non for mobilizing all relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to do their utmost to eliminate such violence.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Root causes, factors and political circumstances 
</b></p>
<p>21. Violence committed in the name of religion is a complex reality. Given the word 
</p>
<p>limits of the present report, the Special Rapporteur will restrict himself to a few non-
</p>
<p>exhaustive typological observations.8 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Narrow-minded interpretations of religions 
</b></p>
<p>22. For many people, religion is a very emotional issue, deeply connected to feelings of 
</p>
<p>identity, devotion and group attachment. Religious convictions can drive people to push 
</p>
<p>their boundaries and perform acts of solidarity, compassion and charity. However, this 
</p>
<p>enormous potential can also turn into a destructive force, feeding collective polarization, 
</p>
<p>narrow-mindedness and violent fanaticism. 
</p>
<p>23. Religious fanaticism is a danger that exists in different religions and beliefs. 
</p>
<p>Attempts to derive a propensity for violence directly from specific theological features of 
</p>
<p>particular religions are highly problematic. Not only do they fail to do justice to the wide 
</p>
<p>range of violent manifestations connected to most different religions and beliefs, including 
</p>
<p>secular worldviews; they also neglect the decisive factor of human agency as pointed out 
</p>
<p>before.  
</p>
<p>24. Although most religions claim a transcendent &#8212; and in this sense &#8220;trans-human&#8221; &#8212; 
</p>
<p>origin, religious sources and normative codes of conduct always accommodate different 
</p>
<p>readings that are actively undertaken by human beings. Thus, human agency is inevitably 
</p>
<p>involved in interpreting religious traditions, dogmas, laws or identities. Open-minded 
</p>
<p>interpretations that encourage tolerance, empathy and solidarity across boundaries may 
</p>
<p>exist alongside narrow-minded interpretations of the same religion, which lead to polarized 
</p>
<p>worldviews and a militant rejection of people holding other persuasions. Whatever the 
</p>
<p>ultimate origins of a religious belief are thought to be, human beings bear in any case 
</p>
<p>responsibility for the practical consequences that they draw from the interpretation of their 
</p>
<p>faith. This particularly applies to religious teachers, preachers and community leaders, 
</p>
<p>whose influence should always be connected with an enhanced sense of responsibility. 
</p>
<p>25. Whenever violence is justified by the invocation of religion or arrogated to religious 
</p>
<p>tenets, the specific interpretations, for example, religious ideas, concepts, images or 
</p>
<p>anxieties, should be taken seriously. Although they should not be seen in isolation from 
</p>
<p>broader political and other factors, it would be too easy simply to dismiss polarizing 
</p>
<p>religious interpretations as mere excuses for acts of aggression. At the same time, the 
</p>
<p>pitfalls of essentialism can be avoided by bearing in mind that it is always human beings, in 
</p>
<p>their various roles and positions, who remain the responsible agents for any justifications 
</p>
<p>and commission of violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Loss of trust in public institutions  
</b></p>
<p>26. The seeds of religious fanaticism fortunately do not always find fertile ground. 
</p>
<p>Whereas in many societies those promoting religious narrow-mindedness, violence or even 
</p>
<p>terrorism do not succeed in mobilizing many followers, in other countries their 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 See also A/HRC/25/58, paras. 16-70. </p>


<p>opportunities may be higher. There are societies in which the voices of fanaticism resonate 
</p>
<p>strongly and in some countries they have even managed to infiltrate important parts of the 
</p>
<p>State apparatus or to lead the Government.  
</p>
<p>27. One main factor, which typically makes larger groups of people receptive to 
</p>
<p>messages of religious extremism, is a general loss of trust in public institutions. What often 
</p>
<p>starts with endemic corruption and political cronyism may end up in a total disenchantment 
</p>
<p>with State politics by large parts of the population. However, if people have lost any trust in 
</p>
<p>the fair functioning of public institutions, they will try to manage their lives by resorting to 
</p>
<p>their own support networks. Frequently, such networks are defined along ethnic or religious 
</p>
<p>lines.  
</p>
<p>28. When overarching public institutions lose their credibility, groupings defined by 
</p>
<p>ethnic and/or religious loyalties at the same time gain more importance. Such fragmentation 
</p>
<p>processes typically produce inward-looking mentalities, collective anxieties and attitudes of 
</p>
<p>general suspicion against everything happening outside of the boundaries of one&#8217;s own 
</p>
<p>group. Where the willingness to trust people is gradually shrinking to an internal circle, 
</p>
<p>collective narrow-mindedness will be a likely consequence. In this situation, polarizing 
</p>
<p>apocalyptic religious messages may become &#8220;attractive&#8221; since they actually seem to match 
</p>
<p>the mind-set of people who feel that they live under siege in a hostile and dangerous 
</p>
<p>political environment. Everyday anxieties and militant religious messages may thus blend 
</p>
<p>into each other.  
</p>
<p>29. In such a precarious constellation, a sudden crisis such as an incident or even mere 
</p>
<p>rumours can easily ignite mass-scale violence, including atrocious acts of barbarism 
</p>
<p>justified in the name of religion. Owing to the lack of trustworthy overarching public 
</p>
<p>institutions, political hysteria may set in and further poison the relationship between 
</p>
<p>competing communities. The end result of this vicious cycle can be a climate of political 
</p>
<p>paranoia in which militarized groups fight each other by using all available means, 
</p>
<p>including religious condemnation and demonization. Militarized group identities defined 
</p>
<p>along religious lines and dichotomized religious worldviews can thus reinforce each other.  
</p>
<p>30. The absence of trustworthy public institutions often goes together with a decline of 
</p>
<p>public communication. If negative rumours remain unchecked by any counter-evidence that 
</p>
<p>could be presented and discussed in public discourses, they may harden into fully-fledged 
</p>
<p>conspiracy projections. In such situations, apocalyptic images and violent messages, which 
</p>
<p>can be found within different religious traditions, may provide interpretative patterns for 
</p>
<p>assessing contemporary anxieties, thereby becoming an additional factor of violent 
</p>
<p>escalation.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Policies of exclusion  
</b></p>
<p>31. While many of the most extreme acts of violence in the name of religion currently 
</p>
<p>occur in the context of failing or failed States, State agencies can also be directly involved 
</p>
<p>in violent sectarian polarization. This is often the case where the State understands itself as 
</p>
<p>the guardian of one particular religion. If this is compounded with an &#8220;official&#8221; or State 
</p>
<p>religion, the negative impact on people belonging to religious minorities tends to be even 
</p>
<p>worse. Whereas the followers of the protected religion(s) usually receive a privileged 
</p>
<p>treatment, adherents to other religions or beliefs may suffer serious discrimination, such as 
</p>
<p>underrepresentation in public employment, exclusion from higher education or even 
</p>
<p>deprivation of citizenship. The experience of systematic exclusion almost inevitably leads 
</p>
<p>to divisiveness within the society.  
</p>
<p>32. Policies of exclusion in the field of religion exist under different auspices. On the 
</p>
<p>one hand, there are a number of Governments that base their legitimacy on their role as 
</p>
<p>guardians of certain religious truth claims. Those people who do not adhere to the protected </p>


<p>religion or those who follow interpretations deemed &#8220;deviant&#8221; may be publicly attacked as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;infidels&#8221;, &#8220;apostates&#8221; or &#8220;heretics&#8221;; some State may even exercise pressure in order to 
</p>
<p>forcibly convert them to the official religion of the country. 
</p>
<p>33. On the other hand, there is an even broader group of States, including formally 
</p>
<p>secular States, which promote a particular religious heritage as an inherent part of their 
</p>
<p>national identity, without resorting to specific truth claims. Such national heritage can 
</p>
<p>either consist of one religion, which has largely shaped the national history, or comprise a 
</p>
<p>number of different religions or beliefs, which are officially recognized as constituting the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;traditional religious mosaic&#8221; of the nation. In fact, the fault lines resulting from harnessing 
</p>
<p>religion for the promotion of national identity often run between &#8220;traditional&#8221; and &#8220;non-
</p>
<p>traditional&#8221; religions, including religions or beliefs of immigrants. Individuals or groups 
</p>
<p>perceived as not fitting into the traditional self-understanding of the nation may be 
</p>
<p>suspected of undermining national cohesion or even acting as fifth columns in the interest 
</p>
<p>of &#8220;foreign powers&#8221; or &#8220;foreign donors&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>34. Policies of exclusion are often manifested in hostile public statements made by 
</p>
<p>populist politicians, usually in conjunction with incitement to religious hatred in the media. 
</p>
<p>Sometimes, even very small minorities are demonized as allegedly posing a dangerous 
</p>
<p>threat to the long-term survival of the nation, or they are accused of being involved in 
</p>
<p>clandestine conspiracies. The Special Rapporteur has often noted a pronounced gender 
</p>
<p>dimension in hate speech, for example, the stoked fear of far-reaching demographic 
</p>
<p>changes allegedly in a strategic attempt of minorities to get the upper hand in the long run, 
</p>
<p>and as a result of a hyperbolic sexual drive ascribed to members of religious minorities, 
</p>
<p>who thereby are depicted as &#8220;primitive&#8221;. LGBT people have also been falsely portrayed in 
</p>
<p>religious discourse as &#8220;threatening&#8221; the survival of a nation or being part of a &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; 
</p>
<p>to control population growth. 
</p>
<p>35. Policies of exclusion may also manifest themselves in formal acts of administration 
</p>
<p>or legislation. For instance, unwelcome religious minorities may confront insuperable 
</p>
<p>obstacles when trying to obtain a legal personality status without which they cannot 
</p>
<p>develop an infrastructure needed for running their community affairs in a sustainable 
</p>
<p>manner. Sometimes the very existence of such communities in a country is deemed 
</p>
<p>&#8220;illegal&#8221;. As a result, people belonging to such discriminated minorities typically suffer 
</p>
<p>systematic harassment and intimidation. A factor that further increases the likelihood of 
</p>
<p>harassment is anti-blasphemy laws or anti-proselytism laws, which may threaten criminal 
</p>
<p>punishments for vaguely circumscribed &#8220;offences&#8221;. Countless examples demonstrate that 
</p>
<p>such laws disproportionately affect minorities. Meanwhile, they may encourage self-
</p>
<p>appointed vigilante groups to commit acts of violent aggression, frequently with direct or 
</p>
<p>indirect support by law enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Impunity, trivialization and the culture of silence 
</b></p>
<p>36. A major problem underneath violence in the name of religion is a culture of 
</p>
<p>impunity that exists in quite a number of countries. Often, victims and their families report 
</p>
<p>that the authorities do not provide efficient protection, that police reach the scene of 
</p>
<p>violence late or become bystanders watching the places of worship being torched or people 
</p>
<p>attacked by an aggressive mob. It is not always clear whether impunity results from a lack 
</p>
<p>of capacity or even reflects a certain degree of complicity by parts of the State apparatus.  
</p>
<p>37. An additional factor that further aggravates the situation is the tendency of certain 
</p>
<p>Governments to ignore or downplay the systemic root causes of violence in the name of 
</p>
<p>religion. When addressing the issue, they may trivialize it as &#8220;sporadic incidents&#8221; allegedly 
</p>
<p>caused by a few irresponsible individuals, without acknowledging the broader structural or 
</p>
<p>political dimension of the issue. Official statistics displaying the frequency and patterns of 
</p>
<p>violence, including disaggregated data on the underlying motives, often do not exist. </p>


<p>38. In a climate of fear and intimidation in some countries &#8212; either caused by 
</p>
<p>aggressive non-State actors or by repressive Governments &#8212; the population may largely 
</p>
<p>refrain from even talking about violence committed in the name of religion. This constitutes 
</p>
<p>yet another layer of the problem. The growing culture of silence, often exacerbated by 
</p>
<p>restrictive laws, prevents responsible stakeholders from tackling the problem publicly and 
</p>
<p>strategically. Overcoming the culture of silence is a major precondition for holding 
</p>
<p>Governments accountable for relevant political actions and omissions, including situations 
</p>
<p>of impunity. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>39. The scourge of violence in the name of religion calls for concerted action of States, 
</p>
<p>religious and belief communities, interreligious initiatives, civil society and the media to 
</p>
<p>contain and eventually overcome this phenomenon. Human rights provide the normative 
</p>
<p>framework in which any policies tackling the problem and its root causes must be 
</p>
<p>developed. Their potential in this regard is manifold:  
</p>
<p>(a) Human rights represent a broad moral consensus endorsed by the 
</p>
<p>international community and are binding under international law, thus combining moral 
</p>
<p>persuasiveness with legal force;  
</p>
<p>(b) Human rights are connected with the establishment of infrastructure-relevant 
</p>
<p>institutions at the global, regional, national and subnational levels. This complex 
</p>
<p>infrastructure facilitates strategic cooperation between different stakeholders in the 
</p>
<p>implementation and monitoring of human rights;  
</p>
<p>(c) The infrastructure of human rights institutions and mechanisms at different 
</p>
<p>levels &#8212; from global to local &#8212; can furthermore help to build or restore trust among 
</p>
<p>people, particularly in situations in which public institutions in a society have largely 
</p>
<p>ceased to function adequately;  
</p>
<p>(d) Although human rights as legal norms do not themselves constitute an 
</p>
<p>overarching belief-system, the underlying principles &#8212; such as the respect for human 
</p>
<p>dignity, the equality of all human beings and the aspiration to universal justice &#8212; have 
</p>
<p>substantive overlaps with many religious, culture and philosophical traditions. Human 
</p>
<p>rights may therefore provide incentives for strengthening the awareness of the charitable 
</p>
<p>messages contained in different religions or beliefs in order to build resilience against 
</p>
<p>messages of hatred and violence;  
</p>
<p>(e) Freedom of religion or belief, in conjunction with other human rights, 
</p>
<p>provides the normative basis for the coexistence and cooperation of people belonging to 
</p>
<p>most different religions or beliefs and obliges the State to provide an inclusive framework. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, freedom of religion or belief assures that different communities and 
</p>
<p>subcommunities will receive protection. 
</p>
<p>40. This non-exhaustive list shows the potential of human rights to bring together 
</p>
<p>various stakeholders who, in concerted actions, should do their utmost to combat violence 
</p>
<p>in the name of religion. Below, the Special Rapporteur discusses specific roles of some 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders in this area. </p>


<p><b> E. Obligations and responsibilities under international law 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Overarching obligations of the State 
</b></p>
<p>41. The State is not just another stakeholder alongside various other actors and 
</p>
<p>institutions. As the formal guarantor of human rights under international law, the State has 
</p>
<p>an overarching obligation that can be divided conceptually into three levels, that is, the 
</p>
<p>obligations to respect, to protect and to promote human rights.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Obligations to respect  
</i></p>
<p>42. For the context of the present discussion, the obligations to respect chiefly require 
</p>
<p>that the State abandon all sorts of &#8212; formal or informal &#8212; policies of exclusion by which 
</p>
<p>persons belonging to certain groups suffer discrimination.9 This has manifold 
</p>
<p>consequences. In particular, Government representatives must clearly refrain from any 
</p>
<p>statements that may be perceived as condoning or even encouraging acts of violence that 
</p>
<p>target religious dissenters, religious minorities or other groups of people. Legislation that 
</p>
<p>renders the existence of certain religious communities as such &#8220;illegal&#8221; in the country or 
</p>
<p>prevents them from developing a sustainable infrastructure is incompatible with the 
</p>
<p>universal right to freedom of religion or belief and should be revoked. Such legislation 
</p>
<p>furthermore fuels resentments and may encourage acts of intimidation, including by law 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies. Moreover, the State should repeal anti-blasphemy laws, anti-
</p>
<p>conversion laws and criminal laws that discriminate against certain people according to 
</p>
<p>their religious affiliations or beliefs or criminalize their &#8220;dissident&#8221; practices. Apart from 
</p>
<p>further increasing the vulnerability of marginalized groups or individuals, these laws may 
</p>
<p>give a pretext to vigilante groups and other perpetrators of hatred for intimidating people 
</p>
<p>and committing acts of violence. Textbooks used for school education should not contain 
</p>
<p>stereotypes and prejudices that may stoke hostile sentiments against the followers of certain 
</p>
<p>religions or beliefs and groups that suffer systematic discrimination, including women and 
</p>
<p>LGBT persons.  
</p>
<p>43. In order to operate as a credible guarantor of freedom of religion or belief for 
</p>
<p>everyone, the State should not identify itself exclusively with one particular religion or 
</p>
<p>belief (or one particular type of religions) at the expense of equal treatment of the followers 
</p>
<p>of other faiths.10 As ample experience demonstrates, the use of religion in the context of 
</p>
<p>national identity politics always harbours aggravated risks of discrimination against 
</p>
<p>minorities, for instance, against members of immigrant religious communities or new 
</p>
<p>religious movements, thus creating divisiveness within the society. Any exclusivist settings 
</p>
<p>should therefore be critically addressed and finally replaced by an inclusive institutional 
</p>
<p>framework in which religious diversity can unfold without discrimination and without fear. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Obligations to protect 
</i></p>
<p>44. Violations of human rights do not only originate from the State; they are quite often 
</p>
<p>carried out by non-State actors. Nonetheless, the State bears a responsibility for such acts 
</p>
<p>inasmuch as they may reflect inadequate human rights protection.  
</p>
<p>45. A first step towards providing protection against violence in the name of religion is a 
</p>
<p>quick and unequivocal condemnation of any such acts, whenever they occur, by high 
</p>
<p>representatives of the State. State representatives should indeed take the lead in rejecting 
</p>
<p>violence, expressing sympathy for victims and providing public support for targeted 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See Human Rights Committee general comment no. 22, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, paras. 9 and 10. 
</p>
<p> 10 See A/HRC/19/60, paras. 65 and 66. </p>


<p>individuals or groups. Violent attacks targeting members of groups that face systematic 
</p>
<p>discrimination in the name of religion should be understood as attacks on the entire society. 
</p>
<p>Public messages to that effect, however, can only be credible if they openly address the root 
</p>
<p>causes, including systemic political conditions, which may become enabling factors of 
</p>
<p>violence. Unfortunately, some Governments display a tendency to resort to policies of 
</p>
<p>trivializing violence by ascribing the incidents to just a few irresponsible individuals 
</p>
<p>without acknowledging the broader political dimensions of the issue. Overcoming such 
</p>
<p>trivialization is the sine qua non for designing effective preventative and coping strategies.  
</p>
<p>46. A major issue in the context of protection against violence in the name of religion is 
</p>
<p>the fight against impunity, wherever it exists. Those who commit, or are complicit in, acts 
</p>
<p>of violence must always be brought to justice. This requires training for law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies and the establishment of an efficient and independent judiciary. Moreover, anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination legislation plays an indispensable role in protecting the equality of all in 
</p>
<p>their enjoyment of human rights, across religious or denominational divides, thus 
</p>
<p>preventing or overcoming divisiveness within society. 
</p>
<p>47. While the States&#8217; obligation to protect human rights requires them to take effective 
</p>
<p>measures to combat terrorism, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that States 
</p>
<p>must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism fully complies with their 
</p>
<p>obligations under international law, particularly human rights, refugee and humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law. In this context, the targeting of specific groups, including members of particular 
</p>
<p>religious communities through so-called religious profiling, is of concern.11  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Obligations to promote 
</i></p>
<p>48. Beyond respecting and protecting human rights, States should also take a broad 
</p>
<p>range of positive measures aimed at facilitating their effective implementation. This 
</p>
<p>includes providing an appropriate framework in which other stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>religious communities, interreligious initiatives, civil society organizations, human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and media professionals, can unfold their specific potential.  
</p>
<p>49. Moreover, the State itself should use all available means &#8212; including formal and 
</p>
<p>informal education and community outreach &#8212; in order to promote a culture of respect, 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination and appreciation of diversity within society. In close consultation with 
</p>
<p>all relevant stakeholders, the State should develop national action plans against violence in 
</p>
<p>the name of religion. A useful document in this context is the Rabat Plan of Action on the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
</p>
<p>discrimination, hostility or violence.12 The Rabat Plan of Action, elaborated with broad 
</p>
<p>participation by experts, Member States and civil society organizations under the auspices 
</p>
<p>of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, can provide 
</p>
<p>guidance on how to build resilience in society against incitement to religious hatred and 
</p>
<p>concomitant acts of violence. Building resilience requires a broad range of activities, 
</p>
<p>including educational efforts, early warning capacities and policies on crisis preparedness, 
</p>
<p>by establishing channels of communication that enable relevant actors to respond 
</p>
<p>strategically and swiftly. 
</p>
<p>50. National human rights institutions are particularly suited for the promotion of human 
</p>
<p>rights. Some of them have an explicit mandate for also promoting intergroup relationships. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur would like to encourage them, including their International 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 See A/HRC/4/21, paras. 40-42. 
</p>
<p> 12 See A/HRC/22/17/Add.4, annex. </p>


<p>Coordinating Committee, to take an active ownership of the Rabat Plan of Action and 
</p>
<p>develop strategies to eliminate the root causes of violence in the name of religion.  
</p>
<p>51. Furthermore, States should safeguard the memory of all population groups, and of 
</p>
<p>religious communities in particular, including by developing and protecting national 
</p>
<p>archives, memorial museums and monuments. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and crimes against humanity 
</b></p>
<p>52. At the 2005 World Summit, Heads of State and Government committed to the 
</p>
<p>responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity.13 This entails the responsibility of States to protect their own 
</p>
<p>populations from atrocity crimes; the responsibility to help other States do so through the 
</p>
<p>provision of international assistance; and the responsibility to take collective action when a 
</p>
<p>State manifestly fails to protect its population. In particular, the word &#8220;populations&#8221; refers 
</p>
<p>to all people living within a State&#8217;s territory, whether citizens or not, and including 
</p>
<p>religious groups. The principle builds on existing obligations under international law and 
</p>
<p>embodies a political determination to prevent and respond to atrocity crimes, but does not 
</p>
<p>itself have an independent legal character.  
</p>
<p>53. In his 2009 report on implementing the responsibility to protect (A/63/677), the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General established a framework for implementing the responsibility to protect 
</p>
<p>principle on the basis of three equal, mutually reinforcing and non-sequential pillars. The 
</p>
<p>first pillar encompasses the responsibility of each individual State to protect its populations 
</p>
<p>from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The second pillar 
</p>
<p>focuses on the provision of international assistance on the basis of paragraphs 138 and 139 
</p>
<p>of the 2005 World Summit Outcome, which asserts that the international community 
</p>
<p>should, as appropriate, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility, and that the 
</p>
<p>international community should also support the United Nations in establishing an early 
</p>
<p>warning capability and assist those which are under stress before crises and conflicts break 
</p>
<p>out. The third pillar outlines options for taking collective action, in a timely and decisive 
</p>
<p>manner and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, should peaceful means 
</p>
<p>be inadequate and where national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their 
</p>
<p>populations.14  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Obligations of non-State armed groups  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) International human rights law 
</i></p>
<p>54. While international human rights law traditionally focused only on the obligations of 
</p>
<p>States,15 an evolving approach recognizes the importance and impact of certain non-State 
</p>
<p>actors, arguing that some human rights obligations also apply to them, including non-State 
</p>
<p>armed groups with (or arguably even without) effective control over a territory. In that 
</p>
<p>regard, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women stressed in its 
</p>
<p>general recommendation No. 30 (2013) on women in conflict prevention, conflict and post-
</p>
<p>conflict situations, that &#8220;under certain circumstances, in particular where an armed group 
</p>
<p>with an identifiable political structure exercises significant control over territory and 
</p>
<p>population, non-State actors are obliged to respect international human rights&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 See General Assembly resolution 60/1, paras. 138 and 139. 
</p>
<p> 14 See also www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/responsibility.shtml; and A/69/266, paras. 78-85.  
</p>
<p> 15 See CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, para. 8. 
</p>
<p> 16 See CEDAW/C/GC/30, para. 16. </p>


<p>55. Special procedures and commissions of Inquiry have also addressed human rights 
</p>
<p>violations committed in the name of religion by armed groups with effective control over 
</p>
<p>territory.17 &#8220;Effective control&#8221; means that the non-State armed group has consolidated its 
</p>
<p>control and authority over a territory to such an extent that it can exclude the State from 
</p>
<p>governing the territory on a more than temporary basis.18 Furthermore, armed groups 
</p>
<p>without effective control over territory have been held to have committed human rights 
</p>
<p>violations.19 In May 2014, a report by the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South 
</p>
<p>Sudan20 stressed that the most basic human rights obligations, in particular those emanating 
</p>
<p>from peremptory international law (jus cogens), bind both the State and armed opposition 
</p>
<p>groups in times of peace and during armed conflict.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) International humanitarian law 
</i></p>
<p>56. In the event that a non-State armed group is party to an armed conflict, international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law can also be invoked. Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions 
</p>
<p>of 1949 defines certain minimum guarantees that all parties involved in a non-international 
</p>
<p>armed conflict should observe, including to treat in all circumstances persons who take no 
</p>
<p>active part in the hostilities humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on religion 
</p>
<p>or faith. Furthermore, a number of norms contained in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and 
</p>
<p>the Additional Protocols I and II of 1977 have reached the status of customary international 
</p>
<p>law and, as such, are binding on all parties to the armed conflict.21  
</p>
<p>57. Most notably, international humanitarian law requires that both the State and non-
</p>
<p>State armed groups take all measures to minimize the impact of violence on civilians, 
</p>
<p>respect the principles of distinction and proportionality when carrying out military 
</p>
<p>operations and ensure the safety and protection of civilians by enabling them to leave areas 
</p>
<p>affected by violence in safety and dignity as well as to access basic humanitarian assistance 
</p>
<p>at all times.22 
</p>
<p><i>  (c) International criminal law 
</i></p>
<p>58. Certain conduct of members of non-State armed groups may also trigger individual 
</p>
<p>responsibility under international criminal law. The Rome Statute of the International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court provides definitions of &#8220;genocide&#8221; in article 6, of &#8220;crimes against 
</p>
<p>humanity&#8221; in article 7 and of &#8220;war crimes&#8221; in article 8. These provisions also include 
</p>
<p>several references to the terms &#8220;religious&#8221; or &#8220;religion&#8221;, for example, in article 6 (&#8220;acts 
</p>
<p>committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a [&#8230;] religious group, as such&#8221;), 
</p>
<p>article 7, paragraph 1 (h), (&#8220;persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on 
</p>
<p>[&#8230;] religious [&#8230;] grounds&#8221;) as well as article 8, paragraphs 2 (b)(ix) and (e)(iv), 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 See, for example, A/56/253, paras. 27 and 30, concerning the Taliban; A/HRC/2/7, para. 19, 
</p>

</p>
<p>59. Individual criminal responsibility is essential to ensuring accountability for gross or 
</p>
<p>serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. However, according 
</p>
<p>to article 25, paragraph 3 (f), of the Rome Statute, &#8220;a person who abandons the effort to 
</p>
<p>commit the crime or otherwise prevents the completion of the crime shall not be liable for 
</p>
<p>punishment under this Statute for the attempt to commit that crime if that person 
</p>
<p>completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose&#8221;. Hence, this provision in 
</p>
<p>combination with the threat of possible international prosecution may hopefully influence 
</p>
<p>individual members of non-State armed groups to abandon their efforts to commit 
</p>
<p>international crimes.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Roles of other stakeholders  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Religious communities and their leaderships  
</b></p>
<p>60. Perpetrators of violence typically represent comparatively small segments of the 
</p>
<p>various religious communities to which they belong, while the large majority of believers 
</p>
<p>are usually appalled to see violence perpetrated in the name of their religion. It is all the 
</p>
<p>more important for the majorities and their leaders, who do not endorse the violence, to 
</p>
<p>speak out against it. In some countries, religious communities organize broad 
</p>
<p>demonstrations and use all available media to publicly condemn religious justifications of 
</p>
<p>violent atrocities. However, there are also situations in which the silence of the majority 
</p>
<p>and their leaders is quite &#8220;deafening&#8221;, thus factually leaving the public stage to small 
</p>
<p>aggressive groups.23 Speaking out in these situations often requires courage, determination 
</p>
<p>and the ability to seize opportunities to intervene at the right moment when violence arises 
</p>
<p>and can still be contained and curbed.  
</p>
<p>61. Overcoming a culture of silence, wherever it exists, in the face of violent attacks is 
</p>
<p>of paramount importance. Often, perpetrators of violence pretend to act on behalf of a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;silent majority&#8221;. Religious fanatics furthermore like to portray themselves as &#8220;heroes&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>a religious avant-garde that ultimately promotes the interests of their community. As long 
</p>
<p>as the majorities and broader communities remain largely silent, extremists can easily play 
</p>
<p>this game. They may feel that they have carte blanche to perform acts of violence and to 
</p>
<p>sell these atrocities as manifestations of religious devotion.  
</p>
<p>62. Overcoming the culture of silence is not an easy task and, depending on the specific 
</p>
<p>situation, such attempts can be quite risky. One problem is that extremist religious groups 
</p>
<p>typically receive or seek to use broad media coverage, whereas voices of peace and 
</p>
<p>reconciliation often remain at the margins of public attention. Although this can be a highly 
</p>
<p>frustrating experience, it should never serve as an excuse for remaining silent. The cynical 
</p>
<p>belief that bad news makes for good sales must not prevent other members of religious 
</p>
<p>communities from bringing forward their views actively. Moreover, in a climate of 
</p>
<p>intimidation, many believers, for fear of reprisals, may refrain from speaking out publicly. 
</p>
<p>In such situations, fellow believers living in safer political environments should lend their 
</p>
<p>voices and clearly condemn violence committed in the name of their religion.  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur has seen impressive anti-violence statements issued by 
</p>
<p>representatives of religious communities, that is, statements which are clear, theologically 
</p>
<p>profound and passionate.24 However, he has also come across public rejections of violence 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23 See, for example, A/HRC/19/60/Add.2, para. 65 (Republic of Moldova). 
</p>
<p> 24 See, for example, A/HRC/25/58/Add.1, para. 35 (Sierra Leone) and A/HRC/25/58/Add.2, para. 16 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>which remain disappointingly abstract, because they are based on the problematic 
</p>
<p>assumption that violence results from a mere &#8220;instrumentalization&#8221; of religion and, 
</p>
<p>accordingly, has little, if anything, to do with religious motives. Yet, such rejections based 
</p>
<p>on a trivialization of religious motives will themselves remain trivial. As discussed earlier, 
</p>
<p>the instrumentalization thesis one-sidedly attributes the problem to external, non-religious 
</p>
<p>factors while too quickly discarding the potential relevance also of religious obsessions and 
</p>
<p>theological views.  
</p>
<p>64. Religious communities and especially their representatives and intellectual leaders 
</p>
<p>should not succumb to the temptation to reduce the issue of violence in the name of religion 
</p>
<p>to mere &#8220;misunderstandings&#8221; and external abuses. This would amount to an irresponsible 
</p>
<p>trivialization of the problem. Instead, when dealing with the issue of such violence, 
</p>
<p>theologians and religious leaders should actually expose themselves to the disturbing fact 
</p>
<p>that perpetrators of violence &#8212; or at least some of them &#8212; may be convinced to perform an 
</p>
<p>act of service to God when killing fellow humans. Taking seriously these ideas, however 
</p>
<p>bizarre and distorted they may seem, is the precondition for giving sufficiently profound 
</p>
<p>responses. Only by confronting the perverse &#8220;attractiveness&#8221; of violent religious extremism 
</p>
<p>for some people, including people living in precarious and volatile political circumstances, 
</p>
<p>will it be possible to tackle the various root causes of violence, including polarizing 
</p>
<p>religious interpretations and incitement to religious hatred.  
</p>
<p>65. Beyond a clear condemnation of violence committed in the name of religion, 
</p>
<p>communities and their leaders should positively promote empathy, tolerance and an 
</p>
<p>appreciation of diversity. They should challenge the religious extremists&#8217; authenticity 
</p>
<p>claims by exposing the ignorance of their views of the charitable core messages contained 
</p>
<p>in religious traditions. Religious communities and scholars may also play an important role 
</p>
<p>in rehabilitation and reintegration programs for violent extremist offenders and foreign 
</p>
<p>fighters who returned to their country of origin, also with a view to neutralize possible 
</p>
<p>future radicalization efforts.25 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Interreligious initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>66. The potential of interreligious communication for overcoming violence in the name 
</p>
<p>of religion is enormous.26 Many examples demonstrate that violence frequently occurs in 
</p>
<p>the absence of any trustful communication across religious or denominational boundaries, 
</p>
<p>and the related vacuum of ideological power. The reasons for the lack or decline of 
</p>
<p>intergroup communication can be manifold, ranging from broader processes of societal 
</p>
<p>fragmentation and policies of exclusion to the demonization of others in polarizing 
</p>
<p>religious interpretations. Whatever the reasons in a particular situation may be, initiatives 
</p>
<p>aimed at improving the relationship between different religious communities can 
</p>
<p>substantially contribute to preventing violent escalation. In-depth research into a number of 
</p>
<p>cases of communal violence has led to the conclusion that acts of violence could be 
</p>
<p>contained to a certain degree in localities where communities had developed a sustainable 
</p>
<p>culture of cross-boundary communication. Apart from its preventative potential, intergroup 
</p>
<p>communication therefore also helps to alleviate situations in which mass-scale violence 
</p>
<p>actually occurs.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>(Jordan). 
</p>
<p> 25 See, for example, www.thegctf.org/documents/10162/38330/Rome+Memorandum-English. and 
</p>
<p>www.thegctf.org/documents/10162/140201/14Sept19_The+Hague-
</p>
<p>Marrakech+FTF+Memorandum.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 26 See A/HRC/22/51/Add.1, para. 90 (Cyprus), A/HRC/25/58, para. 44 and A/66/156, paras. 21-69. </p>


<p>67. For interreligious communication to be productive, partners should meet on an equal 
</p>
<p>footing and there should always be room for a meaningful exchange beyond mere ritualistic 
</p>
<p>encounters. A broad representation, including gender balance and participation of different 
</p>
<p>generations, can ensure that larger populations can take active ownership of such initiatives, 
</p>
<p>thus enhancing their sustainability. There is much space for improvements in this regard, 
</p>
<p>since women, including feminist theologians, are typically very underrepresented in 
</p>
<p>interreligious dialogue initiatives. Their voices are sadly absent in many projects. The roles 
</p>
<p>of women human rights defenders should also be promoted as they can contribute to a less 
</p>
<p>patriarchal interpretation of religions that disproportionately affect the rights of women, 
</p>
<p>girls and LGBT persons. 
</p>
<p>68. Projects that involve interreligious cooperation can have far-reaching impacts. One 
</p>
<p>very positive recent development is the enhanced interreligious cooperation in providing 
</p>
<p>aid for refugees and internally displaced persons.27 Apart from supporting people who are 
</p>
<p>living under dire conditions, such cooperation also sends a much-needed message of hope 
</p>
<p>to these communities and to the international community, and constitutes good practices 
</p>
<p>that may inspire others.  
</p>
<p>69. Some initiatives have led to the formal establishment of interreligious councils in 
</p>
<p>which people of different religious and denominational backgrounds meet regularly. This 
</p>
<p>can be useful to ensure a sustainable cooperation and keep the forces of violent extremism 
</p>
<p>at bay. At the same time, there are also many illustrations of informal grass-root initiatives 
</p>
<p>with the purpose of cherishing trustful relations. Quite surprisingly, everyday 
</p>
<p>communication across religious divides may even exist at the local level in countries that 
</p>
<p>are torn by religious extremism and violent conflicts. Figuratively speaking, even in a 
</p>
<p>desert of violent political paranoia, people communicating across boundaries can uphold 
</p>
<p>certain oases of common sense that certainly deserve to be acknowledged, strengthened and 
</p>
<p>supported politically.  
</p>
<p>70. Interreligious communication and intergroup cooperation have a key function in all 
</p>
<p>agendas to overcome violence in the name of religion. Although people who meet regularly 
</p>
<p>across boundaries will not necessarily agree on all issues, they will realize that followers of 
</p>
<p>other religions and denominations are not &#8220;aliens&#8221; with totally different mentalities or 
</p>
<p>feelings. This is an important experience and a precondition for overcoming hostile 
</p>
<p>stereotypes. Discovering common concerns, worries and interests may also be the first step 
</p>
<p>for developing joint action plans for tackling the root causes of violence more strategically.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>71. Civil society organizations differ from religious communities in that they 
</p>
<p>predominantly locate themselves in the &#8220;civil&#8221; sphere. What brings people together in civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations is not, or not primarily, a common religious belief or practice, but 
</p>
<p>rather joint commitments to address issues of common concerns, including human rights. 
</p>
<p>This does not preclude the possibility that quite a number of civil society organizations at 
</p>
<p>the same time understand themselves as being faith-based. 
</p>
<p>72. The expertise gained by civil society organizations is indispensable for assessing the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation, including freedom of religion or belief. For victims of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations and people living under conditions of constant intimidation, it is reassuring to 
</p>
<p>know that civil society organizations monitor their situations and alert relevant authorities 
</p>
<p>and the public when necessary. They provide information, advice, guidance, assistance and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 27 For example, cooperation between the organizations Lutheran World Federation and Islamic Relief 
</p>
<p>Worldwide; see www.lutheranworld.org/news/lwf-and-islamic-relief-sign-memorandum-
</p>
<p>understanding. </p>


<p>sometimes protection, including by following up on individual cases. The findings of civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations can also assume an early warning function, notably in volatile 
</p>
<p>situations.  
</p>
<p>73. Moreover, in the face of violent aggression, civil society plays a major role in 
</p>
<p>overcoming a culture of silence wherever this exists. It is important for individuals and 
</p>
<p>groups targeted by incitement to religious hatred and violent attacks to experience solidarity 
</p>
<p>support and that others speak out on their behalf. Overcoming silence is likewise needed to 
</p>
<p>challenge the claims of perpetrators of hatred to act in the name of a &#8220;silent majority&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Speaking out against such violence, and the broader political or religious dimensions 
</p>
<p>involved with these problems, can be dangerous. Therefore, local civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations may need international networks to defend them in situations where they are 
</p>
<p>threatened.28  
</p>
<p>74. Different faith-based and secular civil society organizations work together and have 
</p>
<p>created common platforms. Beyond the pragmatic advantages of joining forces, such 
</p>
<p>cooperation also demonstrates that a commitment to human rights can create and strengthen 
</p>
<p>solidarity across all religious, cultural and philosophical divides. This is an important 
</p>
<p>message in itself. The Special Rapporteur has come across impressive examples in this 
</p>
<p>regard, for example, initiatives taken by Christian civil society organizations in support of 
</p>
<p>atheists or Buddhists under threat and public statements made by Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; representatives 
</p>
<p>against the persecution of Shia Muslims. Such acts of solidarity have a highly symbolic 
</p>
<p>value.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Contributions by the media 
</b></p>
<p>75. While the media, including the Internet, are frequently used to stoke intergroup 
</p>
<p>hostilities by spreading false, biased or partisan information and hateful messages that 
</p>
<p>incite violence, they can also be harnessed to foster cross-boundary communication and 
</p>
<p>promote policies of tolerance, reconciliation and cooperation. In short, the media are a part 
</p>
<p>of the problem, but they must certainly be part of the solution.  
</p>
<p>76. Hostile media campaigns can have disastrous effects on people&#8217;s mindset and in the 
</p>
<p>long run can undermine people&#8217;s common sense, creating a climate of confusion and 
</p>
<p>collective hysteria. The most important antidote to hostile media campaigns targeting 
</p>
<p>religious minorities or other groups is the diligent research of facts.  
</p>
<p>77. Fact-finding may also include a public analysis of collective historical traumas. 
</p>
<p>Meaningful communication across boundaries requires the possibility that people can agree 
</p>
<p>&#8212; or at least partially agree &#8212; on important facts concerning intricate historic legacies. It 
</p>
<p>is no coincidence that reconciliation commissions usually also have the aspiration of &#8220;truth&#8221; 
</p>
<p>in their titles (typically being called &#8220;truth and reconciliation commissions&#8221;), because only 
</p>
<p>on the basis of agreeing on at least some elementary historic facts can communities tackle 
</p>
<p>traumatic historic legacies that otherwise would have the potential of tearing societies apart. 
</p>
<p>The &#8220;ghosts of the past&#8221; can only be put to rest by public debates based on a careful 
</p>
<p>research of facts. Here again, public discourse facilitated by a rich landscape of independent 
</p>
<p>and critical media has an important function.  
</p>
<p>78. The media play an indispensable role in bringing about a culture of public discourse. 
</p>
<p>Where such a culture remains underdeveloped or even non-existent, prejudiced messages 
</p>
<p>against groups that face systematic discrimination usually find fertile ground, because 
</p>
<p>hostile rumours remain unchecked by factual evidence, and fearful narratives can hardly be 
</p>
<p>exposed to public scrutiny or counter-narratives. Positively speaking, a developed culture of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 28 See www.ohchr.org/EN/issues/SRHRDefenders/. </p>


<p>open and frank public communication across boundaries is a prerequisite necessary for 
</p>
<p>preventing resentments from escalating to fully-fledged conspiracy projections.  
</p>
<p>79. The media are moreover needed for overcoming the culture of silence, wherever it 
</p>
<p>exists, in the face of violence in the name of religion. In conjunction with civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, representatives of the media should openly address incidents of violence, 
</p>
<p>their root causes and political circumstances. Since a culture of impunity and a culture of 
</p>
<p>silence often go hand in hand, putting an end to such silence may also be a first step 
</p>
<p>towards tackling the problem of impunity. Journalists and other media workers who operate 
</p>
<p>in dangerous environments require networks to defend them against violent threats.  
</p>
<p>80. Moreover, impressive media projects bear witness to the enormous positive potential 
</p>
<p>of the media in facilitating cross-boundary understandings. This may also include the 
</p>
<p>production of fiction aimed at overcoming societal divides. Particularly after experiences of 
</p>
<p>traumatic collective violence, positive media initiatives can help restore the faculty of 
</p>
<p>empathy by making people aware that the members of other religions or beliefs, far from 
</p>
<p>being &#8220;aliens&#8221;, in fact have quite similar fears, hopes and feelings. Generally, the potential 
</p>
<p>impact of media work across religious or other divides can hardly be overemphasized.  
</p>
<p>81. Freedom of religion or belief cannot flourish without freedom of expression, and the 
</p>
<p>human rights enshrined in close neighbourhood in articles 18 and 19 of the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</p>
<p>mutually reinforce each other. Like most other human rights, freedom of expression is not 
</p>
<p>without possible limits, and there can be situations in which the State has to impose 
</p>
<p>restrictions, for instance, in order to protect targeted minorities against advocacy of 
</p>
<p>religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. 
</p>
<p>However, bearing in mind the high value of free communication and the indispensable 
</p>
<p>functions of the media to facilitate public discussions, any limitations imposed on freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression must be enacted with a high degree of empirical and normative diligence. 
</p>
<p>Limitations must meet all the criteria enshrined in article 19, paragraph 3, of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant, which are further spelled out by the Human Right Committee in its 
</p>
<p>general comment no. 34.29 Moreover, the Rabat Plan of Action also sets a high threshold for 
</p>
<p>any restrictions on freedom of expression, including for the application of article 20, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 2, of the International Covenant.30  
</p>
<p>82. Indeed, the best antidote to hate speech is &#8220;more speech&#8221;, in the sense of nuanced 
</p>
<p>and precise media reporting, self-regulating bodies and a fair representation of religious and 
</p>
<p>other minorities within the media, careful fact-finding in order to dispel myths and check 
</p>
<p>negative gossiping, public statements by civil society organizations, sustainable 
</p>
<p>interreligious communication and clear anti-violence messages sent by religious 
</p>
<p>communities, as elaborated above.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>83. Violence in the name of religion does not &#8220;erupt&#8221; in analogy to natural 
</p>
<p><b>catastrophes and it should not be misconstrued as the inevitable result of sectarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>hostilities that supposedly originated centuries or millennia ago, thus seemingly lying 
</b></p>
<p><b>outside of the scope of the responsibility that different actors have today. It is

<p><b>important to overcome fatalistic attitudes that often stem from simplistic descriptions 
</b></p>
<p><b>of </b>the phenomena. Rather than being rooted in seemingly &#8220;perpetual&#8221; religious 
</p>
<p><b>antagonisms, violence in the name of religion is typically caused by contemporary 
</b></p>
<p><b>factors and actors, including political circumstances, which provide the fertile ground 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the seeds of hatred.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>While it would be wrong to focus on religion in isolation when analysing the 
</b></p>
<p>problem, it would be equally simplistic to reduce religious motives to mere &#8220;excuses&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>for violent crimes perpetrated in their name. What is needed is a holistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding of the various factors involved in violence committed in the name of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religion. Typical factors are the lack of trust in the rule of law and fair functioning of 
</b></p>
<p><b>public institutions; narrow-minded and polarizing interpretations of religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditions that may bring about societal fragmentation processes with far-reaching 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative repercussions on social relations; and policies of deliberate exclusion, often in 
</b></p>
<p><b>conjunction with narrowly defined national identity politics and other factors; denial 
</b></p>
<p><b>and impunity for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>law.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Only a full account of the various root causes of the problems can build an 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness of the joint responsibility, which a broad range of actors have in fighting 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence committed in the name of religion. Against this background, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur formulates the recommendations below addressed to the various 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to all relevant stakeholders  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Government representatives, religious communities, civil society organizations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the media and other relevant stakeholders should reject and speak out promptly, 
</b></p>
<p><b>clearly and loudly against any acts of violence committed in the name of religion as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as related incitement to violence and discrimination in law and practice, thus 
</b></p>
<p><b>overcoming the culture of silence that exists in some countries. They should act swiftly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and in concert to deter and stop such violence.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Public condemnations against violence committed in the name of religion 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be made on the basis of an adequately complex analysis of the problem, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including its underlying systemic root causes.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The different stakeholders should jointly contribute to the containment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>eventual elimination of violence committed in the name of religion by making creative 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of their space and specific potential. They should also cooperate in neutralizing 
</b></p>
<p><b>any possible radicalization efforts that target foreign fighters who returned to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>country of origin.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations to different State institutions  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>States have the responsibility to protect its populations, whether nationals or 
</b></p>
<p><b>not, from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>from their incitement. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>States have the obligation to act swiftly to stop acts of violence committed in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>name of religion, against individuals, groups and places of worship. Overcoming a 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture of impunity, wherever it exists, must be a priority. Those who commit or are 
</b></p>
<p><b>complicit in acts of violence must be brought to justice.  </b></p>


<p>91. <b>States should safeguard the memory of all population groups, and of religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities in particular, including by developing and protecting national archives, 
</b></p>
<p><b>memorial museums and monuments. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>States must respect freedom of religion or belief and all other human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>when undertaking actions to contain and combat against violence in the name of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religion.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Legislation that </b>renders the existence of certain religious communities &#8220;illegal&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>in the country should be revoked.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>States should repeal anti-blasphemy laws, anti-conversion laws and any other 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory criminal law provisions, including those based on religious laws.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>States should provide disaggregated data on acts of violence committed in its 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdiction, including on possible religious motivations.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>In order to operate as a credible guarantor of freedom of religion or belief for 
</b></p>
<p><b>everyone, the State should not identify itself exclusively with one particular religion or 
</b></p>
<p><b>belief at the expense of equal treatment of the followers of other faiths. Any exclusivist 
</b></p>
<p><b>settings should be replaced by an inclusive institutional framework in which religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>diversity can unfold without discrimination and without fear.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Anti-discrimination legislation should protect the equality of all in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of human rights, across religious or denominational divides, thus 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventing or overcoming divisiveness within society. States should in particular take 
</b></p>
<p><b>steps to assure that the rights of all will be protected so that all can feel safe in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>religions or beliefs. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>In close consultation with all relevant stakeholders, States should develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>national action plans on how to prevent violence committed in the name of religion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>but also other forms of religious persecution carried out by State agencies or non-
</b></p>
<p><b>State actors. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Textbooks used for school education should not contain negative stereotypes 
</b></p>
<p><b>and prejudices, which may stoke discrimination or hostile sentiments against any 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups, including the followers of certain religions or beliefs.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>States should use all available means, including education and community 
</b></p>
<p><b>outreach, in order to promote a culture of respect, non-discrimination and 
</b></p>
<p><b>appreciation of diversity within the larger society.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>National human rights institutions are encouraged to take an active ownership 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the development of strategies towards eliminating the root causes of violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed in the name of religion.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>States should refrain from stoking violent religious extremism in other 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Recommendations to religious communities  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>When religious communities and their leaders address any violence committed 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the name of their religion, they should take seriously the relevance, inter alia, of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious motives often stemming from narrow-minded, polarizing and patriarchal 
</b></p>
<p><b>interpretations of religious traditions. </b></p>


<p>104. <b>In situations in which speaking out against violence may be dangerous, fellow 
</b></p>
<p><b>believers living in safer political environments should lend their voices and clearly 
</b></p>
<p><b>condemn violence committed in the name of their religion.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Religious communities and their leaders should promote empathy, respect, 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-discrimination and an appreciation of diversity. They should challenge the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authenticity claims of religious extremists by exposing their views as being ignorant of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the charitable core messages contained in religious traditions. Additionally, they 
</b></p>
<p><b>should share with others their beliefs in the importance of respecting the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>others, thereby contributing to a sense that the rights of all will be respected. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Religious communities should feel encouraged to start initiatives of 
</b></p>
<p><b>interreligious communication and cooperation, including the establishment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>interreligious councils. A broad representation, including gender balance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of different generations, can ensure that larger populations can take 
</b></p>
<p><b>active ownership of such initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Recommendations to civil society organizations  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Civil society organizations should continue to collect information about the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of human rights and support people living under conditions of intimidation 
</b></p>
<p><b>by following up on their cases.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The findings of civil society organizations should be more systematically used in 
</b></p>
<p><b>their early warning function, notably in volatile situations.  
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Civil society should continue to play a role in overcoming a culture of silence in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the face of violence committed in the name of religion, thereby sending a signal of 
</b></p>
<p><b>solidarity to targeted individuals and groups.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Faith-based and secular civil society organizations should work together, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by creating common platforms, thereby demonstrating that a commitment 
</b></p>
<p><b>to human rights can create solidarity across all religious, cultural and philosophical 
</b></p>
<p><b>divides. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Human rights defenders operating in dangerous situations deserve particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention and support by networks designed to defend the defenders. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Recommendations to the media 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>In close collaboration with civil society organizations, representatives of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>media should defend their independence, professionalism and integrity and address 
</b></p>
<p><b>incidents of violence, their various root causes and the political circumstances in 
</b></p>
<p><b>which they take place.  
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The media should help to bring about a culture of public discourse that is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>prerequisite to checking hostile rumours and fearful narratives, which should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>exposed to public scrutiny or counter-narratives in order to prevent them from 
</b></p>
<p><b>escalating to fully-fledged conspiracy projections.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Careful fact-finding is the most important antidote to negative media 
</b></p>
<p><b>campaigns that target religious minorities or other groups. Such fact-finding may also 
</b></p>
<p><b>include a public analysis of collective historical traumas. </b></p>


<p>115. <b>The media can help restore the faculty of empathy by making people aware 
</b></p>
<p>that the members of groups facing systematic discrimination, far from being &#8220;aliens&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><b>have quite similar fears, hopes and feelings. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Recommendations to the international community 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>The international community is reminded of its duty to assist and build the 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity of States in fulfilling their commitments to the responsibility to protect their 
</b></p>
<p><b>populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as concluded in the 2005 World Summit.  
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>Human rights mechanisms, including the special procedures, treaty bodies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal periodic review, are encouraged to address the issue of violence in the name 
</b></p>
<p><b>of religion and State involvement in such violence.  
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>The international community should hold States and non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>to account and make them aware of their existing obligations under international law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including human rights, humanitarian, criminal and refugee law. 
</b></p>
