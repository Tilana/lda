<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the suffering of the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan due to the systematic and continuous violation of their fundamental and human rights 
</p>
<p>by Israel since the Israeli military occupation of 1967, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all relevant General Assembly resolutions, the most recent being 
</p>
<p>resolution 69/94 of 16 December 2014, in which the Assembly declared that Israel had 
</p>
<p>failed to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel 
</p>
<p>withdraw from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming once more</i> the illegality of the decision by Israel of 14 December 1981 
</p>
<p>to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has 
</p>
<p>resulted in the effective annexation of that territory, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by 
</p>
<p>force, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of 
</p>
<p>international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> <i>with deep concern</i> of the report of the Special Committee to Investigate 
</p>
<p>Israeli Practices Affecting the Human of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Territories, and in this connection deploring the Israeli settlements in the 
</p>
<p>occupied Arab territories and expressing regret at the constant refusal of Israel to cooperate 
</p>
<p>with and to receive the Special Committee, 
</p>

<p><i>Guided by</i> the relevant provisions of the Charter, international law and the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirming the applicability of the Geneva Convention 
</p>
<p>relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 and the 
</p>
<p>relevant provisions of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 to the occupied Syrian 
</p>
<p>Golan, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming the importance</i> of the peace process, which started in Madrid on the 
</p>
<p>basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November and 338 (1973) of 
</p>
<p>October 1973, and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its concern at the halting 
</p>
<p>of the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed on the 
</p>
<p>basis of the full implementation of resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and of the Human Rights Council, the most recent being Council resolution 25/31 of 
</p>
<p>28 March 2014, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant 
</p>
<p>resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>in particular Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council decided, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan was null and void and without international legal effect, and 
</p>
<p>demanded that Israel rescind forthwith its decision; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to desist from its continuous building of settlements, 
</p>
<p>the most recent of which is the settlement campaign being conducted by the so-called 
</p>
<p>Golan Regional Council under the slogan &#8220;Come to the Golan&#8221;, and to desist from 
</p>
<p>changing the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure and legal 
</p>
<p>status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and emphasizes that the displaced persons of the 
</p>
<p>population of the occupied Syrian Golan must be allowed to return to their homes and to 
</p>
<p>recover their property; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and 
</p>
<p>Israeli identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and to desist from 
</p>
<p>its repressive measures against them and from all other practices that obstruct the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of their fundamental rights and their civil, political, economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, some of which are mentioned in the report of the Special Committee to 
</p>
<p>Investigate Israeli Practices affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other 
</p>
<p>Arabs of the Occupied Territories; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to allow the Syrian population of occupied Syrian Golan to 
</p>
<p>visit their families and relatives in the Syrian motherland through the Quneitra checkpoint 
</p>
<p>and under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and to rescind 
</p>
<p>its decision to prohibit these visits, as it is in flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva 
</p>
<p>Convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to release immediately the Syrian detainees in Israeli 
</p>
<p>prisons, some of whom have been detained for more than 28 years, and to treat them in 
</p>
<p>conformity with international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Further calls upon </i>Israel, in this connection, to allow delegates of the 
</p>
<p>International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Syrian prisoners of conscience and 
</p>
<p>detainees in Israeli prisons accompanied by specialized physicians to assess the state of 
</p>
<p>their physical and mental health and to protect their lives; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Determines</i> that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken 
</p>
<p>or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, including the Knesset&#8217;s decision of 22 
</p>
<p>November 2010 to hold a referendum before any withdrawal from the occupied Syrian </p>


<p>Golan and East Jerusalem, that seek to alter the character and legal status of the occupied 
</p>
<p>Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international law and of 
</p>
<p>the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 
</p>
<p>August 1949, and have no legal effect; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Again calls upon</i> States Members of the United Nations not to recognize any 
</p>
<p>of the above-mentioned legislative or administrative measures; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention 
</p>
<p>of all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, 
</p>
<p>international and regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>organizations to disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on this matter to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council at its thirty-first session; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Decides to continue</i> the consideration of the human rights violations in the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan at its thirty-first session.
